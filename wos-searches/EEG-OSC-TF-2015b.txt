We present a framework for the model-free estimation of information storage and information transfer computed as the terms composing the predictive information about the target of a multivariate dynamical process. The approach tackles the curse of dimensionality employing a nonuniform embedding scheme that selects progressively, among the past components of the multivariate process, only those that contribute most, in terms of conditional mutual information, to the present target process. Moreover, it computes all information-theoretic quantities using a nearest-neighbor technique designed to compensate the bias due to the different dimensionality of individual entropy terms. The resulting estimators of prediction entropy, storage entropy, transfer entropy, and partial transfer entropy are tested on simulations of coupled linear stochastic and nonlinear deterministic dynamic processes, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over the traditional estimators based on uniform embedding. The framework is then applied to multivariate physiologic time series, resulting in physiologically well-interpretable information decompositions of cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory interactions during head-up tilt and of joint brain-heart dynamics during sleep.

Tracking lexical consolidation with ERPs: Lexical and semantic-priming effects on N400 and LPC responses to newly-learned words	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Memory consolidation; Word learning; N400; LPC; EEG; Semantic priming	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; BRAIN; RECOLLECTION; OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; ACQUISITION	Novel words can be recalled immediately and after little exposure, but require a post-learning consolidation period to show word-like behaviour such as lexical competition. This pattern is thought to reflect a qualitative shift from episodic to lexical representations. However, several studies have reported immediate effects of meaningful novel words on semantic processing, suggesting that integration of novel word meanings may not require consolidation. The current study synthesises and extends these findings by showing a dissociation between lexical and semantic effects on the electrophysiological (N400, LPC) response to novel words. The difference in N400 amplitude between novel and existing words (a lexical effect) decreased significantly after a 24-h consolidation period, providing novel support for the hypothesis that offline consolidation aids lexicalisation. In contrast, novel words preceded by semantically related primes elicited a more positive LPC response (a semantic-priming effect) both before and after consolidation, indicating that certain semantic effects can be observed even when words have not been fully lexicalised. We propose that novel meanings immediately start to contribute to semantic processing, but that the underlying neural processes may shift from strategic to more automatic with consolidation.

Our aim here was to identify the timing of brain processes that lead to variations in objective performance and subjective judgments of confidence. We capitalized on the Partial Report Paradigm [Sperling, G. The information available in brief visual presentations. Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 74, 1, 1960], which allowed us to separate experimentally the moment of encoding of information from that of its retrieval [Zylberberg, A., Dehaene, S., Mindlin, G. B., & Sigman, M. Neurophysiological bases of exponential sensory decay and top-down memory retrieval: A model. Frontiers in Computa-tional Neuroscience, 3, 2009]. We observed that the level of subjective confidence is indexed by two very specific evoked potentials at latencies of about 400 and 600 msec during the retrieval stage and by a stationary measure of intensity of the alpha band during the encoding period. When factoring out the effect of confidence, objective performance shows a weak effect during the encoding and retrieval periods. These results have relevant implications for theories of decisionmaking and confidence, suggesting that confidence is not constructed online as evidence is accumulated toward a decision. Instead, confidence attributions are more consistent with a retrospective mechanism that monitors the entire decision process.

Arousal transitions in sleep, wakefulness, and anesthesia are characterized by an orderly sequence of cortical events	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting-state global signal; Consciousness; Feedback process; Alpha inhibitory gating; Sleep; Propofol anesthesia	BASAL FOREBRAIN NEURONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; TOP-DOWN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG-VIGILANCE; ALPHA; FMRI; DYNAMICS; PROPOFOL; FLUCTUATIONS	Many aspects of brain function are influenced by modulatory processes, including arousal. The most abrupt changes in arousal occur at the wake-sleep transition and at the induction of anesthetic conditions. They are accompanied by major electrophysiological changes, including an emergence of low-frequency (sleep-like) activity and a loss of mid-frequency (wake-like) activity that has been linked to feedback processes of the brain. Nevertheless, the causal relationship between these two types of electrophysiological changes, as well as the cortical mechanisms underlying changes in arousal and consciousness, remain poorly understood. To address this, we studied spontaneous electro-cortical activity during arousal changes in macaques. During sleep and at loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia, we identified a prototypical sequence of cortical events in which the loss of mid-frequency activity preceded, by seconds, the increases in low-frequency activity. Furthermore, in visual areas, an influence of mid-frequency change onto high-frequency activity was observed across visual hierarchy. These results are consistent with the notion that drops in arousal and consciousness are facilitated by a release of feedback cortical inhibition. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A key component is the cingulo-opercular (CO) network composed of anterior insula/operculum, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. Its function has been particularly difficult to characterize due to the network's pervasive activity and frequent co-activation with other control-related networks. We previously suggested this network to underlie intrinsically maintained tonic alertness. Here, we tested this hypothesis by separately manipulating the demand for selective attention and for tonic alertness in a two-factorial, continuous pitch discrimination paradigm. The 2 factors had independent behavioral effects. Functional imaging revealed that activity as well as functional connectivity in the CO network increased when the task required more tonic alertness. Conversely, heightened selective attention to pitch increased activity in the dorsal attention (DAT) network but not in the CO network. Across participants, performance accuracy showed dissociable correlation patterns with activity in the CO, DAT, and fronto-parietal (FP) control networks. These results support tonic alertness as a fundamental function of the CO network. They further the characterization of this function as the effortful process of maintaining cognitive faculties available for current processing requirements.

Successful memory formation is driven by contextual encoding in the core memory network	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						iEEG; Free-recall; Episodic memory; Encoding	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; INFERIOR PREFRONTAL CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PATTERN SIMILARITY; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA ACTIVITY; RETRIEVAL; REPRESENTATION	To understand how memories are successfully formed, scientists have compared neural activity during the encoding of subsequently remembered and forgotten items. Though this approach has elucidated a network of brain regions involved in memory encoding, this method cannot distinguish broad, non-specific signals from memory specific encoding processes, such as associative encoding. Associative encoding, which is a key mechanism of learning, can be seen in the tendency of participants to successively recall, or cluster, study neighbors. We assessed the electrophysiological correlates of associative processing by comparing intracranially recorded EEG activity during the encoding of items that were subsequently recalled and clustered; recalled and not clustered; or not recalled. We found that high frequency activity (HFA) in left prefrontal cortex, left temporal cortex and hippocampus increased during the encoding of subsequently recalled items. Critically, the magnitude of this effect was largest for those recalled items that were also subsequently clustered. HFA temporally dissociated across regions, with increases in left prefrontal cortex preceding those in hippocampus. Furthermore, late hippocampal HFA positively correlated with behavioral measures of clustering. These results suggest that associative processes linking items to their spatiotemporal context underlie the traditionally observed subsequent memory effect and support successful memory formation.

The influence of nitrogen and oxygen additions on the thermal characteristics of aluminium-based thin films	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						Sputtering; Thin films; Nitrides; Oxides; Microstructure; Thermal properties	ANNEALING ANALYSIS; DISCHARGE VOLTAGE; PART I; COATINGS; STABILITY; EVOLUTION	The ternary aluminium oxynitride (AIN(x)O(y)) system offers the possibility to obtain a wide range of properties by tailoring the ratio between pure Al, AIN(x) and AlOy and therefore opening a significant number of possible applications. In this work the thermal behaviour of AIN(x)O(y) thin films was analysed by modulated infrared radiometry (MIRR), taking as reference the binary AlOy and AlNx. systems. MIRR is a non-contact and non-destructive thermal wave measurement technique based on the excitation, propagation and detection of temperature oscillations of very small amplitudes. The intended change of the partial pressure of the reactive gas (N-2 and/or O-2) influenced the target condition and hence the deposition characteristics which, altogether, affected the composition and microstructure of the films. Based on the MIRR measurements and their qualitative and quantitative interpretation, some correlations between the thermal transport properties of the films and their chemical/physical properties have been found. Furthermore, the potential of such technique applied in this oxynitride system, which present a wide range of different physical responses, is also discussed. The experimental results obtained are consistent with those reported in previous works and show a high potential to fulfil the demands needed for the possible applications of the systems studied. They are clearly indicative of an adequate thermal response if this particular thin film system is aimed to be applied in small sensor devices or in electrodes for biosignal acquisition, such as those for electroencephalography or electromyography as it is the ease of the main research area that is being developed in the group.

By contrast, neuroimaging and lesion studies suggest that at least partially distinct cortical networks are involved in motor imagery and execution. We sought to further disentangle this relationship by studying the role of brain-robot interfaces in the context of motor imagery and motor execution networks. Twenty right-handed subjects performed several behavioral tasks as indicators for imagery and execution of movements of the left hand, i.e. kinesthetic imagery, visual imagery, visuomotor integration and tonic contraction. In addition, subjects performed motor imagery supported by haptic/proprioceptive feedback from a brain-robot-interface. Principal component analysis was applied to assess the relationship of these indicators. The respective cortical resting state networks in the a-range were investigated by electroencephalography using the phase slope index. We detected two distinct abilities and cortical networks underlying motor control: a motor imagery network connecting the left parietal and motor areas with the right prefrontal cortex and a motor execution network characterized by transmission from the left to right motor areas. We found that a brain-robot-interface might offer a way to bridge the gap between these networks, opening thereby a backdoor to the motor execution system. This knowledge might promote patient screening and may lead to novel treatment strategies, e.g. for the rehabilitation of hemiparesis after stroke. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

On Evolution and the Quantum and Classical Regimes in Brain Function	JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES			English	Article						evolution; attention; Quantum Zeno Effect; neural assemblies; Quantum Hebbian Learning	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; GAP-JUNCTIONS; ELECTRICAL SYNAPSES; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; ATTENTION; IMPLICIT; ORIGIN; CONSCIOUSNESS	As species evolved, consciousness (awareness) manifested at different levels: physical, mental and subtle. But why different species exhibit different grades of consciousness continues to intrigue researchers. A plausible reason could be that adaptation to environmental changes, and hence survival and evolution, all depend on the level of consciousness species possess. This could be the reason why evolutionarily older species (with lower order consciousness) only implicitly (slowly and unconsciously) adapt, whereas evolved species (with higher order consciousness) explicitly (quickly and consciously) adapt to unforeseen situations gaining tremendous survival advantage. This ability requires exploring innumerable possibilities including representations that may not have been experienced before and requires faster, brain-wide computations. We argue that the transition from slow adaptation to fast learning can be explained by considering two different regimes of computation in the brain: a Classical Regime based on slow neuronal signalling, and a much faster Quantum Regime marked by subtler quantum computations at the sub-neuronal level. We conjecture that as brains of species increased in size, a threshold was reached, beyond which species could volitionally control attention and exploit the Quantum Regime which not only enabled them to quickly perform non-local computations, develop dynamic brain-wide neural associations, and adapt very fast, but also be mentally aware, observe themselves, and hence speed-up their own evolution.

Evidence against attentional state modulating scalp-recorded auditory brainstem steady-state responses	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Frequency-following response FFR; Envelope-following response; Attention; Auditory processing	FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EFFECT SIZE; SPEECH; ENVELOPE; SOUNDS	Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and their steady-state counterpart (subcortical steady-state responses, SSSRs) are generally thought to be insensitive to cognitive demands. However, a handful of studies report that SSSRs are modulated depending on the subject's focus of attention, either towards or away from an auditory stimulus. Here, we explored whether attentional focus affects the envelope-following response (EFR), which is a particular kind of SSSR, and if so, whether the effects are specific to which sound elements in a sound mixture a subject is attending (selective auditory attentional modulation), specific to attended sensory input (inter-modal attentional modulation), or insensitive to attentional focus. We compared the strength of EFR-stimulus phase locking in human listeners under various tasks: listening to a monaural stimulus, selectively attending to a particular ear during dichotic stimulus presentation, and attending to visual stimuli while ignoring dichotic auditory inputs. We observed no systematic changes in the EFR across experimental manipulations, even though cortical EEG revealed attention-related modulations of alpha activity during the task. We conclude that attentional effects, if any, on human subcortical representation of sounds cannot be observed robustly using EFRs.

Previous electrophysiological studies have confirmed impaired reward processing in patients with BPD. However, it is not clear which aspects of reward processing are affected and which brain regions are involved. The present study investigated both evoked and induced event-related oscillations (EROs) to feedback events (thought to represent different aspects of feedback processing), and used source localization (sLORETA) to assess activity in two areas known to contribute to reward processing, the dorsomedial prefrontal/anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC/ACC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Methods. Eighteen patients with BPD and 22 healthy controls performed a gambling task, while 64-channel electroencephalographic activity was recorded. Evoked and induced theta and high-beta band EROs as well as activity in the two regions of interest were investigated depending on the valence and magnitude of feedback events. Results. Theta-band responses to negative feedback were reduced in BPD, an effect that involved only evoked responses and the dmPFC/ ACC region, and was associated with trait impulsivity in patients. sLORETA analyses revealed disturbed evoked responses depending on feedback magnitude in the theta (OFC) and high-beta (dmPFC/ACC and OFC) frequency range. Conclusions. The results indicate multiple dysfunctions of feedback processing in patients with BPD, implicating several distinct subsets of reward-processing mechanisms.

Dynamic recruitment of resting state sub-networks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; PHASE-LOCKING; EEG DATA; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATIONS; ALPHA; GAMMA; BETA	Resting state networks (RSNs) are of fundamental importance in human systems neuroscience with evidence suggesting that they are integral to healthy brain function and perturbed in pathology. Despite rapid progress in this area, the temporal dynamics governing the functional connectivities that underlie RSN structure remain poorly understood. Here, we present a framework to help further our understanding of RSN dynamics. We describe a methodology which exploits the direct nature and high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG). This technique, which builds on previous work, extends from solving fundamental confounds in MEG (source leakage) to multivariate modelling of transient connectivity. The resulting processing pipeline facilitates direct (electrophysiological) measurement of dynamic functional networks. Our results show that, when functional connectivity is assessed in small time windows, the canonical sensorimotor network can be decomposed into a number of transiently synchronising sub-networks, recruitment of which depends on current mental state. These rapidly changing sub-networks are spatially focal with, for example, bilateral primary sensory and motor areas resolved into two separate sub-networks. The likely interpretation is that the larger canonical sensorimotor network most often seen in neuroimaging studies reflects only a temporal aggregate of these transient sub-networks. Our approach opens new frontiers to study RSN dynamics, showing that MEG is capable of revealing the spatial, temporal and spectral signature of the human connectome in health and disease.

The Contribution of Encoding and Retrieval Processes to Proactive Interference	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						episodic memory; proactive interference encoding; retrieval; working memory	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; EPISODIC RECALL; DYNAMICS; ATTENTION; SEARCH; LOAD; OSCILLATIONS; MAINTENANCE	Proactive interference (Pi) refers to the finding that memory for recently studied (target) material can be impaired by the prior study of other (nontarget) material. Previous accounts of PI differed in whether they attributed PI to impaired retrieval or impaired encoding. Here, we suggest an integrated encoding-retrieval account, which assigns a role for each of the 2 types of processes in buildup of PI. Employing a typical PI task, we examined (a) the role of encoding processes in PI by- recording scalp EEG during study of nontarget and target lists, and (b) the role of retrieval processes in PI by measuring recall totals and response latencies in target list recall. In addition, we measured subjects' working memory capacity (WNW). Behaviorally, the PI effect arose in both recall totals and response latencies, indicating PI at the sampling and the recovery stage of recall. Neurally, we found an increase in electrophysiological activities in the theta frequency band (5-8 Hz) from nontarget to target list encoding, indicating an increase in memory load during tai-get list encoding. The results demonstrate that impaired retrieval and impaired encoding can contribute to PI. 'They also show that WMC affects PI. For both encoding and retrieNW processes. PI was reduced in high-WMC subjects, suggesting that those subjects are able to separate target from nontarget information and create stronger focus on the target material.

Within the last years, however, improvements in signal analytical techniques, applied to both animal and human fMRI, EEG, MEG, and ECoG data, greatly increased our understanding and challenged several, dogmatic concepts of SWD. This review will summarize these recent data, demonstrating that SWD are not primary generalized, are not sudden and unpredictable events. It will disentangle different functional contributions of structures within the cortico-thalamo-cortical system, relevant for the generation, generalization, maintenance, and termination of SWD and will present a new "network based" scenario for these oscillations. Similarities and differences between rodent and human data are presented demonstrating that in both species a local cortical onset zone of SWD exists, although with different locations; that in both some forms of cortical and thalamic precursor activity can be found, and that SWD occur through repetitive cyclic activity between cortex and thalamus. The focal onset zone in human data could differ between patients with varying spatial and temporal dynamics; in rats the latter is still poorly investigated.

Objective: To determine the brain region responsible for originating K-complexes. Methods: We reviewed all 269 patients assessed for epilepsy surgery with intracranial electrodes and single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) at King's College Hospital between 1999 and 2013. Intracranial EEG responses to electrical stimulation at orbitofrontal, frontal, cingulate, temporal and parietal loci were compared visually with each patient's K-complexes and the degree of resemblance was quantified. Results: Among the 269 patients, K-complex-like responses were exclusively observed in all 6 patients who had depth electrodes in the cingulate cortex. In each patient, the stimulation site eliciting the response of greatest similarity to the patient's K-complex was located within the dorso-caudal anterior cingulate. The K-complex like responses were evoked when the patients were awake. Conclusion: Our findings provide the first causal evidence that the cingulate gyrus initiates the widespread synchronous activity that constitutes the K-complex. The induction of K-complex-like responses during wakefulness suggests that the mechanisms required for the initiation of K-complexes are separate from those involved in sleep. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Cortical drive of low-frequency oscillations in the human nucleus accumbens during action selection	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						nucleus accumbens; action selection; local field potentials; synchronization; deep brain stimulation	DECISION-MAKING; INFORMATION-FLOW; STIMULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; CONNECTIVITY; DOPAMINE; EPILEPSY; AMYGDALA; RELEASE	The nucleus accumbens is thought to contribute to action selection by integrating behaviorally relevant information from multiple regions, including prefrontal cortex. Studies in rodents suggest that information flow to the nucleus accumbens may be regulated via task-dependent oscillatory coupling between regions. During instrumental behavior, local field potentials (LFP) in the rat nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex are coupled at delta frequencies (Gruber AJ, Hussain RJ, O'Donnell P. PLoS One 4: e5062, 2009), possibly mediating suppression of afferent input from other areas and thereby supporting cortical control (Calhoon GG, O'Donnell P. Neuron 78: 181-190, 2013). In this report, we demonstrate low-frequency cortico-accumbens coupling in humans, both at rest and during a decision-making task. We recorded LFP from the nucleus accumbens in six epilepsy patients who underwent implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes. All patients showed significant coherence and phase-synchronization between LFP and surface EEG at delta and low theta frequencies. Although the direction of this coupling as indexed by Granger causality varied between subjects in the resting-state data, all patients showed a cortical drive of the nucleus accumbens during action selection in a decision-making task. In three patients this was accompanied by a significant coherence increase over baseline. Our results suggest that low-frequency cortico-accumbens coupling represents a highly conserved regulatory mechanism for action selection.

Ethosuximide (ETX) is one of the principal medications against absence seizures. We investigate the effect of ETX on the Kir2.1 channel, a prototypical inward rectifier K+ channel possibly playing an important role in the setting of neuronal membrane potential. We demonstrate that the outward currents of Kir2.1 channels are significantly inhibited by intracellular ETX. We further show that the movement of neutral molecule ETX in the Kir2.1 channel is accompanied by similar to 1.2 K+, giving rise to the vivid voltage dependence of ETX unbinding rate. Moreover, the apparent affinity (K (d) ) of ETX in the channels are decreased by single-point mutations involving M183, E224, and S165, and especially by double mutations involving T141/S165, which always also disrupt the flux-coupling feature of ETX block. Molecular dynamics simulation demonstrates narrowing of the pore at similar to D172 by binding of ETX to S165 or T141. ETX block of the Kir2.1 channels may cause a modest but critical depolarization of the relevant neurons, decreasing available T-type Ca2+ channels and consequently lessening pathological thalamocortical burst discharges.

Driving steady-state visual evoked potentials at arbitrary frequencies using temporal interpolation of stimulus presentation	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; SSVEP; Stimulus presentation; Frequency-tagging; BCI; Vision; Oscillation	FEATURE-SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; TIME-COURSE; COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS; CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION; CUED SHIFTS; OLD-AGE; FACILITATION; FEATURES; RESPONSES	Background: Steady-state visual evoked potentials have been utilized widely in basic and applied research in recent years. These oscillatory responses of the visual cortex are elicited by flickering stimuli. They have the same fundamental frequency as the driving stimulus and are highly sensitive to manipulations of attention and stimulus properties. While standard computer monitors offer great flexibility in the choice of visual stimuli for driving SSVEPs, the frequencies that can be elicited are limited to integer divisors of the monitor's refresh rate. Results: To avoid this technical constraint, we devised an interpolation technique for stimulus presentation, with which SSVEPs can be elicited at arbitrary frequencies. We tested this technique with monitor refresh rates of 85 and 120 Hz. At a refresh rate of 85 Hz, interpolated presentation produced artifacts in the recorded spectrum in the form of additional peaks not located at the stimulated frequency or its harmonics. However, at a refresh rate of 120 Hz, these artifacts did not occur and the spectrum elicited by an interpolated flicker became indistinguishable from the spectrum obtained by non-interpolated presentation of the same frequency. Conclusions: Our interpolation technique eliminates frequency limitations of the common non-interpolated presentation technique and has many possible applications for future research.

In this study, we evaluated dynamic changes of PSS power toward seizure onset in patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II. Methods: We collected data from 10 pediatric patients with FCD type II, who underwent invasive monitoring with subdural grids. The PSS were averaged based on spike-triggering in 30 s epochs during both interictal and preictal periods. We quantitatively measured and compared PSS power and distribution between interictal and preictal periods, both within and outside the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Results: PSS power was significantly higher in all areas during preictal period compared with interictal period. During preictal period, PSS power within SOZ was significantly higher than outside SOZ. From interictal to preictal period, the number of electrodes with high power PSS significantly increased within SOZ and decreased outside SOZ. Conclusions: Toward seizure onset, PSS power increased in all areas, predominantly within SOZ, and became confined into SOZ in a subset of FCD type II patients. Significance: Preictal PSS power increase and confinement into SOZ accompany transition to seizures. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of opposing lateral visuospatial asymmetries in the upper and lower visual fields	CORTEX			English	Article						Pseudoneglect; Neglect; Attention; Alpha; MVEP	TIME-ON-TASK; VIEWING PERCEPTUAL ASYMMETRIES; LINE-BISECTION JUDGMENTS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EXTRAPERSONAL SPACE; UNILATERAL NEGLECT; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; RIGHTWARD SHIFT	Neurologically healthy individuals typically exhibit a subtle bias towards the left visual field during spatial judgments, known as "pseudoneglect". However, it has yet to be reliably established if the direction and magnitude of this lateral bias varies along the vertical plane. Here, participants were required to distribute their attention equally across a checkerboard array spanning the entire visual field in order to detect transient targets that appeared at unpredictable locations. Reaction times (RTs) were faster to left hemifield targets in the lower visual field but the opposite trend was observed for targets in the upper field. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analyses focused on the interval prior to target onset in order to identify endogenous neural correlates of these behavioral asymmetries. The relative hemispheric distribution of pre-target oscillatory alpha power was predictive of RT bias to targets in the lower visual field but not the upper field, indicating separate attentional mechanisms for the upper and lower visual fields. Analysis of multifocal visuale-voked potentials (MVEP) in the pre-target interval also indicated that the opposing upper and lower field asymmetries may impact on the magnitude of primary visual cortical responses. These results provide new evidence of a functional segregation of upper and lower field visuospatial processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of seven-day diazepam administration on resting-state functional connectivity in healthy volunteers: a randomized, double-blind study	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Anxiety disorders; Anxiolysis; Benzodiazepines; Diazepam; Functional connectivity; GABA; GABAA receptors; Independent component analysis; Pharmacological imaging; Resting-state fMRI	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BOLD SIGNAL FLUCTUATIONS; LEVEL-DEPENDENT SIGNAL; HUMAN BRAIN; NETWORKS; EEG; CORTEX; FMRI; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION	Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are anxiolytic-sedative drugs, used for the treatment of several different disorders. The pharmacological mechanism of action of benzodiazepines is well understood; however, it remains unclear which neural networks and systems are involved in translating these neurochemical actions into their therapeutic effects. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of 7-day diazepam administration compared to placebo on resting-state functional connectivity in healthy adults independent of any task. Thirty-four healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive either diazepam (N = 17) or placebo (15 mg daily for 7 days) and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance acquisition. Model-free data analysis was performed using independent component analysis and dual regression. Consistent with previous research, 11 resting-state networks were identified. Increased connectivity in response to diazepam administration was found in the medial visual network and middle/inferior temporal network. Diazepam did not cause any decreases in functional connectivity. Diazepam administration increases functional connectivity in areas of emotional processing independent of any task. Diazepam also enhanced functional connectivity in the medial visual system, which is a brain region rich in GABA(A) receptors, and shows high binding of GABAergic drugs. These increases in functional connectivity are characteristic of CNS depressants.	[Pflanz, C.

In this study, the model of LFP in the visual cortex proposed by Mazzoni et al. (2008) was adapted to organize a network of two cortical areas, in which pyramidal neurons were divided into two sub-population modeling columns with spatially organized connections to neurons in other areas. Using the model enabled the relationship between neural firing and LFP to be evaluated, in addition to the LFP coherence between the two areas. Results showed that: (1) neurons in a particular sub-population generated the LFP in the area; (2) the spatial consistency of neural firing in the two areas was strongly correlated with LFP coherence; and (3) this consistency was capable of regulating LFP coherence in a lower frequency band, which was originally introduced to neurons in a particular sub-population. These results were derived from a winner-take-all operation in the columnar structure; thus, they are expected to be common in the cortex. It is suggested that the spatial consistency of neural firing is essential for regulating long-range LFP synchronization, which would facilitate neuronal integration processes over multiple cortical areas.

Visual analysis of long-term multi-channel intracranial recordings is extremely laborious and prone to bias. Development of new and reliable techniques of automatic spike detection represents a crucial step towards increasing the information yield of intracranial recordings and to improve surgical outcome. In this study, we designed a novel and robust detection algorithm that adaptively models statistical distributions of signal envelopes and enables discrimination of signals containing IEDs from signals with background activity. This detector demonstrates performance superior both to human readers and to an established detector. It is even capable of identifying low-amplitude IEDs which are often missed by experts and which may represent an important source of clinical information. Application of the detector to non-epileptic intracranial data from patients with intractable facial pain revealed the existence of sharp transients with waveforms reminiscent of interictal discharges that can represent biological sources of false positive detections. Identification of these transients enabled us to develop and propose secondary processing steps, which may exclude these transients, improving the detector's specificity and having important implications for future development of spike detectors in general.

This "mentalizing" capacity is apparent in everyday human interactions and conversations. We investigated its neural basis using magnetoencephalography. We focused on whether mentalizing was engaged spontaneously and routinely to understand an utterance's meaning or largely on-demand, to restore "common ground" when expectations were violated. Participants conversed with 1 of 2 confederate speakers and established tacit agreements about objects' names. In a subsequent "test" phase, some of these agreements were violated by either the same or a different speaker. Our analysis of the neural processing of test phase utterances revealed recruitment of neural circuits associated with language (temporal cortex), episodic memory (e.g., medial temporal lobe), and mentalizing (temporo-parietal junction and ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Theta oscillations (3-7 Hz) were modulated most prominently, and we observed phase coupling between functionally distinct neural circuits. The episodic memory and language circuits were recruited in anticipation of upcoming referring expressions, suggesting that context-sensitive predictions were spontaneously generated. In contrast, the mentalizing areas were recruited on-demand, as a means for detecting and resolving perceived pragmatic anomalies, with little evidence they were activated to make partner-specific predictions about upcoming linguistic utterances.

Energy-Efficient Long-term Continuous Personal Health Monitoring	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTI-SCALE COMPUTING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Body area networks; compressive sensing; continuous health monitoring; implantable and wearable medical devices; secure wireless sensor network	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SENSOR	Continuous health monitoring using wireless body area networks of implantable and wearable medical devices (IWMDs) is envisioned as a transformative approach to healthcare. Rapid advances in biomedical sensors, low-power electronics, and wireless communications have brought this vision to the verge of reality. However, key challenges still remain to be addressed. The constrained sizes of IWMDs imply that they are designed with very limited processing, storage, and battery capacities. Therefore, there is a very strong need for efficiency in data collection, analysis, storage, and communication. In this paper, we first quantify the energy and storage requirements of a continuous personal health monitoring system that uses eight biomedical sensors: (1) heart rate, (2) blood pressure, (3) oxygen saturation, (4) body temperature, (5) blood glucose, (6) accelerometer, (7) electrocardiogram (ECG), and (8) electroencephalogram (EEG). Our analysis suggests that there exists a significant gap between the energy and storage requirements for long-term continuous monitoring and the capabilities of current devices. To enable energy-efficient continuous health monitoring, we propose schemes for sample aggregation, anomaly-driven transmission, and compressive sensing to reduce the overheads of wirelessly transmitting, storing, and encrypting/authenticating the data. We evaluate these techniques and demonstrate that they result in two to three orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy and storage requirements, and can help realize the potential of long-term continuous health monitoring.

J	Jiang, J; Zhang, QL; van Gaal, S				Jiang, Jun; Zhang, Qinglin; van Gaal, Simon			Conflict awareness dissociates theta-band neural dynamics of the medial frontal and lateral frontal cortex during trial-by-trial cognitive control	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; RESPONSE CONFLICT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; ADAPTATION; CONSCIOUSNESS; ADJUSTMENTS; MECHANISMS; OSCILLATIONS; FACILITATION	Recent findings have refuted the common assumption that executive control functions of the prefrontal cortex exclusively operate consciously, suggesting that many, if not all, cognitive processes could potentially operate unconsciously. However, although many cognitive functions can be launched unconsciously, several theoretical models of consciousness assume that there are crucial qualitative differences between conscious and unconscious processes. We hypothesized that the potential benefit of awareness in cognitive control mechanisms might become apparent when high control has to be maintained across time and requires the interaction between a set of distant frontal brain regions. To test this, we extracted oscillatory power dynamics from electro-encephalographic data recorded while participants performed a task in which conflict awareness was manipulated by masking the conflict-inducing stimulus. We observed that instantaneous conflict as well as across trial conflict adaptation mechanisms were associated with medial frontal theta-band power modulations, irrespective of conflict awareness. However, and crucially, across-trial conflict adaptation processes reflected in increased theta-band power over dorsolateral frontal cortex were observed after fully conscious conflict only. This suggests that initial conflict detection and subsequent control adaptation by the medial frontal cortex are automatic and unconscious, whereas the routing of information from the medial frontal cortex to the lateral prefrontal cortex is a unique feature of conscious cognitive control.

Seizure localization using ictal phase-locked high gamma A retrospective surgical outcome study	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY SURGERY; ONSET; PROPAGATION; GENERATION; RESECTION	Objective: To determine whether resection of areas with evidence of intense, synchronized neural firing during seizures is an accurate indicator of postoperative outcome. Methods: Channels meeting phase-locked high gamma (PLHG) criteria were identified retrospectively from intracranial EEG recordings (102 seizures, 46 implantations, 45 patients). Extent of removal of both the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and PLHG was correlated with seizure outcome, classified as good (Engel class I or II, n = 32) or poor (Engel class III or IV, n = 13). Results: Patients with good outcomes had significantly greater proportions of both SOZ and the first 4 (early) PLHG sites resected. Improved outcome classification was noted with early PLHG, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (PLHG 0.79, SOZ 0.68) and by odds ratios for resections including at least 75% of sites identified by each measure (PLHG 9.7 [95% CI: 2.3-41.5], SOZ 5.3 [95% CI: 1.2-23.3]). Among patients with resection of at least 75% of the SOZ, 78% (n = 30) had good outcomes, increasing to 91% when the resection also included at least 75% of early PLHG sites (n = 22). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the localizing value of early PLHG, which is comparable to that provided by the SOZ. Incorporation of PLHG into the clinical evaluation may improve surgical efficacy and help to focus resections on the most critical areas.

Recent studies have suggested that BOLD fluctuations pertain to a spatiotemporal organization with different frequencies. The present study aimed to investigate the frequency-dependent SD-related brain oscillatory activity by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analysis. The ALFF changes were measured across different frequencies (Slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz; Slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; and Typical band: 0.01-0.08 Hz) in 24 h SD as compared to rested wakeful during resting-state fMRI. Sixteen volunteers underwent two fMRI sessions, once during rested wakefulness and once after 24 h of SD. SD showed prominently decreased ALFF in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), while increased ALFF in the visual cortex, left sensorimotor cortex and fusiform gyrus. Across the Slow-4 and Slow-5, results differed significantly in the OFC, DLPFC, thalamus and caudate in comparison to typical frequency band; and Slow-4 showed greater differences. In addition, negative correlations of behavior performance and ALFF patterns were found mainly in the right IPL across the typical frequency band. These observations provided novel insights about the physiological responses of SD, identified how it disturbs the brain rhythms, and linked SD with frequency-dependent alterations in amplitude patterns.

Mouse model of OPRM1 (A118G) polymorphism has altered hippocampal function	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Mu-opioid receptor; Single nucleotide polymorphism; OPRM1; A112G; A118G; N40D; Mice; Sex; Genotype; Hippocampus	MU-OPIOID-RECEPTOR; SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; GENE OPRM1; MORPHINE CONSUMPTION; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; CA1 REGIONS; ALCOHOL; EXPRESSION; BINDING	A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1 A118G) has been widely studied for its association in a variety of drug addiction and pain sensitivity phenotypes; however, the extent of these adaptations and the mechanisms underlying these associations remain elusive. To clarify the functional mechanisms linking the OPRM1 A118G SNP to altered phenotypes, we used a mouse model possessing the equivalent nucleotide/amino acid substitution in the Oprm1 gene. In order to investigate the impact of this SNP on circuit function, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging in hippocampal slices and in vivo electroencephalogram recordings of the hippocampus following MOPR activation. As the hippocampus contains excitatory pyramidal cells whose activity is highly regulated by a dense network of inhibitory neurons, it serves as an ideal structure to evaluate how putative receptor function abnormalities may influence circuit activity. We found that MOPR activation increased excitatory responses in wild-type animals, an effect that was significantly reduced in animals possessing the Oprm1 SNP. Furthermore, in order to assess the in vivo effects of this SNP during MOPR activation, EEG recordings of hippocampal activity following morphine administration corroborated a loss-of-function phenotype. In conclusion, as these mice have been shown to have similar MOPR expression in the hippocampus between genotypes, these data suggest that the MOPR A118G SNP results in a loss of receptor function.

In the second series at the middle of this interval for strengthening of the load was entered the additional cognitive task in the form of conditioning stimuli like Go/NoGo - circles of blue or green color. Data analysis of the research was carried out by means of continuous wavelet-transformation on the basis of "mather" complex Morlet-wavelet in the range of 1-35 Hz. Beta rhythm power was characterized by the mean level, maxima of wavelet-transformation coefficient (WLC) and latent periods of maxima. Introduction of additional cognitive task to pause between the target and triggering stimuli led to essential increase in absolute values of the mean level of beta rhythm WLC and relative sizes of maxima of beta rhythm WLC. In the series of experiments without conditioning stimulus subjects with large number of mistakes (from 6 to 40), i.e. rigid set, in comparison with subjects with small number of mistakes (to 5), i.e. plastic set, at the forming stage were characterized by higher values of the mean level of beta rhythm WLC. Introduction of the conditioning stimuli led to smoothing of intergroup distinctions throughout the experiment.	[Yakovenko, I. A.; Cheremushkin, E. A.; Kozlov, M.

In recent years psychophysical studies have shown that short-term monocular deprivation alters visual perception in adult humans. Specifically, after 150 min of monocular deprivation the deprived eye strongly dominates the dynamics of binocular rivalry, reflecting homeostatic plasticity. Here we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this form of short-term visual cortical plasticity by measuring visual evoked potentials (VEPs) on the scalp of adult humans during monocular stimulation before and after 150 min of monocular deprivation. We found that monocular deprivation had opposite effects on the amplitude of the earliest component of the VEP (C1) for the deprived and non-deprived eye stimulation. C1 amplitude increased (+66%) for the deprived eye, while it decreased (-29%) for the non-deprived eye. Source localization analysis confirmed that the C1 originates in the primary visual cortex. We further report that following monocular deprivation, the amplitude of the peak of the evoked alpha spectrum increased on average by 23% for the deprived eye and decreased on average by 10% for the non-deprived eye, indicating a change in cortical excitability. These results indicate that a brief period of monocular deprivation alters interocular balance in the primary visual cortex of adult humans by both boosting the activity of the deprived eye and reducing the activity of the non-deprived eye. This indicates a high level of residual homeostatic plasticity in the adult human primary visual cortex, probably mediated by a change in cortical excitability.	[Lunghi, Claudia; Morrone, M.

Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation Modulates Tinnitus-Related Beta- and Gamma-Band Activity	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						MEG; Synchrony; Tinnitus; Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation	SIGNAL SPACE SEPARATION; FAR-FIELD POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN-STEM; SYNCHRONIZATION; MEG; EEG; POWER; VNS	Objectives: The ability of a treatment method to interfere with tinnitus-related neural activity patterns, such as cortical gamma rhythms, has been suggested to indicate its potential in relieving tinnitus. Therapeutic modulation of gamma-band oscillations with vagus nerve stimulation has been recently reported in epileptic patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) on neural oscillatory patterns. Design: We calculated the power spectral density and synchrony of magnetoencephalography recordings during auditory stimulation in seven tinnitus patients and eight normal-hearing control subjects. Comparisons between subject groups were performed to reveal electrophysiological markers of tinnitus. tVNS-specific effects within each group were studied by comparing recording blocks with and without tVNS. We also investigated the correlation of each measure with individual ratings of tinnitus distress, as measured by the tinnitus handicap inventory questionnaire. Results: Tinnitus patients differed from controls in the baseline condition (no tVNS applied), measured by both cortical oscillatory power and synchronization, particularly at beta and gamma frequencies. Importantly, we found tVNS-induced changes in synchrony, correlating strongly with tinnitus handicap inventory scores, at whole-head beta-band (r = -0.857, p = 0.007), whole-head gamma-band (r = -0.952, p = 0.0003), and frontal gamma-band (r = -0.952, p = 0.0003). Conclusions: We conclude that tVNS was successful in modulating tinnitus- related beta-and gamma-band activity and thus could have potential as a treatment method for tinnitus.

Although several studies have shown neuropsychological disabilities of children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), there is no clear evidence about the impairment of attentional systems and the comorbidity of attentional problems. Our research was based on the attention network model and assessed the characteristics of three anatomically defined subnetworks (alerting, orienting, and executive control) of 90 children with BECTS and 90 healthy children. All the subjects enrolled in the study participated in the attention network test (ANT) with assessment of both the reaction time (RT) and accuracy of the test. The results indicated that the performance of healthy controls was significantly better in orienting of attentional system (P < 0.001) and the accuracy of attention network test (P < 0.001), compared with that of children affected by BECTS. The grand mean effect (higher score worse) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the patient group than that in the control group. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between the age of onset and the accuracy of attention network test results, and a negative correlation between the age of onset and the results of grand mean effect. A negative correlation was observed between spike index (SI) of the non-REM sleep stage and the accuracy of attention network test results. We found no relationship between the grand mean effect and clinical factors such as gender, duration of clinical course, duration of seizures, total number of seizures, severity of seizures (seizure frequency), hemispheric lateralization of electroencephalograph (EEG), and the awake SI. Furthermore, no relationship was observed between the clinical factors and the accuracy of the test results. The findings showed that BECTS is associated with impaired attentional networks, and impairments are greater at younger ages of onset. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Progressive, Seizure-Like, Spike-Wave Discharges Are Common in Both Injured and Uninjured Sprague-Dawley Rats: Implications for the Fluid Percussion Injury Model of Post-Traumatic Epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						absence; acquired epilepsy; epilepsy; fluid percussion; genetic epilepsy; seizure	COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES; PHOTOTHROMBOTIC BRAIN INFARCTION; GENETIC ABSENCE EPILEPSY; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; LONG-EVANS RATS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; AWAKE RATS; EEG; NETWORKS	Variable-duration oscillations and repetitive, high-voltage spikes have been recorded in the electrocorticogram (ECoG) of rats weeks and months after fluid percussion injury (FPI), a model of traumatic brain injury. These ECoG events, which have many similarities to spike-wave-discharges (SWDs) and absence seizures, have been proposed to represent nonconvulsive seizures characteristic of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). The present study quantified features of SWD episodes in rats at different time points after moderate to severe FPI, and compared them with age-matched control rats. Control and FPI-injured rats at 1 year of age displayed large-amplitude and frequent SWD events at frontal and parietal recording sites. At 3-6 months, SWDs were shorter in duration and less frequent; extremely brief SWDs (i.e., "larval") were detected as early as 1 month. The onset of the SWDs was nearly always synchronous across electrodes and of larger amplitude in frontal regions. A sensory stimulus, such as a click, immediately and consistently stopped the occurrence of the SWDs. SWDs were consistently accompanied by behavioral arrest. All features of SWDs in control and experimental (FPI) rats were indistinguishable. None of the FPI-treated rats developed nonconvulsive or convulsive seizures that could be distinguished electro-graphically or behaviorally from SWDs. Because SWDs have features similar to genetic absence seizures, these results challenge the hypothesis that SWDs after FPI reflect PTE.

The identification of common oscillatory inputs to motor neurons in the electromyographic (EMG) signal power spectrum is often preceded by EMG rectification for enhancing the low-frequency oscillatory components. However, rectification is a nonlinear operator and its influence on the EMG signal spectrum is not fully understood. In this study, we aim at determining when EMG rectification is beneficial in the study of oscillatory inputs to motor neurons. Approach. We provide a full mathematical description of the power spectrum of the rectified EMG signal and the influence of the average shape of the motor unit action potentials on it. We also provide a validation of these theoretical results with both simulated and experimental EMG signals. Main results. Simulations using an advanced computational model and experimental results demonstrated the accuracy of the theoretical derivations on the effect of rectification on the EMG spectrum. These derivations proved that rectification is beneficial when assessing the strength of low-frequency (delta and alpha bands) common synaptic inputs to the motor neurons, when the duration of the action potentials is short, and when the level of cancellation is relatively low. On the other hand, rectification may distort the estimation of common synaptic inputs when studying higher frequencies (beta and gamma), in a way dependent on the duration of the action potentials, and may introduce peaks in the coherence function that do not correspond to physiological shared inputs. Significance. This study clarifies the conditions when rectifying the surface EMG is appropriate for studying neural connectivity.

Since transgenic animal models of Huntington's disease capture basic neuropathology of the disorder, auditory gating was studied in BACHD (line5) transgenic rats and Q175 transgenic mice, together with local field gamma power in the hippocampus and primary auditory cortex. Using clinically equivalent acoustic-stimulation paradigms, impaired auditory gating was detected in transgenic BACHD rats under anesthesia and in freely-moving condition. In addition, transgenic BACHD rats showed a lower level of hippocampal and cortical field gamma band power compared to wild-type counterpart, which might be related to their compromised mitochondrial function. Systemic administration of the recently developed phosphodiesterase 9A (PDE9A) inhibitor PF-04447943 dose-dependently improved gating deficit in transgenic BACHD rats in both brain regions. Q175 mice, including wild-type, heterozygote and homozygote mice showed similarly poor gating, and administration of PF-04447943 was without effect. Treatment of transgenic BACHD rats with daily administration of PF-04447943 (1 mg/kg) over 7-days resulted in an improvement in their auditory gating both in the hippocampus and primary auditory cortex as evaluated 24 h after the last treatment. In fact, differences in auditory gating between wild-type and transgenic BACHD rats were totally abolished after sub-chronic treatment with the PDE9A inhibitor. Our findings indicate that BACHD transgenic rats show abnormal auditory gating with features resembling those of Huntington's disease patients, which could be considered as potential translational biomarker for drug development in treatment of this disease.

Every 2 s, a brief 10 ms light pulse was applied and the local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded with a 10 kHz sampling rate. The experiment was repeated 100 times and we only retained and analyzed data from six animals that showed stable and repeatable response to optical stimulations. The presence of nonlinearity in our data was checked using the null hypothesis that the data were linearly correlated in the temporal domain, but were random otherwise. For each trail, 100 surrogate data sets were generated and both time reversal asymmetry and false nearest neighbor (EN N) were used as discriminating statistics for the null hypothesis. We found that nonlinearity is present in all LFP data. The first 0.5s of each 2s LFP recording were dominated by the transient response of the networks. For each trial, we used the last 1.5 s of steady activity to measure the phase resetting induced by the brief 10 ms light stimulus. After correcting the LFPs for the effect of phase resetting, additional preprocessing was carried out using dendrograms to identify "similar" groups among LFP trials. We found that the steady dynamics of mPFC in response to light stimuli could be reconstructed in a three-dimensional phase space with topologically similar "8"-shaped attractors across different animals. Our results also open the possibility of designing a low-dimensional model for optical stimulation of the mPFC local network.

Functional Brain Networks: Linking Thalamic Atrophy to Clinical Disability in Multiple Sclerosis, A Multimodal fMRI and MEG Study	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						fMRI; MEG; multiple sclerosis; functional networks; functional connectivity; thalamic atrophy	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; HUMAN CONNECTOME; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY; ORGANIZATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT; COGNITION; SURGERY	Thalamic atrophy is known to be one of the most important predictors for clinical dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS). As the thalamus is highly connected to many cortical areas, this suggests that thalamic atrophy is associated with disruption of cortical functional networks. We investigated this thalamo-cortical system to explain the presence of physical and cognitive problems in MS. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) were performed in 86 MS patients and 21 healthy subjects. We computed cortical functional networks for fMRI and MEG by respectively the Pearson's correlation coefficient and the phase lag index using the same automated anatomical labeling atlas for both modalities. Thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was only estimated using fMRI. We computed conventional network metrics such as clustering coefficient and path length and analyzed the minimum spanning tree (MST), a subnetwork and backbone of the original network. MS patients showed reduced thalamic volumes and increased thalamo-cortical connectivity. MEG cortical functional networks showed a lower level of integration in MS in terms of the MST, whereas fMRI cortical networks did not differ between groups. Lower integration of MEG cortical functional networks was both related to thalamic atrophy as well as to increased thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in fMRI and to worse cognitive and clinical status. This study demonstrated for the first time that thalamic atrophy is associated with global disruption of cortical functional networks in MS and this global disruption of network activity was related to worse cognitive and clinical function in MS.

J	Thompson, GJ; Pan, WJ; Keilholz, SD				Thompson, Garth John; Pan, Wen-Ju; Keilholz, Shella Dawn			Different dynamic resting state fMRI patterns are linked to different frequencies of neural activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						resting state fMRI; dynamic analysis; quasi-periodic patterns; sliding window correlation; simultaneous electrophysiology and MRI	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; BOLD FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SLOW EEG FLUCTUATIONS; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; ISOFLURANE; INCREASES	Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) results have indicated that network mapping can contribute to understanding behavior and disease, but it has been difficult to translate the maps created with rsfMRI to neuroelectrical states in the brain. Recently, dynamic analyses have revealed multiple patterns in the rsfMRI signal that are strongly associated with particular bands of neural activity. To further investigate these findings, simultaneously recorded invasive electrophysiology and rsfMRI from rats were used to examine two types of electrical activity (directly measured low-frequency/infraslow activity and band-limited power of higher frequencies) and two types of dynamic rsfMRI (quasi-periodic patterns or QPP, and sliding window correlation or SWC). The relationship between neural activity and dynamic rsfMRI was tested under three anesthetic states in rats: dexmedetomidine and high and low doses of isoflurane. Under dexmedetomidine, the lightest anesthetic, infraslow electrophysiology correlated with QPP but not SWC, whereas band-limited power in higher frequencies correlated with SWC but not QPP. Results were similar under isoflurane; however, the QPP was also correlated to band-limited power, possibly due to the burst-suppression state induced by the anesthetic agent. The results provide additional support for the hypothesis that the two types of dynamic rsfMRI are linked to different frequencies of neural activity, but isoflurane anesthesia may make this relationship more complicated. Understanding which neural frequency bands appear as particular dynamic patterns in rsfMRI may ultimately help isolate components of the rsfMRI signal that are of interest to disorders such as schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder.

Laminar Profile and Physiology of the alpha Rhythm in Primary Visual, Auditory, and Somatosensory Regions of Neocortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha rhythm; auditory; laminar; somatosensory; visual	SOURCE-DENSITY ANALYSIS; FIELD POTENTIALS; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; EEG ALPHA; MU RHYTHM; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES	The functional significance of the alpha rhythm is widely debated. It has been proposed that alpha reflects sensory inhibition and/or a temporal sampling or "parsing" mechanism. There is also continuing disagreement over the more fundamental questions of which cortical layers generate alpha rhythms and whether the generation of alpha is equivalent across sensory systems. To address these latter questions, we analyzed laminar profiles of local field potentials (LFPs) and concomitant multiunit activity (MUA) from macaque V1, S1, and A1 during both spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Current source density (CSD) analysis of laminar LFP profiles revealed alpha current generators in the supragranular, granular, and infragranular layers. MUA phase-locked to local current source/sink configurations confirmed that alpha rhythms index local neuronal excitability fluctuations. CSD-defined alpha generators were strongest in the supragranular layers, whereas LFP alpha power was greatest in the infragranular layers, consistent with some of the previous reports. The discrepancy between LFP and CSD findings appears to be attributable to contamination of the infragranular LFP signal by activity that is volume-conducted from the stronger supragranular alpha generators. The presence of alpha generators across cortical depth in V1, S1, and A1 suggests the involvement of alpha in feedforward as well as feedback processes and is consistent with the view that alpha rhythms, perhaps in addition to a role in sensory inhibition, may parse sensory input streams in a way that facilitates communication across cortical areas.

We studied thalamo-cortical connectivity and synchrony in human mesial temporal lobe seizures in order to analyze their role in seizure termination. Twenty-two seizures from 10 patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing pre-surgical evaluation were analyzed using intracerebral recordings [stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG)]. We performed a measure of SEEG signal interdependencies (non-linear correlation), to estimate the functional connectivity between thalamus and cortical regions. Then, we derived synchronization indices, namely global, thalamic, mesio-temporal, and thalamo-mesio temporal index at the onset and the end of seizures. In addition, an estimation of thalamic "outputs and inputs" connectivity was proposed. Thalamus was consistently involved in the last phase of all analyzed seizures and thalamic synchronization index was significantly more elevated at the end of seizure than at the onset. The global synchronization index at the end of seizure negatively correlated with seizure duration (p = 0.045) and in the same way the thalamic synchronization index showed an inverse tendency with seizure duration. Six seizures out of twenty-two displayed a particular thalamo-cortical spike-and-wave pattern at the end. They were associated to higher values of all synchronization indices and outputs from thalamus (p = 0.0079). SWP seizures displayed a higher and sustained increase of cortical and thalamo-cortical synchronization with a stronger participation of thalamic outputs. We suggest that thalamo-cortical oscillations might contribute to seizure termination via modulation of cortical synchronization. In the subgroup of SWP seizures, thalamus may exert a control on temporal lobe structures by inducing a stable hypersynchronization that ultimately leads to seizure termination.

Cortical Functional Connectivity during Cued vs. Implicit Modality-Specific Anticipatory Attention: EEG-Source Alpha Coherence Analysis	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Review						directed modality-specific attention (cued attention); implicit anticipation; visual and auditory tasks; source-space coherence; alpha rhythm	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TOP-DOWN; SEQUENCE; TASK; PARIETAL; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; DISSOCIATION; RESOLUTION	The brain functional organization was studied in a group of healthy right-handed adults (N = 16, mean age = 23 +/- 5.7) during preparation for visual and auditory sensory tasks in two conditions: (1) participants waited for appearance of either a visual or an auditory stimulus after being cued about its sensory modality (the cued anticipatory attention) or (2) they developed implicit anticipation of stimulus in the course of repetitive exposure to the same sequence of visual and auditory stimuli pairs. In both cases, participants were asked to discriminate the temporal order of stimuli presentation within a pair of either visual or auditory modality. The functional connectivity was assessed via alpha coherence computed in the source space for preselected regions of interests. For both visual and auditory modalities, increase of strength of functional links among cortical areas involved in the fronto-parietal attention system is found during the cued attention when compared to nonspecific sustained attention. An increase is also observed in the connection strengths between sensory-specific and associative (parietal and prefrontal) areas. In visual modality, the buildup of implicit anticipation was accompanied by the strengthening of functional links between the ventral premotor cortex and caudal (parietal and occipital) areas of the right hemisphere. In the case of auditory task, the increase of connection strengths within fronto-temporal cortical areas was observed. These areas included the rostral supplementary motor areas, ventral premotor cortices and primary auditory cortices.	[Machinskaya, R. I.; Talalay, I. V.; Kurgansky, A.

Distinguishing cognitive state with multifractal complexity of hippocampal interspike interval sequences	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						delayed nonmatch-to-sample; hippocampus; long-range temporal correlations; multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis; resting state; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); working memory	WORKING-MEMORY; RESTING STATE; CANNABINOIDS REVEAL; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PHASE PRECESSION; DELTA ACTIVITY; THETA RHYTHM; TERM-MEMORY; DYNAMICS; EEG	Fractality, represented as self-similar repeating patterns, is ubiquitous in nature and the brain. Dynamic patterns of hippocampal spike trains are known to exhibit multifractal properties during working memory processing; however, it is unclear whether the multifractal properties inherent to hippocampal spike trains reflect active cognitive processing. To examine this possibility, hippocampal neuronal ensembles were recorded from rats before, during and after a spatial working memory task following administration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a memory-impairing component of cannabis. Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis was performed on hippocampal interspike interval sequences to determine characteristics of monofractal long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), quantified by the Hurst exponent, and the degree/magnitude of multifractal complexity, quantified by the width of the singularity spectrum. Our results demonstrate that multifractal firing patterns of hippocampal spike trains are a marker of functional memory processing, as they are more complex during the working memory task and significantly reduced following administration of memory impairing THC doses. Conversely, LRTCs are largest during resting state recordings, therefore reflecting different information compared to multifractality. In order to deepen conceptual understanding of multifractal complexity and LRTCs, these measures were compared to classical methods using hippocampal frequency content and firing variability measures. These results showed that LRTCs, multifractality, and theta rhythm represent independent processes, while delta rhythm correlated with multifractality. Taken together, these results provide a novel perspective on memory function by demonstrating that the multifractal nature of spike trains reflects hippocampal microcircuit activity that can be used to detect and quantify cognitive, physiological, and pathological states.

Impaired sleep homeostasis has been suspected in both CFS and PI. Methods: We compared perceived sleep quality, fatigue and sleepiness symptom-intensities, polysomnography (PSG) and SWS spectral power distributions of drug-free CFS and PI patients without comorbid sleep or mental disorders, with a good sleeper control group. Results: Higher fatigue without EDS and impaired perceived sleep quality were confirmed in both patient groups. PSG mainly differed in sleep fragmentation and SWS durations. Spectral analysis revealed a similar decrease in central ultra slow power (0.3-0.79 Hz) proportion during SWS for both CFS and PI and an increase in frontal power proportions of faster frequencies during SWS in PI only. The latter was correlated to affective symptoms whereas lower central ultra slow power proportions were related to fatigue severity and sleep quality impairment. Conclusions: In combination with normal (PI) or even increased SWS durations (CFS), we found consistent evidence for lower proportions of slow oscillations during SWS in PI and CFS. Significance: Observing normal or increased SWS durations but lower proportions of ultra slow power, our findings suggest a possible quantitative compensation of altered homeostatic regulation.

Fundamental differences in the nature of visual and auditory inputs might account for this discrepancy: whereas the visual system mainly relies on spatial information, time might be the most important factor for the auditory system. In contrast to vision, temporal subsampling (i.e. taking snapshots') of the auditory input stream might thus prove detrimental for the brain as essential information would be lost. Rather than embracing the view of a continuous auditory processing, we recently proposed that discrete perceptual cycles' might exist in the auditory system, but on a hierarchically higher level of processing, involving temporally more stable features. This proposal leads to the prediction that the auditory system would be more robust to temporal subsampling when applied on a high-level' decomposition of auditory signals. To test this prediction, we constructed speech stimuli that were subsampled at different frequencies, either at the input level (following a wavelet transform) or at the level of auditory features (on the basis of LPC vocoding), and presented them to human listeners. Auditory recognition was significantly more robust to subsampling in the latter case, that is on a relatively high level of auditory processing. Although our results do not directly demonstrate perceptual cycles in the auditory domain, they (a) show that their existence is possible without disrupting temporal information to a critical extent and (b) confirm our proposal that, if they do exist, they should operate on a higher level of auditory processing.

The stimulation of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 2 receptor has been shown to be effective in a number of animal models of schizophrenia. In this study, we investigated the antipsychotic profiles of (2S)-5-methyl-2-{[4-(1,1,1-trifluoro-2-methylpropan-2-yl)phenoxy]methyl}-2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b][1,3] oxazole-6-carboxamide (TASP0443294), a newly synthesized positive allosteric modulator of the mGlu2 receptor. TASP0443294 potentiated the response of human mGlu2 and rat mGlu2 receptors to glutamate with EC50 values of 277 and 149 nM, respectively, without affecting the glutamate response of human mGlu3 receptor. TASP0443294 was distributed in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid after peroral administration in rats. The peroral administration of TASP0443294 inhibited methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion in rats, which was attenuated by an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, and improved social memory impairment induced by 5R, 10S-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a, d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801) in rats. Furthermore, TASP0443294 reduced the ketamine-induced basal gamma hyperactivity in the prefrontal cortex and suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in rats. These findings indicate that TASP0443294 is an mGlu2 receptor positive allosteric modulator with antipsychotic activity, and that the suppression of aberrant gamma oscillations and REM sleep could be considered as neurophysiological biomarkers for TASP0443294.

J	Kajikawa, Y; Schroeder, CE				Kajikawa, Yoshinao; Schroeder, Charles E.			Generation of field potentials and modulation of their dynamics through volume integration of cortical activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						field potential; current source density; volume conduction; LFP	AUDITORY-CORTEX; FREQUENCY; REFLECTS; GAMMA; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; SIGNALS; REACH	Field potentials (FPs) recorded within the brain, often called "local field potentials" (LFPs), are useful measures of net synaptic activity in a neuronal ensemble. However, due to volume conduction, FPs spread beyond regions of underlying synaptic activity, and thus an "LFP" signal may not accurately reflect the temporal patterns of synaptic activity in the immediately surrounding neuron population. To better understand the physiological processes reflected in FPs, we explored the relationship between the FP and its membrane current generators using current source density (CSD) analysis in conjunction with a volume conductor model. The model provides a quantitative description of the spatiotemporal summation of immediate local and more distant membrane currents to produce the FP. By applying the model to FPs in the macaque auditory cortex, we have investigated a critical issue that has broad implications for FP research. We have shown that FP responses in particular cortical layers are differentially susceptible to activity in other layers. Activity in the supragranular layers has the strongest contribution to FPs in other cortical layers, and infragranular FPs are most susceptible to contributions from other layers. To define the physiological processes generating FPs recorded in loci of relatively weak synaptic activity, strong effects produced by synaptic events in the vicinity have to be taken into account. While outlining limitations and caveats inherent to FP measurements, our results also suggest specific peak and frequency band components of FPs can be related to activity in specific cortical layers. These results may help improving the interpretability of FPs.

However, the function of sleep still remains elusive. The difficulty with unraveling sleep's function may arise from the lack of understanding of how the multitude of processes associated with waking and sleep-from gene expression and single neuron activity to the whole brain dynamics and behavior-functionally and mechanistically relate to each other. Therefore, novel conceptual frameworks, which integrate and take into account the variety of phenomena occurring during waking and sleep at different levels, will likely lead to advances in our understanding of the function of sleep, above and beyond what merely descriptive or correlative approaches can provide. One such framework, the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, focuses on wake- and sleep-dependent changes in synaptic strength. The core claim of this hypothesis is that learning and experience during wakefulness are associated with a net increase in synaptic strength. In turn, the proposed function of sleep is to provide synaptic renormalization, which has important implications with respect to energy needs, intracranial space, metabolic supplies, and, importantly, enables further plastic changes. In this article we review the empirical evidence for this hypothesis, which was obtained at several levels-from gene expression and cellular excitability to structural synaptic modifications and behavioral outcomes. We conclude that although the mechanisms behind the proposed role of sleep in synaptic homeostasis are undoubtedly complex, this conceptual framework offers a unique opportunity to provide mechanistic and functional explanation for many previously disparate observations, and define future research strategies.

To understand how these factors together regulate cortical dynamics, we recorded simultaneously spontaneous and somatosensory-evoked multiunit activity from primary somatosensory cortex and from the locus coeruleus (LC) (the neuromodulatory nucleus releasing norepinephrine) in urethane-anesthetized rats. We found that bursts of ipsilateral-LC firing preceded by few tens of milliseconds increases of cortical excitability, and that the 1- to 10-Hz rhythmicity of LC discharge appeared to increase the power of delta-band (1-4 Hz) cortical synchronization. To investigate quantitatively how LC firing might causally influence spontaneous and stimulus-driven cortical dynamics, we then constructed and fitted to these data a model describing the dynamical interaction of stimulus drive, ongoing synchronized cortical activity, and noradrenergic neuromodulation. The model proposes a coupling between LC and cortex that can amplify delta-range cortical fluctuations, and shows how suitably timed phasic LC bursts can lead to enhanced cortical responses to weaker stimuli and increased temporal precision of cortical stimulus-evoked responses. Thus, the temporal structure of noradrenergic modulation may selectively and dynamically enhance or attenuate cortical responses to stimuli. Finally, using the model prediction of single-trial cortical stimulus-evoked responses to discount single-trial state-dependent variability increased by similar to 70% the sensory information extracted from cortical responses. This suggests that downstream circuits may extract information more effectively after estimating the state of the circuit transmitting the sensory message.

However, the precise pathophysiology of tinnitus remains unknown. Llinas' thalamocortical dysrhythmia model suggests that neural deafferentation due to hearing loss causes a dysregulation of coherent activity between thalamus and auditory cortex. This leads to a pathological coupling of theta and gamma oscillatory activity in the resting state, localised to the auditory cortex where normally alpha oscillations should occur. Numerous studies also suggest that tinnitus perception relies on the interplay between auditory and non-auditory brain areas. According to the Global Brain Model, a network of global fronto-parietal-cingulate areas is important in the generation and maintenance of the conscious perception of tinnitus. Thus, the distress experienced by many individuals with tinnitus is related to the top-down influence of this global network on auditory areas. In this magnetoencephalographic study, we compare resting-state oscillatory activity of tinnitus participants and normal-hearing controls to examine effects on spectral power as well as functional and effective connectivity. The analysis is based on beamformer source projection and an atlas-based region-of-interest approach. We find increased functional connectivity within the auditory cortices in the alpha band. A significant increase is also found for the effective connectivity from a global brain network to the auditory cortices in the alpha and beta bands. We do not find evidence of effects on spectral power. Overall, our results provide only limited support for the thalamocortical dysrhythmia and Global Brain models of tinnitus.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of status epilepticus are not well established. With this argument, we use a computational modeling approach combined with in vivo electrophysiological data obtained from an experimental model of status epilepticus to infer about changes that may lead to a seizure. Special emphasis is done to analyze parameter changes during or after pilocarpine administration. A cubature Kalman filter is utilized to estimate parameters and states of the model in real time from the observed electrophysiological signals. It was observed that during basal activity ( before pilocarpine administration) the parameters presented a standard deviation below 30% of the mean value, while during SE activity, the parameters presented variations larger than 200% of the mean value with respect to basal state. The ratio of excitation inhibition, increased during SE activity by 80% with respect to the transition state, and reaches the lowest value during cessation. In addition, a progression between low and fast inhibitions before or during this condition was found. This method can be implemented in real time, which is particularly important for the design of stimulation devices that attempt to stop seizures. These changes in the parameters analyzed during seizure activity can lead to better understanding of the mechanisms of epilepsy and to improve its treatments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is frequently found in the alpha and beta bands in humans during generation, observation, and imagery of movement and is considered to reflect cortical motor activity and action-perception coupling. The shared information driving ERD in all these motor-related behaviors is unknown. We investigated whether particular laws governing production and perception of curved movement may account for the attenuation of alpha and beta rhythms. Human movement appears to be governed by relatively few kinematic laws of motion. One dominant law in biological motion kinematics is the 2/3 power law (PL), which imposes a strong dependency of movement speed on curvature and is prominent in action-perception coupling. Here we directly examined whether the 2/3 PL elicits ERD during motion observation by characterizing the spatiotemporal signature of ERD. ERDs were measured while human subjects observed a cloud of dots moving along elliptical trajectories either complying with or violating the 2/3 PL. We found that ERD within both frequency bands was consistently stronger, arose faster, and was more widespread while observing motion obeying the 2/3 PL. An activity pattern showing clear 2/3 PL preference and lying within the alpha band was observed exclusively above central motor areas, whereas 2/3 PL preference in the beta band was observed in additional prefrontal-central cortical sites. Our findings reveal that compliance with the 2/3 PL is sufficient to elicit a selective ERD response in the human brain.

Functional Integration Between Brain Regions at Rest Occurs in Multiple-Frequency Bands	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						BOLD; high frequency; ICA; multiband; RSFC	STATE NETWORKS; COVARIANCE NETWORKS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; BOLD; EEG; FLUCTUATIONS; RESOLUTION; OSCILLATIONS	Studies of resting-state fMRI have shown that blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals giving rise to temporal correlation across voxels (or regions) are dominated by low-frequency fluctuations in the range of similar to 0.01-0.1 Hz. These low-frequency fluctuations have been further divided into multiple distinct frequency bands (slow-5 and -4) based on earlier neurophysiological studies, though low sampling frequency of fMRI (similar to 0.5 Hz) has substantially limited the exploration of other known frequency bands of neurophysiological origins (slow-3, -2, and -1). In this study, we used resting-state fMRI data acquired from 21 healthy subjects at a higher sampling frequency of 1.5 Hz to assess the presence of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) across multiple frequency bands: slow-5 to slow-1. The effect of different frequency bands on spatial extent and connectivity strength for known resting-state networks (RSNs) was also evaluated. RSNs were derived using independent component analysis and seed-based correlation. Commonly known RSNs, such as the default mode, the fronto-parietal, the dorsal attention, and the visual networks, were consistently observed at multiple frequency bands. Significant inter-hemispheric connectivity was observed between each seed and its contra lateral brain region across all frequency bands, though overall spatial extent of seed-based correlation maps decreased in slow-2 and slow-1 frequency bands. These results suggest that functional integration between brain regions at rest occurs over multiple frequency bands and RSFC is a multiband phenomenon. These results also suggest that further investigation of BOLD signal in multiple frequency bands for related cognitive processes should be undertaken.

However, a link between behaviors and learning process in the brain of animal model of autism remained largely unexplored. Particularly, spontaneous neural signaling in learning-related brain areas has not been studied. This study investigated local field potential (LFP) of the hippocampus (HP), the olfactory bulb (OB) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA) on gestational day 13. Adult male Swiss albino mouse offspring implanted with intracranial electrodes were used. VPA-exposed mice exhibited ASD-associated behaviors. Hippocampal LFP analysis revealed that VPA group significantly increased low gamma activity (25-45 Hz) during awake immobility. Regression analyses confirmed positive correlations between locomotor speed and hippocampal theta oscillations in control but not VPA group. VPA group exhibited increases in delta (1-4 Hz) and beta (25-35 Hz) activities in OB during awake immobility and active exploring, respectively. Moreover, significantly increased and decreased coherences between HP and OB of VPA animals were seen within gamma (active exploration) and theta (awake immobility) ranges, respectively. In addition, significant increase in coherence between HP and mPFC was seen within delta range during active exploration. In addition to three ASD symptoms, VPA animals also exhibited differential patterns of olfacto-hippocampal LFP, altered locomotor speed-related hippocampal theta activities and distinct interplays between HP and learning-related brain areas. The altered olfacto-hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex-hippocampal networks may underlie impairments in autism mouse model.

This is at least partly because of the complexity of the cholinergic circuitry and the difficulty in comparing results from in vivo studies obtained under diverse experimental conditions and types of anesthetics. Hence the role of nAChRs in the synchronization of cortical activity during slow-wave sleep is still controversial, with some studies showing they are involved in ACh-dependent EEG desynchronization, and others suggesting that this effect is mediated exclusively by muscarinic receptors. Here we use an in vitro model of endogenous network activity, in the form of recurring self-maintained depolarized states (Up states), which allows us to examine the role of high-affinity nAChRs on network dynamics in a simpler form of the cortical microcircuit. We find that mice lacking nAChRs containing the beta 2-subunit (beta 2-nAChRs) have longer and more frequent Up states, and that this difference is eliminated when beta 2-nAChRs in wild-type mice are blocked. We further show that endogenously released ACh can modulate Up/Down states through the activation of both beta 2- and alpha 7-containing nAChRs, but through distinct mechanisms: alpha 7-nAChRs affect only the termination of spontaneous Up states, while beta 2-nAChRs also regulate their generation. Finally we provide evidence that the effects of beta 2-subunit-containing, but not alpha 7-subunit-containing nAChRs, are mediated through GABA(B) receptors. To our knowledge this is the first study documenting direct nicotinic modulation of Up/Down state activity.

J	Kotz, SA; Schmidt-Kassow, M				Kotz, Sonja A.; Schmidt-Kassow, Maven			Basal ganglia contribution to rule expectancy and temporal predictability in speech	CORTEX			English	Article						Temporal predictability; Beat; Meter; Syntax; Speech; Basal ganglia; Cerebellum	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BEAT PERCEPTION; WORD SEGMENTATION; TIME PERCEPTION; NEURAL BASIS; LANGUAGE; RHYTHM; OSCILLATIONS	The current work set out to answer three questions: (1) Are reported syntactic deficits in patients with structural damage to the basal ganglia (BG) in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical systems (CSTCS) the result of a syntax specific computational deficit or are they potentially a consequence of a generalized timing deficit? (2) Do BG patients suffer from a simple beat perception deficit in speech comparable to the one reported in music? (3) Can regular speech meter (i.e., a pattern of beats induced by the regular alteration of stressed and unstressed syllable accents) ameliorate the computation of syntactically marked information by making speech events temporally predictable and salient? The latter 'remediation' hypothesis would predict that when speech events (i.e., those that are syntactically marked) are metrically aligned to the syllabic accent structure, the computation of syntactic information is facilitated or in the case of patients ameliorated. During continuous EEG measurement nineteen patients with focal BG lesions and matched healthy controls listened to metrically regular and syntactically well-formed sentences and metrically well-formed sentences that either violated syntactic expectancy, metrical expectancy, or both. While healthy controls showed an expected P600 response in the event-related brain potential (ERP) to all expectancy violations, BG patients showed overall comparable P600 responses to all, but the metrical expectancy violation. These results confirm that (1) BG patients suffer from a simple beat perception deficit in speech and (2) regular speech meter ameliorates the computation of syntactically marked information in the speech signal. We propose that a domain general sensorimotor cerebello-thalamo-cortical system (CTCS), involved in event-based temporal processing, engages in the remediation of dysfunctional cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical timing that affects the timely computation of linguistic (i.e., syntax) information in the speech signal.

Age-related changes in sleep spindles characteristics during daytime recovery following a 25-hour sleep deprivation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; sleep spindles; circadian process; sleep loss; homeostatic sleep pressure	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; MIDDLE YEARS; CIRCADIAN MODULATION; EEG; BRAIN; YOUNG; LIFE; OSCILLATIONS; TOPOGRAPHY	Objectives: The mechanisms underlying sleep spindles (similar to 11-15 Hz; >0.5 s) help to protect sleep. With age, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain sleep at a challenging time (e.g., daytime), even after sleep loss. This study compared spindle characteristics during daytime recovery and nocturnal sleep in young and middle-aged adults. In addition, we explored whether spindles characteristics in baseline nocturnal sleep were associated with the ability to maintain sleep during daytime recovery periods in both age groups. Methods: Twenty-nine young (15 women and 14 men; 27.3 y +/- 5.0) and 31 middle-aged (19 women and 13 men; 51.6 y +/- 5.1) healthy subjects participated in a baseline nocturnal sleep and a daytime recovery sleep after 25 hours of sleep deprivation. Spindles were detected on artifact-free Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep epochs. Spindle density (nb/min), amplitude (mu V), frequency (Hz), and duration (s) were analyzed on parasagittal (linked ears) derivations. Results: In young subjects, spindle frequency increased during daytime recovery sleep as compared to baseline nocturnal sleep in all derivations, whereas middle-aged subjects showed spindle frequency enhancement only in the prefrontal derivation. No other significant interaction between age group and sleep condition was observed. Spindle density for all derivations and centro-occipital spindle amplitude decreased whereas prefrontal spindle amplitude increased from baseline to daytime recovery sleep in both age groups. Finally, no significant correlation was found between spindle characteristics during baseline nocturnal sleep and the marked reduction in sleep efficiency during daytime recovery sleep in both young and middle-aged subjects. Conclusion: These results suggest that the interaction between homeostatic and circadian pressure modulates spindle frequency differently in aging. Spindle characteristics do not seem to be linked with the ability to maintain daytime recovery sleep.	[Rosinvil, T.; Lafortune, M.; Sekerovic, Z.; Bouchard, M.; Dube, J.; Martin, N.; Lina, J.

This new WM testing application will be available to download for free in Apple Store app ("SDRST app"). In order to verify the feasibility of this computer-based task, we conducted three experiments with different manipulations and groups of participants. We were interested in investigating if (1) the SDRST is sensitive enough to tap into cognitive differences brought by aging and dementia; (2) different experimental manipulations work successfully; (3) cortical brain activations seen in other WM tasks are also demonstrated here; and (4) non human primates are able to answer the task. Performance (scores and response time) was better for young than older adults and higher for the latter when compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. All groups performed better with facial stimuli than with images of scenes and with emotional than with neutral stimuli. Electrophysiology data showed activation on prefrontal and frontal areas of scalp, theta band activity on the midline area, and gamma activity in left temporal area. There are all scalp regions known to be related to attention and WM. Besides those data, our sample of adult captive capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) answered the task above chance level. Taken together, these results corroborate the reliability of this new computer-based SDRST as a measure of visuospatial WM in clinical and non-clinical populations as well as in non-human primates. Its tablet app allows the task to be administered in a wide range of settings, including hospitals, homes, schools, laboratories, universities, and research institutions.

NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Granger-causality; Phase slope index; Volume conduction; Reversed time series; Vector autoregressive modeling	MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL INTERACTIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EEG DATA; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; ATTENTION; FEEDBACK	Granger-causality metrics have become increasingly popular tools to identify directed interactions between brain areas. However, it is known that additive noise can strongly affect Granger-causality metrics, which can lead to spurious conclusions about neuronal interactions. To solve this problem, previous studies have proposed the detection of Granger-causal directionality, i.e. the dominant Granger-causal flow, using either the slope of the coherency (Phase Slope Index; PSI), or by comparing Granger-causality values between original and time-reversed signals (reversed Granger testing). We show that for ensembles of vector autoregressive (VAR) models encompassing bidirectionally coupled sources, these alternative methods do not correctly measure Granger-causal directionality for a substantial fraction of VAR models, even in the absence of noise. We then demonstrate that uncorrelated noise has fundamentally different effects on directed connectivity metrics than linearly mixed noise, where the latter may result as a consequence of electric volume conduction. Uncorrelated noise only weakly affects the detection of Granger-causal directionality, whereas linearly mixed noise causes a large fraction of false positives for standard Granger-causality metrics and PSI, but not for reversed Granger testing. We further show that we can reliably identify cases where linearly mixed noise causes a large fraction of false positives by examining the magnitude of the instantaneous influence coefficient in a structural VAR model. By rejecting cases with strong instantaneous influence, we obtain an improved detection of Granger-causal flow between neuronal sources in the presence of additive noise. These techniques are applicable to real data, which we demonstrate using actual area V1 and area V4 LFP data, recorded from the awake monkey performing a visual attention task. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that significant variations in both of the time-frequency measurements underlie the specific changes in the ERP directly related to MI. For the MI task, we chose a simple everyday task (throwing a tennis ball), that does not require any particular motor expertise, set within the controlled virtual reality scenario of a tennis court. When compared to the rest condition a consistent, long-lasting negative fronto-central ERP wave was accompanied by significant changes in both time frequency measurements suggesting long-lasting cortical activity reorganization. The ERP wave was characterized by two peaks at about 300 ms (N300) and 1000 ms (N1000). The N300 component was centrally localized on the scalp and was accompanied by significant phase consistency in the delta brain rhythms in the contralateral central scalp areas. The N1000 component spread wider centrally and was accompanied by a significant power decrease (or event related desynchronization) in low beta brain rhythms localized in fronto-precentral and parieto-occipital scalp areas and also by a significant power increase (or event related synchronization) in theta brain rhythms spreading fronto-centrally. During the transition from N300 to N1000, a contralateral alpha (mu) as well as post-central and parieto-theta rhythms occurred. The visual representation of movement formed in the minds of participants might underlie a top-down process from the fronto-central areas which is reflected by the amplitude changes observed in the fronto-central ERPs and by the significant phase synchrony in contralateral fronto-central delta and contralateral central mu to parietal theta presented here.

Global and regional functional connectivity maps of neural oscillations in focal epilepsy	BRAIN			English	Article						epilepsy; functional connectivity; magnetoencephalography; outcome; surgery	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; SURGERY; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MEG; HIPPOCAMPAL; SEIZURES; EEG; CONSCIOUSNESS	Intractable focal epilepsy is a devastating disorder with profound effects on cognition and quality of life. Epilepsy surgery can lead to seizure freedom in patients with focal epilepsy; however, sometimes it fails due to an incomplete delineation of the epileptogenic zone. Brain networks in epilepsy can be studied with resting-state functional connectivity analysis, yet previous investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging or electrocorticography have produced inconsistent results. Magnetoencephalography allows non-invasive whole-brain recordings, and can be used to study both long-range network disturbances in focal epilepsy and regional connectivity at the epileptogenic zone. In magnetoencephalography recordings from presurgical epilepsy patients, we examined: (i) global functional connectivity maps in patients versus controls; and (ii) regional functional connectivity maps at the region of resection, compared to the homotopic non-epileptogenic region in the contralateral hemisphere. Sixty-one patients were studied, including 30 with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and 31 with focal neocortical epilepsy. Compared with a group of 31 controls, patients with epilepsy had decreased resting-state functional connectivity in widespread regions, including perisylvian, posterior temporo-parietal, and orbitofrontal cortices (P < 0.01, t-test). Decreased mean global connectivity was related to longer duration of epilepsy and higher frequency of consciousness-impairing seizures (P < 0.01, linear regression). Furthermore, patients with increased regional connectivity within the resection site (n = 24) were more likely to achieve seizure postoperative seizure freedom (87.5% with Engel I outcome) than those with neutral (n = 15, 64.3% seizure free) or decreased (n = 23, 47.8% seizure free) regional connectivity (P < 0.02, chi-square). Widespread global decreases in functional connectivity are observed in patients with focal epilepsy, and may reflect deleterious long-term effects of recurrent seizures. Furthermore, enhanced regional functional connectivity at the area of resection may help predict seizure outcome and aid surgical planning.

Maladaptive neual synchrony in tinnitus: origin and restoration	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						tinnitus; neural plasticity; neural synchrony; brain rhythms; coordinated reset	PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; COORDINATED RESET NEUROMODULATION; ENRICHED ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT; SPONTANEOUS NEURAL ACTIVITY; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NOISE TRAUMA; HEARING-LOSS; COCHLEAR NUCLEUS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION	Tinnitus is the conscious perception of sound heard in the absence of physical sound sources external or internal to the body, reflected in aberrant neural synchrony of spontaneous or resting-state brain activity. Neural synchrony is generated by the nearly simultaneous firing of individual neurons, of the synchronization of membrane-potential changes in local neural groups as reflected in the local field potentials, resulting in the presence of oscillatory brain waves in the EEG. Noise-induced hearing loss, often resulting in tinnitus, causes a reorganization of the tonotopic map in auditory cortex and increased spontaneous firing rates and neural synchrony. Spontaneous brain rhythms rely on neural synchrony. Abnormal neural synchrony in tinnitus appears to be confined to specific frequency bands of brain rhythms. Increases in delta-band activity are generated by deafferented/deprived neuronal networks resulting from hearing loss. Coordinated reset (CR) stimulation was developed in order to specifically counteract such abnormal neuronal synchrony by desynchronization. The goal of acoustic CR neuromodulation is to desynchronize tinnitus-related abnormal delta-band oscillations. CR neuromodulation does not require permanent stimulus delivery in order to achieve long-lasting desynchronization or even a full-blown anti-kindling but may have cumulative effects, i.e., the effect of different CR epochs separated by pauses may accumulate. Unlike other approaches, acoustic CR neuromodulation does not intend to reduce tinnitus-related neuronal activity by employing lateral inhibition. The potential efficacy of acoustic CR modulation was shown in a clinical proof of concept trial, where effects achieved in 12 weeks of treatment delivered 4-6 h/day persisted through a preplanned 4-week therapy pause and showed sustained long-term effects after 10 months of therapy, leading to 75% responders.

The current study tested the hypothesis that pain reduction with tDCS is associated with an increase in the peak frequency spectrum density in the theta-alpha range. Methods: Twenty patients with spinal cord injury and bilateral neuropathic pain received single sessions of both sham and anodal tDCS (2 mA) over the left primary motor area (M1) for 20 min. Treatment order was randomly assigned. Pre-to post-procedure changes in pain intensity and peak frequency of electroencephalogram spectral analysis were compared between treatment conditions. Results: The active treatment condition (anodal tDCS over M1) but not sham treatment resulted in significant decreases in pain intensity. In addition, consistent with the study hypothesis, peak theta-alpha frequency (PTAF) assessed from an electrode placed over the site of stimulation increased more from pre-to post-session among participants in the active tDCS condition, relative to those in the sham tDCS condition. Moreover, we found a significant association between a decrease in pain intensity and an increase in PTAF at the stimulation site. Conclusions: The findings are consistent with the possibility that anodal tDCS over the left M1 may be effective, at least in part, because it results in an increase in M1 cortical excitability, perhaps due to a pain inhibitory effect of motor cortex stimulation that may influence the descending pain modulation system. Future research is needed to determine if there is a causal association between increased left anterior activity and pain reduction. Significance: The results provide new findings regarding the effects of tDCS on neuropathic pain and brain oscillation changes. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Applications of electromagnetic fields to brain tissue have been shown to affect cellular properties and their importance for therapies in medicine is recognized. In this study, differentiating murine cortical networks on multiwell microelectrode arrays were repeatedly exposed to an extremely low-electromagnetic field (ELEMF) with alternating 10 and 16 Hz frequencies piggy backed onto a 150 MHz carrier frequency. The ELEMF exposure stimulated the electrical network activity and intensified the structure of bursts. Further, the exposure to electromagnetic fields within the first 28 days in vitro of the differentiation of the network activity induced also reorganization within the burst structure. This effect was already most pronounced at 14 days in vitro after 10 days of exposure. Overall, the development of cortical activity under these conditions was accelerated. These functional electrophysiological changes were accompanied by morphological ones. The percentage of neurons in the neuron glia co-culture was increased without affecting the total number of cells, indicating an enhancement of neurogenesis. The ELEMF exposure selectively promoted the proliferation of a particular population of neurons, evidenced by the increased proportion of GABAergic neurons. The results support the initial hypothesis that this kind of ELEMF stimulation could be a treatment option for specific indications with promising potential for CNS applications, especially for degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.

We characterized the sleep-wake cycle in the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD, which overexpresses a mutant human form of amyloid precursor protein resulting in high levels of beta-amyloid and plaque formation by 3 months of age. Polysomnographic recordings in freely-moving mice were conducted to study sleep-wake cycle architecture at 3, 7 and 11 months of age and corresponding levels of beta-amyloid in brain regions regulating sleep-wake states were measured. At all ages, TgCRND8 mice showed increased wakefulness and reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the resting and active phases. Increased wakefulness in TgCRND8 mice was accompanied by a shift in the waking power spectrum towards fast frequency oscillations in the beta (14-20 Hz) and low gamma range (20-50 Hz). Given the phenotype of hyperarousal observed in TgCRND8 mice, the role of noradrenergic transmission in the promotion of arousal, and previous work reporting an early disruption of the noradrenergic system in TgCRND8, we tested the effects of the alpha-1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, prazosin, on sleep-wake patterns in TgCRND8 and non-transgenic (NTg) mice. We found that a lower dose (2 mg/kg) of prazosin increased NREM sleep in NTg but not in TgCRND8 mice, whereas a higher dose (5 mg/kg) increased NREM sleep in both genotypes, suggesting altered sensitivity to noradrenergic blockade in TgCRND8 mice. Collectively our results demonstrate that amyloidosis in TgCRND8 mice is associated with sleep-wake cycle dysfunction, characterized by hyperarousal, validating this model as a tool towards understanding the relationship between beta-amyloid overproduction and disrupted sleep-wake patterns in AD.

Resting-State Alpha in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Alpha Associations with Thalamic Volume	JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; Alpha; Resting-state; Magnetoencephalography; Thalamus	EEG ALPHA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; METABOLIC-RATE; BRAIN SIZE; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; INDIVIDUALS	Alpha circuits (8-12 Hz), necessary for basic and complex brain processes, are abnormal in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study obtained estimates of resting-state (RS) alpha activity in children with ASD and examined associations between alpha activity, age, and clinical symptoms. Given that the thalamus modulates cortical RS alpha rhythms, associations between thalamic structure and alpha activity were examined. RS magnetoencephalography was obtained from 47 typically-developing children (TDC) and 41 children with ASD. RS alpha activity was measured using distributed source localization. Left and right thalamic volume measurements were also obtained. In both groups, the strongest alpha activity was observed in Calcarine Sulcus regions. In Calcarine regions, only TDC showed the expected association between age and alpha peak frequency. ASD had more alpha activity than TDC in regions bordering the Central Sulcus as well as parietal association cortices. In ASD, whereas greater left Central Sulcus relative alpha activity was associated with higher Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores, greater Calcarine region relative alpha activity was associated with lower SRS scores. Although thalamic volume group differences were not observed, relationships between thalamic volume and Calcarine alpha power were unique to TDC. The present study also identified a failure to shift peak alpha frequency as a function of age in primary alpha-generating areas in children with ASD. Findings suggested that increased RS alpha activity in primary motor and somatosensory as well as parietal multimodal areas-with increased alpha thought to reflect greater inhibition-might impair the ability to identify or interpret social cues. Finally, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report associations between thalamic volume and alpha power, an association observed only in TDC. The lack of thalamic and alpha associations in ASD suggests thalamic contributions to RS alpha abnormalities in ASD.	[Edgar, J.

Cortical Response Similarities Predict which Audiovisual Clips Individuals Viewed, but Are Unrelated to Clip Preference	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTERSUBJECT CORRELATIONS; WAVELET ANALYSIS; TEMPORAL CORTEX; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; FMRI; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; VARIABILITY; POTENTIALS	Cortical responses to complex natural stimuli can be isolated by examining the relationship between neural measures obtained while multiple individuals view the same stimuli. These inter-subject correlation's (ISC's) emerge from similarities in individual's cortical response to the shared audiovisual inputs, which may be related to their emergent cognitive and perceptual experience. Within the present study, our goal is to examine the utility of using ISC's for predicting which audiovisual clips individuals viewed, and to examine the relationship between neural responses to natural stimuli and subjective reports. The ability to predict which clips individuals viewed depends on the relationship of the EEG response across subjects and the nature in which this information is aggregated. We conceived of three approaches for aggregating responses, i.e. three assignment algorithms, which we evaluated in Experiment 1A. The aggregate correlations algorithm generated the highest assignment accuracy (70.83% chance = 33.33%) and was selected as the assignment algorithm for the larger sample of individuals and clips within Experiment 1B. The overall assignment accuracy was 33.46% within Experiment 1B (chance = 06.25%), with accuracies ranging from 52.9% (Silver Linings Playbook) to 11.75% (Seinfeld) within individual clips. ISC's were significantly greater than zero for 15 out of 16 clips, and fluctuations within the delta frequency band (i.e. 0-4 Hz) primarily contributed to response similarities across subjects. Interestingly, there was insufficient evidence to indicate that individuals with greater similarities in clip preference demonstrate greater similarities in cortical responses, suggesting a lack of association between ISC and clip preference. Overall these results demonstrate the utility of using ISC's for prediction, and further characterize the relationship between ISC magnitudes and subjective reports.

Reduced susceptibility to induced seizures in the Neuroligin-3(R451C) mouse model of autism	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Autism; Mice; Epilepsy; Seizures; Tonic-clonic; Pentylenetetrazole	EEG ABNORMALITIES; EPILEPSY; MUTATIONS; MICE; PENTYLENETETRAZOLE; INHIBITION; INTERNEURONS; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY	Epilepsy is a common comorbidity in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and several gene mutations are associated with both of these disorders. In order to determine whether a point mutation in the gene for the synaptic protein, Neuroligin-3 (Nlgn3, R451C), identified in patients with ASD alters seizure susceptibility, we administered the proconvulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) to adult male Neuroligin-3(R451C) (NL3(R451C)) and wild type (WT) mice. It has previously been reported that NL3(R451C) mice show altered inhibitory GABAergic activity in brain regions relevant to epilepsy, including the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. PTZ administration induces absence-seizures at low dose, and generalised convulsive seizures at higher dose. Susceptibility to absence seizures was examined by analysing the frequency and duration of spike-and-wave discharge (SWD) events and accompanying motor seizure activity induced by subcutaneous administration of low dosage (20 or 30 mg/kg) PTZ. Susceptibility to generalised convulsive seizures was tested by measuring the response to high dosage (60 mg/kg) PTZ using a modified Racine scale. There was no change in the number of SWD events exhibited by NL3(R451C) compared to WT mice following administration of both 20 mg/kg PTZ (1.17 1 +/- 0.31 compared to 16.0 +/- 11.16 events/30 min, NL3(R451C) versus WT, respectively) and 30 mg/kg PTZ (7.5 +/- 6.54 compared with 27.8 +/- 119.9 events/30 min, NL3(R451C) versus WT, respectively). NL3(R451C) mice were seizure resistant to generalised convulsive seizures induced by high dose PTZ compared to WT littermates (median latency to first >3 s duration clonic seizure; 14.5 min versus 7.25 min, 95% Cl: 1.625-2.375, p = 0.0009, NL3(R451C) versus WT, respectively). These results indicate that the R451C mutation in the Nlgn3 gene, associated with ASD in humans, confers resistance to induced seizures, suggesting dysfunction of PTZ-sensitive GABAergic signalling in this mouse model of ASD.

Using language comprehension as a test case, the present study aimed to dissociate age-related changes in prediction generation versus internal model adaptation following a prediction error. Event related brain potentials (ERPs) were measured in a group of older adults (60-81 years; n = 40) as they read sentences of the form "The opposite of black is white/yellow/nice." Replicating previous work in young adults, results showed a target related P300 for the expected antonym ("white"; an effect assumed to reflect a prediction match), and a graded N400 effect for the two incongruous conditions (i.e. a larger N400 amplitude for the incongruous continuation not related to the expected antonym, "nice," versus the incongruous associated condition, "yellow"). These effects were followed by a late positivity, again with a larger amplitude in the incongruous non-associated versus incongruous associated condition. Analyses using linear mixed-effects models showed that the target-related P300 effect and the N400 effect for the incongruous non-associated condition were both modulated by age, thus suggesting that age related changes affect both prediction generation and model adaptation. However, effects of age were outweighed by the interindividual variability of ERP responses, as reflected in the high proportion of variance captured by the inclusion of by condition random slopes for participants and items. We thus argue that at both a neurophysiological and a functional level the notion of general differences between language processing in young and older adults may only be of limited use, and that future research should seek to better understand the causes of interindividual variability in the ERP responses of older adults and its relation to cognitive performance.

This brought to notice an unexpected within individual topographic similarity between task conditions, despite our original interest in task-related differences. A recent related work explored the quantification of the similarity in beta topography between largely differing tasks. In this article, we used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the decomposition of beta activity from a visual attention task, and compared it with quiet resting, recorded by 128-channel EEG in 62 subjects. We statistically tested whether each ICA component obtained in one condition could be explained by a linear regression model based on the topographic patterns from the other condition, in each individual. Results were coherent with the previous report, showing a high topographic similarity between conditions. From an average of 12 beta component maps obtained for each task, over 80% were satisfactorily explained by the complementary task. Once more, the component maps including those considered unexplained, putatively "task-specific", had their scalp distribution and estimated cortical sources highly variable across subjects. These findings are discussed along with other studies based on individual data and the present fMRI results, reinforcing the increasingly accepted view that individual variability in sets of active neocortical association areas is not noise, but intrinsic to cortical physiology. Actual 'noise', mainly stemming from group "brain averaging" and the emphasis on statistical differences as opposed to similarities, may explain the overall hardship in replication of the vast literature on supposed task-specific forms of activity, and the ever inconclusive status of a universal functional mapping of cortical association areas. A new hypothesis, that individuals may use the same idiosyncratic sets of areas, at least by their fraction of activity in the sub-delta and beta range, in various non-sensory-motor forms of conscious activities, is a corollary of the discussed variability.

In particular, the issue of temporal orienting of attention in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease has been overlooked. The present research aimed to explore whether subtle deficits of cortical activation are present in these patients early in the course of the disease. We studied the upper-alpha event-related synchronization/desynchronization phenomenon during a paradigm of temporal orientation of attention. MCI patients (n = 27) and healthy elderly controls (n = 15) performed a task in which periodically omitted tones had to be predicted and their virtual onset time had to be marked by pressing a button. Single-trial responses were measured, respectively, before and after the motor response. Then, upper-alpha responses were compared to upper-alpha power during eyes-closed resting state. The time course of the task was characterized by two different behavioral conditions: (1) a pre-event epoch, in which the subject awaited the virtual onset of the omitted tone, (2) a post-event epoch (after button pressing), in which the subject was in a post-motor response condition. The principal findings are: (1) during the waiting epoch, only healthy elderly had an upper-alpha ERD at the level of both temporal and posterior brain regions; (2) during the post-motor epoch, the aMCI patients had a weaker upper-alpha ERS on prefrontal regions; (3) only healthy elderly showed a laterality effect: (a) during the waiting epoch, the upper-alpha ERD was greater at the level of the right posterior-temporal lead; during the post-motor epoch, the upper alpha ERS was greater on the left prefrontal lead. The relevance of these findings is that the weaker upper-alpha response observed in aMCI patients is evident even if the accuracy of the behavioral performance (i.e., button pressing) is still spared. This abnormal upper-alpha response might represent an early biomarker of the attention-executive network impairment in MCI due to Alzheimer's disease.

The frequency of hippocampal theta rhythm is modulated on a circadian period and is entrained by food availability	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hippocampus; theta; food entrainable oscillator; episodic memory; circadian rhythm	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; EPISODIC MEMORY; PLACE UNITS; PHASE-SHIFT; TIME CELLS; LEPTIN; CA1; ANXIETY	The hippocampal formation plays a critical role in the generation of episodic memory. While the encoding of the spatial and contextual components of memory have been extensively studied, how the hippocampus encodes temporal information, especially at long time intervals, is less well understood. The activity of place cells in hippocampus has previously been shown to be modulated at a circadian time-scale, entrained by a behavioral stimulus, but not entrained by light. The experimental procedures used in the previous study of this phenomenon, however, necessarily conflated two alternative entraining stimuli, the exposure to the recording environment and the availability of food, making it impossible to distinguish between these possibilities. Here we demonstrate that the frequency of theta-band hippocampal EEG varies with a circadian period in freely moving animals and that this periodicity mirrors changes in the firing rate of hippocampal neurons. Theta activity serves, therefore, as a proxy of circadianmodulated hippocampal neuronal activity. We then demonstrate that the frequency of hippocampal theta driven by stimulation of the reticular formation also varies with a circadian period. Because this effect can be observed without having to feed the animal to encourage movement we were able to identify what stimulus entrains the circadian oscillation. We show that with reticular activated recordings started at various times of the day the frequency of theta varies quasi-sinusoidally with a 25 h period and phase-aligned when referenced to the animal's regular feeding time, but not the recording start time Furthermore, we show that theta frequency consistently varied with a circadian period when the data obtained from repeated recordings started at various times of the day were referenced to the start of food availability in the recording chamber. This pattern did not occur when data were referenced to the start of the recording session or to the actual time of day when this was not also related to feeding time. This double dissociation demonstrates that hippocampal theta is modulated with a circadian timescale, and that this modulation is strongly entrained by food. One interpretation of this finding is that the hippocampus is responsive to a food entrainable oscillator (FEO) that might modulate foraging behavior over circadian periods.	[Munn, Robert G.

In addition to chronic stress in social and work environments, physical and chemical exposures at home, at work, and during leisure activities are causal or contributing environmental stressors that deserve attention by the general practitioner as well as by all other members of the health care community. It seems certainly necessary now to take "new exposures" like electromagnetic field (EMF) into account. Physicians are increasingly confronted with health problems from unidentified causes. Studies, empirical observations, and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. Individual susceptibility and environmental factors are frequently neglected. New wireless technologies and applications have been introduced without any certainty about their health effects, raising new challenges for medicine and society. For instance, the issue of so-called non-thermal effects and potential long-term effects of low-dose exposure were scarcely investigated prior to the introduction of these technologies. Common EMF sources include Wi-Fi access points, routers and clients, cordless and mobile phones including their base stations, Bluetooth devices, ELF magnetic fields from net currents, ELF electric fields from electric lamps and wiring close to the bed and office desk. On the one hand, there is strong evidence that long-term-exposure to certain EMF exposures is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer's disease and male infertility. On the other hand, the emerging electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities, disability administrators and case workers, politicians, as well as courts of law. We recommend treating EHS clinically as part of the group of chronic multisystem illnesses (CMI) leading to a functional impairment (EHS), but still recognizing that the underlying cause remains the environment. In the beginning, EHS symptoms often occur only occasionally, but over time they may increase in frequency and severity. Common EHS symptoms include headaches, concentration difficulties, sleeping problems, depression, lack of energy, fatigue and flu-like symptoms. A comprehensive medical history, which should include all symptoms and their occurrences in spatial and temporal terms and in the context of EMF exposures, is the key to the diagnosis. The EMF exposure can be assessed by asking for typical sources like Wi-Fi access points, routers and clients, cordless and mobile phones and measurements at home and at work. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure, that is, reducing or eliminating all sources of EMF at home and in the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools, hospitals, public transport, and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). If a detrimental EMF exposure is reduced sufficiently, the body has a chance to recover and EHS symptoms will be reduced or even disappear. Many examples have shown that such measures can prove effective. Also the survival rate of children with leukemia depends on ELF magnetic field exposure at home. To increase the effectiveness of the treatment, the broad range of other environmental factors that contribute to the total body burden should also be addressed. Anything that supports a balanced homeostasis will increase a person's resilience against disease and thus against the adverse effects of EMF exposure. There is increasing evidence that EMF exposure has a major impact on the oxidative and nitrosative regulation capacity in affected individuals. This concept also may explain why the level of susceptibility to EMF can change and why the number of symptoms reported in the context of EMF exposures is so large. Based on our current understanding, a treatment approach that minimizes the adverse effects of peroxynitrite - as has been increasingly used in the treatment of multisystem disorders - works best. This EMF Guideline gives an overview of the current knowledge regarding EMF-related health risks and provides concepts for the diagnosis and treatment and accessibility measures of EHS to improve and restore individual health outcomes as well as for the development of strategies for prevention.

In studies, estimates of the number of individuals with focal epilepsy who do not become seizure-free despite optimal drug therapy vary according to the age of the participants and which focal epilepsies are included, but have been reported as at least 20% and in some studies up to 70%. If the epileptogenic zone can be located surgical resection offers the chance of a cure with a corresponding increase in quality of life. Objectives The primary objective is to assess the overall outcome of epilepsy surgery according to evidence from randomised controlled trials. The secondary objectives are to assess the overall outcome of epilepsy surgery according to non-randomised evidence and to identify the factors that correlate to remission of seizures postoperatively. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid) (2001 to 4 July 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for relevant trials up to 4 July 2013. Selection criteria Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies or case series, with either a prospective and/or retrospective design, including at least 30 participants, a well-defined population (age, sex, seizure type/frequency, duration of epilepsy, aetiology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis, surgical findings), an MRI performed in at least 90% of cases and an expected duration of follow-up of at least one year, and reporting an outcome relating to postoperative seizure control. Data collection and analysis Three groups of two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed study quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. Outcomes were proportion of participants achieving a good outcome according to the presence or absence of each prognostic factor of interest. We intended to combine data with risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals. Main results We identified 177 studies (16,253 participants) investigating the outcome of surgery for epilepsy. Four studies were RCTs (including one that randomised participants to surgery or medical treatment). The risk of bias in the RCTs was unclear or high, limiting our confidence in the evidence that addressed the primary review objective. Most of the remaining 173 non-randomised studies had a retrospective design; they were of variable size, were conducted in a range of countries, recruited a wide demographic range of participants, used a wide range of surgical techniques and used different scales used to measure outcomes. We performed quality assessment using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool and determined that most studies provided moderate or weak evidence. For 29 studies reporting multivariate analyses we used the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool and determined that very few studies were at low risk of bias across the domains. In terms of freedom from seizures, one RCT found surgery to be superior to medical treatment, two RCTs found no statistically significant difference between anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) with or without corpus callosotomy or between 2.5 cm or 3.5 cm ATL resection, and one RCT found total hippocampectomy to be superior to partial hippocampectomy. We judged the evidence from the four RCTs to be of moderate to very low quality due to the lack of information reported about the randomised trial design and the restricted study populations. Of the 16,253 participants included in this review, 10,518 (65%) achieved a good outcome from surgery; this ranged across studies from 13.5% to 92.5%. Overall, we found the quality of data in relation to the recording of adverse events to be very poor. In total, 118 studies examined between one and eight prognostic factors in univariate analysis. We found the following prognostic factors to be associated with a better post-surgical seizure outcome: an abnormal pre-operative MRI, no use of intracranial monitoring, complete surgical resection, presence of mesial temporal sclerosis, concordance of pre-operative MRI and electroencephalography (EEG), history of febrile seizures, absence of focal cortical dysplasia/malformation of cortical development, presence of tumour, right-sided resection and presence of unilateral interictal spikes. We found no evidence that history of head injury, presence of encephalomalacia, presence of vascular malformation or presence of postoperative discharges were prognostic factors of outcome. We observed variability between studies for many of our analyses, likely due to the small study sizes with unbalanced group sizes, variation in the definition of seizure outcome, definition of the prognostic factor and the influence of the site of surgery, all of which we observed to be related to postoperative seizure outcome. Twenty-nine studies reported multivariable models of prognostic factors and the direction of association of factors with outcome was generally the same as found in the univariate analyses. However, due to the different multivariable analysis approaches and selective reporting of results, meaningful comparison of multivariate analysis with univariate meta-analysis is difficult. Authors' conclusions The study design issues and limited information presented in the included studies mean that our results provide limited evidence to aid patient selection for surgery and prediction of likely surgical outcome. Future research should be of high quality, have a prospective design, be appropriately powered and focus on specific issues related to diagnostic tools, the site-specific surgical approach and other issues such as the extent of resection. Prognostic factors related to the outcome of surgery should be investigated via multivariable statistical regression modelling, where variables are selected for modelling according to clinical relevance and all numerical results of the prognostic models are fully reported. Protocols should include pre- and postoperative measures of speech and language function, cognition and social functioning along with a mental state assessment. Journal editors should not accept papers where adverse events from a medical intervention are not recorded. Improvements in the development of cancer care over the past three to four decades have been achieved by answering well-defined questions through the conduct of focused RCTs in a step-wise fashion. The same approach to surgery for epilepsy is required.
