Furthermore, single-trial analysis of EEG is believed to show more realistic pictures of ongoing and event-related activities of the brain with millisecond resolution. Here, we present a nonparametric multiple change-point detection and estimation method for analysis of single-trial EEG recorded during auditory and visual oddball tasks. In a simple attention task like oddball, the frontal cortex of the brain is responsible for distinguishing and responding appropriately to target and standard events. With sub-second resolution at the frontal cortex, we show that the alpha-band activity changes according to "inhibition timing" hypothesis and the beta-band activity is in line with "maintaining the status quo" hypothesis.

There are coherent activities in brain not only seen during explicit tasks but also during rest. This article aims to investigate the Wavelet based Phase coherence of oscillations of eye closed and eye open signals during resting states. The wavelet coherence is computed for selected 19 electrodes according to 10-20 system from 129 channel EEG signals. The significance was obtained using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and pairwise wavelet coherence was computed for each possible combination. The Wavelet Phase Coherence using Wavelet Transform gives significantly high results (P<0.05) in EC and EO signals during resting states in frequency interval 0.5-50 Hz overall as well as in the band intervals such as delta (05-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), beta (13-22 Hz) and gamma (22-50 Hz).

EEG is a measurement tool to measure electrical activity generated by translating chemical variation in brain into voltage. EEG signals are measured with multi-electrode placed at properly localized part of the brain with either intracranial or Scalp EEG method. EEG (Electroencephalograph) analysis has become very important to detect various human diseases. The most important and simple aspect in processing EEG signals is to use time frequency analysis for possible diagnosis. Advanced methods of spectral analysis can extract new information encompassed in EEG signals by means of specific parameters. The EEG analysis plays very important role in feature extraction of EEG signal for detecting and predicting various brain diseases. The main objective of this paper is to study time-frequency analysis of EEG signal and compare their performances.

Sleep-wake architecture and time-frequency parameters of EEG were analyzed during drowsiness and sleep in WAG/Rij rats with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy. The incidence of seizures varied in a group of 10 rats, in which 5 individuals did not develop epileptic discharges in their EEG (asymptomatic rats). In contrast to asymptomatic, symptomatic subjects (1) displayed less percentage of wakefulness EEG pattern and more non-REM sleep, (2) showed higher beta and less delta EEG power in frontal cortex during non-REM sleep. Mid-frequency oscillations, such as sleep spindles and 5-9 Hz oscillations, were detected in EEG automatically and underwent time-frequency analysis by means of skeletons of wavelet surfaces. Some mid-frequency oscillations showed "complex" frequency structure, consisting of the dominant and subdominant components. "Complex" sleep spindles more frequently appeared in asymptomatic rats than in symptomatic, whereas the dominant frequency of these spindles in symptomatic rats was higher than in asymptomatic (12.7 vs 11.9 Hz). In general, low-frequency components were readily integrated in sleep spindles in asymptomatic WAG/Rij rats, and decrease in number of "complex" sleep spindles may be associated with epileptic phenotype.

The visual review of HFOs on intracerebral electroencephalography is time consuming and tedious, and it can be improved by time-frequency (TF) analysis. The main issue is that the signal is dominated by lower frequencies that mask the HFOs. Our aim was to flatten (i.e., whiten) the frequency spectrum to enhance the fast oscillations while preserving an optimal signal to noise ratio (SNR). Method: We investigated eight methods of data whitening based on either prewhitening or TF normalization in order to improve the detectability of HFOs. We detected all local maxima of the TF image above a range of thresholds in the HFO band. Results: We obtained the precision and recall curves at different SNR and for different HFO types and illustrate the added value of whitening both in the TF plane and in time domain. Conclusion: The normalization strategies based on a baseline and on our proposed method (the "H-0 z-score") are more precise than the others. Significance: The H-0 z-score provides an optimal framework for representing and detecting HFOs, independent of a baseline and a priori frequency bands.

Alper			Emotion Recognition with Eigen Features of Frequency Band Activities Embedded in Induced Brain Oscillations Mediated by Affective Pictures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain oscillations; gamma band activity; emotional state; data mining	SINGULAR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; FUZZY SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; EEG-BASED DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET METHODOLOGY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; SLEEP EEG; GAMMA; AROUSAL; CLASSIFICATION; FRACTALITY	In this study, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) has been used for the first time in order to extract emotional features from well-defined electroencephalography (EEG) frequency band activities (BAs) so-called delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-16Hz), beta (16-32Hz), gamma (32-64Hz). These five BAs were estimated by applying sixth-level multi-resolution wavelet decomposition (MRWD) with Daubechies wavelets (db-8) to single channel nonaveraged emotional EEG oscillations of 6 s for each scalp location over 16 recording sites (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, C3, C4, P3, P4, T3, T4, T5, T6, O1, O2). Every trial was mediated by different emotional stimuli which were selected from international affective picture system (IAPS) to induce emotional states such as pleasant (P), neutral (N), and unpleasant (UP). Largest principal components (PCs) of BAs were considered as emotional features and data mining approaches were used for the first time in order to classify both three different (P, N, UP) and two contrasting (P and UP) emotional states for 30 healthy controls. Emotional features extracted from gamma BAs (GBAs) for 16 recording sites provided the high classification accuracies of 87.1% and 100% for classification of three emotional states and two contrasting emotional states, respectively. In conclusion, we found the followings: (1) Eigenspectra of high frequency BAs in EEG are highly sensitive to emotional hemispheric activations, (2) emotional states are mostly mediated by GBA, (3) pleasant pictures induce the higher cortical activation in contrast to unpleasant pictures, (4) contrasting emotions induce opposite cortical activations, (5) cognitive activities are necessary for an emotion to occur.

The aim of this review is to describe lithium-induced EEG changes in bipolar disorder and to discuss potential underlying factors. A literature survey about lithium-induced EEG changes in bipolar disorder was performed. Lithium consistently enhances magnitudes of brain oscillations in slow frequencies ( delta and theta) in both resting-state EEG studies as well as event-related oscillations studies. Enhancement of magnitudes of beta oscillations is specific to event-related oscillations. Correlation between serum lithium levels and brain oscillations has been reported. Lithium-induced changes in brain oscillations might correspond to lithium-induced alterations in neurotransmitters, signaling cascades, plasticity, brain structure, or biophysical properties of lithium. Therefore, lithium-induced changes in brain oscillations could be promising biomarkers to assess the molecular mechanisms leading to variability in efficacy. Since the variability of lithium response in bipolar disorder is due to the genetic differences in the mechanisms involving lithium, it would be highly promising to assess the lithium-induced EEG changes as biomarkers in genetic studies.

Here we studied the relation between ictal and interictal spike-wave discharges (SWDs) and electroencephalography (EEG) gamma oscillatory activity (30-60 Hz) in patients with IGE. Methods: EEG recordings were obtained of 14 children with IGE (mean age, 8.5 +/- 5 years) and 14 age-and sex-matched controls. Time-frequency analysis of each seizure and seizure-free control epochs was performed and cross-coherences of neocortical gamma oscillations were calculated to describe interictal and ictal characteristics of generalized seizures. Results: SWDs were characterized with an abrupt increase of oscillatory activity of 34 and 13-60 Hz, peaking at 3-4 and 30-60 Hz, and with a simultaneous decrease in the 8-12 Hz frequency band. The rise in EEG gamma oscillations was short-lasting and decreased before activity declined at lower frequency ranges. Compared to control patients, patients with epilepsy also showed higher interictal values of mean coherence of gamma activity, but this interictal increase was not significant after post hoc analysis. Significance: Our data support the hypothesis that gamma oscillatory activity increase concomitantly with rises in activity of lower EEG frequencies during absence seizures and that the activity starts to cease earlier than lower EEG frequencies. The data did not support a change in gamma activity preceding the 3-4 Hz SWDs. SWDs are hypothetically generated by the synchronous interaction between the thalamus and the cortex, whereas the production of gamma activity is the result of activity in local inhibitory networks. Thus, the modification of SWD by gamma activity may be understood in terms of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms involved.

Identification of HFOs in magnetoencephalography (MEG) is hindered by noise. Computing spatial filters using beamforming to reconstruct time series for selected brain regions, so-called virtual sensors (VS), can increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We identified HFOs in MEG in time domain using VS. Methods: Fifteen minutes of MEG data were selected from 12 patients. VS were placed around the epileptic spikes (affected region) and in the contralateral hemisphere. VS and physical sensors were reviewed for HFOs and spikes. HFO locations were compared to spikes and other clinical parameters. Results: Eight patients showed 78 time points with 575 HFOs in VS, 513 were in the affected region. HFOs could not be identified in physical sensors for 61 of the 78 VS time points. HFOs overlapped with presumed epileptogenic areas and were also visible in unfiltered VS signals. Conclusion: Beamformer-based VS analysis can help to identify epileptic HFOs that are not discernable in physical MEG sensors. Significance: This approach can be extended to enable localization of non-invasively recorded HFOs. This would help surgical planning and reduce the need for invasive diagnostics.

By contrast, less attention has been paid to which processes uniquely contribute to each modality. The present study investigated the neuronal oscillations that enable a subject to process pain and touch as well as to evaluate the intensity of both modalities by means of Electroencephalography. Nineteen healthy subjects were asked to rate the intensity of each stimulus at single trial level. By computing Linear mixed effects models (LME) encoding of both modalities was explored by relating stimulus intensities to brain responses. While the intensity of single touch trials is encoded only by theta activity, pain perception is encoded by theta, alpha and gamma activity. Beta activity in the tactile domain shows an on/off like characteristic in response to touch which was not observed in the pain domain. Our results enhance recent findings pointing to the contribution of different neuronal oscillations to the processing of nociceptive and tactile stimuli.

Methods: 64-channel EEG data and surface electromyographic (sEMG) data were recorded from 25 neurologically-healthy adults during swallowing and tongue-tapping. Events were demarcated so that sensorimotor activity primarily from the pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing could be compared to activity resulting from tongue tapping. Results: Independent component analysis identified bilateral clusters of sensorimotor mu components localized to the premotor and primary motor cortices as well as an infrahyoid myogenic cluster. Subsequent event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) analyses showed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the spectral power in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) frequency bands of the mu clusters in both tasks. Mu ERD was stronger during swallowing when compared to tongue tapping (pFDR < .05) and the differences in sensorimotor processing between conditions was greater in the right hemisphere than the left, suggesting stronger right hemisphere lateralization for swallowing than tongue-tapping. Conclusion: Mu activity was interpreted as representing a normal feed forward and feedback driven sensorimotor loop during the later stages of swallowing. Significance: Results support further use of this novel neuroimaging technique to concurrently map neural and muscle activity during swallowing in clinical populations using EEG.

To improve the classification accuracy, discriminant features were selected based on Fisher score among EEG frequency bands and electrodes. Especially, the time-frequency representation with Morlet wavelet transforms showed clear differences in gamma, beta, and alpha band powers at frontocentral area, and theta band power at centroparietal area. The best classification accuracy of 75.5% was obtained by a support vector machine classifier with the gamma band features at frontocentral area. This result may enable a new intelligent user-interface which understands users' implicit intention, i.e., unexpressed or hidden intention.

The current work aimed to confirm this age related difference in response to emotional stimuli of diverse intensities by examining Electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory power in time-frequency analysis. Methods: Time-frequency analyses were performed on the EEG data recorded for highly negative (HN), moderately negative (MN) and Neutral pictures in 20 adolescents and 20 adults during a covert emotional task. The results showed a significant age by emotion interaction effect in the theta and beta oscillatory power during the 500-600 ms post stimulus. Results: Adolescents showed significantly less pronounced theta synchronization (ERS, 5.5-7.5 Hz) for HN stimuli, and larger beta desynchronization (ERD; 18-20 Hz) for both HN and MN stimuli, in comparison with neutral stimuli. By contrast, adults exhibited no significant emotion effects in theta and beta frequency bands. In addition, the analysis of the alpha spectral power (10.5-12 Hz; 850-950 ms) showed a main effect of emotion, while the emotion by age interaction was not significant. Irrespective of adolescents or adults, HN and MN stimuli elicited enhanced alpha suppression compared to Neutral stimuli, while the alpha power was similar across HN and MN conditions. Conclusions: These results confirmed prior findings that adolescents are more sensitive to emotionally negative stimuli compared to adults, regardless of emotion intensity, possibly due to the developing prefrontal control system during adolescence.

Though a few people have devoted their efforts to exploring its nonlinear nature from the perspective of manifold learning, they hardly take into full account both time-frequency feature and nonlinear nature. To obtain features that can fully describe the information from a nonlinear nature and time-frequency perspective of MI-EEG, a novel feature extraction method is proposed based on the Locally Linear Embedding algorithm (LLE) and DWT. The multi-scale multi-resolution analysis is implemented for MI-EEG with DWT, and the valid time and frequency windows are determined in advance by a Wigner-Ville distribution. In view of the nonlinear structure in MI-EEG, LLE is applied to the approximation components to obtain the nonlinear features, and the statistics of the detail components are calculated to obtain the time-frequency features. After an organic combination of the two features, a Back-Propagation neural network optimized by a Genetic Algorithm was employed as a classifier to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method. Compared with conventional DWT-based methods, the proposed method has a better effect on feature visualization with an obvious clustering distribution and improves the classification results and their stability. This paper successfully achieves manifold learning in signal processing of EEG.

This paper concentrates on specific neural oscillations that can be observed in EEG signals which are delta (1.0 - 4.0 Hz) and beta (12.0 - 25.0 Hz) during problem solving task. Our aim is to investigate the role of the delta and beta neural oscillations during problem solving task at cortical area as compared to resting state (i.e. eyes open) using EEG. Eight volunteered healthy right-handed male students were recruited in this study. EEG 128-channel Hydro-Cel Geodesic (EGI Inc.)system was used in this study for data collection, but only 19 channels were used for data analysis. EEG recordings were taken during problem solving task (i.e. Raven's Advanced ProgressiveMatric (RAPM)) and during resting state (eyes open). Results showed that delta was significantly higher in almost all brain region and beta was significantly higher at prefrontal region only. Since we aim to investigate the role of delta and beta oscillation during problem solving, further investigation needs to be done with greater number of subjects in order to have more significant result to support this study. Further investigation could also help in finding quantitative indicators for intelligent assessment using brain signals.

Any tool that has the potential to restore abnormal brain oscillations is therefore beneficial to patients with neuropsychiatric illnesses. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is one such tool. It is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, which is able to alter brain oscillations depending on its parameters of stimulation and is used in clinical setting because of its potential therapeutic effects on the brain. However, the optimum stimulation parameters to induce the therapeutic effect of rTMS remains elusive. Therefore, it is important to investigate the differential effects between high versus low frequency of magnetic stimulation on the mechanism of brain oscillations in human subjects. Here we show, using combined rTMS and surface electroencephalography (EEG) that low and high frequencies of magnetic stimulation would induce dichotomy effects in EEG brain oscillatory activity. In particular, high-frequency rTMS 10Hz induces a synchronised oscillations for theta brain rhythm. In contrast, low-frequency rTMS 1Hz desynchronises neural oscillations on the same brain rhythm. Taken together, our results show that the desynchronisation effect of low-frequency rTMS 1Hz may potentially reverse the interference of altered neural oscillations. More extensive basic and clinical research using combined rTMS and EEG are needed to determine the optimum parameters of rTMS stimulation to restore adequate neural oscillations.

Cross-modal spatial attention causes a distortion of sound localization, although the neural basis of the effect remains an unanswered question. We hypothesized that top-down and bottom-up visual-spatial attention causes the ventriloquism effect with different modulations of ongoing neural oscillation. To test this hypothesis, human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) was measured during a sound localization task. Top-down attention suppressed the EEG amplitude in the alpha frequency (10 Hz) over the contralateral temporal electrode sites to visual cue hemifields. Bottom-up attention shifted the EEG phase to the theta frequency (7 Hz), rather than suppressing the amplitude.

CAP is a sleep phenomenon composed by consecutive sequences of A-phases (each A-phase could belong to a possible group A1, A2 or A3) observed during the non-REM sleep. Each A-phase is separated by a B-phase which has the basal frequency of the EEG during a specific sleep stage. The patterns formed by these sequences reflect the sleep instability and consequently help to understand the sleep process. Ten recordings from healthy good sleepers were included in this study. The current study investigates complexity, statistical and frequency signal properties of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings at the transitions: B-phase-A-phase. In addition, classification between the onset-offset of the A-phases and B-phase was carried out with a kNN classifier. The results showed that EEG signal presents significant differences (p < 0.05) between A-phases and B-phase for the standard deviation, energy, sample entropy, Tsallis entropy and frequency band indices. The A-phase onset showed values of energy three times higher than B-phase at all the sleep stages. The statistical analysis of variance shows that more than 80 % of the A-phase onset and offset is significantly different from the B-phase. The classification performance between onset or offset of A-phases and background showed classification values over 80 % for specificity and accuracy and 70 % for sensitivity. Only during the A3-phase, the classification was lower. The results suggest that neural assembles that generate the basal EEG oscillations during sleep present an over-imposed coordination for a few seconds due to the A-phases. The main characteristics for automatic separation between the onset-offset A-phase and the B-phase are the energy at the different frequency bands.

TMS-EEG is a newly emerging tool for probing neural dynamics by giving a perturbation to ongoing neural oscillations. Indeed, our previous TMS-EEG studies have shown that TMS can induce phase resetting of ongoing neural oscillations locally and globally in human brain networks. We propose a possible mechanistic account for the TMS-induced phase resetting of neural oscillations. We also discuss evidence that TMS-EEG can probe distinct modes of neural dynamics and switching between the modes in the human brain.

The epilepsy diseases can be determined with observing the main properties of before and on-time seizure signals in time and frequency domain. Physicians are evaluating the results after some necessary scoring on EEG records. However, this evaluation is specialistic, time consuming processes and also may subjective results. At this point, to allow detection of epilepsy diseases, a decision support system can give more objective results to the physicians for diagnosing. The subject of the study is automatically diagnosing the epilepsy diseases on EEG signals. In the proposed study, analyses of EEG signals in time and frequency domain were done and features of diseases were obtained. As a result, using artificial neural network (ANN) and obtained features, a decision support system is realized to diagnose the epilepsy. The specificity and the sensitivity of the algorithm are 94% and 66% respectively.

Using a research-grade EEG acquisition system, we acquired 64-channel EEG recordings from three volunteers performing several cognitive, sensory, and motor tasks in both LSBB and hospital settings. Time-frequency analysis on the signals acquired in both environments reveals that the task-induced increase in gamma band (> 30 Hz) energy relative to the resting state EEG is more prominent in signals acquired at LSBB, suggesting that task-specific changes in EEG are better reflected and more readily detected in signals acquired at LSBB. These results further demonstrate the potential value of low-noise settings such as the LSBB for conducting challenging high-frequency EEG studies.

Studies have shown that EEG-based seizure detection is very difficult for a specific epileptic population with intellectual disability due to the cerebral development disorders. In this work, a seizure detection method based on dynamic warping (DW) is proposed for patients with intellectual disability. It uses an EEG template of an individual subject's dominant seizure type, to extract the morphological features from EEG signals. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier is used to perform the seizure detection. Results show that the DW-based feature in the frequency domain is superior than that in the time domain, and the features extracted using wavelet transform method.	[Wang, Lei; Arends, Johan B. A.

Methods: In 14 ABPE patients with methylprednisolone treatment, we measured interictal HFOs and spikes during sleep in pre- and post-methylprednisolone scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) were taken as control. Results: Before methylprednisolone treatment, 10/14 ABPE patients had HFOs, with a mean value of 85.79 per 60 s per patient, while 2/14 BECTS patients had HFOs with a mean value of 1.86 per 60 s per patient (p = 0.006). The 10 ABPE patients with HFOs tended to have more frequent epileptic negative myoclonus/atypical absences than the other 4 ABPE patients without HFOs. Rates reduced by methylprednisolone treatment were statistically significant for both spikes (p = 0.027) and HFOs (p = 0.005). The percentage of reduction was 41.8% (4653/11,133) and 95% (1141/1202) for spikes and HFOs, respectively. Conclusion: Proportion and rates of HFOs in ABPE were more prevalent than in BECTS. HFO rates reduced by methylprednisolone treatment might be more significant than spike rates. Significance: Prevalence of HFOs reflected at least some aspect of epileptic severity of ABPE. HFOs were more sensitive to methylprednisolone treatment than spikes. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A wide range of interventions have been developed that aim to promote motor recovery in affected persons. High-intensity and task-specific training protocols show promising results. A better understanding of brain functioning in the context of motor learning and motor control may help to further improve rehabilitation outcome. Mobile brain imaging has brought advances that led to the development of models that characterize different aspects of the cortical involvement in movement. We are interested in translating those findings into online applications and lay a basis for novel rehabilitation interventions. In this paper, we use a model of gait consisting of two parameters: The state of walking (compared to upright standing) and the dynamics of the movement, i.e. the gait cadence. To this end, we perform mobile electroencephalography (EEG) measurements combined with inverse brain imaging and time-frequency analyses optimized for online application.

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) holds the promise to elucidate the causal link between specific frequencies of oscillatory brain activity and cognitive processes. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recording during tACS would offer an opportunity to directly explore immediate neurophysiological effects of tACS. However, it is not trivial to measure EEG signals during tACS, as tACS creates a huge artifact in EEG data. Here we explain how to set up concurrent tACS-EEG experiments. Two necessary considerations for successful EEG recording while applying tACS are highlighted. First, bridging of the tACS and EEG electrodes via leaking EEG gel immediately saturates the EEG amplifier. To avoid bridging via gel, the viscosity of the EEG gel is the most important parameter. The EEG gel must be viscous to avoid bridging, but at the same time sufficiently fluid to create contact between the tACS electrode and the scalp. Second, due to the large amplitude of the tACS artifact, it is important to consider using an EEG system with a high resolution analog-todigital (A/D) converter. In particular, the magnitude of the tACS artifact can exceed 100 mV at the vicinity of a stimulation electrode when 1 mA tACS is applied. The resolution of the A/D converter is of importance to measure good quality EEG data from the vicinity of the stimulation site. By following these guidelines for the procedures and technical considerations, successful concurrent EEG recording during tACS will be realized.

Given the global initiatives in mapping the human brain, recognition of the utility of this technique is growing across neuroscience disciplines. Importantly, TMS-EEG offers translational biomarkers that can be applied in health and disease, across the lifespan, and in humans and animals, bridging the gap between animal models and human studies. However, to utilize the full potential of TMS-EEG methodology, standardization of TMS-EEG study protocols is needed. In this article, we review the principles of TMS-EEG methodology, factors impacting TMS-EEG outcome measures, and the techniques for preventing and correcting artifacts in TMS-EEG data. To promote the standardization of this technique, we provide comprehensive guides for designing TMS-EEG studies and conducting TMS-EEG experiments. We conclude by reviewing the application of TMS-EEG in basic, cognitive and clinical neurosciences, and evaluate the potential of this emerging technology in brain research.

The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been applied to extract the time-frequency features of MI-EEG. However, the existing EEG classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and BP network, did not make full use of the time sequence information in time-frequency features, the resulting recognition performance were not very ideal. In this paper, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is integrated with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to yield a novel recognition method, denoted as DWT-LSTM. DWT is applied to analyze the each channel of MI-EEG and extract its effective wavelet coefficients, representing the time-frequency features. Then a LSTM based RNN is used as a classifier for the patten recognition of observed MI-EEG data. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset, and the 5-fold cross validation experimental results show that DWT-LSTM yields relatively higher classification accuracies compared to the existing approaches. This is helpful for the further research and application of RNN in processing of MI-EEG.

In this paper, Sample entropy(SampEn) was computed and represented as the nonlinear feature of motor imagery EEG signal for it can quantify the probability of new information appeared in time series. In addition, orthogonal empirical mode decomposition (OEMD) was also employed to extract the average energy of selected intrinsic mode functions(IMF) as the time-frequency feature for motor imagery EEG signal. Based on a public dataset, many experiments were conducted. Slide window was used to select the best time period for a better performance in feature extraction, and cross validation of 10 folds was applied in all the classification procedure. The highest recognition rate using SampEn and OEMD is respectively 86.07% and 83.21% classified by incremental support vector machine (ISVM) respectively. However, the highest classification rate of combined features is 86.79% by using ISVM which is a little higher than that of SampEn. Big linear correlation between SampEn and energy of IMF explains why the classification accuracy by combining the two types of features is not as high as expected.

While it is believed that speech motor adaptation under altered sensory feedback involves rapid reorganization of speech motor networks, the mechanisms by which different brain regions communicate and coordinate their activity to mediate adaptation remain unknown, and explanations of outcome differences in adaption remain largely elusive. In this study, under the paradigm of altered auditory feedback with continuous EEG recordings, the differential roles of oscillatory neural processes in motor speech adaptability were investigated. The predictive capacities of different EEG frequency bands were assessed, and it was found that theta-, beta-, and gamma-band activities during speech planning and production contained significant and reliable information about motor speech adaptability. It was further observed that these bands do not work independently but interact with each other suggesting an underlying brain network operating across hierarchically organized frequency bands to support motor speech adaptation. These results provide novel insights into both learning and disorders of speech using time frequency analysis of neural oscillations.

J	Li, MA; Luo, XY; Yang, JF				Li, Ming-ai; Luo, Xin-yong; Yang, Jin-fu			Extracting the nonlinear features of motor imagery EEG using parametric t-SNE	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Motor imagery electroencephalography; Discrete wavelet transform; Parametric t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding; Visualization	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS	When performing studies on brain computer interface based rehabilitation problems, researchers frequently encounter difficulty due to the curse of dimensionality and the nonlinear nature of Motor Imagery Electroencephalography (MI-EEG). Though many approaches have been proposed recently to address the feature extraction problem and have shown surprising performance, unfortunately, most of them are non-parametric or linear dimension reduction techniques, which are limited in utility for out of-sample extension for MI-EEG classification. To address the problem and obtain accurate MI-EEG features, a new unsupervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique termed parametric t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (P. t-SNE) is employed to extract the nonlinear features from MI-EEG. Considering that MI-EEG is a kind of non-stationary signal with remarkable time-frequency rhythmic distribution characteristics, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to extract the time frequency features of MI-EEG. Furthermore, P. t-SNE is applied to selected wavelet components to get the nonlinear features. They are then combined serially to construct the feature vector. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset, and the experimental results show that the nonlinear features have great visualization performance with obvious clustering distribution, and the feature extraction method indicates excellent classification performance as evaluated by a support vector machine classifier. This paper suggests a manifold based technique for further analysis and classification research of MI EEG. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the collected EEG signals are usually corrupted with artifacts which can seriously reduce the accuracy of the depth of anesthesia (DOA) monitors. In this paper, the main purpose is to compare five different EEG based anesthesia indices, namely median frequency (MF), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn) and permutation entropy (PeEn), for their artifacts rejection ability in order to measure the DOA accurately. The current analysis is based on synthesized EEG corrupted with four different types of artificial artifacts and real data collected from patients undergoing general anesthesia during surgery. The experimental results demonstrate that all indices could discriminate awake from anesthesia state (p < 0.05), however PeEn is superior to other indices. Furthermore, a combined index is obtained by applying these five indices as inputs to train, validate and test a feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) model with bispectral index (BIS) as target. The combined index via ANN offers more advantages with higher correlation of 0.80 +/- 0.01 for real time DOA monitoring in comparison with single indices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our laboratory previously showed that rat models of acute and neuropathic pain manifest increased power in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) recorded by electrocorticography (ECoG). In this study, we hypothesized that pain increases EEG power and corticocortical coherence in different rat models of pain, whereas treatments with clinically effective analgesics reverse these changes. Our results show increased cortical power over S1 and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in awake, freely behaving rat models of acute, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Coherence between PFC and S1 is increased at a late, but not early, time point during the development of neuropathic pain. Electroencephalography power is not affected by ibuprofen in the acute pain model. However, pregabalin and mexiletine reverse the changes in power and S1-PFC coherence in the inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. These data suggest that quantitative EEG might be a valuable predictor of pain and analgesia in rodents.

J	McLelland, D; Lavergne, L; VanRullen, R				McLelland, Douglas; Lavergne, Louisa; VanRullen, Rufin			The phase of ongoing EEG oscillations predicts the amplitude of peri-saccadic mislocalization	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; STABILITY; TIME; REPRESENTATION; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; NEURONS; CORTEX	Our constant eye movements mean that updating processes, such as saccadic remapping, are essential for the maintenance of a stable spatial representation of the world around us. It has been proposed that, rather than continually update a full spatiotopic map, only the location of a few key objects is updated, suggesting that the process is linked to attention. At the same time, mounting evidence links attention to oscillatory neuronal processes. We therefore hypothesized that updating processes should themselves show oscillatory characteristics, inherited from underlying attentional processes. To test this, we carried out a combined psychophysics and EEG experiment in human participants, using a saccadic mislocalization task as a behaviourally measureable proxy for spatial updating, and simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. We then used a time-frequency analysis to test for a correlation between oscillation phase and perceptual outcome. We found a significant phase-dependence of mislocalization in a time-frequency region from around 400 ms prior to saccade initiation and peaking at around 7 Hz, principally apparent over occipital electrodes. Thus the degree of perceived mislocalization is correlated with the phase of a theta-frequency oscillation prior to saccade onset.

Current electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring devices are very expensive and may not be feasible in rural areas. Because a seizure is nonstationary, composed of multiple frequencies, and difficult to acquire, visual and conventional frequency-based methods have limited application.Materials and Methods:One hundred healthy individuals at their best possible conscious state and 25 patients with an epileptic seizure a few hours prior to the time of recording were chosen. The recordings were carried at Shri Preethi Hospital and Nanda Engineering College, Tamilnadu, India, during the period of June 2014-December 2014. The primary objective was to differentiate the diseased from normal individuals, as well as quantifying the EEG signal and diagnosing remotely.Results:Using wavelet coefficients, the separation between seizure and nonseizure states was measured and compared with that of healthy individuals of different age groups. The systems performance was measured by parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, region of convergence, and precision rate.Conclusions:The novelty of this article lies in the design, development, and clinical analysis of a low-cost EEG device for remote diagnosis.

These problems have motivated the development of various automated seizure detection systems that can aid neurophysiologists in accurate diagnosis of epilepsy. The present study is focused on the development of a robust automated system for classification against low levels of supervised training. EEG data from two different repositories are considered for analysis and validation of the proposed system. The signals are decomposed into time-frequency sub bands till sixth level using dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). All details and last approximation coefficients are used to calculate features viz. energy, standard deviation, root-mean-square, Shannon entropy, mean values and maximum peaks. These feature sets are passed through a general regression neural network (GRNN) for classification with K-fold cross-validation scheme under varying train-to-test ratios. The current model yields ceiling level classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity & specificity) in all combinations of datasets (ictal vs non-ictal) in less than 0.028 s. The proposed scheme will not only maximize hit-rate and correct rejection rate but also will aid neurophysiologists in the fast and accurate diagnosis of seizure onset. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

EMD works well to decompose a time series into a set of intrinsic mode functions with specific frequency bands. An IMF therefore represents an intrinsic component on its correspondingly intrinsic frequency band. The word of 'intrinsic' means the frequency is totally adaptive to the nature of a signal. In this study, power density and nonlinearity are two critical parameters for characterizing the amplitude and frequency modulations in IMFs. In this study, a nonlinearity level is quantified using degree of waveform distortion (DWD), which represents the characteristic of waveform distortion as an assessment of the intra-wave modulation of an IMF. In the application of anesthesia EEG analysis, the assessments of power density and DWD for a set of IMFs represent dynamic responses in EEG caused by two different anesthesia agents, Ketamine and Alfentanil, on different frequency bands. Ketamine causes the increase of power density and the decrease of nonlinearity on gamma-band neuronal oscillation, which cannot be found EEG responses of group B using Alfentanil. Both agents cause an increase of power density and a decrease of nonlinearity on beta-band neuronal oscillation accompany with a loss of consciousness. Moreover, anesthesia agents cause the decreases of power density and nonlinearity (i.e. DWD) for the low-frequency IMFs.

The search for neural biomarkers of performance remains a challenge in movement science and sport psychology. The non-invasive nature of high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recording has made it a most promising avenue for providing quantitative feedback to practitioners and coaches. Here, we review the current relevance of the main types of EEG oscillations in order to trace a perspective for future practical applications of BEG and event-related potentials (ERP) in sport. In this context, the hypotheses of unified brain rhythms and continuity between wake and sleep states should provide a functional template for EEG biomarkers in sport. The oscillations in the thalamo-cortical and hippocampal circuitry including the physiology of the place cells and the grid cells provide a frame of reference for the analysis of delta, theta, beta, alpha (incl.mu), and gamma oscillations recorded in the space field of human performance. Based on recent neuronal models facilitating the distinction between the different dynamic regimes (selective gating and binding) in these different oscillations we suggest an integrated approach articulating together the classical biomechanical factors (3D movements and EMG) and the high-density EEG and ERP signals to allow finer mathematical analysis to optimize sport performance, such as microstates, coherency/directionality analysis and neural generators.

The FCMC analysis is an effective method to describe the information transfer and interaction in neuromuscular pathways. Forthermore, the multiscaled coherence analyses of EEG and EMG signals recorded simultaneously could describe the multiple spatial and temporal functional connection characteristics of FCMC, which could be helpful for understanding the multiple spatial and temporal coupling mechanism of neuromuscular system. In this paper, based on the adaptively decomposing signal into frequency band characteristis of variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the quantitatively detecting the directed exchange of information between two systems of transfer entropy (TE), a new method-variational mode decomposition-transfer entropy (VMD-TE) is proposed. The VMD-TE method could quantitatively analyze the nonlinear functional connection characteristic on multiple time-frequency scales between EEG over brain scalp and surface EMG signals from flexor digitorum surerficialis, which are recorded simultaneously during grip task with steady-state force output. In this paper, application of VMD-TE method consists of two steps. Firstly, the EEG and EMG signals are adaptively decomposed into multi intrinsic mode functions based on variational mode decomposition method, respectively, to describe the information on different time-frequency scales. Then the transfer entropies between the different time-frequency scales of EEG and EMG are calculated to describe the nonlinear corticomuscular coupling characteristic in different pathways (EEG -> EMG and EMG -> EEG), to show the functional coupling strength (namely VMD-TE values). finally, the maximum VMD-TE values between the different time-frequency scales of EEG and EMG signals among the eight subjects are selected, to describe the discrepancies of FCMC interaction strength between all time-frequency scales. The results show that functional corticomuscular coupling is significant in both descending (EEG -> EMG) and ascending (EMG -> EEG) directions in the beta-band (15-35 Hz) in the static force output stage. Meanwhile, the interaction strength between EEG signal and the gamma band (50-72 Hz) of EMG signal in descending direction is higher than in ascending direction. Our study confirms that the beta oscillations of EEG travel bidirectionally between sensorimotor cortex and contralateral muscles in sensorimotor loop system, and the oscillation of beta-band of EMG signal is considered to be driven from cortex pyramidal tract and cortex and likely to reflect the information transmission from muscle to the sensorimotor cortex. The beta-band corticomuscular coupling reveals the information transmission between the muscles and sensorimotor cortex. Additionally, the corticomuscular coupling strength discrepancy varies on different time-frequency scales between EEG and EMG signals. The results show that the VMD-TE can quantitatively estimate the nonlinear time-frequency interconnection and functional corticomuscular coupling between sensorimotor cortex and muscle.

Cyclists performed a maximum aerobic power test on the first testing day followed by a time-to-exhaustion trial at 85% of their maximum power output on 2 subsequent days that were separated by similar to 48 h. EEG was recorded using a 64-channel system at 500 Hz. Independent component (IC) analysis parsed the EEG scalp data into maximal ICs. An equivalent current dipole model was calculated for each IC, and results were clustered across subjects. A time-frequency analysis of the identified electrocortical clusters was performed to investigate the magnitude and timing of event-related spectral perturbations. Significant changes (P < 0.05) in electrocortical activity were found in frontal, supplementary motor and parietal areas of the cortex. Overall, there was a significant increase in EEG power as fatigue developed throughout the exercise. The strongest increase was found in the frontal area of the cortex. The timing of event-related desynchronization within the supplementary motor area corresponds with the onset of force production and the transition from flexion to extension in the pedaling cycle. The results indicate an involvement of the cerebral cortex during the pedaling task that most likely involves executive control function, as well as motor planning and execution.

These ERD/ERS activities are suggested to reflect various aspects of pain perception, including the representation, encoding, assessment, and integration of the nociceptive sensory inputs, as well as behavioral responses to pain, even the precise details of their roles remain unclear. Previous studies investigating the functional relevance of ERD/ERS activities in pain perception were normally done by assessing their latencies, frequencies, magnitudes, and scalp distributions, which would be then correlated with subjective pain perception or stimulus intensity. Nevertheless, these temporal, spectral, and spatial profiles of stimulus induced ERD/ERS could only partly reveal the dynamics of brain oscillatory activities. Indeed, additional parameters, including but not limited to, phase, neural generator, and cross frequency couplings, should be paid attention to comprehensively and systemically evaluate the dynamics of oscillatory activities associated with pain perception and behavior. This would be crucial in exploring the psychophysiological mechanisms of neural oscillation, and in understanding the neural functions of cortical oscillations involved in pain perception and behavior. Notably, some chronic pain (e.g., neurogenic pain and complex regional pain syndrome) patients are often associated with the occurrence of abnormal synchronized oscillatory brain activities, and selectively modulating cortical oscillatory activities has been showed to be a potential therapy strategy to relieve pain with the application of neurostimulation techniques, e.g., repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Thus, the investigation of the oscillatory activities proceeding from phenomenology to function, opens new perspectives to address questions in human pain psychophysiology and pathophysiology, thereby promoting the establishment of rational therapeutic strategy.

For slow event-related components, such as the P3, this developmental change may be masked due to increased amplitude levels of ongoing delta and theta oscillations in adolescents. Methods: In a cross-sectional study design, EEG was measured in 51 participants between 13 and 24 years. A visual oddball paradigm was used to elicit the P3. Our analysis focused on fronto-parietal activations within the P3 time-window and the concurrent time-frequency characteristics in the delta (similar to 0.5-4 Hz) and theta (similar to 4-7 Hz) band. Results: The parietal P3 amplitude was similar across the investigated age range, while the amplitude at frontal regions increased with age. The pre-stimulus amplitudes of delta and theta oscillations declined with age, while post-stimulus amplitude enhancement and inter-trial phase coherence increased. These changes affected fronto-parietal electrode sites. Conclusions: The parietal P3 maximum seemed comparable for adolescents and young adults. Detailed analysis revealed that within the P3 time-window brain maturation during adolescence may lead to reduced spontaneous slow-wave oscillations, increased amplitude modulation and time precision of event-related oscillations, and altered P3 scalp topography. Significance: Time-frequency analyses may help to distinguish selective neurodevelopmental changes within the P3 time window. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Reduced habituation of auditory evoked potentials indicate cortical hyper-excitability in Fragile X Syndrome	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							PSYCHOTIC BIPOLAR DISORDER; MOUSE MODEL; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PAIRED STIMULI; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; ABNORMALITIES; INDIVIDUALS; MINOCYCLINE	Sensory hypersensitivities are common, clinically distressing features of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Preclinical evidence suggests this abnormality may result from synaptic hyper-excitability in sensory systems. This model predicts reduced sensory habituation to repeated stimulus presentation. Fourteen adolescents and adults with FXS and 15 age-matched controls participated in a modified auditory gating task using trains of 4 identical tones during dense array electroencephalography (EEG). Event-related potential and single trial time-frequency analyses revealed decreased habituation of the N1 event-related potential response in FXS, and increased gamma power coupled with decreases in gamma phase-locking during the early-stimulus registration period. EEG abnormalities in FXS were associated with parent reports of heightened sensory sensitivities and social communication deficits. Reduced habituation and altered gamma power and phase-locking to auditory cues demonstrated here in FXS patients parallels preclinical findings with Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, the EEG abnormalities seen in FXS patients support the model of neocortical hyperexcitability in FXS, and may provide useful translational biomarkers for evaluating novel treatment strategies targeting its neural substrate.

Detection of steering direction using EEG recordings based on sample entropy and time-frequency analysis	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Monitoring driver's intentions beforehand is an ambitious aim, which will bring a huge impact on the society by preventing traffic accidents. Hence, in this preliminary study we recorded high resolution electroencephalography (EEG) from 5 subjects while driving a car under real conditions along with an accelerometer which detects the onset of steering. Two sensor-level analyses, sample entropy and time-frequency analysis, have been implemented to observe the dynamics before the onset of steering. Thus, in order to classify the steering direction we applied a machine learning algorithm consisting of: dimensionality reduction and classification using principal-component-analysis (PCA) and support-vector-machine (SVM), respectively. The results showed an increase of the sample entropy and the estimated power values in the theta and alpha frequency bands, 100 ms before the onset of steering. The detection of steering direction depicted that sample entropy gives a higher classification accuracy (73.5% +/- 6.8) as compared to that of using the estimated power for theta and alpha frequency bands (62.6% +/- 5.6).

EEG oscillations: From correlation to causality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Neuronal entrainment; Brain oscillations; EEG; Electroencephalography; Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; CORTICAL NETWORK ACTIVITY; ELECTRO-ENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; 10 HZ; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; RESONANCE PHENOMENA; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES	Already in his first report on the discovery of the human EEG in 1929, Berger showed great interest in further elucidating the functional roles of the alpha and beta waves for normal mental activities. Meanwhile, most cognitive processes have been linked to at least one of the traditional frequency bands in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma range. Although the existing wealth of high-quality correlative EEG data led many researchers to the conviction that brain oscillations subserve various sensory and cognitive processes, a causal role can only be demonstrated by directly modulating such oscillatory signals. In this review, we highlight several methods to selectively modulate neuronal oscillations, including EEG-neurofeedback, rhythmic sensory stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In particular, we discuss tACS as the most recent technique to directly modulate oscillatory brain activity. Such studies demonstrating the effectiveness of tACS comprise reports on purely behavioral or purely electrophysiological effects, on combination of behavioral effects with offline EEG measurements or on simultaneous (online) tACS-EEG recordings. Whereas most tACS studies are designed to modulate ongoing rhythmic brain activity at a specific frequency, recent evidence suggests that tACS may also modulate cross-frequency interactions. Taken together, the modulation of neuronal oscillations allows to demonstrate causal links between brain oscillations and cognitive processes and to obtain important insights into human brain function.

J	Diykh, M; Li, Y				Diykh, Mohammed; Li, Yan			Complex networks approach for EEG signal sleep stages classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Complex networks; Sleep stages; Statistical features	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; TIME-SERIES; FEATURE-SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; CHANNEL EEG; FEATURES; SIMILARITY; ENTROPY	Sleep stage scoring is a challenging task. Most of existing sleep stage classification approaches rely on analysing electroencephalography (EEG) signals in time or frequency domain. A novel technique for EEG sleep stages classification is proposed in this paper. The statistical features and the similarities of complex networks are used to classify single channel EEG signals into six sleep stages. Firstly, each EEG segment of 30 s is divided into 75 sub-segments, and then different statistical features are extracted from each sub-segment. In this paper, feature extraction is important to reduce dimensionality of EEG data and the processing time in classification stage. Secondly, each vector of the extracted features, which represents one EEG segment, is transferred into a complex network. Thirdly, the similarity properties of the complex networks are extracted and classified into one of the six sleep stages using a k-means classifier. For further investigation, in the statistical features extraction phase two statistical features sets are tested and ranked based on the performance of the complex networks. To investigate the classification ability of complex networks combined with k-means, the extracted statistical features were also forwarded to a k-means and a support vector machine (SVM) for comparison. We also compare the proposed method with other existing methods in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed method attains better classification results and a reasonable execution time compared with the SVM, k-means and the other existing methods. The research results in this paper indicate that the proposed method can assist neurologists and sleep specialists in diagnosing and monitoring sleep disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate biomarkers obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to reflect corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma patients. Material/Methods: Our study included 20 retinoblastoma patients treated at the Department of Ophthalmology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University between 2010 and 2014. Twenty normal individuals were included in the control group. EEG activity was recorded continuously with 32 electrodes using standard EEG electrode placement for detecting EEG power. A cornea confocal microscope was used to examine corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma patients and normal individuals. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between corneal nerve injury and EEG power changes. The sensitivity and specificity of changed EEG power in diagnosis of corneal nerve injury were also analyzed. Results: The predominantly slow EEG oscillations changed gradually into faster waves in retinoblastoma patients. The EEG pattern in retinoblastoma patients was characterized by a distinct increase of delta (P<0.01) and significant decrease of theta power P<0.05). Corneal nerves were damaged in corneas of retinoblastoma patients. Corneal nerve injury was positively correlated with delta EEG spectra power and negatively correlated with theta EEG spectra power. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity by compounding in the series were 60% and 67%, respectively. Conclusions: Changes in delta and theta of EEG appear to be associated with occurrence of corneal nerve injury. Useful information can be provided for evaluating corneal nerve damage in retinoblastoma patients through analyzing EEG power bands.

TMS-EEG: A window into the neurophysiological effects of transcranial electrical stimulation in non-motor brain regions	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES); Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS); Electroencephalography (EEG); Neuroimaging; Neuromodulation; Cognition	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; WORKING-MEMORY PERFORMANCE; RANDOM NOISE STIMULATION; SHAM-CONTROLLED TRIAL; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED EEG	Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) techniques are able to induce changes in cortical excitability and plasticity through the administration of weak currents to the brain and are currently being used to manipulate a vast array of cognitive processes. Despite the widespread use of tES technologies within both research and remedial settings, their precise neurophysiological mechanisms of action are not well established outside of the motor cortex. The expanding use of tES within non-motor brain regions highlights the growing need for a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of stimulation across a diversity of cortical locations. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) provides a method of directly probing both local and widespread changes in brain neurophysiology, through the recording of TMS-evoked potentials and cortical oscillations. In this review we explore TMS-EEG as a tool for examining the impact of tES on cortical function and argue that multimodal approaches which combine tES with TMS-EEG could lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms which underlie tES-induced cognitive modulation.

MEG sensor and source measures of visually induced gamma-band oscillations are highly reliable	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Test-retest reliability; Visually induced gamma (30-100 Hz) response; Magnetoencephalography (MEG); DICS beamforming; Time-frequency analysis	FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; PEAK FREQUENCY; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION; RHYTHMS; COMMUNICATION; HIPPOCAMPAL	High frequency brain oscillations are associated with numerous cognitive and behavioral processes. Non-invasive measurements using electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) have revealed that high frequency neural signals are heritable and manifest changes with age as well as in neuropsychiatric illnesses. Despite the extensive use of EEG/MEG-measured neural oscillations in basic and clinical research, studies demonstrating test-retest reliability of power and frequency measures of neural signals remain scarce. Here, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of visually induced gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations derived from sensor and source signals acquired over two MEG sessions. The study required participants (N = 13) to detect the randomly occurring stimulus acceleration while viewing amoving concentric grating. Sensor and source MEG measures of gamma-band activity yielded comparably strong reliability (average intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.861). Peak stimulus-induced gamma frequency (53-72 Hz) yielded the highest measures of stability (ICCSENSOR = 0.940; ICCSOURCE = 0.966) followed by spectral signal change (ICCSENSOR = 0.890; ICCSOURCE = 0.893) and peak frequency bandwidth (ICCSENSOR = 0.856; ICCSOURCE = 0.622). Furthermore, source-reconstruction significantly improved signal-to-noise for spectral amplitude of gamma activity compared to sensor estimates. Our assessments highlight that both sensor and source derived estimates of visually induced gamma-band oscillations from MEG signals are characterized by high test-retest reliability, with source derived oscillatory measures conferring an improvement in the stability of peak-frequency estimates. Importantly, our finding of high test-retest reliability supports the feasibility of pharma-MEG studies and longitudinal aging or clinical studies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The pathophysiology of ACM is still unclear but these patterns suggest neuronal dysfunction in specific brain areas. We performed source localization analysis of IRDA (in the frequency band of 1-3.5 Hz) to better understand the ACM mechanism. Typical IRDA EEG patterns were recorded in a patient with ACM during the acute stage. A second EEG was obtained after recovery from ACM. To identify source localization of IRDA, statistical non-parametric mapping using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was performed for the delta frequency band comparisons between ACM attack and non-attack periods. A difference in the current density maximum was found in the dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC). The significant differences were widely distributed over the frontal, parietal, temporal and limbic lobe, paracentral lobule and insula and were predominant in the left hemisphere. Dorsal ACC dysfunction was demonstrated for the first time in a patient with ACM in this source localization analysis of IRDA. The ACC plays an important role in the frontal attentional control system and acute confusion. This dysfunction of the dorsal ACC might represent an important ACM pathophysiology.

Advances in EEG: home video telemetry, high frequency oscillations and electrical source imaging	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						EEG telemetry; Epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; Source localisation	SCALP-FAST OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE-ONSET; 80-500 HZ; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FAST RIPPLES; DENSE ARRAY; EPILEPSY; LOCALIZATION; ACCURACY; SPIKES	Over the last two decades, technological advances in electroencephalography (EEG) have allowed us to extend its clinical utility for the evaluation of patients with epilepsy. This article reviews three main areas in which substantial advances have been made in the diagnosis and pre-surgical planning of patients with epilepsy. Firstly, the development of small portable video-EEG systems have allowed some patients to record their attacks at home, thereby improving diagnosis, with consequent substantial healthcare and economic implications. Secondly, in specialist centres carrying out epilepsy surgery, there has been considerable interest in whether bursts of very high frequency EEG activity can help to determine the regions of the brain likely to be generating the seizures. Identification of these discharges, initially only recorded from intracranial electrodes, may thus allow better surgical planning and improve surgical outcomes. Finally we discuss the contribution of electrical source imaging in the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy, and its prospects for the future.

Little is known regarding the time - frequency characteristics of EEG activities while recognizing microexpressions. We examined the neural activities associated with recognizing microexpressions and macroexpressions (with duration of greater than 200 ms). The event-related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) were entered into a repeated measures ANOVA, the results showed that the main effect of duration for the event-related spectral perturbation were significant, and the theta oscillations (4 Hz to 8 Hz) increased in recognizing expressions with a duration of 40 ms compared with 300 ms. The results showed that the recognition of microexpressions rely on different brain mechanisms than that of macroexpressions.

Analysis of iEEG in the routine EEG frequency range (0.5-70 Hz) remains the basis in clinical practice. Low-voltage fast activity is the most commonly reported ictal onset pattern in neocortical epilepsy, and low-frequency high-amplitude repetitive spiking is the most commonly reported ictal onset pattern in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Recent studies using wideband EEG recording have demonstrated that examining higher (80-1000 Hz) and lower (0.016-0.5 Hz) EEG frequencies can provide additional diagnostic information and help to improve the surgical outcome. In addition, novel computational techniques of iEEG signal analysis have provided new insights into the epileptic network. Here, we review some of these recent advances. Although these sophisticated and advanced techniques of iEEG analysis show promise in localizing the epileptogenic zone, their utility needs to be further validated in larger studies.

Visual deviant stimuli produce mismatch responses in the amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Event-related potential (ERP); Event-related synchronization (ERS); Mismatch negativity (MMN); Oscillations; Peripheral vision; Visual mismatch oscillatory response (vMOR)	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; THETA OSCILLATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DEPTH-PERCEPTION; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; NEGATIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORKS; FEEDBACK	Objectives: Auditory and visual deviant stimuli evoke mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, which can be recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, little is known about the role of neuronal oscillations in encoding of rare stimuli. We aimed at verifying the existence of a mechanism for the detection of deviant visual stimuli on the basis of oscillatory responses, so-called visual mismatch oscillatory response (vMOR). Methods: Peripheral visual stimuli in an oddball paradigm, standard vs. deviant (7: 1), were presented to twenty healthy subjects. The oscillatory responses to an infrequent change in the direction of moving peripheral stimuli were recorded with a 60-channel EEG system. In order to enhance the detection of oscillatory responses, we used the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, designed for the optimal extraction of changes in the amplitude of oscillations. Results: Both standard and deviant visual stimuli produced Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) and Synchronization (ERS) primarily in the occipito-parietal cortical areas. ERD and ERS had overlapping time-courses and peaked at about 500-730 ms. These oscillatory responses, however, were significantly stronger for the deviant than for the standard stimuli. A difference between the oscillatory responses to deviant and standard stimuli thus reflects the presence of vMOR. Conclusions: The present study shows that the detection of visual deviant stimuli can be reflected in both synchronization and desynchronization of neuronal oscillations. This broadens our knowledge about the brain mechanisms encoding deviant sensory stimuli. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Real time stress detection system based on EEG signals	BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						Stress detection; Electroencephalography; Hilbert-Huang transform; Support vector machine; Machine learning	MEDICAL-STUDENTS	Stress has become a common emotion that students experience in day to day life. Several factors contribute to their stress and proven to have a detrimental effect on their performance. Hence, stress becomes ubiquitous in academic environment due to higher expectations in academic achievement, poor time management, and financial concerns. It has an adverse effect on the quality of their life affecting both physical and mental health. It is a guarantor for depression and suicidal risks if left unnoticed over a longer period. The traditional stress detection system is based on physiological signals and facial expression techniques. The major drawback is the uncertainty that arises due to numerous external factors like sweating, room temperature, anxiety. Some methods like hormone analysis have a drawback of invasive procedure. There is a need for a method that is non-invasive, precise, accurate and reliable. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a perfect tool as it is a non-invasive procedure. Also, it receives feedback from stress hormones; it can serve as reliable tool to measure stress. This research work aims to detect stress for students based on EEG as EEG displays a good correlation with stress. The EEG signal is pre-processed to remove artefacts and relevant time-frequency features are extracted using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). The extracted features are manipulated to detect stress levels using hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results revealed the efficiency of the system to detect stress in real time using their brain wave.

Autonomous OA Removal in Real-Time from Single Channel EEG Data on a Wearable Device Using a Hybrid Algebraic-Wavelet Algorithm	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artifact removal; EEG signal processing; real-time algorithm; wearable	OCULAR ARTIFACTS	Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to record brain activities in natural settings. Ocular Artifacts (OA) usually contaminates EEG signals, removal of which is critical for accurate feature extraction and classification. With the increasing adoption of wearable technologies, single-channel real-time EEG systems that often require real-time signal processing for immediate real-time feedback are becoming more prevalent. However, traditional OA removal algorithms usually requiremultiple channels of EEG data, are computationally expensive, and do not perform well in real-time. In this article, a new hybrid algorithm is proposed that autonomously detects OA and subsequently removes OA from a single-channel steaming EEG data in real-time. The proposed single EEG channel algorithm also does not require additional reference electrooculography (EOG) channel. The algorithm has also been implemented on an embedded hardware platform of single channel wearable EEG system (NeuroMonitor). The algorithm first detects the OA zones using an Algebraic approach and then removes these artifacts from the detected OA zones using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition method. The de-noising technique is applied only to the OA zone, which minimizes loss of neural information outside the OA zone. A qualitative and quantitative performance evaluation was carried out with a 0.5s epoch in overlapping sliding window technique using time-frequency analysis, mean square coherence, and correlation coefficient statistics. The hybrid OA removal algorithm demonstrated real-time operation with 3s latency on the PSoC-3-microcontroller-based EEG system. Successful implementation of OA removal from single-channel real-time EEG data using the proposed algorithm shows promise for real-time feedback applications of wearable EEG devices.

The underlying cognitive and neural processes are, however, poorly understood. Methods: This review synthesizes functional neuroimaging studies of visual creativity. Seven functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and 19 electroencephalography (EEG) studies were included, comprising 27 experiments and around 800 participants. Results: Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of the fMRI studies comparing visual creativity to non-rest control tasks yielded significant clusters in thalamus, left fusiform gyrus, and right middle and inferior frontal gyri. The EEG studies revealed a tendency for decreased alpha power during visual creativity compared to baseline, but comparisons of visual creativity to non-rest control tasks revealed inconsistent findings. Conclusions: The findings are consistent with suggested contributions to visual creativity of prefrontally mediated inhibition, evaluation, and working memory, as well as visual imagery processes. Findings are discussed in relation to prominent theories of the neural basis of creativity.

Accumulating evidence shows that features of these oscillations are highly dynamic: power, frequency and phase fluctuate alongside changes in behavior and task demands. The role and mechanism supporting this variability is however poorly understood. We here analyze a network of recurrently connected spiking neurons with time delay displaying stable synchronous dynamics. Using mean-field and stability analyses, we investigate the influence of dynamic inputs on the frequency of firing rate oscillations. We show that afferent noise, mimicking inputs to the neurons, causes smoothing of the system's response function, displacing equilibria and altering the stability of oscillatory states. Our analysis further shows that these noise-induced changes cause a shift of the peak frequency of synchronous oscillations that scales with input intensity, leading the network towards critical states. We lastly discuss the extension of these principles to periodic stimulation, in which externally applied driving signals can trigger analogous phenomena. Our results reveal one possible mechanism involved in shaping oscillatory activity in the brain and associated control principles.

HFOs additionally serve as a prototypical example of challenges in the analysis of discrete events in high-temporal resolution, intracranial EEG data. Two primary challenges are 1) dimensionality reduction, and 2) assessing feasibility of classification. Dimensionality reduction assumes that the data lie on a manifold with dimension less than that of the features space. However, previous HFO analysis have assumed a linear manifold, global across time, space (i.e. recording electrode/channel), and individual patients. Instead, we assess both a) whether linear methods are appropriate and b) the consistency of the manifold across time, space, and patients. We also estimate bounds on the Bayes classification error to quantify the distinction between two classes of HFOs (those occurring during seizures and those occurring due to other processes). This analysis provides the foundation for future clinical use of HFO features and guides the analysis for other discrete events, such as individual action potentials or multi-unit activity.

Granger causality testing is essential for establishing causal relations among variables in multivariate dynamic processes. However, testing for Granger causality in the frequency domain is challenging due to the nonlinear relation between frequency domain measures (e.g., partial directed coherence, generalized partial directed coherence) and time domain data. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that phase resampling is a general and robust method for making statistical inferences even with short time series. With Gaussian data, phase resampling yields satisfactory type I and type II error rates in all but one condition we examine: when a small effect size is combined with an insufficient number of data points. Violations of normality lead to slightly higher error rates but are mostly within acceptable ranges. We illustrate the utility of phase resampling with two empirical examples involving multivariate electroencephalography (EEG) and skin conductance data.

Specifically, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be processed and analyzed by the developed tool, which incorporates commonly used temporal and frequency analysis methods. In addition to common methods, the tool also provides non-linear chaos analysis with Lyapunov exponents and entropies; multivariate analysis with principal and independent component analyses; and pattern classification with discriminant analysis. This tool can also be utilized for training in biomedical engineering education. This easy-to-use and easy-to-learn, intuitive tool is described in detail in this paper.

Non-invasive brain mapping in epilepsy: Applications from magnetoencephalography	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Magnetoencepahlography; Epilepsy; Cortical oscillations; Connectivity; Graph theory	GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; FOCAL EPILEPSY; RESTING GABA; EEG-FMRI; MEG; LOCALIZATION; PROPAGATION	Background: Non-invasive in vivo neurophysiological recordings with EEG/MEG are key to the diagnosis, classification, and further understanding of epilepsy. Historically the emphasis of these recordings has been the localisation of the putative sources of epileptic discharges. More recent developments see new techniques studying oscillatory dynamics, connectivity and network properties. New method: New analysis strategies for whole head MEG include the development of spatial filters or beamformers for source localisation, time-frequency analysis for cortical dynamics and graph theory applications for connectivity. Results: The idea of epilepsy as a network disorder is not new, and new applications of structural and functional brain imaging show differences in cortical and subcortical networks in patients with epilepsy compared to controls. Concepts of 'focal' and 'generalised' are challenged by evidence of focal onsets in generalised epileptic discharges, and widespread network changes in focal epilepsy. Spectral analyses can show differences in induced cortical response profiles, particularly in photosensitive epilepsy. Comparison with existing method: This review focuses on the application of MEG in the study of epilepsy, starting with a brief historical perspective, followed by novel applications of source localisation, time-frequency and connectivity analyses. Conclusion: Novel MEG analyses approaches show altered cortical dynamics and widespread network alterations in focal and generalised epilepsies, and identification of regional network abnormalities may have a role in epilepsy surgery evaluation.

This practical concept could be used also for fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). Progranulin (PGRN) has been recently recognized as a useful diagnostic biomarker for fronto-temporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) due to GRN null mutations. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a reliable tool in detecting brain networks changes. The working hypothesis of the present study is that EEG oscillations could detect different modifications among FTLD stages (FTD-MCI versus overt FTD) as well as differences between GRN mutation carriers versus non-carriers in patients with overt FTD. Materials and Methods: EEG in all patients and PGRN dosage in patients with a clear FTD were detected. The cognitive state has been investigated through mini mental state examination (MMSE). Results: MCI-FTD showed a significant lower spectral power in both alpha and theta oscillations as compared to overt FTD. GRN mutations carriers affected by FTLD show an increase in high alpha and decrease in theta oscillations as compared to non-carriers. Conclusion: EEG frequency rhythms are sensible to different stage of FTD and could detect changes in brain oscillatory activity affected by GRN mutations.

Features of the EEG Spectral Composition in Patients with Cervicocranialgias and Dorsalgias of Different Origin	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ongoing EEG; spectral composition; cervicocranialgia; dorsalgia; multiple sclerosis; consequences of neuroinfections	LOW-BACK-PAIN	We examined the spectral composition of ongoing EEG activity in 77 patients suffering from intense pain in the neck and/or back (cervicocranialgia and/or dorsalgia) caused by neurological vertebral disorders of reflex origin (group VDRO, n = 43), multiple sclerosis (group MS, n = 17), and consequences of earlier neuroinfections (group NIC, n = 17). Visual analysis of EEG records of these patients showed the existence of disorganized EEG patterns more intensely manifested in the latter two groups. Spectral EEG analysis demonstrated that the averaged spectral powers (SPs) of beta 1 and beta 2 oscillations in patients of group MS were, in almost all EEG leads, significantly greater than those in subjects of groups VDRO and NIC, while the SP of. activity in most cortical loci (except frontal ones) was significantly lower. The SP of the beta 1 and beta 2 subrhythms demonstrated significant negative correlations with the frequency of pain attacks in the VDRO group. At the same time, the power of this subrhythm in the MS group showed close positive correlations with the pain intensity, while these indices in the group NIC correlated with the frequency of pain attacks. The increased power of high-frequency components of ongoing EEG can be considered an EEG correlate of dorsalgials and cervicocranialgias in MS patients.	[Nazarchuk, I. A.; Sukhorukov, V.

To distinguish real HFOs from spurious ones using analysis of the raw signal. Method: We developed a new method to prevent false HFO detections due to the filtering effect by detecting oscillations in the raw signal at the time of sharp events. We specified temporal features to classify sharp events with and without HFOs using support vector machine in both ripple and fast ripple bands. The traditionally used time-frequency representation served as the gold standard to indicate real and false HFOs. Results: 44% of ripples and 43% of FRs concurring with sharp events were found to be false HFOs. Sharp events with HFOs had significantly more oscillations in the raw signal than sharp events without. They could be distinguished from false HFOs with accuracy of 76.6% in the ripple band and 72.6% in the fast ripple band. Conclusion: It may be most appropriate to detect HFOs as oscillations not only on the filtered signal but also on the raw signal. The classical time-frequency display used for identifying HFOs should be used with great care due to the possible masking effect of broadband activities. Significance: The separation of real HFOs from broadband activities will raise the validity of HFO detection methods and will therefore support future HFO investigations.

However, the amount of time needed to gather EEG data means that most laboratory studies use relatively small sample sizes. Using the Muse, a portable and wireless four-channel EEG headband, we obtained EEG recordings from 6029 subjects 18-88 years in age while they completed a category exemplar task followed by a meditation exercise. Here, we report age-related changes in EEG power at a fine chronological scale for delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands, as well as peak alpha frequency and alpha asymmetry measures for both frontal and temporoparietal sites. We found that EEG power changed as a function of age, and that the age-related changes depended on sex and frequency band. We found an overall age-related shift in band power from lower to higher frequencies, especially for females. We also found a gradual, year-by-year slowing of the peak alpha frequency with increasing age. Finally, our analysis of alpha asymmetry revealed greater relative right frontal activity. Our results replicate several previous age-and sex-related findings and show how some previously observed changes during childhood extend throughout the lifespan. Unlike previous age-related EEG studies that were limited by sample size and restricted age ranges, our work highlights the advantage of using large, representative samples to address questions about developmental brain changes. We discuss our findings in terms of their relevance to attentional processes and brain-based models of emotional well-being and aging.

Sustained amplitude modulations in the contralateral hand area show decrease for alpha (10-12 Hz) and beta (18-24 Hz), but increase for high gamma (60-80 Hz) frequencies during the entire movement period. Additionally, we found movement phase-related amplitudes, which resembled the flexion and extension sequence of the fingers. Especially for faster movement cadences, movement phase-related amplitudes included high beta (24-30 Hz) frequencies in prefrontal areas. Interestingly, the spectral profiles and source patterns of movement phase-related amplitudes differed from sustained activities, suggesting that they represent different frequency-specific large-scale networks. First, networks were signified by the sustained element, which statically modulate their synchrony levels during continuous movements. These networks may upregulate neuronal excitability in brain regions specific to the limb, in this study the right hand area. Second, movement phase-related networks, which modulate their synchrony in relation to the movement sequence. We suggest that these frequency-specific networks are associated with distinct functions, including top-down control, sensorimotor prediction, and integration. The separation of different large-scale networks, we applied in this work, improves the interpretation of EEG sources in relation to human motor behavior.

In the new multiwavelet-based parametric modeling framework, the time-dependent parameters in the time-varying model are locally represented using a novel multiwavelet decomposition scheme. An effective orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm aided by mutual information criterion is then applied for sparse model selection and parameter estimation. The resultant estimation of time-dependent spectral density in the signal can simultaneously achieve a high resolution in both time and frequency, which is a powerful TFA technique for nonstationary biomedical signals including EEG. Two examples, one for an artificial EEG signal and another for a real EEG signal are included to show the effectiveness and applicability of the new proposed approach. Simulation studies and applications to real EEG data elucidate that the proposed wavelet approach is capable of achieving a high time-frequency representation for nonstationary processes.

Our time-frequency analysis-based feature extraction is fine-tuned to capture sleep stage-specific signal features as described in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine manual that the human experts follow. We used ensemble learning with an ensemble of stacked sparse autoencoders for classifying the sleep stages. We used class-balanced random sampling across sleep stages for each model in the ensemble to avoid skewed performance in favor of the most represented sleep stages, and addressed the problem of misclassification errors due to class imbalance while significantly improving worst-stage classification. We used an openly available dataset from 20 healthy young adults for evaluation. We used a single channel of EEG from this dataset, which makes our method a suitable candidate for longitudinal monitoring using wearable EEG in real-world settings. Our method has both high overall accuracy (78%, range 75-80%), and high mean -score (84%, range 82-86%) and mean accuracy across individual sleep stages (86%, range 84-88%) over all subjects. The performance of our method appears to be uncorrelated with the sleep efficiency and percentage of transitional epochs in each recording.

Even among automatic methods such as time-frequency (T-F) representations, there is still room for more improvement. New method: To optimise the efficiency of T-F domain analysis of sleep electroencephalography (EEG) a novel approach for automatically identifying the brain waves, sleep spindles, and IC-complexes from the sleep EEG signals is proposed. The proposed method is based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA). The single-channel EEG signal (C3-A2) is initially decomposed and then the desired components are automatically separated. In addition, the noise is removed to enhance the discrimination ability of features. The obtained T-F features after preprocessing stage are classified using a multi-class support vector machines (SVMs) and used for the identification of four sleep stages over three sleep types. Furthermore, to emphasise on the usefulness of the proposed method the automatically-determined spindles are parameterised to discriminate three sleep types. Result: The four sleep stages are classified through SVM twice: with and without preprocessing stage. The mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for before the preprocessing stage are: 71.5 +/- 0.11%, 56.1 +/- 0.09% and 86.8 +/- 0.04% respectively. However, these values increase significantly to 83.6 +/- 0.07%, 70.6 +/- 0.14% and 90.8 +/- 0.03% after applying SSA. Comparison with existing method: The new T-F representation has been compared with the existing benchmarks. Our results prove that, the proposed method well outperforms the previous methods in terms of identification and representation of sleep stages. Conclusion: Experimental results confirm the performance improvement in terms of classification rate and also representative T-F domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The studies on delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) oscillatory responses in humans upon application of cognitive paradigms showed that delta oscillations are related to cognitive processes, mainly in decision making and attentional processes. The present manuscript comprehensively reviews the studies on delta oscillatory responses upon cognitive stimulation in healthy subjects and in different pathologies, namely Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and alcoholism. Further delta oscillatory response upon presentation of faces, facial expressions, and affective pictures are reviewed. The relationship between pre-stimulus delta activity and post-stimulus evoked and event-related responses and/or oscillations is discussed. Cross-frequency couplings of delta oscillations with higher frequency windows are also included in the review. The conclusion of this review includes several important remarks, including that delta oscillatory responses are involved in cognitive and emotional processes. A decrease of delta oscillatory responses could be a general electrophysiological marker for cognitive dysfunction (Alzheimer's disease, MCI, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and alcoholism). The pre-stimulus activity (phase or amplitude changes in delta activity) has an effect on post stimulus EEG responses. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

But only a few of the studies was discussed based on brain activity. Most of the study only focused on the correct response or score result of the task. Thus, this present study aims to improve the limitations. The brain response is investigates during memorization based on electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. EEG is an imaging technique that able to record the brain electrical signal in a short time. The visual working memory task with two difficulty level (easy and difficult) was preferred for experiment. Sixty healthy subjects were required to memorize the visual task at three different conditions; silent and listening to Mozart music k448 and pure white noise in 2 minutes. The sound intensity was controlled at 40 to 55 dB to minimize the effect of volume on subject. There were two measurements which were memorizing test score and brain activity was used to evaluate the memory performance of the subject. During memorizing process, the brain activity was recorded using 10-20 electrode placement system of Neurofax 9200 EEG acquisition machine. The Fp1, Fz, F8, T3, T4, T5, T6, Pz, O1 and O2 channels were selected for analyzing process by using MATLAB software. The wavelet approach was used to process the raw EEG data. Based on the result, it showed that the memory performance was influenced when the environmental condition was changing. Different pattern of EEG signal has been found for different conditions based on the relative power of frequency band.	[Daud, S.

Evoked and resting state activations affect local cerebral hemodynamic properties through processes collectively referred to as neurovascular coupling. Its investigation calls for an ability to track both the neural and vascular aspects of brain function. We used scalp electroencephalography (EEG), which provided a measure of the electrical potentials generated by cortical postsynaptic currents. Simultaneously we utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to continuously monitor hemoglobin concentration changes in superficial cortical layers. The multi-modal signal from 18 healthy adult subjects allowed us to investigate the association of neural activity in a range of frequencies over the whole-head to local changes in hemoglobin concentrations. Our results verified the delayed alpha (8-16 Hz) modulation of hemodynamics in posterior areas known from the literature. They also indicated strong beta (16-32 Hz) modulation of hemodynamics. Analysis revealed, however, that beta modulation was likely generated by the alpha-beta coupling in EEG. Signals from the inferior electrode sites were dominated by scalp muscle related activity. Our study aimed to characterize the phenomena related to neurovascular coupling observable by practical, cost-effective, and non-invasive multi-modal techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In anaesthetized rats the decrease of EEG spectral power was shown through all diapasons under consideration. The most pronounced decay of the EEG power was marked in the 30-40 Hz band (27.3 +/- 18.5, p = 2.46 x 10(-11)). In other frequency ranges the power decrease was less but its significance remained high. In conscious rats the simultaneous decay of the EEG power from 20 to 100 Hz range was also the most informative index of SD wave. The maximum power loss was found for band 30-40 Hz (11.2 +/- 7.8, p = 2.55 x 10(-7)). It was shown that besides of EEG power decay the development of SD wave was characterized by the appearance of high frequency activity in front of SD and at the end of it. The increase of high-frequency activity in front of SD wave appeared in the ipsilateral hemisphere and moved along the cortex with the velocity of the SD wave itself. However the bursts of high frequency activity at the end of unilateral SD occurred simultaneously in both hemispheres and lasted 1.5-2.5 min. Findings contribute to detection of SD wave on basis of EEG spectral analysis.	[Koroleva, V. I.; Sakharov, D. S.; Bogdanov, A.

It is often referred to as a learning disability and is characterized by deficits in the linguistic system. To better understand the neural underpinnings of dyslexia, we examined the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra between pre-adolescents with dyslexia and neurotypical control children during eyes closed state. We reported the differences in spontaneous oscillatory activity of each major EEG band (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) adopting a global as well as in a region-by-region and hemispheric approach to elucidate whether there are changes in asymmetry in children with dyslexia compared to controls. We also examined the relationship between EEG power spectra and clinical variables. The findings of our study confirm the presence of an atypical linguistic network, evident in children with dyslexia. This abnormal network hallmarked by a dominance of theta activity suggests that these abnormalities are present prior to these children learning to read, thus implicating delayed maturation and abnormal hypoarousal mechanisms.

PPI of cortical response to a startling pulse is known to be modulated by attention. With a time-frequency analysis, we sought to determine whether goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention differentially modulate inhibition of cortical oscillations elicited by a startling pulse. Methods: An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 26 healthy controls performing an active acoustic PPI paradigm. Startling stimuli were presented alone or either 400 or 1000 ms after one of three types of visual prepulse: to-be-attended (goal-directed attention), unexpected (stimulus-driven attention) or to-be-ignored (non focused attention). We calculated the percentage PPI for the auditory event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) of theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), betal (13-20 Hz) and beta2 (20-30 Hz) oscillations and changes in inter-trial coherence (ITC), a measure of phase synchronization of electroencephalographic activity. Results: At 400 ms: (i) PPI of the ERSP of alpha, theta and betal oscillation was greater after an unexpected and a to-be-attended prepulse than after a to-be-ignored prepulse; and (ii) PPI of beta2 oscillations was greater after a to-be-attended than a to-be-ignored prepulse. At 1000 ms: (i) PPI of alpha oscillations was greater after an unexpected and a to-be-attended prepulse than after a to-be-ignored prepulse; and PPI of betal oscillations was greater after a to-be-attended than a to-be-ignored prepulse. The ITC values did not vary according to the type of prepulse. Conclusions: In an active PPI paradigm, stimulus-driven and goal-directed attention each have differential effects on the modulation of cortical oscillations.

Interictal Infraslow Activity in Stereoelectroencephalography: From Focus to Network	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; DC shift; Stereoelectroencephalography; Infraslow activity; Epileptogenic network; Wideband EEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; DIRECT-CURRENT SHIFTS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; SEIZURE-ONSET; HUMAN BRAIN; FLUCTUATIONS	Purpose: Infraslow activity (ISA) occurring during the interictal state in focal epilepsy is largely unstudied. In this exploratory analysis, the authors aimed to characterize features of interictal ISA in a cohort of patients studied by stereoelectroencephography. Methods: The interictal stereoelectroencephography records for 15 consecutive adult patients were retrospectively analyzed, after application of both conventional (1.6-70 Hz) and infraslow (0.01-0.1 Hz) bandpass filters. Visual analysis was complemented by time-frequency analysis to quantify the change in ISA power over hours. Linear correlation coefficient (R) calculations were used to map interictal connectivity in the infraslow band. Results: Interictal ISA background fluctuations were present throughout the interictal state in all patients, manifesting as recurrent and stereotyped oscillations. These oscillations had an apparent modulatory effect on conventional-band activities and spikes ("spike-crested oscillations"). In the infraslow band, the correlations between electrode contacts were shown to have a stable structure over time. Conclusions: Infraslow activity exists as a fundamental component of wideband cortical dynamics in focal epilepsy, with features suggestive of scale-free (1/f) dynamics: evidence of phase-amplitude coupling and functional connectivity in the infraslow band. Rather than viewed as a focal paroxysmal activity, interictal ISA may be better understood as a network process, although this requires further study.

High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) have emerged as potential presurgical biomarkers for the identification of the EZ in addition to Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) and ictal activity. Although they are promising to localize the EZ, they are not yet suited for the diagnosis or monitoring of epilepsy in clinical practice. Primary barriers remain: the lack of a formal and global definition for HFOs; the consequent heterogeneity of methodological approaches used for their study; and the practical difficulties to detect and localize them noninvasively from scalp recordings. Here, we present a methodology for the recording, detection, and localization of interictal HFOs from pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. We report representative data of HFOs detected noninvasively from interictal scalp EEG and MEG from two children undergoing surgery. The underlying generators of HFOs were localized by solving the inverse problem and their localization was compared to the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) as this was defined by the epileptologists. For both patients, Interictal Epileptogenic Discharges (IEDs) and HFOs were localized with source imaging at concordant locations. For one patient, intracranial EEG (iEEG) data were also available. For this patient, we found that the HFOs localization was concordant between noninvasive and invasive methods. The comparison of iEEG with the results from scalp recordings served to validate these findings. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that presents the source localization of scalp HFOs from simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings comparing the results with invasive recordings. These findings suggest that HFOs can be reliably detected and localized noninvasively with scalp EEG and MEG. We conclude that the noninvasive localization of interictal HFOs could significantly improve the presurgical evaluation for pediatric patients with epilepsy.

J	Tschentscher, N; Hauk, O				Tschentscher, Nadja; Hauk, Olaf			Frontal and Parietal Cortices Show Different Spatiotemporal Dynamics across Problem-solving Stages	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG-DATA; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; ALPHA; MEG; ARCHITECTURE	Arithmetic problem-solving can be conceptualized as a multistage process ranging from task encoding over rule and strategy selection to step-wise task execution. Previous fMRI research suggested a frontal-parietal network involved in the execution of complex numerical and nonnumerical tasks, but evidence is lacking on the particular contributions of frontal and parietal cortices across time. In an arithmetic task paradigm, we evaluated individual participants' retrieval and multistep procedural strategies on a trial-by-trial basis and contrasted those in time-resolved analyses using combined EEG and MEG. Retrieval strategies relied on direct retrieval of arithmetic facts (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). Procedural strategies required multiple solution steps (e.g., 12 + 23 = 12 + 20 + 3 or 23 + 10 + 2). Evoked source analyses revealed independent activation dynamics within the first second of problem-solving in brain areas previously described as one network, such as the frontal-parietal cognitive control network: The right frontal cortex showed earliest effects of strategy selection for multistep procedural strategies around 300 msec, before parietal cortex activated around 700 msec. In time-frequency source power analyses, memory retrieval and multistep procedural strategies were differentially reflected in theta, alpha, and beta frequencies: Stronger beta and alpha desynchronizations emerged for procedural strategies in right frontal, parietal, and temporal regions as function of executive demands. Arithmetic fact retrieval was reflected in right prefrontal increases in theta power. Our results demonstrate differential brain dynamics within frontal-parietal networks across the time course of a problem-solving process, and analyses of different frequency bands allowed us to disentangle cortical regions supporting the underlying memory and executive functions.

Delta, theta, beta, and gamma brain oscillations index levels of auditory sentence processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain oscillations; EEG; Auditory sentence; Phonological processing; Semantic processing; Syntactic processing	WORKING-MEMORY; POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; SPEECH COMPREHENSION; NEURAL DYNAMICS; PHASE; RESPONSES; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; INTELLIGIBILITY; SYNCHRONIZATION	A growing number of studies indicate that multiple ranges of brain oscillations, especially the delta (delta, <4 Hz), theta (theta, 4-8 Hz), beta (beta, 13-30 Hz), and gamma (gamma, 30-50 Hz) bands, are engaged in speech and language processing. It is not clear, however, how these oscillations relate to functional processing at different linguistic hierarchical levels. Using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), the current study tested the hypothesis that phonological and the higher-level linguistic (semantic/syntactic) organizations during auditory sentence processing are indexed by distinct EEG signatures derived from the delta, theta, beta, and gamma oscillations. We analyzed specific EEG signatureswhile subjects listened to Mandarin speech stimuli in three different conditions in order to dissociate phonological and semantic/syntactic processing: (1) sentences comprising valid disyllabic words assembled in a valid syntactic structure (real-word condition); (2) utterances with morphologically valid syllables, but not constituting valid disyllabic words (pseudo-word condition); and (3) backward versions of the real-word and pseudo-word conditions. We tested four signatures: band power, EEG-acoustic entrainment (EAE), cross-frequency coupling (CFC), and inter-electrode renormalized partial directed coherence (rPDC). The results show significant effects of band power and EAE of delta and theta oscillations for phonological, rather than semantic/syntactic processing, indicating the importance of tracking delta- and theta-rate phonetic patterns during phonological analysis. We also found significant beta-related effects, suggesting tracking of EEG to the acoustic stimulus (high-beta EAE), memory processing (theta-low-beta CFC), and auditory-motor interactions (20-Hz rPDC) during phonological analysis. For semantic/syntactic processing, we obtained a significant effect of gamma power, suggesting lexical memory retrieval or processing grammatical word categories. Based on these findings, we confirm that scalp EEG signatures relevant to delta, theta, beta, and gamma oscillations can index phonological and semantic/syntactic organizations separately in auditory sentence processing, compatible with the view that phonological and higher-level linguistic processing engage distinct neural networks.

Comparison of Brain Networks During Interictal Oscillations and Spikes on Magnetoencephalography and Intracerebral EEG	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Oscillations; Spikes; Epilepsy; MEG; Intracerebral EEG; Connectivity	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN TEMPORAL-LOBE; PARTIAL EPILEPSY; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; PROPAGATION; MEG; CONNECTIVITY; RECORDINGS; SURGERY	Electromagnetic source localization in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows finding the generators of transient interictal epileptiform discharges ('interictal spikes'). In intracerebral EEG (iEEG), oscillatory activity (above 30 Hz) has also been shown to be a marker of neuronal dysfunction. Still, the difference between networks involved in transient and oscillatory activities remains largely unknown. Our goal was thus to extract and compare the networks involved in interictal oscillations and spikes, and to compare the non-invasive results to those obtained directly within the brain. In five patients with both MEG and iEEG recordings, we computed correlation graphs across regions, for (1) interictal spikes and (2) epileptic oscillations around 30 Hz. We show that the corresponding networks can involve a widespread set of regions (average of 10 per patient), with only partial overlap (38 % of the total number of regions in MEG, 50 % in iEEG). The non-invasive results were concordant with intracerebral recordings (79 % for the spikes and 50 % for the oscillations). We compared our interictal results to iEEG ictal data. The regions labeled as seizure onset zone (SOZ) belonged to interictal networks in a large proportion of cases: 75 % (resp. 58 %) for spikes and 58 % (resp. 33 %) for oscillations in iEEG (resp. MEG). A subset of SOZ regions were detected by one type of discharges but not the other (25 % for spikes and 8 % for oscillations). Our study suggests that spike and oscillatory activities involve overlapping but distinct networks, and are complementary for presurgical mapping.

Recently, a few efforts on CCA-based SSVEP methods have been made to demonstrate the benefits for brain computer interface (BCI). Most of these methods are limited to linear CCA. In this paper consider a deep extension of CCA where input data are processed through multiple layers before their correlations are computed. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to apply deep CCA (DCCA) to the task of frequency component extraction in SSVEP. Our empirical study demonstrates that DCCA extracts more robust feature, which has significantly higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) compared to those of CCA, and it results in better performance in classification with the averaged accuracy of 92%.

Neural oscillatory changes in WM were examined by varying temporal WM load. Electroencephalography was obtained from 18 subjects performing a temporal version of the visual n-back WM task (n = 1 or 2). Electroencephalography revealed that posterior alpha power decreased and temporal region-distributed beta power increased as WM load increased. This result is consistent with previous findings that posterior alpha band reflects inhibition of task-irrelevant information. Furthermore, findings from this study suggest that temporal region-distributed beta band activity is engaged in the active maintenance of temporal duration in WM.

We evaluated whether electroencephalography (EEG) and multimodality monitoring parameters may facilitate assessment of consciousness in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 83 consecutively treated adults with subarachnoid hemorrhage. All patients were initially comatose and had invasive brain monitoring placed. Behavioral assessments were performed during daily interruption of sedation and categorized into 3 groups based on their best examination as (1) comatose, (2) arousable (eye opening or attending toward a stimulus), and (3) aware (command following). EEG features included spectral power and complexity measures. Comparisons were made using bootstrapping methods and partial least squares regression. Results: We identified 389 artifact-free EEG clips following behavioral assessments. Increasing central gamma, posterior alpha, and diffuse theta-delta oscillations differentiated patients who were arousable from those in coma. Command following was characterized by a further increase in central gamma and posterior alpha, as well as an increase in alpha permutation entropy. These EEG features together with basic neurological examinations (eg, pupillary light reflex) contributed heavily to a linear model predicting behavioral state, whereas brain physiology measures (eg, brain oxygenation), structural injury, and clinical course added less. Interpretation: EEG measures of behavioral states provide distinctive signatures that complement behavioral assessments of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage shortly after the injury. Our data support the hypothesis that impaired connectivity of cortex with both central thalamus and basal forebrain underlies decreasing levels of consciousness.

A hypothesis is set that the 3D materials are better than the 2D materials for learning and memory recall. To test the hypothesis, we proposed a classification system that will predict true or false recall for short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) after learning by either 2D or 3D educational contents. For this purpose, EEG brain signals are recorded during learning and testing; the signals are then analysed in the time domain using different types of features in various frequency bands. The features are then fed into a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. The experimental results indicate that the learning and memory recall using 2D and 3D contents do not have significant differences for both the STM and the LTM.

The key technique for rehabilitation system is the feature extraction of Motor Imagery Electroencephalography (MI-EEG), which is a nonlinear time-varying and nonstationary signal with remarkable time-frequency characteristic. Though a few people have made efforts to explore the nonlinear nature from the perspective of manifold learning, they hardly take into full account both time-frequency feature and nonlinear nature. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method is proposed based on the Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) algorithm and DWT. The multiscale multiresolution analysis is implemented for MI-EEG by DWT. LLE is applied to the approximation components to extract the nonlinear features, and the statistics of the detail components are calculated to obtain the time-frequency features. Then, the two features are combined serially. A backpropagation neural network is optimized by genetic algorithm and employed as a classifier to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiment results of 10-fold cross validation on a public BCI Competition dataset show that the nonlinear features visually display obvious clustering distribution and the fused features improve the classification accuracy and stability. This paper successfully achieves application of manifold learning in BCI.

MEG/EEG also provides different categories of neuronal indices including activity magnitude, connectivity, and network properties along the three dimensions. In the last 20 years, interest has increased in inter-regional connectivity and complex network properties assessed by various sophisticated scientific analyses. We herein review the definition, computation, short history, and pros and cons of connectivity and complex network (graph-theory) analyses applied to MEG/EEG signals. We briefly describe recent developments in source reconstruction algorithms essential for source-space connectivity and network analyses. Furthermore, we discuss a relatively novel approach used in MEG/EEG studies to examine the complex dynamics represented by human brain activity. The correct and effective use of these neuronal metrics provides a new insight into the multi dimensional dynamics of the neural representations of various functions in the complex human brain.

In both of these conditions, participants wore VO liquid crystal spectacles which allowed the experimenter to accurately control visual information being presented or occluded to the participant. Alpha band (8-13 Hz) revealed significant differences in channel-averaged power spectrum in these two conditions, but not theta band (4-8 Hz) and beta band (13-30 Hz). In order to determine which channels contributed to these bands, region-averaged and single-channel power spectrum were computed which revealed similar patterns for eyes-open (VT) and eyes-closed (VO) conditions in each band. COP analysis was performed to understand postural steadiness in VT and VO conditions; the analysis indicated significant and larger time-domain distance measures (mean velocity), time-domain hybrid measures (mean frequency and sway area) and frequency domain measures (centroidal frequency) in the VO condition. The increased of alpha power in most frontal and posterior regions was indicative of the cortical processing of vision.

Over the past decade, several methods have been proposed in time, frequency and time-frequency domain to accurately isolate ictal EEG activities from artifacts. Among denoising approaches Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are widely used. Denoising based on Generalized EigenValue Decomposition (GEVD) is one of the Semi-Blind Source Separation (SBSS) methods which has been recently proposed. In the GEVD-based method, a couple of time-frequency covariance matrices are used. These time-frequency (TF) covariance matrices are calculated in the time-frequency domain using a special time-frequency mask. This time-frequency mask is extracted based on the time-frequency signature corresponding to the time-frequency spectrum of an ictal source obtained by CCA. In this paper, we use MultiScale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA) in order to extract the time-frequency mask. To this end, a novel SBSS method, called CCA-MSPCA-TF-GEVD, is proposed and the efficacy of CCA-MSPCA-TF-GEVD compared with that of CCA, ICA and CCA-TF-GEVD is presented.

The functional state of these networks is defined by the amplitude and phase of ongoing oscillations of neuronal populations at different frequencies. The contribution of functionally different cortical networks has yet to be elucidated, and only a clear dependence of sensory perception on prestimulus alpha oscillations has been clearly identified. Here, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large sample of healthy participants to investigate how ongoing fluctuations in the activity of different cortical networks affect the perception of subsequent nociceptive stimuli. We observed that prestimulus EEG oscillations in the alpha (at bilateral central regions) and gamma (at parietal regions) bands negatively modulated the perception of subsequent stimuli. Combining information about alpha and gamma oscillations predicted subsequent perception significantly more accurately than either measure alone. In a parallel experiment, we found that prestimulus fMRI activity also modulated the perception of subsequent stimuli: perceptual ratings were higher when the BOLD signal was higher in nodes of the sensorimotor network and lower in nodes of the default mode network. Similar to what observed in the EEG data, prediction accuracy was improved when the amplitude of prestimulus BOLD signals in both networks was combined. These findings provide a comprehensive physiological basis to the idea that dynamic changes in brain state determine forthcoming behavioral outcomes.

Hierarchical Clustering of the Electroencephalogram Spectral Coherence to Study the Changes in Brain Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease	2016 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) held as part of IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (IEEE WCCI)	JUL 24-29, 2016	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolutionary Programming Soc, IET, IEEE BigData Initiat, Gulf Univ Sci & Technol			EEG COHERENCE; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; POWER; COMPUTATION; DEMENTIA; MODELS	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disorder characterized by a loss of functional connections between different areas of the brain. AD is considered a cortical dementia, thus Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used as a tool for diagnosing AD for the last two decades. Often, the hallmarks of EEG abnormality in AD patients are a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies and reduced coherences among cortical regions, however, it is still mostly unknown how these abnormalities evolve together with the disease progression. In this paper we proposed a longitudinal study of the EEG of three AD patients in order to study the disease progression, from the coherence point of view, over the four major EEG sub-bands: delta, theta, alpha and beta. The EEG was recorded at time T0 and then after three months (time T1). We proposed a coherence based hierarchical clustering method to group the electrodes together according to their mutual pairwise coherence, in order to evaluate how the brain connectivity changed along with the disease in the spectral domain. The results provide an in-depth view of the structure of electrode interconnection of every single patient in every sub-band at time T0 and time T1. This study endorsed the commonly shared belief that coherence reduces over time but it revealed that coherence spatial distribution changes in a different way, from patient to patient. The results also showed that a patient-specific brain connectivity analysis is possible and that a personalized analysis of the disease's progression might provide valuable diagnostic information. In the near future, the study will be extended to a larger dataset in order to validate the method statistically.

By applying an automatic technique, we explored the spatial characteristics of ripples (80-250 Hz), fast ripples (250-500 Hz) and spikes using human iEEG data recorded in 5 patients with refractory temporal epilepsy, and related our results to clinician-identified SOZ. Fast ripples, which generally appeared within the spiking regions, reached 100% of specificity when used for SOZ approximation, whereas spikes showed highest sensitivity of 92%. Our results indicate that the information of HFOs and spikes can be fused together to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease. Automatic detectors can be used efficiently to identify different types of neural activities, and thus facilitate the accurate delineation of SOZ.

We hypothesize that the comprehensive electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation can determine AED efficacy in epileptic children. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the alteration of characteristics of interictal EEG during the AED therapy. Methods: Forty-three children aged 3-9 were investigated. EEGs were recorded three times: prior to valproic acid-Depakine (Dep) monotherapy and twice under the Dep therapy (at three and six/eight months). Baseline EEG was analyzed for quantitative characteristics of interictal EEG, such as absolute values of the power (AVP) spectra and EEG topography/brain mapping. The study involved epileptiform EEG and clinical condition assessments. Results: Dep decreased AVP spectra in a low-frequency range, suppressed spontaneous epileptic discharge, and spike-wave complex 3/s. Dep partially decreased spikes-polyspikes, sharp waves, and generalized paroxysmal bursts during functional trials. Dep did not diminish rhythmic monomorphic theta-waves (RMT) of tempo-parietal localization observed by brain mapping. The presence of RMT correlated with the reocurrence of seizures if Dep was withdrawn. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the presence of RMT with tempo-parietal localization on the interictal EEG can anticipate reocurrence of seizures if Dep dose will be reduced or withdrawn. The efficacy of the AED therapy can be revealed via reduction of low-frequency waves and suppression of epileptiform EEG elements parallel to clinical improvement. Thus, optimal treatment strategies can be tailored based on the evaluation of background EEG characteristics using spectral analysis, EEG mapping, and the quantitative EEG approach.

Epileptic Electroencephalography Profile Associates with Attention Problems in Children with Fragile X Syndrome: Review and Case Series	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						fragile X syndrome; electroencephalography; clinical case series; endophenotype; attention deficit disorder; neurofeedback	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; QUANTITATIVE EEG; NEUROFEEDBACK; ADHD; AUTISM; MALES; GENE; HYPERACTIVITY; METAANALYSIS; SPECIFICITY	Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and a variant of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The FXS population is quite heterogeneous with respect to comorbidities, which implies the need for a personalized medicine approach, relying on biomarkers or endophenotypes to guide treatment. There is evidence that quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) endophenotype-guided treatments can support increased clinical benefit by considering the patient's neurophysiological profile. We describe a case series of 11 children diagnosed with FXS, aged one to 14 years, mean 4.6 years. Case data are based on longitudinal clinically-observed reports by attending physicians for comorbid symptoms including awake and asleep EEG profiles. We tabulate the comorbid EEG symptoms in this case series, and relate them to the literature on EEG endophenotypes and associated treatment options. The two most common endophenotypes in the data were diffuse slow oscillations and epileptiform EEG, which have been associated with attention and epilepsy respectively. This observation agrees with reported prevalence of comorbid behavioral symptoms for FXS. In this sample of FXS children, attention problems were found in 37% (4 of 11), and epileptic seizures in 45% (5 of 11). Attention problems were found to associate with the epilepsy endophenotype. From the synthesis of this case series and literature review, we argue that the evidence-based personalized treatment approach, exemplified by neurofeedback, could benefit FXS children by focusing on observable, specific characteristics of comorbid disease symptoms.

Methods: Intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in 13 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. HFOs between 80 and 200 Hz were semi-automatically detected from total 15-min EEG epochs each for REM and slow wave sleep (SWS). z-Score of HFO occurrence rate was calculated from the baseline rate derived from non-epileptogenic cortex. Intracranial electrodes were labeled as REM dominant HFO (RdH) if REM z-score was greater than SWS z-score or as SWS dominant HFO (SdH) if SWS z-score was greater than REM z-score. Relationship of electrode location to the area of surgical resection was compared between RdH and SdH electrodes. Results: Out of 1070 electrodes, 101 were defined as RdH electrodes and 115 as SdH electrodes. RdH electrodes were associated with the area of resection in patients with postoperative seizure freedom (P < 0.001), but not in patients without seizure freedom. Conclusions: HFOs near the epileptogenic zone are less suppressed during REM. Significance: The less suppressive effect of REM may provide a specific marker of epileptogenicity.

J	Khan, NA; Ali, S				Khan, Nabeel A.; Ali, Sadiq			CLASSIFICATION OF EEG SIGNALS USING ADAPTIVE TIME-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS	METROLOGY AND MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Adaptive Directional Time-Frequency Distribution; EEG signals; Time-Frequency features; Pattern recognition	SEIZURE DETECTION; REPRESENTATION; DESIGN	Time-Frequency (t-f) distributions are frequently employed for analysis of new-born EEG signals because of their non-stationary characteristics. Most of the existing time-frequency distributions fail to concentrate energy for a multicomponent signal having multiple directions of energy distribution in the t-f domain. In order to analyse such signals, we propose an Adaptive Directional Time-Frequency Distribution (ADTFD). The ADTFD outperforms other adaptive kernel and fixed kernel TFDs in terms of its ability to achieve high resolution for EEG seizure signals. It is also shown that the ADTFD can be used to define new time-frequency features that can lead to better classification of EEG signals, e.g. the use of the ADTFD leads to 97.5% total accuracy, which is by 2% more than the results achieved by the other methods.

The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of Hindustani music on brain activity during normal relaxing conditions using electroencephalography (EEG). Ten male healthy subjects without special musical education participated in the study. EEG signals were acquired at the frontal (F3/F4) lobes of the brain while listening to music at three experimental conditions (rest, with music and without music). Frequency analysis was done for the alpha, theta and gamma brain rhythms. The finding shows that arousal based activities were enhanced while listening to Hindustani music of contrasting emotions (romantic/sorrow) for all the subjects in case of alpha frequency bands while no significant changes were observed in gamma and theta frequency ranges. It has been observed that when the music stimulus is removed, arousal activities as evident from alpha brain rhythms remain for some time, showing residual arousal. This is analogous to the conventional 'Hysteresis' loop where the system retains some 'memory' of the former state. This is corroborated in the non linear analysis (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) of the alpha rhythms as manifested in values of fractal dimension. After an input of music conveying contrast emotions, withdrawal of music shows more retention as evidenced by the values of fractal dimension. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of EEG signal by flicker-noise spectroscopy: identification of right-/left-hand movement imagination	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Flicker-noise spectroscopy (FNS); Movement imagination (MI); Electroencephalography (EEG); Brain-computer interface (BCI)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MENTAL PRACTICE; MOTOR IMAGERY; MU-RHYTHM; DESYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	Flicker-noise spectroscopy (FNS) is a general phenomenological approach to analyzing dynamics of complex nonlinear systems by extracting information contained in chaotic signals. The main idea of FNS is to describe an information hidden in correlation links, which are present in the chaotic component of the signal, by a set of parameters. In the paper, FNS is used for the analysis of electroencephalography signal related to the hand movement imagination. The signal has been parametrized in accordance with the FNS method, and significant changes in the FNS parameters have been observed, at the time when the subject imagines the movement. For the right-hand movement imagination, abrupt changes (visible as a peak) of the parameters, calculated for the data recorded from the left hemisphere, appear at the time corresponding to the initial moment of the imagination. In contrary, for the left-hand movement imagination, the meaningful changes in the parameters are observed for the data recorded from the right hemisphere. As the motor cortex is activated mainly contralaterally to the hand, the analysis of the FNS parameters allows to distinguish between the imagination of the right-and left-hand movement. This opens its potential application in the brain-computer interface.

In particular, we focus on methodological platforms based on electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Key aspects of experimental setup, data acquisition, data preprocessing, and analysis are described and discussed with emphasis on recordings performed on the infant brain. The measurement and estimation of large-scale brain network connectivity using fMRI and EEG has become an important tool to study brain development. To this end, we describe central findings regarding the large-scale brain network architecture of the infant brain. Further, data analysis strategies pertaining to the investigation brain connectivity are described together with a discussion of their advantages and pitfalls.

Multiclass Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential Frequency Evaluation Using Chirp-Modulated Stimuli	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs); canonical correlation analysis (CCA); feature selection; genetic algorithms (GAs); steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs)		Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are oscillations of the electroencephalogram (EEG) which are mainly observed over the occipital area that exhibits a frequency corresponding to a repetitively flashing visual stimulus. SSVEPs have proven to be very consistent and reliable signals for rapid EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) control. While a subject-specific SSVEP stimulus frequency optimization is ideal, this can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Thus, many studies select SSVEP stimulation frequencies somewhat arbitrarily. There is no standardized set of SSVEP stimulus frequencies or frequency selection method, and some studies even claim conflicting frequency ranges for optimal performance. In this work, 17 subjects were stimulated with an LED array that flashed according to a chirp-modulated signal having a frequency that varied linearly over the typical functional range of SSVEP. The resulting EEG was analyzed using canonical correlation analysis and a genetic algorithm was implemented to determine generalized stimulation frequency sets over a continuum of simulated multiclass BCI classification scenarios. The results show that distinct frequency feature groupings exist over the different multiclass scenarios, and that these groupings result in different information transfer rates. These offline results can provide a guide for generalized stimulus frequency selection for SSVEP-based BCIs with an arbitrary number of targets.

Ripples often co-occur with spikes. We investigated the spatiotemporal relation between spikes and ripples, and differences between spikes that do and do not co-occur with ripples. Methods: We marked 50 time points with spikes in bipolar surface EEG during NREM sleep in patients with focal or multifocal epilepsy. We marked ripples that occurred with spikes and calculated parameters relating spikes and ripples: the duration, amplitude and slope of spikes, the timing of the start of ripples and spikes and the proportion of overlap. Results: In total 219 ripples and 5995 individual spikes were marked in 31 patients. Spikes with ripples were on average shorter, had higher amplitude and higher slope than spikes without ripples. 64% of ripples started before spikes started. Spikes occurred on 13 (5-26) channels per patient, and ripples on 3 (0-14) channels, which were also spike channels. Conclusion: Ripples precede rather than follow spikes, so ripples are unlikely to result from spikes. Significance: Ripples and spikes seem not one-on-one coupled, but certain states of the brain can accommodate both. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

There is a need to analyze huge volumes of EEG data for finding the epileptic seizures. The manual analysis of EEG records for identifying seizure manifestations is time-consuming and creates an immense workload for the physician. To reduce the EEG analysis time, an autonomous epilepsy detection system is proposed using a Time-Frequency(TF) entropy measure. First, the TF spectrum of the EEG signal is computed using the S-transform(ST). Then the entropy measure is determined from the TF spectrum. The performance metrics of the proposed entropy index is measured using a least square support vector machine(LSSVM) classifier. The proposed entropy feature produced a highest classification accuracy of 86% when validated with Bern-Barcelona EEG dataset. The area under curve(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) plot for the proposed entropy feature is 0.914. The average computational time for extracting the proposed entropy feature is 0.4027s. The proposed Time-Frequency entropy feature is analyzed in terms of classification accuracy and computation time.

Most of these studies demonstrate that placebo significantly decreased neural activities in pain modulatory brain regions and pain-evoked potentials. This study examined placebo analgesia-related effects on spontaneous brain oscillations. We examined placebo effects on four order-fixed 20-min conditions in two sessions: isotonic saline-induced control conditions (with/without placebo) followed by hypertonic saline-induced tonic muscle pain conditions (with/without placebo) in 19 subjects using continuous electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Placebo treatment exerted significant analgesic effects in 14 placebo responders, as subjective intensity of pain perception decreased. Frequency analyses were performed on whole continuous EEG data, data during pain perception rating and data after rating. The results in the first two cases revealed that placebo induced significant increases and a trend toward significant increases in the amplitude of alpha oscillation during tonic muscle pain compared to control conditions in frontal-central regions of the brain, respectively. Placebo-induced decreases in the subjective intensity of pain perception significantly and positively correlated with the increases in the amplitude of alpha oscillations during pain conditions. In conclusion, the modulation effect of placebo treatment was captured when the pain perception evaluating period was included. The strong correlation between the placebo effect on reported pain perception and alpha amplitude suggest that alpha oscillations in frontal-central regions serve as a cortical oscillatory basis of the placebo effect on tonic muscle pain. These results provide important evidence for the investigation of objective indicators of the placebo effect.

The current study applies concepts from graph theory to investigate the differences in lagged phase functional connectivity using the average resting state EEG of 311 tinnitus patients and 256 healthy controls. The primary finding of the study was a significant increase in connectivity in beta and gamma oscillations and a significant reduction in connectivity in the lower frequencies for the tinnitus group. There also seems to be parallel processing of long-distance information between delta, theta, alpha1 and gamma frequency bands that is significantly stronger in the tinnitus group. While the network reorganizes into a more regular topology in the low frequency carrier oscillations, development of a more random topology is witnessed in the high frequency oscillations. In summary, tinnitus can be regarded as a maladaptive 'disconnection' syndrome, which tries to both stabilize into a regular topology and broadcast the presence of a deafferentation-based bottom-up prediction error as a result of a top-down prediction.

P.; Lachaux, Jean-Philippe; Baillet, Sylvain; Jerbi, Karim			A multivariate method for estimating cross-frequency neuronal interactions and correcting linear mixing in MEG data, using canonical correlations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Multivariate analysis; Canonical correlation analysis; Cross-frequency coupling; Functional connectivity; Linear mixing correction	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-POWER; EEG DATA; BRAIN; NETWORK; ALPHA	Background: Cross-frequency interactions between distinct brain areas have been observed in connection with a variety of cognitive tasks. With electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) data, typical connectivity measures between two brain regions analyze a single quantity from each region within a specific frequency band; given the wideband nature of EEG/MEG signals, many statistical tests may be required to identify true coupling. Furthermore, because of the poor spatial resolution of activity reconstructed from EEG/MEG, some interactions may actually be due to the linear mixing of brain sources. New method: In the present work, a method for the detection of cross-frequency functional connectivity in MEG data using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is described. We demonstrate that CCA identifies correlated signals and also the frequencies that cause the correlation. We also implement a procedure to deal with linear mixing based on symmetry properties of cross-covariance matrices. Results: Our tests with both simulated and real MEG data demonstrate that CCA is able to detect interacting locations and the frequencies that cause them, while accurately discarding spurious coupling. Comparison with existing methods: Recent techniques look at time delays in the activity between two locations to discard spurious interactions, while we propose a linear mixing model and demonstrate its relationship with symmetry aspects of cross-covariance matrices. Conclusions: Our tests indicate the benefits of the CCA approach in connectivity studies, as it allows the simultaneous evaluation of several possible combinations of cross-frequency interactions in a single statistical test.

FOs can be of physiologic origin associated to sensory processing and memory consolidation. In epilepsy, FOs are of pathologic origin and biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone. Seventeen patients with focal epilepsy previously confirmed with identified FOs in scalp electroencephalography (EEG) were evaluated. To handle data deriving from large number of sensors (275 axial gradiometers) we used an automatic detector with high sensitivity. False positives were discarded by two human experts. MSI of the FOs was performed with the wavelet based maximum entropy on the mean method. We found FOs in 11/17 patients, in only one patient the channel with highest FO rate was not concordant with the epileptogenic region and might correspond to physiologic oscillations. MEG FOs rates were very low: 0.02-4.55 per minute. Compared to scalp EEG, detection sensitivity was lower, but the specificity higher in MEG. MSI of FOs showed concordance or partial concordance with proven generators of seizures and epileptiform activity in 10/11 patients. We have validated the proposed framework for the non-invasive study of FOs with MEG. The excellent overall concordance with other clinical gold standard evaluation tools indicates that MEG FOs can provide relevant information to guide implantation for intracranial EEG pre-surgical evaluation and for surgical treatment, and demonstrates the important added value of choosing appropriate FOs detection and source localization methods.

High-resolution time-frequency analysis of EEG signals using multiscale radial basis functions	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						EEG signals; Multiscale radial basis functions; Modified PSO algorithm; System identification; Time-varying models; Time-frequency spectra	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; NONSTATIONARY SIGNALS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SERIES; WAVELETS	An efficient time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) modeling approach using the multiscale radial basis functions (MRBF) method is presented for nonstationary signal processing, with applications to time frequency analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG). In this new parametric modeling framework, the time-varying coefficients in the WAR model are approximated by using MRBF that can better identify time-varying parameters with a variety of dynamic processes in nonstationary signals. Thus, the time varying modeling problem is simplified to optimal scale determination of MRBF and parameter estimation, which can be effectively resolved by a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and an ordinary least square (OLS) algorithm, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a comparison with recursive least squares (RLS) and the Legendre polynomials expansion method for a synthesized EEG signal is performed. Results demonstrated that the proposed approach could indeed provide optimal time-frequency resolution as compared to RLS and Legendre polynomials expansion. The new WAR modeling approach was also applied to the analysis of experimental EEG signals to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We use the recently developed method of mapping time series into directed horizontal graphs (dHVG). Each node of the dHVG represents a time point in the original intracranial EEG (iEEG) signal. Statistically significant differences between the distributions of the nodes' number of input and output connections are used to detect time-irreversible iEEG signals. Results: In 31 of 32 seizure recordings we found time-irreversible iEEG signals. The maximally time-irreversible signals always occurred during seizures, with highest probability in the middle of the first seizure half. These signals spanned a large range of frequencies and amplitudes but were all characterized by saw-tooth like shaped components. Brain regions removed from patients who became post-surgically seizure-free generated significantly larger time-irreversibilities than regions removed from patients who still had seizures after surgery. Conclusions: Our results corroborate that ictal time-irreversible iEEG signals can indeed serve as markers of the epileptogenic zone and can be efficiently detected and quantified in a time-resolved manner by dHVG based methods. Significance: Ictal time-irreversible EEG signals can help to improve pre-surgical evaluation in patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant epilepsies.

Selected time-frequency components from single-channel frontal EEG were extracted and formed a statistical multivariate model predicting user enjoyment level. Frequency components from Theta, Alpha and Beta bands at different time moments were selected. We found robust model performance during 10-folds cross-validation with 100 repetitions. A high correlation of around 0.8 between predicted and actual enjoyment level of subjects was achieved. Considering various factors of the selected features, we found an important role of alpha as the emotional component, and beta as the cognitive component involved in the complex enjoyment processes. Also, in accordance with the peak-end rule, feature from latter part of the video seems to create a large influence to the overall experience. From all of these results, we implement real-time EEG-based detection system for media user enjoyment with single EEG channel.

J	Myrden, A; Chau, T				Myrden, Andrew; Chau, Tom			Feature clustering for robust frequency-domain classification of EEG activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Brain-computer interface; Feature extraction; Feature selection	FEATURE-SELECTION; ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; ALERTNESS; ALGORITHM; CRITERIA; GENDER; AGE	Background: The analysis of electroencephalograms is often performed in the frequency-domain. These analyses typically involve the computation of spectral power either over pre-defined frequency bands (e.g. theta, delta, alpha, and beta bands) or over a large number of narrow frequency ranges. However, the former technique ignores variability in these frequency bands over time and between participants while the latter ignores the significant redundancy between these powers. New method: This paper details an unsupervised feature extraction method for EEG data that uses a clustering of features to agglomerate narrow-band spectral powers based on their similarities. This method computes a set of analogues to the traditional frequency bands that are data-driven and participant specific. A fast correlation-based filter was used to identify which of these agglomerated features were most useful for each investigated classification problem. Results: The new feature clustering algorithm was used to detect changes in three mental states and to detect the performance of three mental tasks. Balanced classification accuracies approaching or exceeding 70% were attained for all classification problems. Comparison to existing methods: Classification accuracies attained by this algorithm were compared to those attained by two frequency-domain algorithms that did not employ clustering - a wide-band algorithm based on the spectral power within the theta, delta, alpha, and beta bands and a narrow-band algorithm based on the spectral power within 1-Hz ranges. Overall, the feature clustering algorithm was statistically superior to both alternative algorithms. Conclusions: The new feature clustering algorithm provides a promising alternative to conventional frequency-domain EEG analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG recordings for four repetitions of the syllable (/ta/) under two different conditions (non modified and modified) were collected for one group of 13 full-term and two groups of preterm infants differing in language production performance; 15 infants had high scores (HS), and 14 had low scores (LS). Full-term and HS preterm infants showed significant decreases in amplitude for syllable repetition in both conditions. LS preterm infants showed a decrease only in the modified syllable condition, suggesting a facilitation effect of modified syllables in the LS preterm group. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite significant progress, roughly half of all patients undergoing focal surgical resection, and most patients receiving focal electrical stimulation, are not seizure free. There is intense interest in high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) recorded with intracranial electroencephalography as potential biomarkers to improve epileptogenic brain localization, resective surgery, and focal electrical stimulation. The present review examines the evidence that HFOs are clinically useful biomarkers.Recent findingsPerforming the PubMed search High-Frequency Oscillations and Epilepsy' for 2013-2015 identifies 308 articles exploring HFO characteristics, physiological significance, and potential clinical applications.SummaryThere is strong evidence that HFOs are spatially associated with epileptic brain. There remain, however, significant challenges for clinical translation of HFOs as epileptogenic brain biomarkers: Differentiating true HFO from the high-frequency power changes associated with increased neuronal firing and bandpass filtering sharp transients. Distinguishing pathological HFO from normal physiological HFO. Classifying tissue under individual electrodes as normal or pathological. Sharing data and algorithms so research results can be reproduced across laboratories. Multicenter prospective trials to provide definitive evidence of clinical utility.

Change in Mean Frequency of Resting-State Electroencephalography after Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						tDCS; DLPFC; healthy volunteer; cortical oscillations; EEG mean frequency	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; TDCS; EXCITABILITY; MEMORY; DEPRESSION; SYNCHRONIZATION	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is proposed as a tool to investigate cognitive functioning in healthy people and as a treatment for various neuropathological disorders. However, the underlying cortical mechanisms remain poorly understood. We aim to investigate whether resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to monitor the effects of tDCS on cortical activity. To this end we tested whether the spectral content of ongoing EEG activity is significantly different after a single session of active tDCS compared to sham stimulation. Twenty participants were tested in a sham-controlled, randomized, crossover design. Resting-state EEG was acquired before, during and after active tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (15 min of 2 mA tDCS) and sham stimulation. Electrodes with a diameter of 3.14 cm(2) were used for EEG and tDCS. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to examine differences in power spectral density (PSD) and the EEG mean frequency to quantify the slowing of EEG activity after stimulation. PLS revealed a significant increase in spectral power at frequencies below 15 Hz and a decrease at frequencies above 15 Hz after active tDCS (P = 0.001). The EEG mean frequency was significantly reduced after both active tDCS (P < 0.0005) and sham tDCS (P = 0.001), though the decrease in mean frequency was smaller after sham tDCS than after active tDCS (P = 0.073). Anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC using a high current density bi-frontal electrode montage resulted in general slowing of resting-state EEG. The similar findings observed following sham stimulation question whether the standard sham protocol is an appropriate control condition for tDCS.

Changes in electrocorticographic beta frequency components precede spreading depolarization in patients with acute brain injury	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Spreading depolarization; Ketamine; Beta frequency; EEG	SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; DEPRESSION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; KETAMINE; TRAUMA; PREDICTION; CLUSTERS	Objective: Spreading depolarization (SD) occurs after traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, malignant hemispheric stroke and intracranial hemorrhage. SD has been associated with secondary brain injury, which can be reduced by ketamine. In this present study frequency bands of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings were investigated with regards to SDs. Methods: A total of 43 patients after acute brain injury were included in this retrospective and explorative study. Relative delta 0.5-4 Hz, theta 4-8 Hz, alpha 8-13 Hz and beta 13-40 Hz bands were analyzed with regards to SD occurrence and analgesic and sedative administration. Higher frequencies, including gamma 40-70 Hz, fast gamma 70-100 Hz and high frequency oscillations 100-200 Hz were analyzed in a subset of patients with a sampling rate of up to 400 Hz. Results: A close association of relative beta frequency and SD was found. Relative beta frequency was suppressed up to two hours prior to SD when compared to hours with no SD. This finding was partially explained by administration of ketamine. Even after removal of all patient data during administration of ketamine, SDs occurred predominantly during times with low relative beta frequency in a patientin-dependent analysis. Conclusion: Suppression of beta frequency by ketamine or without ketamine is associated with low SD counts. Significance: Alteration of beta frequency might help to predict occurrence of SDs in acutely brain injured patients. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Therefore, it is essential to support numerical learning from basic to more advanced competency levels. From educational psychology it is known that learning is most effective when the respective content is neither too easy nor too demanding in relation to learners' prerequisites. However, so far it is difficult to assess individual's cognitive workload independently from performance to adapt learning environments accordingly. In the present study, we aim at identifying learners' cognitive workload induced by addition tasks of varying difficulty using electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, a classifier using specific features in the EEG-signal is trained to differentiate between different levels of task difficulty significantly above chance level and with high consistency over all participants. Importantly, our model even allows for the prediction of cognitive demands induced by the addition tasks in a cross-participant approach. Closer inspection of the crucial EEG features indicates that oscillations in the theta and alpha band recorded from parietal electrodes are most reflective of current task difficulty. In summary, we are able to differentiate cognitive workload of participants independently from performance based on data of only a small number of electrodes. This suggests that a reduced EEG-setup combined with cross-participant classification may be a feasible approach to assess learners' cognitive workload.

The present work introduces a biosignal processing approach, suggesting a computational resource to estimate coherent or synchronised interactions as an eventual supportive aid in the diagnosis of primary insomnia and schizophrenia pathologies. By deploying linear, nonlinear and statistical methods upon 25 electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic overnight sleep recordings, the assessment of cross-correlation, wavelet coherence and : phase synchronisation is focused on tracking discerning features amongst the clinical cohorts. Our results indicate that certain neuronal oscillations interact with cardiac power bands in distinctive ways responding to standardised sleep stages and patient groups, which promotes the hypothesis of subtle functional dynamics between neuronal assembles and (para)sympathetic activity subject to pathophysiological conditions.

However, an important limitation of the available fMRI studies is that hemodynamic signals only provide an indirect measure of the neuronal activity. In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures electrophysiological activity of the brain. However, little is known about the brain-wide organization of such spontaneous neuronal population signals at the resting state. It is not entirely clear if or how the network structure built upon slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals is represented in terms of fast, dynamic, and spontaneous neuronal activity. In this study, we investigated the electrophysiological representation of RSNs from simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI data in the resting human brain. We developed a data-driven analysis approach that reconstructed multiple large-scale electrophysiological networks from high-resolution EEG data alone. The networks derived from EEG were then compared with RSNs independently derived from simultaneously acquired fMRI in their spatial structures as well as temporal dynamics. Results reveal spatially and temporally specific electrophysiological correlates for the fMRI-RSNs. Findings suggest that the spontaneous activity of various large-scale cortical networks is reflected in macroscopic EEG potentials.

Encephalography Connectivity on Sources in Male Nonsmokers after Nicotine Administration during the Resting State	NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Pharmacology; Encephalography; Connectivity; Resting state; Eyes-closed condition; Eyes-open condition	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GAMMA-POWER; EEG DATA; BRAIN; PHASE; LOCALIZATION; FREQUENCY; VIGILANCE; OSCILLATIONS	We present an encephalography (EEG) connectivity study where 30 healthy male nonsmokers were randomly allocated either to a nicotine group (14 subjects, 7 mg of transdermal nicotine) or to a placebo group. EEG activity was recorded in an eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) condition before and after drug administration. This is a reanalysis of a previous dataset. Through a source reconstruction procedure, we extracted 13 time series representing 13 sources belonging to a resting-state network. Here, we conducted connectivity analysis (renormalized partial directed coherence; rPDC) on sources, focusing on the frequency range of 8.5-18.4 Hz, subdivided into 3 frequency bands (alpha(1), alpha(2), and beta(1)) with the hypothesis that an increase in vigilance would modulate connectivity. Furthermore, a phase-amplitude coupling (mean resultant vector length; VL) analysis, was performed investigating whether an increase of vigilance would modulate phase-amplitude coupling. In the VL analysis we estimated the coupling of the phases of 3 low frequencies (alpha(1), alpha(2), and beta(1)), respectively, with the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations (30-40 Hz, low.). With rPDC we found that during the EC condition, nicotine decreased feedback connectivity (from the precentral gyrus to precuneus, angular gyrus, cuneus and superior occipital gyrus) at 10.5-12.4 Hz. The VL analysis showed nicotine-induced increases in coupling at 10.5-18.4 Hz in the precuneus, cuneus and superior occipital gyrus during the EC condition. During the EO condition, no significant results were found in connectivity or phase-amplitude coupling measures at any frequency range. In conclusion, the results suggest that nicotine potentially increases the level of vigilance in the EC condition. (C) 2016 S.

In particular, of the studies that have been carried out in humans over the last 30 years, none has investigated how vestibular stimulation (VS) affects cortical oscillations. Here we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy human subjects and a group of bilateral vestibular loss patients (BVPs) undergoing transient and constant-velocity passive whole body yaw rotations, focusing our analyses on the modulation of cortical oscillations in response to natural VS. The present approach overcame significant technical challenges associated with combining natural VS with human electrophysiology and reveals that both transient and constant-velocity VS are associated with a prominent suppression of alpha power (8-13 Hz). Alpha band suppression was localized over bilateral temporo-parietal scalp regions, and these alpha modulations were significantly smaller in BVPs. We propose that suppression of oscillations in the alpha band over temporo-parietal scalp regions reflects cortical vestibular processing, potentially comparable with alpha and mu oscillations in the visual and sensorimotor systems, respectively, opening the door to the investigation of human cortical processing under various experimental conditions during natural VS.

Posterior resting state EEG asymmetries are associated with hedonic valuation of food	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Resting state asymmetry; Brain oscillations; Electroencephalography; Food; Hedonic valuation	FRONTAL BRAIN ASYMMETRY; RIGHT PARIETAL CORTEX; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; AFFECTIVE RESPONSES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; TASTE ATTITUDES; EATING BEHAVIOR; REWARD; INHIBITION; WEIGHT	Research on the hedonic value of food has been important in understanding the motivational and emotional correlates of normal and abnormal eating behaviour. The aim of the present study was to explore associations between hemispheric asymmetries recorded during resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) and hedonic valuation of food. Healthy adult volunteers were recruited and four minutes of resting state EEG were recorded from the scalp. Hedonic food valuation and reward sensitivity were assessed with the hedonic attitude to food and behavioural activation scale. Results showed that parieto-occipital resting state EEG asymmetries in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency range correlate with the hedonic valuation of food. Our findings suggest that self-reported sensory-related attitude towards food is associated with interhemispheric asymmetries in resting state oscillatory activity. Our findings contribute to understanding the electrophysiological correlates of hedonic valuation, and may provide an opportunity to modulate the cortical imbalance by using non-invasive brain stimulation methods to change food consumption.

Building an EEG-fMRI Multi-Modal Brain Graph: A Concurrent EEG-fMRI Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; dynamic; multi-modal; brain graph; ICA	RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; TIME-VARYING CONNECTIVITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; HUMAN CONNECTOME; HEALTHY CONTROLS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; INTEGRATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MEMORY	The topological architecture of brain connectivity has been well characterized by graph theory based analysis. However, previous studies have primarily built brain graphs based on a single modality of brain imaging data. Here we develop a framework to construct multi-modal brain graphs using concurrent EEG-fMRI data which are simultaneously collected during eyes open (EC)) and eyes closed (EC) resting states. FMRI data are decomposed into independent components with associated time courses by group independent component analysis (ICA). EEG time series are segmented, and then spectral power time courses are computed and averaged within 5 frequency bands (delta; theta; alpha; beta; low gamma). EEG-fMRI brain graphs, with EEG electrodes and fMRI brain components serving as nodes, are built by computing correlations within and between fMRI ICA time courses and EEG spectral power time courses. Dynamic EEG-fMRI graphs are built using a sliding window method, versus static ones treating the entire time course as stationary. In global level, static graph measures and properties of dynamic graph measures are different across frequency bands and are mainly showing higher values in eyes closed than eyes open. Nodal level graph measures of a few brain components are also showing higher values during eyes closed in specific frequency bands. Overall, these findings incorporate fMRI spatial localization and EEG frequency information which could not be obtained by examining only one modality. This work provides a new approach to examine EEG-fMRI associations within a graph theoretic framework with potential application to many topics.

High frequency oscillations and high frequency functional network characteristics in the intraoperative electrocorticogram in epilepsy	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Epilepsy; High Frequency Oscillations; Functional network analysis; Epileptogenic zone; Epilepsy surgery	FAST RIPPLES; EPILEPTOGENIC NETWORKS; SEIZURE ONSET; CONNECTIVITY; EEG; HZ; RECORDINGS; TOPOLOGY; SPIKES; CELLS	Objective: High frequency oscillations (HFOs; >80 Hz), especially fast ripples (FRs, 250-500 Hz), are novel biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue. The pathophysiology suggests enhanced functional connectivity within FR generating tissue. Our aim was to determine the relation between brain areas showing FRs and 'baseline' functional connectivity within EEG networks, especially in the high frequency bands. Methods: We marked FRs, ripples (80-250 Hz) and spikes in the electrocorticogram of 14 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. We assessed 'baseline' functional connectivity in epochs free of epileptiform events within these recordings, using the phase lag index. We computed the Eigenvector Centrality (EC) per channel in the FR and gamma band network. We compared EC between channels that did or did not show events at other moments in time. Results: FR-band EC was higher in channels with than without spikes. Gamma-band EC was lower in channels with ripples and FRs. Conclusions: We confirmed previous findings of functional isolation in the gamma-band and found a first proof of functional integration in the FR-band network of channels covering presumed epileptogenic tissue. Significance: 'Baseline' high-frequency network parameters might help intra-operative recognition of epileptogenic tissue without the need for waiting for events. These findings can increase our understanding of the 'architecture' of epileptogenic networks and help unravel the pathophysiology of HFOs. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A sample of 34 healthy participants was recruited and performed two tasks, Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) intelligence assessment and learning task. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded during resting state (eyes open) and in learning task. In the learning task, participants study animated contents about human anatomy and physiology for 10 minutes. In the EEG spectral analysis, all six frequency bands showed higher mean power during learning task compared to resting state in the frontal lobe, especially in FP2 and F8 locations.

EEG was decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the intrinsic local characteristic time scale. Analytic amplitude, analytic frequency, and recurrence property quantified by recurrence quantification analysis were explored on IMFs, and the first two scales revealed difference between normal EEG and hypoxia EEG. Classification accuracy of hypoxia EEG and normal EEG could reach 67.8% before decline of neurobehavioral ability, which represented that hypoxia EEG pattern could be detected at an early stage. Classification accuracy of hypoxia EEG and normal EEG increased with time and deepened intensity of hypoxia was observed by regular shift of hypoxia EEG pattern with time in a three dimensional subspace. The reduced shift and classification accuracy after intermittent hypoxic training represented that hypoxia tolerance enhanced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This leaves a blind spot lingering over the neuronal correlates of episodic memory formation in day-to-day life. To address this, we presented participants with a series of words to memorise along a pre-designated route across campus while a mobile EEG system acquired ongoing neural activity. Replicating lab-based subsequent memory effects (SMEs), we identified significant low to mid frequency power decreases (< 30 Hz), including beta power decreases over the left inferior frontal gyrus. When investigating the oscillatory correlates of temporal and spatial context binding, we found that items strongly bound to spatial context exhibited significantly greater theta power decreases than items strongly bound to temporal context. These findings expand upon lab-based studies by demonstrating the influence of real world contextual factors that underpin memory formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is well known that beta amplitude decreases prior to voluntary movements and expected tactile stimuli. Paradoxically, recent studies have reported a beta amplitude increase prior to expected visual and auditory stimuli. Moreover, it has been suggested that, in isochronic stimulus series, the rising beta slope is adjusted to the duration of the interstimulus interval. We investigated the characteristics of such timing related pre-stimulus beta power increases using visual stimulus sequences that were presented at three regular rates (0.61, 0.74 and 0.95 Hz). EEG was recorded from twenty participants while they attended the sequences by performing a clock reading task. Time-frequency analyses showed a consistent pattern of beta modulation: the post-stimulus beta power decrease was followed by a steep increase. Contrary to recent views, we found that the peaks of beta power, for the three presentation rates, were reached at a similar latency post-stimulus, instead of a fixed interval preceding the next stimulus. This demonstrates that, at interstimulus intervals between 1-2 s, beta synchronization slopes are not modulated by timing mechanisms related to prediction of upcoming stimuli. We reconcile the discrepant results by proposing that when shorter interval durations are used, as in previous studies, beta resynchronization is interrupted by the presentation of a new stimulus, making it seem as if beta power peaks prior to upcoming stimuli. We emphasize caution with respect to the notion that the timing of beta synchronization is an expression of predictive timing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Thus far, the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits are not well understood. Previous studies with unisensory stimulation have shown altered neural oscillations in SCZ. As such, altered oscillations could contribute to aberrant multisensory processing in this patient group. To test this assumption, we conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) study in 15 SCZ and 15 control participants in whom we examined neural oscillations and event-related potentials (ERPs) in the sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI). In the SIFI multiple auditory stimuli that are presented alongside a single visual stimulus can induce the illusory percept of multiple visual stimuli. In SCZ and control participants we compared ERPs and neural oscillations between trials that induced an illusion and trials that did not induce an illusion. On the behavioral level, SCZ (55.7%) and control participants (55.4%) did not significantly differ in illusion rates. The analysis of ERPs revealed diminished amplitudes and altered multisensory processing in SCZ compared to controls around 135 ms after stimulus onset. Moreover, the analysis of neural oscillations revealed altered 2535 Hz power after 100 to 150 ms over occipital scalp for SCZ compared to controls. Our findings extend previous observations of aberrant neural oscillations in unisensory perception paradigms. They suggest that altered ERPs and altered occipital beta/gamma band power reflect aberrant multisensory processing in SCZ.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difficult to identify critical changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection, thus opening up a vast research challenges for developing automated methods for quantifying such subtle changes. Moreover, manual interpretation becomes complex due to nonlinear and non-stationary nature of the EEG signals. Hence, it is necessary to develop a quantitative method to automatically identify the normal and epileptic brain activities. In this study, we propose a supervised machine learning method to classify non-ictal (normal or preictal or interictal) and ictal (during seizure) brain activities from EEG signals. Several time-domain and time-frequency domain features are extracted to characterize EEG signals, which are then applied to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) classifier in order classify brain epilepsy. A preliminary experiment with two sets of EEG signals from `focal' and `nonfocal' channels (50 EEG signals per set, each of 10 second duration) of five subjects shows 79.20% accuracy of the epilepsy classification using a combination of features from the time frequency domain.

We used high-density electroencephalography to investigate wake resting state oscillations characteristic of insomnia disorder (ID) at a fine-grained spatiospectral resolution. Methods: A case-control assessment during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) was performed in a laboratory for human physiology. Participants (n = 94, 74 female, 21-70 y) were recruited through www.sleepregistry.nl: 51 with ID, according to DSM-5 and 43 matched controls. Exclusion criteria were any somatic, neurological or psychiatric condition. Group differences in the spectral power topographies across multiple frequencies (1.5 to 40 Hz) were evaluated using permutation-based inference with Threshold-Free Cluster-Enhancement, to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: As compared to controls, participants with ID showed less power in a narrow upper alpha band (11-12.7 Hz, peak: 11.7 Hz) over bilateral frontal and left temporal regions during EO, and more power in a broad beta frequency range (16.3-40 Hz, peak: 19 Hz) globally during EC. Source estimates suggested global rather than cortically localized group differences. Conclusions: The widespread high power in a broad beta band reported previously during sleep in insomnia is present as well during eyes closed wakefulness, suggestive of a round-the-clock hyperarousal. Low power in the upper alpha band during eyes open is consistent with low cortical inhibition and attentional filtering. The fine-grained HD-EEG findings suggest that, while more feasible than PSG, wake EEG of short duration with a few well-chosen electrodes and frequency bands, can provide valuable features of insomnia.

The most common MTP BCI employs a time series of bandpass-filtered EEG potentials (referred to here as the potential time-series, PTS, model) for reconstructing the trajectory of a 3D limb movement using multiple linear regression. These studies report the best accuracy when a 0.5-2 Hz bandpass filter is applied to the EEG. In the present study, we show that spatiotemporal power distribution of theta (4-8 Hz), mu (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-28 Hz) bands are more robust for movement trajectory decoding when the standard PTS approach is replaced with time-varying bandpower values of a specified EEG band, ie, with a bandpower time-series (BTS) model. A comprehensive analysis comprising of three subjects performing pointing movements with the dominant right arm toward six targets is presented. Our results show that the BTS model produces significantly higher MTP accuracy (R similar to 0.45) compared to the standard PTS model (R similar to 0.2). In the case of the BTS model, the highest accuracy was achieved across the three subjects typically in the mu (8-12 Hz) and low-beta (12-18 Hz) bands. Additionally, we highlight a limitation of the commonly used PTS model and illustrate how this model may be suboptimal for decoding motion trajectory relevant information. Although our results, showing that the mu and beta bands are prominent for MTP, are not in line with other MTP studies, they are consistent with the extensive literature on classical multiclass sensorimotor rhythm-based BCI studies (classification of limbs as opposed to motion trajectory prediction), which report the best accuracy of imagined limb movement classification using power values of mu and beta frequency bands. The methods proposed here provide a positive step toward noninvasive decoding of imagined 3D hand movements for movement-free BCIs.

Relevance vector classifier decision fusion and EEG graph-theoretic features for automatic affective state characterization	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Affective states; Graph theory; Electroencephalography; Relevance vector machines; Decision fusion	EMOTION RECOGNITION; BRAIN; MUSIC; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNALS; CONSCIOUSNESS; INFORMATION; ASYMMETRY; SELECTION	Objective characterization of affective states during music clip watching could lead to disruptive new technologies, such as affective brain-computer interfaces, neuromarketing tools, and affective video tagging systems, to name a few. To date, the majority of existing systems have been developed based on analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) patterns in specific brain regions. With music videos, however, a complex interplay of information transfer exists between various brain regions. In this paper, we propose the use of EEG graph-theoretic analysis to characterize three emotional ratings: valence, arousal, and dominance, as well as the "liking" subjective rating. For characterization, graph-theoretic features were used to classify emotional states through support vector machine (SVM) and relevance vector machine (RVM) classifiers. Moreover, fusion schemes at feature and decision levels were also used to improve classification performance. In general, our study shows that the EEG graph-theoretic features are better suited for emotion classification than traditionally used EEG features such as, spectral power features (SPF) and asymmetry index (AI) features. The percentage increase in classification performance, represented by F1-scores, obtained using the proposed methodologies relative to the traditionally used SPF and AI features ranged from: Valence (7-9%), Arousal (3-8%), Dominance (5-6%) and Liking (4-7%). These findings suggest that an EEG graph-theoretical approach along with a robust classifier can better characterize human affective states evoked during music clip watching. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental models are important for studying epileptogenesis. We previously reported that repetitive high-frequency oscillations with spikes (rHFOSs) occur early after lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) and may be a biomarker for PTE. The objective of this study was to use multiple electrodes in rat hippocampal and neocortical regions to describe the long-term electroencephalographic and behavioral evolution of rHFOSs and epileptic seizures after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Adult male rats underwent mild, moderate, or severe FPI or sham injury followed by video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with a combination of 16 neocortical and hippocampal electrodes at an early, intermediate, or late time-point after injury, up to 52 weeks. Recordings were analyzed for the presence of rHFOSs and seizures. Results: Analysis was done on 28 rats with FPI and 7 shams. Perilesional rHFOSs were recorded in significantly more rats after severe (70.3%) than mild (20%) injury or shams (14.3%). Frequency of occurrence was significantly highest in the early (10.8/h) versus late group (3.2/h). Late focal seizures originating from the same electrodes were recorded in significantly more rats in the late (87.5%) versus early period (22.2%), occurring almost exclusively in injured rats. Seizure duration increased significantly over time, averaging 19 s at the beginning of the early period and 27 s at the end of the late period. Seizure frequency also increased significantly over time, from 4.4 per week in the early group to 26.4 per week in the late group. Rarely, rats displayed early seizures or generalized seizures. Significance: FPI results in early rHFOSs and later spontaneous focal seizures arising from peri-lesional neocortex, supporting its use as a model for PTE. Epilepsy severity increased over time and was related to injury severity. The association between early rHFOSs and later focal seizures suggests that rHFOSs may be a potential noninvasive biomarker of PTE.

Subjects in this study were 8 people consisting of 4 schizophrenic patients and 4 healthy subjects. Subjects were recorded from 12 electrodes with Electroencephalography (EEG). EEG signals were recorded during a resting eye-closed state for 4-6 minutes. Data were extracted and analyzed by centering and filtering, then performed using Welch Periodogram technique for the spectral estimation with a Hamming window. The results of this study showed that delta power spectral in schizophrenic patients increased ten times from healthy subjects; theta power spectral in schizophrenic patients increased three times from healthy subjects; alpha power spectral in schizophrenic patients decreased with an increase of one third of healthy subjects. These results were confirmed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showing there were significant differences between schizophrenic and healthy subjects on delta, theta and alpha brain wave. Based on the results of Brain Mapping analysis showed that there was significant increasing in the activity of delta waves and theta waves in frontal lobe of schizophrenics, whereas the alpha waves indicated a decrease in the occipital lobe in all schizophrenic patients.

Cross-Frequency Information Transfer from EEG to EMG in Grasping	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			MUSCLE; SYNCHRONIZATION; PRINCIPLES	This paper presents an investigation into the corticomuscular relationship during a grasping task by evaluating the information transfer between EEG and EMG signals. Information transfer was computed via a non-linear model-free measure, transfer entropy (TE). To examine the cross-frequency interaction, TEs were computed after the times series were decomposed into various frequency ranges via wavelet transform. Our results demonstrate the capability of TE to capture the direct interaction between EEG and EMG. In addition, the cross-frequency analysis revealed instantaneous decrease in information transfer from EEG to the high frequency component of EMG (100-200Hz) during the onset of movement.

Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed that a co-activation of sensory and frontoparietal areas is crucial for conscious sensory perception in the several second time-scale of BOLD signal fluctuations. Electrophysiological recordings with magneto-and electroencephalography (MEG and EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) have shown that event related responses (ERs), phase-locking of neuronal activity, and oscillation amplitude modulations in sub-second timescales are greater for consciously perceived than for unperceived stimuli. The cortical sources of ER and oscillation dynamics predicting the conscious perception have, however, remained unclear because these prior studies have utilized MEG/EEG sensor-level analyses or iEEG with limited neuroanatomical coverage. We used a somatosensory detection task, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and cortically constrained source reconstruction to identify the cortical areas where ERs, local poststimulus amplitudes and phase-locking of neuronal activity are predictive of the conscious access of somatosensory information. We show here that strengthened ERs, phase-locking to stimulus onset (SL), and induced oscillations amplitude modulations all predicted conscious somatosensory perception, but the most robust and widespread of these was SL that was sustained in low-alpha (6-10 Hz) band. The strength of SL and to a lesser extent that of ER predicted conscious perception in the somatosensory, lateral and medial frontal, posterior parietal, and in the cingulate cortex. These data suggest that a rapid phase-reorganization and concurrent oscillation amplitude modulations in these areas play an instrumental role in the emergence of a conscious percept.

High Resolution Topography of Age-Related Changes in Non- Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Electroencephalography	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-DENSITY EEG; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; WHITE-MATTER; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; MIDDLE YEARS; MEMORY	Sleeping brain activity reflects brain anatomy and physiology. The aim of this study was to use high density (256 channel) electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep to characterize topographic changes in sleep EEG power across normal aging, with high spatial resolution. Sleep was evaluated in 92 healthy adults aged 18-65 years old using full polysomnography and high density EEG. After artifact removal, spectral power density was calculated for standard frequency bands for all channels, averaged across the NREM periods of the first 3 sleep cycles. To quantify topographic changes with age, maps were generated of the Pearson's coefficient of the correlation between power and age at each electrode. Significant correlations were determined by statistical non-parametric mapping. Absolute slow wave power declined significantly with increasing age across the entire scalp, whereas declines in theta and sigma power were significant only in frontal regions. Power in fast spindle frequencies declined significantly with increasing age frontally, whereas absolute power of slow spindle frequencies showed no significant change with age. When EEG power was normalized across the scalp, a left centro-parietal region showed significantly less agerelated decline in power than the rest of the scalp. This partial preservation was particularly significant in the slow wave and sigma bands. The effect of age on sleep EEG varies substantially by region and frequency band. This non-uniformity should inform the design of future investigations of aging and sleep. This study provides normative data on the effect of age on sleep EEG topography, and provides a basis from which to explore the mechanisms of normal aging as well as neurodegenerative disorders for which age is a risk factor.

However, in the absence of predictability afforded by rhythmic structure, we hypothesize that the neural dynamical states associated with optimal psychophysical performance are more complex than what has been described previously for rhythmic stimuli. The current electroencephalography study characterized the brain dynamics associated with optimal detection of gaps embedded in narrow-band acoustic noise stimuli lacking low-frequency rhythmic structure. Optimal gap detection was associated with three spectrotemporally distinct delta-governed neural microstates. Individual microstates were characterized by unique instantaneous combinations of neural phase in the delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. Critically, gap detection was not predictable from local fluctuations in stimulus acoustics. The current results suggest that, in the absence of rhythmic structure to entrain neural oscillations, good performance hinges on complex neural states that vary from moment to moment.

Brain-Heart Linear and Nonlinear Dynamics during Visual Emotional Elicitation in Healthy Subjects	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			DEPRESSIVE STATES; SYSTEM; MODEL	This study investigates brain-heart dynamics during visual emotional elicitation in healthy subjects through linear and nonlinear coupling measures of EEG spectrogram and instantaneous heart rate estimates. To this extent, affective pictures including different combinations of arousal and valence levels, gathered from the International Affective Picture System, were administered to twenty-two healthy subjects. Time-varying maps of cortical activation were obtained through EEG spectral analysis, whereas the associated instantaneous heartbeat dynamics was estimated using inhomogeneous point-process linear models. Brain-Heart linear and nonlinear coupling was estimated through the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), considering EEG time-varying spectra and point-process estimates defined in the time and frequency domains. As a proof of concept, we here show preliminary results considering EEG oscillations in the theta band (4-8 Hz). This band, indeed, is known in the literature to be involved in emotional processes. MIC highlighted significant arousal-dependent changes, mediated by the prefrontal cortex interplay especially occurring at intermediate arousing levels. Furthermore, lower and higher arousing elicitations were associated to not significant brain-heart coupling changes in response to pleasant/unpleasant elicitations.

Driving performance and EEG fluctuations during on-the-road driving following sleep deprivation	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						On-the-road driving; SDLP; Sleep deprivation; Sleepiness; Time on task; Background EEG	ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; DRIVER FATIGUE; NEURAL SYSTEMS; WAVE ACTIVITY; WAKING EEG; VIGILANCE; NIGHT; ALERTNESS; BRAIN; ATTENTION	The present study mainly aimed to assess whether and how sleepiness due to sleep deprivation interacts with Time on Task (ToT) effects both on electroencephalography (EEG) measures and driving performance in real driving conditions. Healthy participants performed a one hour on-the-road monotonous highway driving task while EEG was recorded continuously after one night of normal sleep and after one night of total sleep deprivation. The main outcome parameter in the highway driving test was the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP). SDLP and EEG indices (i.e alpha and theta power spectra) increased after sleep deprivation and varied with ToT. The latter was more pronounced after sleep deprivation. Beta power spectra did not differ between conditions but increased with ToT. Changes in SDLP and EEG did not correlate significantly. We conclude that driving performance as well as fatigue and sleepiness fluctuations with ToT were more evident after sleep deprivation as compared to normal sleep. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An HRV Study and Descriptive Report of Subjective Experience of Undergoing EEG Testing	ANNALS OF NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						EEG electrode placement; 10-20 system; Subjective report; Mental stress and fatigue; Massage therapy; Heart rate variability	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; MASSAGE THERAPY; STRESS; PAIN	To explore the heart rate variability (HRV) changes and subjective perception of undergoing electroencephalography (EEG). We conducted a study on 35 healthy male volunteers. The intervention consisted of placing 23 disc-type EEG electrodes of 5-7 mm diameter with long flexible lead according to international 10-20 system for the duration of 30 min, in a sitting position, on the scalp. The outcome measures were time and frequency domain parameters of HRV analysis and descriptive report of subjective experiences on a 3-point Likert scale. The perception of undergoing EEG ranged from pleasant to uneasy. For 13 (37%) participants it was soothing and relaxing, for 11 (31.5%) it was neutral and for the rest 11 (31.5%) it was uneasy and restrictive in nature. However, HRV analysis of the pre and post EEG, showed no statistically significant difference. In our study, the mixed subjective experience of undergoing EEG may be due to individual variation in the perception of the intervention. No difference in HRV parameters may be because of 2 possibilities. The first possibility is varied experiences of procedure with temporal progression. Same participants may have experienced 2 opposite extremes of experiences over and over again, which may have cancelled out sympathetic and parasympathetic responses. The second possibility may be that no stress is generated during clinical test. (C) 2016 S.

J	Keil, J; Pomper, U; Senkowski, D				Keil, Julian; Pomper, Ulrich; Senkowski, Daniel			Distinct patterns of local oscillatory activity and functional connectivity underlie intersensory attention and temporal prediction	CORTEX			English	Article						Attention; Functional connectivity; EEG; Graph theory; Neural oscillations	LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ALPHA POWER; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION; TIME; EEG; SUPPRESSION	Intersensory attention (IA) describes our ability to attend to stimuli of one sensory modality, while disregarding other modalities. Temporal prediction (TP) describes the process of directing attention to specific moments in time. Both attention mechanisms facilitate sensory stimulus processing, yet it is not understood whether they rely on common or distinct network patterns. In this electroencephalography (EEG) study, we presented auditory cues followed by visuo-tactile stimuli. The cues indicated whether participants should detect visual or tactile targets in the visuo-tactile stimuli. TP was manipulated by presenting stimuli block-wise at fixed or variable inter-stimulus intervals. We analysed power and functional connectivity of source-projected oscillations. We computed graph theoretical measures to identify networks underlying IA and TP. Participants responded faster when stimuli were presented with fixed compared to variable inter-stimulus intervals, demonstrating a facilitating effect of TP. Distinct patterns of local delta-, alpha-, and beta-band power modulations and differential functional connectivity in the alpha and beta-bands reflected the influence of IA and TP. An interaction between IA and TP was found in theta-band connectivity in a network comprising frontal, somatosensory and parietal areas. Our study provides insights into how IA and TP dynamically shape oscillatory power and functional connectivity to facilitate stimulus processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate interhemispheric cortical connectivity between the primary motor cortices (M1s) in participants with chronic stroke and controls using TMS-EEG. Ten participants with chronic stroke and four controls were tested. TMS-evoked responses were recorded at rest and during a typical TMS assessment of transcallosal inhibition (TCI). EEG recordings from peri-central gyral electrodes (C3 and C4) were evaluated using imaginary phase coherence (IPC) analyses to quantify levels of effective interhemispheric connectivity. Significantly increased TMS-evoked beta (15-30 Hz frequency range) IPC was observed in the stroke group during ipsilesional MI stimulation compared to controls during TCI assessment but not at rest. TMS-evoked beta IPC values were associated with TMS measures of transcallosal inhibition across groups. These results suggest TMS-evoked EEG responses can index abnormal effective interhemispheric connectivity in chronic stroke. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, spectrograms of ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) of one participant constructed a third-order tensor with three factors of time, frequency and space; and the stimulus data consisting of acoustical features derived from the naturalistic and continuous music formulated a matrix with two factors of time and the number of features. Thus, the multilinear partial least squares (PLS) conforming to the canonical polyadic (CP) model was performed on the tensor and the matrix for decomposing the ongoing EEG. Consequently, we found that brain activity of majority of participants was significantly correlated with the musical features in time domain, and that such brain activity showed frontal or central or posterior or occipital distributions along the scalp, and that such brain activity could be of different oscillation bands in frequency domain.

Spindle activity occurring phase-locked to the SO is considered a candidate mediator of memory consolidation during sleep. We used source localization of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from 11 sleeping human subjects for an in-depth analysis of the temporal and spatial properties of sleep spindles co-occurring with SOs. Slow oscillations and spindles were identified in the EEG and related to the MEG signal, providing enhanced spatial resolution. In the temporal domain, we confirmed a phase-locking of classical 12-15 Hz fast spindle activity to the depolarizing SO up-state and of 9-12 Hz slow spindle activity to the up-to-down-state transition of the SO. In the spatial domain, we show a broad spread of spindle activity, with less distinct anterior-posterior separation of fast and slow spindles than commonly seen in the EEG. We further tested a prediction of current memory consolidation models, namely the existence of a spatial bias of SOs over sleep spindles as a mechanism to promote localized neuronal synchronization and plasticity. In contrast to that prediction, a comparison of SOs dominating over the left vs. right hemisphere did not reveal any signs of a concurrent lateralization of spindle activity co-occurring with these SOs. Our data are consistent with the concept of the neocortical SO exerting top-down control over thalamic spindle generation. However, they call into question the notion that SOs locally coordinate spindles and thereby inform spindle-related memory processing. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

For this purpose, an experiment involving forty-seven participants was carried out. In this experiment electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and respiration data were acquired while subjects were watching a 30-min audiovisual content. This content was composed by a submarine documentary and nine commercials (one of them the ad under evaluation). After the signal pre-processing, four sets of features were extracted from the physiological signals using different state-of-the-art metrics. These features computed in time and frequency domains are the inputs to several basic and advanced classifiers. An average of 89.76% of the instances was correctly classified according to the Ace Score index. The best results were obtained by a classifier consisting of a combination between AdaBoost and Random Forest with automatic selection of features. The selected features were those extracted from GSR and HRV signals. These results are promising in the audiovisual content evaluation field by means of physiological signal processing.

Several recent studies have reported that target speaker identification is possible through electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. If the EEG system could be reduced to acceptable size while retaining the signal quality, hearing aids could benefit from the integration with concealed EEG. To compare the performance of a multichannel around-the-ear EEG system with high-density cap EEG recordings an envelope tracking algorithm was applied in a competitive speaker paradigm. The data from 20 normal hearing listeners were concurrently collected from the traditional state-of-the-art laboratory wired EEG system and a wireless mobile EEG system with two bilaterally-placed around-the-ear electrode arrays (cEEGrids). The results show that the cEEGrid ear-EEG technology captured neural signals that allowed the identification of the attended speaker above chance-level, with 69.3% accuracy, while cap EEG signals resulted in the accuracy of 84.8%. Further analyses investigated the influence of ear-EEG signal quality and revealed that the envelope tracking procedure was unaffected by variability in channel impedances. We conclude that the quality of concealed ear-EEG recordings as acquired with the cEEGrid array has potential to be used in the brain computer interface steering of hearing aids.

A new method for its complexity, in terms of number of signal components extracted from its time-frequency distributions, has been proposed in this paper. Exploiting its spectral energy variation with time, the joint time-frequency distribution approach was upgraded by the modification of Renyi entropy, called short-term Renyi entropy, and applied to multichannel EEG signal analysis resulting in novel algorithm for its complexity detection. Number of EEG signals components obtained for various EEG signals was shown to provide useful information concerning brain activity at each electrode location, which may further be used to detect the brain activity abnormalities for patients with limb movement difficulties.

Previous studies have indicated that musical training was related to better working memory and that these behavioral differences were associated with differences in neural activity in the brain. However, it was not clear whether musical training impacts memory in general, beyond working memory. By recruiting professional musicians with extensive training, we investigated if musical training has a broad impact on memory with corresponding electroencephalography (EEG) signal changes, by using working memory and long-term memory tasks with verbal and pictorial items. Behaviorally, musicians outperformed on both working memory and long-term memory tasks. A comprehensive EEG pattern study has been performed, including various univariate and multivariate features, time-frequency (wavelet) analysis, power-spectra analysis, and deterministic chaotic theory. The advanced feature selection approaches have also been employed to select the most discriminative EEG and brain activation features between musicians and non-musicians. High classification accuracy (more than 95%) in memory judgments was achieved using Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM). For working memory, it showed significant differences between musicians versus non-musicians during the delay period. For long-term memory, significant differences on EEG patterns between groups were found both in the pre-stimulus period and the post-stimulus period on recognition. These results indicate that musicians memorial advantage occurs in both working memory and long-term memory and that the developed computational framework using advanced data mining techniques can be successfully applied to classify complex human cognition with high time resolution.

Evidence indicates, that these dynamic connectivity changes are delivered by microstructural elements of sleep: short periods of environmental stimuli evaluation followed by sleep promoting procedures. The connectivity patterns of the latter, among other aspects of sleep microstructure, are still to be fully elucidated. We suggest here a methodology for the assessment and investigation of the connectivity patterns of EEG microstructural elements, such as sleep spindles. The methodology combines techniques in the preprocessing, estimation, error assessing and visualization of results levels in order to allow the detailed examination of the connectivity aspects (levels and directionality of information flow) over frequency and time with notable resolution, while dealing with the volume conduction and EEG reference assessment. The high temporal and frequency resolution of the methodology will allow the association between the microelements and the dynamically forming networks that characterize them, and consequently possibly reveal aspects of the EEG microstructure. The proposed methodology is initially tested on artificially generated signals for proof of concept and subsequently applied to real EEG recordings via a custom built MATLAB-based tool developed for such studies. Preliminary results from 843 fast sleep spindles recorded in whole night sleep of 5 healthy volunteers indicate a prevailing pattern of interactions between centroparietal and frontal regions. We demonstrate hereby, an opening to our knowledge attempt to estimate the scalp EEG connectivity that characterizes fast sleep spindles via an "EEG-element connectivity" methodology we propose. The application of the latter, via a computational tool we developed suggests it is able to investigate the connectivity patterns related to the occurrence of EEG microstructural elements. Network characterization of specified physiological or pathological EEG microstructural elements can potentially be of great importance in the understanding, identification, and prediction of health and disease.

Epilepsy seizures are the consequence of the transient electrical aggravation of the cerebrum. Around 50 million individuals worldwide have epilepsy, and around two out of every three new cases are found in developing nations. Epilepsy can happen at any age. The identification is conceivable by investigating Electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals. This paper, introduces a procedure for processing EEG signals for distinguishing proof of epilepsy seizure. Proposed framework is mix of multi-wavelet change and machine learning system. Rough Time and frequency domain calculation is upgraded (called as Improved Approximate Time and frequency domain so as to calculate irregularities which exist in EEG signals. The present strategy is performed and is compared with the current methodology, in view of factors such as affectability, specificity, and exactness parameters. Precision has been observed at approximately 93%.

Critical Care EEG Monitoring Res	Sensitivity of quantitative EEG for seizure identification in the intensive care unit	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; CEREBRAL FUNCTION MONITOR; CRITICALLY-ILL CHILDREN; DENSITY SPECTRAL ARRAY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; TERMINOLOGY; CRITERIA; ADULTS	Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity of quantitative EEG (QEEG) for electrographic seizure identification in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Six-hour EEG epochs chosen from 15 patients underwent transformation into QEEG displays. Each epoch was reviewed in 3 formats: raw EEG, QEEG + raw, and QEEG-only. Epochs were also analyzed by a proprietary seizure detection algorithm. Nine neurophysiologists reviewed raw EEGs to identify seizures to serve as the gold standard. Nine other neurophysiologists with experience in QEEG evaluated the epochs in QEEG formats, with and without concomitant raw EEG. Sensitivity and false-positive rates (FPRs) for seizure identification were calculated and median review time assessed. Results: Mean sensitivity for seizure identification ranged from 51% to 67% for QEEG-only and 63%-68% for QEEG + raw. FPRs averaged 1/h for QEEG-only and 0.5/h for QEEG + raw. Mean sensitivity of seizure probability software was 26.2%-26.7%, with FPR of 0.07/h. Epochs with the highest sensitivities contained frequent, intermittent seizures. Lower sensitivities were seen with slow-frequency, low-amplitude seizures and epochs with rhythmic or periodic patterns. Median review times were shorter for QEEG (6 minutes) and QEEG + raw analysis (14.5 minutes) vs raw EEG (19 minutes; p = 0.00003). Conclusions: A panel of QEEG trends can be used by experts to shorten EEG review time for seizure identification with reasonable sensitivity and low FPRs. The prevalence of false detections confirms that raw EEG review must be used in conjunction with QEEG. Studies are needed to identify optimal QEEG trend configurations and the utility of QEEG as a screening tool for non-EEG personnel. Classification of evidence review: This study provides Class II evidence that QEEG + raw interpreted by experts identifies seizures in patients in the ICU with a sensitivity of 63%-68% and FPR of 0.5 seizures per hour.

Electrophysiological evidence during episodic prospection implicates medial prefrontal and bilateral middle temporal gyrus	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Episodic prospection; Self-referential thought; Default mode; Temporal gyrus; Quantitative EEG	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MENTAL TIME-TRAVEL; EEG-ALPHA; DECISION-MAKING; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; RESTING BRAIN; THETA-BAND; FUTURE	fMRI studies have implicated the medial prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe, components of the default mode network (DMN), in episodic prospection. This study compared quantitative EEG localized to these DMN regions during prospection and during resting and while waiting for rewards. EEG was recorded in twenty-two adults while they were asked to (i) envision future monetary episodes; (ii) wait for rewards and (iii) rest. Activation sources were localized to core DMN regions. EEG power and phase coherence were compared across conditions. Prospection, compared to resting and waiting, was associated with reduced power in the medial prefrontal gyrus and increased power in the bilateral medial temporal gyrus across frequency bands as well as greater phase synchrony between these regions in the delta band. The current quantitative EEG analysis confirms prior fMRI research suggesting that medial prefrontal and medial temporal gyrus interactions are central to the capacity for episodic prospection.

The lack of signal processing tools suitable for the analysis of nonlinear and nonstationary electroencephalographic (EEG) hinders such analyses. In this study, noise assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) is used to estimate the causal inference in the frequency domain, i.e., partial directed coherence (PDC). Natural and intrinsic oscillations corresponding to the motor imagery tasks can be extracted due to the data-driven approach of NA-MEMD, which does not employ predefined basis functions. Simulations based on synthetic data with a time delay between two signals demonstrated that NA-MEMD was the optimal method for estimating the delay between two signals. Furthermore, classification analysis of the motor imagery responses of 29 subjects revealed that NA-MEMD is a prerequisite process for estimating the causal network across multichannel EEG data during mental tasks.

TOWARD DEEP BRAIN MONITORING WITH SUPERFICIAL EEG SENSORS PLUS NEUROMODULATORY FOCUSED ULTRASOUND	ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Focused ultrasound; EEG; Brain activity	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; LOW-INTENSITY; FREQUENCY; LOCALIZATION; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; NEURONS	Noninvasive recordings of electrophysiological activity have limited anatomic specificity and depth. We hypothesized that spatially tagging a small volume of brain with a unique electroencephalography (EEG) signal induced by pulsed focused ultrasound could overcome those limitations. As a first step toward testing this hypothesis, we applied transcranial ultrasound (2 MHz, 200-ms pulses applied at 1050 Hz for 1 s at a spatial peak temporal average intensity of 1.4 W/cm(2)) to the brains of anesthetized rats while simultaneously recording EEG signals. We observed a significant 1050-Hz electrophysiological signal only when ultrasound was applied to a living brain. Moreover, amplitude demodulation of the EEG signal at 1050 Hz yielded measurement of gamma band (>30 Hz) brain activity consistent with direct measurements of that activity. These results represent preliminary support for use of pulsed focused ultrasound as a spatial tagging mechanism for non-invasive EEG-based mapping of deep brain activity with high spatial resolution.

J	Sagi, V; Evans, MS				Sagi, Vishwanath; Evans, M. Steven			Relationship between high-frequency oscillations and spikes in a case of temporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR CASE REPORTS			English	Article						Seizure; High-frequency oscillation; Epileptiform spikes with high-frequency oscillations; EEG; Human temporal lobe epilepsy; Epilepsy surgery	BRAIN	Objective: The aim of this case report was to study the relationship between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spikes, and seizures in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. Introduction: During intracranial electroencephalography ( EEG), HFOs are thought to be a marker for the seizure onset zone (SOZ). High-frequency oscillations are classified into ripples with frequencies of 70-200 Hz and fast ripples with frequencies of 200-500 Hz. Although HFOs are thought to be a marker for the SOZ, their relationship to spikes has not been studied in detail, especially within the SOZ. Methods: We studied the time course of ripples and spikes in a patient undergoing intracranial EEG. Medications were discontinued on day one. She suffered three seizures on day three. Her SOZ was in the left hippocampus, which displayed abundant ripples and spikes. Ripples, spikes with simultaneous ripples, and spikes without ripples were counted for this study. Results: We found that ripples and spikes in the SOZ had a marked diurnal variation. Ripples, spikes with ripples, and spikes without ripples increased and decreased in concert until just before seizure onset, when ripples and spikes with ripples increased markedly. Spikes without ripples did not increase. Conclusions: These results support ripples as a marker for SOZ and show that they co-occur with spikes. Seizure onset was heralded by an increase in ripples and spikes with ripples, without an increase in spikes without ripples. We hypothesize that spikes associated with ripples may have a somewhat different pathophysiological mechanism than spikes not associated with ripples, differences that may be relevant for the timing of seizure onset.

In our research, subjects performed real and imaginary movements of their right arm as EEG signals were recorded with a 32-electrode cap at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. Our experiment consisted of twelve 30-second tests, each composed of 5 repetitions of two opposite movements. Indications on timing, speed, and type of movement were provided by a computer program during the experiment. The 12 tests included two base lines with open and closed eyes, four tests covering all degrees of freedom of the shoulder and elbow, and one for hand movement, as well as imagination of all five movements. We used the Continuous Wavelet Transform, using the complex Morlet mother wavelet, to identify how characteristic frequencies change over time. We then developed a method for generating binary classifier functions capable of distinguishing between two sets of movements based on the wavelet coefficients at a variety of frequencies over all 32 electrodes. We then used the binary classifiers to generate a master classifier function which determines the most probable movement at any given time. Our results showed a 56.4% +/- 7.9% success rate for determining the correct movement out of 23 different possibilities. Furthermore, the classifier functions themselves provide information regarding the key frequencies and regions that distinguish one arm movement from another.

CoSMoMVPA: Multi-Modal Multivariate Pattern Analysis of Neuroimaging Data in Matlab/GNU Octave	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						multi-variate pattern analysis; software; functional magnetic resonance imaging; magnetoencephalography; electroencephalography; open source; cognitive neuroscience	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FREE CLUSTER-ENHANCEMENT; VENTRAL TEMPORAL CORTEX; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; ACTION REPRESENTATIONS; FMRI ACTIVITY; SCIKIT-LEARN; BRAIN; INFORMATION; INFERENCE	Recent years have seen an increase in the popularity of multivariate pattern (MVP) analysis of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data, and, to a much lesser extent, magneto- and electro-encephalography (M/EEG) data. We present CoSMoMVPA, a lightweight MVPA (MVP analysis) toolbox implemented in the intersection of the Matlab and GNU Octave languages, that treats both fMRI and M/EEG data as first-class citizens. CoSMoMVPA supports all state-of-the-art MVP analysis techniques, including searchlight analyses, classification, correlations, representational similarity analysis, and the time generalization method. These can be used to address both data-driven and hypothesis-driven questions about neural organization and representations, both within and across: space, time, frequency bands, neuroimaging modalities, individuals, and species. It uses a uniform data representation of fMRI data in the volume or on the surface, and of M/EEG data at the sensor and source level. Through various external toolboxes, it directly supports reading and writing a variety of fMRI and M/EEG neuroimaging formats, and, where applicable, can convert between them. As a result, it can be integrated readily in existing pipelines and used with existing preprocessed datasets. CoSMoMVPA overloads the traditional volumetric searchlight concept to support neighborhoods for M/EEG and surface-based fMRI data, which supports localization of multivariate effects of interest across space, time, and frequency dimensions. CoSMoMVPA also provides a generalized approach to multiple comparison correction across these dimensions using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement with state-of-the-art clustering and permutation techniques. CoSMoMVPA is highly modular and uses abstractions to provide a uniform interface for a variety of MVP measures. Typical analyses require a few lines of code, making it accessible to beginner users. At the same time, expert programmers can easily extend its functionality. CoSMoMVPA comes with extensive documentation, including a variety of runnable demonstration scripts and analysis exercises (with example data and solutions). It uses best software engineering practices including version control, distributed development, an automated test suite, and continuous integration testing. It can be used with the proprietary Matlab and the free GNU Octave software, and it complies with open source distribution platforms such as NeuroDebian. CoSMoMVPA is Free/Open Source Software under the permissive MIT license.

However, the induced changes are highly variable between individuals, potentially limiting research and clinical utility. One factor that might contribute to this variability is the level of cortical inhibition at the time of stimulation. The alpha rhythm (similar to 8-13Hz) recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) is thought to reflect pulsatile cortical inhibition; therefore, targeting non-invasive brain stimulation to particular phases of the alpha rhythm may provide an approach to enhance plasticity induction. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to entrain cortical oscillations in a frequency-specific manner. We investigated whether the neuroplastic response to continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) was enhanced by timing bursts of stimuli to the peak or the trough of a tACS-imposed alpha rhythm. While motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were unaffected when cTBS was applied in-phase with the peak of the tACS-imposed oscillation, MEP depression was enhanced when cTBS was applied in-phase with the trough. This enhanced MEP depression was dependent on the individual peak frequency of the endogenous alpha rhythm recorded with EEG prior to stimulation, and was strongest in those participants classified as non-responders to standard cTBS. These findings suggest that tACS may be used in combination with cTBS to enhance the plasticity response. Furthermore, the peak frequency of endogenous alpha, as measured with EEG, may be used as a simple marker to pre-select those individuals likely to benefit from this approach.

J	Liu, ZY; Sun, JW; Zhang, Y; Rolfe, P				Liu, Zhiyong; Sun, Jinwei; Zhang, Yan; Rolfe, Peter			Sleep staging from the EEG signal using multi-domain feature extraction	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; MF-DFA; VGA; LS-SVM	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; SYNCHRONIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; DEPTH	The analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) can yield much useful information about brain function, including indications of sleep stage. During the process of EEG analysis, feature extraction is one of the most critical technical aspect. Traditional EEG feature extraction methods are mainly based on single domain analysis. However, due to the highly non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of the EEG, it is difficult to extract comprehensive information only from single domain analysis. In the present study, a novel feature extraction method was proposed based on the multi-domain analysis of the EEG. Fifteen characteristic parameters were extracted based on the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), visibility graph algorithm (VGA), frequency analysis and nonlinear analysis. Ten optimal parameters of the fifteen parameters were selected by the genetic algorithm (GA). Then the Least Squares-Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) were used to classify the sleep states. The cross validation results demonstrated that multi-domain feature extraction method can obtain more useful information in the EEG signal. Compared to the frequency domain parameters, nonlinear parameters and time domain parameters, the predictive accuracy of sleep staging classification with optimal multi-domain parameters improved 11.08%, 10.76% and 6.40% respectively.

Robust seizure detection in EEG using 2D DWT of time-frequency distributions	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article								Seizure is a psychological disorder which is observed through electro-encephalography (EEG) by monitoring the electrical activity inside our brain. Joint time-frequency (TF) analysis is helpful for capturing the dynamic property of EEG signals as solely time or frequency analysis is not sufficient to clearly depict the non-stationary electrical activity. This study is based on the use of 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for feature extraction from the TF image with seizure classification performed through support vector machine. For classifier evaluation a dataset of 80 seizure and 80 non-seizure samples are used, with leave-one-out cross-validation method. The proposed scheme achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.375% and has outperformed state of the art by 6%. This work will assist physicians in seizure detection, particularly in neonatal case where it can cause a life-time disability.

A review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Arithmetic; Arithmetic fact retrieval; EEG; Mathematical cognition; Strategy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SINGLE-DIGIT MULTIPLICATION; OPERAND-RECOGNITION PARADIGM; RESPONSE-STIMULUS-INTERVALS; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL-CHILDREN; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MENTAL ADDITION; WORKING-MEMORY; OLDER-ADULTS	Arithmetic strategies refer to the set of procedures used to solve arithmetic problems. Previous studies revealed that participants can solve arithmetic problems by using several arithmetic strategies. In this review, we discuss the added value of using electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate such strategies. Indeed, this technique enables to delineate different aspects of information processing, and can further our understanding of arithmetic strategies. The investigation of processes involved within arithmetic strategies with event-related potentials (ERPs) and frequency analyses allows to discover how participants solve different types of problems by enabling to distinguish arithmetic strategies on the bases of their electrophysiological signatures. Moreover, this technique is fruitful to investigate the time course of arithmetic strategy selection and execution. EEG can also help to investigate the role of general cognitive processes during execution of arithmetic strategies. Finally, EEG is also a powerful tool to specify how strategy use differs between groups of different skills or ages. Overall, by addressing these ends, EEG further our understanding of variations in participants' arithmetic performance as a function of different characteristics, such as participants' (e.g., age, skills), problems' (e.g., problem or split size, rule violation), or situations' (e.g., strategy execution on previous problems, correctness of proposed answers) characteristics.

Electroencephalography (EEG) data streams were collected from six crew members of a submarine piloting and navigation team while they performed a required training simulation. A representation of neurodynamic organization was first generated by creating symbols every second that showed the EEG power levels of each crew member. The second-by-second expression of these symbols continuously varied with the changing task, and the magnitude, duration and frequency of these variations could be quantitated using a moving window of Shannon entropy over the symbol stream. These changes in neurodynamic organization (i.e. entropy) were seen in the alpha, beta and gamma EEG frequency bands. A representation of team members' synchrony was created by measuring the mutual information in the EEG power levels for fourteen dyad combinations. Mutual information was present in the gamma EEG band, and elevated levels were distributed throughout the task. These discrete periods of synchrony were poorly correlated at zero lag with either changes in the team's neurodynamic organization, or speech patterns.

This article provides a foundational approach for investigating the role of expertise in programming language comprehension, showing that this electrical activity in the brain can indicate (1) prior programming experience by class level (current state of progression through an undergraduate computer science program), and (2) self-reported experience levels.

APSTM algorithm can probe the change in the synchrony of the underlying system with high sensitivity, and be applied to multichannel, nonlinear time series in noisy. This paper uses the EEG filter provided by the EEGLAB to extract the four common waves : theta, alpha, beta and gamma, which are from the normal and epilepsy EEG signals. The four frequency bands of EEG signals are analysed based on the APSTM algorithm, and the results show that the APSTM determinant can distinguish the epilepsy from the normal EEG signals clearly. And when APSTM determinant detects epileptic discharge, the theta wave is the most significant, and the beta wave can only generally detect epileptic discharge, while alpha and gamma waves are ineffective.

Sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects refer to decreased poorer strategy effects (i.e., poorer performance when the cued strategy is not the best) on current problem following poorer strategy problems compared to after better strategy problems. Analyses on electrophysiological (EEG) data revealed important age-related changes in time, frequency, and coherence of brain activities underlying sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects. More specifically, sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects were associated with earlier and later time windows (i.e., between 200- and 550 ms and between 850- and 1250 ms). Event-related potentials (ERPs) also revealed an earlier onset in older adults, together with more anterior and less lateralized activations. Furthermore, sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects were associated with theta and alpha frequencies in young adults while these modulations were found in delta frequency and theta inter-hemispheric coherence in older adults, consistent with qualitatively distinct patterns of brain activity. These findings have important implications to further our understanding of age-related differences and similarities in sequential modulations of cognitive control processes during arithmetic strategy execution.

Imaging studies have emphasised the overlap between infant and adult brain connectome architecture, but electrophysiological analysis of infant brain nociceptive networks can provide further understanding of the functional postnatal development of pain perception. Here we hypothesise that the human infant brain encodes noxious information with different neuronal patterns compared to adults. To test this we compared EEG responses to the same time-locked noxious skin lance in infants aged 0-19 days (n = 18, clinically required) and adults aged 23-48 years (n = 21). Time-frequency analysis revealed that while some features of adult nociceptive network activity are present in infants at longer latencies, including beta-gamma oscillations, infants display a distinct, long latency, noxious evoked 18-fold energy increase in the fast delta band (2-4 Hz) that is absent in adults. The differences in activity between infants and adults have a widespread topographic distribution across the brain. These data support our hypothesis and indicate important postnatal changes in the encoding of mechanical pain in the human brain.

Cortical activity modulations underlying age-related performance differences during posture-cognition dual tasking	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Postural control; Aging; EEG; Time-frequency analyses; Dual task; Cognition; Working memory	ATTENTIONAL DEMANDS; WORKING-MEMORY; BODY SWAY; BALANCE; STABILITY; YOUNG; WALKING; FOCUS; INDIVIDUALS; MOVEMENTS	To date, no systematic research investigating cortical correlates of performance changes in dual tasking has been reported in the elderly population. Thus, we monitored whole-scalp cortical activations (EEG) during both single task and posture-cognition dual tasking with the main goal of understanding cortical activity modulations underlying age-related differences on posture-cognition dual tasking conditions. Postural and cognitive data analyses showed that elderly people had decreased cognitive performance even during challenging single cognitive tasks. Working memory impairments in the elderly group can be observed when a challenging cognitive task is performed in any postural condition, while postural control performance differences only became significant during challenging dual task conditions. Behavioral performance results, in general, indicate that elderly subjects may adopt a non-automated conscious control strategy and prioritize postural performance over cognitive performance to maintain upright stance only when the cognitive load is low. EEG analyses showed increased delta, theta and gamma oscillations, primarily over frontal, central-frontal, central and central-parietal cortices during dual tasking conditions. We found that delta oscillations were more responsive to challenging postural conditions presumably related to cortical representations of changing sensory conditions in postural tasks. Theta rhythms, on the other hand, were more responsive to cognitive task difficulty in both groups, with more pronounced increases in younger subjects which may underlie neural correlates of high-level cognitive computations including encoding and retrieval. Gamma oscillations also increased in the elderly primarily over central and central-parietal cortices during challenging postural tasks, indicating increased allocation of attentional sources to postural tasks.

The task for EEG recording consists of simple motor imagery movements that the subject has to imagine. The system uses an effective time-frequency based feature extraction method using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or spectrogram. Energy, variance, and skewness features are computed on the spectrogram. These features are used to train a support vector machine and neural network classifier. The classifiers are tested for person authentication with testing data using cross-validation. Results using a different number of channels with optimum features are presented.

This ability from the interaction between goal-directed and stimulus driven attentional control is termed contingent reorienting. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated activations of the ventral and dorsal attentional networks (DANs) which exhibit right hemisphere dominance, but the temporal dynamics of the attentional networks still remain unclear. The present study used event-related potential (ERP) to index the locus of spatial attention and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to acquire the time-frequency information during contingent reorienting. The ERP results showed contingent reorienting induced significant N2pc on both hemispheres. In contrast, our time-frequency analysis found further that, unlike the N2pc, theta oscillation during contingent reorienting differed between hemispheres and experimental sessions. The inter-trial coherence (ITC) of the theta oscillation demonstrated that the two sides of the attentional networks became phase-locked to contingent reorienting at different stages. The left attentional networks were associated with contingent reorienting in the first experimental session whereas the bilateral attentional networks play a more important role in this process in the subsequent session. This phase-locked information suggests a dynamic temporal evolution of the involvement of different attentional networks in contingent reorienting and a potential role of the left ventral network in the first session.

Sustained Modafinil Treatment Effects on Control-Related Gamma Oscillatory Power in Schizophrenia	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LOCUS-COERULEUS; RULE SELECTION; WORKING-MEMORY; IN-VITRO; MODULATION; DOPAMINE; NOREPINEPHRINE	Control-related cognitive processes such as rule selection and maintenance are associated with cortical oscillations in the gamma range, and modulated by catecholamine neurotransmission. Control-related gamma power is impaired in schizophrenia, and an understudied treatment target. It remains unknown whether pro-catecholamine pharmacological agents augment control-related gamma oscillations in schizophrenia. We tested the effects of 4-week fixed-dose daily adjunctive modafinil (MOD) 200 mg, in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups design. Twenty-seven stable schizophrenia patients performed a cognitive control task during EEG, at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. EEG data underwent time-frequency decomposition with Morlet wavelets to determine power of 4-80 Hz oscillations. The modafinil group (n = 14), relative to placebo group (n = 13), exhibited enhanced oscillatory power associated with high-control rule selection in the gamma range after treatment, with additional effects during rule maintenance in gamma and sub-gamma ranges. MOD-treated patients who exhibited improved task performance with treatment also showed greater treatment-related delay period gamma compared with MOD-treated patients without improved performance. This is the first evidence in schizophrenia of augmentation of cognition-related gamma oscillations by an FDA-approved agent with therapeutic potential. Gamma oscillations represent a novel treatment target in this disorder, and modulation of catecholamine signaling may represent a viable strategy at this target.

One cognitive task to address this issue is the so-called own name paradigm, in which subjects are presented with first names including the own name. In the active condition, a specific target name has to be silently counted. We recorded EEG during this task in 24 healthy controls, 8 patients suffering from Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) and 7 minimally conscious (MCS) patients. EEG was analysed with respect to amplitude as well as phase modulations and connectivity. Results showed that general reactivity in the delta, theta and alpha frequency (event-related de-synchronisation, ERS/ERD, and phase locking between trials and electrodes) toward auditory stimulation was higher in controls than in patients. In controls, delta ERS and lower alpha ERD indexed the focus of attention in both conditions, late theta ERS only in the active condition. Additionally, phase locking between trials and delta phase connectivity was highest for own names in the passive and targets in the active condition. In patients, clear stimulus-specific differences could not be detected. However, MCS patients could reliably be differentiated from UWS patients based on their general event-related delta and theta increase independent of the type of stimulus. In conclusion, the EEG signature of the active own name paradigm revealed instruction-following in healthy participants. On the other hand, DOC patients did not show clear stimulus-specific processing. General reactivity toward any auditory input, however, allowed for a reliable differentiation between MCS and UWS patients.

Time-frequency analysis can reveal large high-frequency (HF) power changes (80-500 Hz) associated with inter-ictal spikes. The present study determines how well the rate of HFOs and spike-related HF power changes were co-localized with SOZ. Methods: We analyzed 583 channels (68 in the SOZ) sampled from 14 patients who underwent intracranial EEG recording. We determined if the rate of visually-marked HFOs and spike-related HF power changes differed between SOZ and non-SOZ. Results: Significantly higher rates of HFOs were found in SOZ. The degree of spike-related HF power augmentation failed to differ between SOZ and non-SOZ, whereas that of post-spike HF power attenuation was significantly more severe in SOZ compared to in non-SOZ. Regions showing HFOs and large spike-related HF-changes showed a partial overlap in distribution in 7/14 patients. Conclusions: Strong HF augmentation during spikes and high HFO rates occurred over different brain locations. The rate of HFOs showed the best performance in identifying SOZ. Post-spike HF power attenuation may represent increased inhibition in these channels and should be investigated further. Significance: Strong HF power changes during spikes and HFOs per se seem to reflect distinct phenomena. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Movement-related phase locking in the delta-theta frequency band	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Finger tapping; Movement initiation; Voluntary motor action; Externally triggered motor action	MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; ACTIVATION; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS; ARTIFACTS; DYNAMICS	Movements result from a complex interplay of multiple brain regions. These regions are assembled into distinct functional networks depending on the specific properties of the action. However, the nature and details of the dynamics of this complex assembly process are unknown. In this study, we sought to identify key markers of the neural processes underlying the preparation and execution of motor actions that always occur irrespective of differences in movement initiation, hence the specific neural processes and functional networks involved. To this end, EEG activity was continuously recorded from 18 right-handed healthy participants while they performed a simple motor task consisting of button presses with the left or right index finger. The movement was performed either in response to a visual cue or at a self-chosen, i.e., non-cued point in time. Despite these substantial differences in movement initiation, dynamic properties of the EEG signals common to both conditions could be identified using time-frequency and phase locking analysis of the EEG data. In both conditions, a significant phase locking effect was observed that started prior to the movement onset in the delta-theta frequency band (2-7 Hz), and that was strongest at the electrodes nearest to the contralateral motor region (M1). This phase locking effect did not have a counterpart in the corresponding power spectra (i.e., amplitudes), or in the event-related potentials. Our finding suggests that phase locking in the delta-theta frequency band is a ubiquitous movement-related signal independent of how the actual movement has been initiated. We therefore suggest that phase-locked neural oscillations in the motor cortex are a prerequisite for the preparation and execution of motor actions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) were used to assess network structure and network dynamics during resting state with eyes open and closed, and auditory oddball performance through phase synchronization between EEG channels. For this assessment, we constructed a hyper-frequency network (HFN) based on within- and cross-frequency coupling (WFC and CFC, respectively) at 10 oscillation frequencies ranging between 2 and 20 Hz. We found that CFC generally differentiates between task conditions better than WFC. CFC was the highest during resting state with eyes open. Using a graph-theoretical approach (GTA), we found that HFNs possess small-world network (SWN) topology with a slight tendency to random network characteristics. Moreover, analysis of the temporal fluctuations of HFNs revealed specific network topology dynamics (NTD), i.e., temporal changes of different graph theoretical measures such as strength, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length (CPL), local, and global efficiency determined for HFNs at different time windows. The different topology metrics showed significant differences between conditions in the mean and standard deviation of these metrics both across time and nodes. In addition, using an artificial neural network approach, we found stimulus-related dynamics that varied across the different network topology metrics. We conclude that functional connectivity dynamics (FCD), or NTD, which was found using the HFN approach during rest and stimulus processing, reflects temporal and topological changes in the functional organization and reorganization of neuronal cell assemblies.

According to the underlying role of studying this pattern, we propose using synchrosqueezing transform (SST) for the purpose of analysis and automatic detection of K-complex. SST is an EMD-like time-frequency algorithm for signal analysis. Our idea is based on the robust properties of the SST and its previous satisfactory results on biomedical signals, especially those with specific patterns. We successfully applied SST on 10 segments of 30 minutes sleep EEG signals which contain K-complexes labeled by two experts. Results illustrate that SST representation is able to detect this pattern at the right time and frequency locations in the time frequency plane, which are in consistency with the standard definition. Comparison with the continuous wavelet demonstrates the superiority of SST especially in finding K complexes at the right places, reducing the blurredness and mistakenly detecting other part of the signal as K-complex.

Methods: Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) studies before and after the treatment were investigated in 15 patients with CSWS. To investigate functional and effective connectivity within the network generating the delta activity in the background sleep EEG, the methods of dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) and renormalized partial directed coherence (RPDC) were applied. Results: Independent of etiology and severity of epilepsy, background EEG pattern in patients with CSWS before treatment is associated with the complex network of coherent sources in medial prefrontal cortex, somatosensory association cortex/posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus/parahippocampal gyrus/insular cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. The analysis of information flow within this network revealed that the medial parietal cortex, the precuneus, and the thalamus act as central hubs, driving the information flow to other areas, especially to the temporal and frontal cortex. The described CSWS-specific pattern was no longer observed in patients with normalized sleep EEG. In addition, frequency of spiking showed a strong linear correlations with absolute source power, source coherence strength, and source RPDC strength at both time points: (1) Spike and wave index (SWI) versus absolute source power at EEG1 (r = 0.56; p = 0.008) and at EEG2 (r = 0.45; p = 0.009); (2) SWI versus source coherence strength at EEG1 (r = 0.71; p = 0.005) and at EEG2 (r = 0.52; p = 0.006); and (3) SWI versus source RPDC strength at EEG1 (r = 0.65; p = 0.003) and at EEG2 (r = 0.47; p = 0.009). Significance: The leading role of the precuneus and thalamus in the hierarchical organization of the network underlying the background EEG points toward the significance of fluctuations of vigilance in the generation of CSWS. This hierarchical network organization appears to be specific for CSWSas it is resolved after successful treatment.

These abnormalities are thought to be associated with functional disconnections among cortical areas, death of cortical neurons, axonal pathology, and cholinergic deficits. Since transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) over the temporo-parietal area is thought to have beneficial effects in patients with AD, in this study we aimed to investigate whether tDCS benefits are related to tDCS-induced changes in cortical activity, as represented by qEEG. A weak anodal current (1.5 mA, 15 min) was delivered bilaterally over the temporal parietal lobe to seven subjects with probable AD (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE score >20). EEG (21 electrodes, 10-20 international system) was recorded for 5 min with eyes closed before (baseline, t0) and 30 min after anodal and cathodal tDCS ended (t1). At the same time points, patients performed a Word Recognition Task (WRT) to assess working memory functions. The spectral power and the inter- and intra-hemispheric EEG coherence in different frequency bands (e.g., low frequencies, including delta and theta; high frequencies, including alpha and beta) were calculated for each subject at tO and t1. tDCS-induced changes in EEG neurophysiological markers were correlated with the performance of patients at the WRT. At baseline, qEEG features in AD patients confirmed that the decreased high frequency power was correlated with lower MMSE. After anodal tDCS, we observed an increase in the high-frequency power in the temporo-parietal area and an increase in the temporo-parieto-occipital coherence that correlated with the improvement at the WRT. In addition, cathodal tDCS produced a non-specific effect of decreased theta power all over the scalp that was not correlated with the clinical observation at the WRT. Our findings disclosed that tDCS induces significant modulations in the cortical EEG activity in AD patients. The abnormal pattern of EEG activity observed in AD during memory processing is partially reversed by applying anodal tDCS, suggesting that anodal tDCS benefits in AD patients during working memory tasks are supported by the modulation of cortical activity.

Most of the studies have demonstrated their interaction over the prefrontal regions while manipulating visual or verbal working memory load. However, less attention has been directed to the impact of musical or auditory input in cognitive performance. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) of six subjects were measured when they were performing a paradigm of auditory n-back working memory task. EEGLAB and the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) were utilized to parse the scalp EEG signals into source activity. The results revealed that when subjects were engaged in high versus low memory load, there were significantly stronger delta (1-4 Hz) activity in superior frontal gyrus, theta (4-7 Hz) activity in posterior cingulate cortex, alpha 1 (8-10 Hz) and beta 1 (12-16 Hz) activity in insula, but weaker alpha 2 (10-12 Hz) activity in anterior cingulate cortex. These results demonstrated that auditory working memory accompanied distinct brain network modulation to the visual or verbal task.

We used Electroencephalography (EEG) to develop a novel brain-computer interface that monitors users' states in order to reduce visual strain. We present the first system that discriminates comfortable conditions from uncomfortable ones during stereoscopic vision using EEG. In particular, we show that either changes in event-related potentials' (ERPs) amplitudes or changes in EEG oscillations power following stereoscopic objects presentation can be used to estimate visual comfort. Our system reacts within 1 s to depth variations, achieving 63% accuracy on average (up to 76%) and 74% on average when 7 consecutive variations are measured (up to 93%). Performances are stable (approximate to 62.5%) when a simplified signal processing is used to simulate online analyses or when the number of EEG channels is lessened. This study could lead to adaptive systems that automatically suit stereoscopic displays to users and viewing conditions. For example, it could be possible to match the stereoscopic effect with users' state by modifying the overlap of left and right images according to the classifier output.

The dynamics of slow neural oscillations as recorded using magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) provide a window into the neural mechanics of these limitations. Especially oscillations in the alpha range (8-13 Hz) are a sensitive marker for memory load. Moreover, according to current models, the resultant working memory load is determined by the relative noise in the neural representation of maintained information. The auditory domain allows memory researchers to apply and test the concept of noise quite literally: Employing degraded stimulus acoustics increases memory load and, at the same time, allows assessing the cognitive resources required to process speech in noise in an ecologically valid and clinically relevant way. The present review first summarizes recent findings on neural oscillations, especially alpha power, and how they reflect memory load and memory decay in auditory working memory. The focus is specifically on memory load resulting from acoustic degradation. These findings are then contrasted with contextual factors that benefit neural as well as behavioral markers of memory performance, by reducing representational noise. We end on discussing the functional role of alpha power in auditory working memory and suggest extensions of the current methodological toolkit.

Thus, it is inevitable to commit more errors when challenged with high memory loads. However, the neural mechanisms that determine the accuracy of response at high memory loads still remain unclear. High temporal resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) technique makes it the best tool to resolve the temporal dynamics of brain networks. EEG-defined microstate is the quasi-stable scalp electrical potential topography that represents the momentary functional state of brain. Thus, it has been possible to assess the information processing currently performed by the brain using EEG microstate analysis. We hypothesize that the EEG microstate preceding the trial could determine its outcome in a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) task. Twenty-four healthy participants performed a high memory load VSWM task, while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. Four microstate maps were found to represent the functional brain state prior to the trials in the VSWM task. One pre-trial microstate map was found to determine the accuracy of subsequent behavioural response. The intracranial generators of the pre-trial microstate map that determined the response accuracy were localized to the visuospatial processing areas at bilateral occipital, right temporal and limbic cortices. Our results imply that the behavioural outcome in a VSWM task could be determined by the intensity of activation of memory representations in the visuospatial processing brain regions prior to the trial.

We developed a new real-time coordination game that required two individuals of a dyad to synchronize with a partner (coordination task) or with a computer (control task) by counting in mind rhythmically. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded simultaneously from a dyad to examine OT effects on inter-brain synchrony of neural activity during interpersonal coordination. Experiment 1 found that dyads showed smaller interpersonal time lags of counting and greater inter-brain synchrony of alpha-band neural oscillations during the coordination (vs control) task and these effects were reliably observed in female but not male dyads. Moreover, the increased alpha-band inter-brain synchrony predicted better interpersonal behavioral synchrony across all participants. Experiment 2, using a double blind, placebo-controlled between-subjects design, revealed that intranasal OT vs placebo administration in male dyads improved interpersonal behavioral synchrony in both the coordination and control tasks but specifically enhanced alpha-band interbrain neural oscillations during the coordination task. Our findings provide first evidence that OT enhances inter-brain synchrony in male adults to facilitate social coordination.

While the cortical dynamics and neuro-modulating influences affecting the transition from wakefulness to sleep is well researched, the assumption has been that individual slow waves, the hallmark of deep sleep, are spontaneously occurring cortical events. By creating event-related potentials from the NIRS recording, time-locked to the onset of thousands of individual slow waves, we show the onset of slow waves is phase-locked to an ongoing oscillation in the NIRS recording. This oscillation stems from the moment to moment fluctuations of light absorption caused by arterial pulsations driven by the heart beat. The same oscillating signal can be detected if the electrocardiogram is time-locked to the onset of the slow wave. The ongoing NIRS oscillation suggests that individual slow wave initiation is dependent on that signal, and not the other way round. However, the precise causal links remain speculative. We propose several potential mechanisms: that the heart-beat or arterial pulsation acts as a stimulus which evokes a down-state; local fluctuations in energy supply may lead to a network effect of hyperpolarization; that the arterial pulsations lead to corresponding changes in the cerebral-spinal-fluid which evokes the slow wave; or that a third neural generator, regulating heart rate and slow waves may be involved.

Accounting for microsaccadic artifacts in the EEG using independent component analysis and beamforming	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Oscillation; time frequency analyses; Visual processes	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; BRAIN; RESPONSES; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION	Neuronal activity in the gamma-band range was long considered a marker of object representation. However, scalp-recorded EEG activity in this range is contaminated by a miniature saccade-related muscle artifact. Independent component analysis (ICA) has been proposed as a method of removal of such artifacts. Alternatively, beamforming, a source analysis method in which potential sources of activity across the whole brain are scanned independently through the use of adaptive spatial filters, offers a promising method of accounting for the artifact without relying on its explicit removal. We present here the application of ICA-based correction to a previously published dataset. Then, using beamforming, we examine the effect of ICA correction on the scalp-recorded EEG signal and the extent to which genuine activity is recoverable before and after ICA correction. We find that beamforming attributes much of the scalp-recorded gamma-band signal before correction to deep frontal sources, likely the eye muscles, which generate the artifact related to each miniature saccade. Beamforming confirms that what is removed by ICA is predominantly this artifactual signal, and that what remains after correction plausibly originates in the visual cortex. Thus, beamforming allows researchers to confirm whether their removal procedures successfully removed the artifact. Our results demonstrate that ICA-based correction brings about general improvements in signal-to-noise ratio suggesting it should be used along with, rather than be replaced by, beamforming.

Common and differential electrophysiological mechanisms underlying semantic object memory retrieval probed by features presented in different stimulus types	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Semantics; Memory retrieval; Neural oscillations	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA POWER; ALPHA-BAND; EEG; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SIGNATURES; RESPONSES; DELTA	How the brain combines the neural representations of features that comprise an object in order to activate a coherent object memory is poorly understood, especially when the features are presented in different modalities (visual vs. auditory) and domains (verbal vs. nonverbal). We examined this question using three versions of a modified Semantic Object Retrieval Test, where object memory was probed by a feature presented as a written word, a spoken word, or a picture, followed by a second feature always presented as a visual word. Participants indicated whether each feature pair elicited retrieval of the memory of a particular object. Sixteen subjects completed one of the three versions (N = 48 in total) while their EEG were recorded simultaneously. We analyzed EEG data in four separate frequency bands (delta: 1-4 Hz, theta: 4-7 Hz; alpha: 8-12 Hz; beta: 13-19 Hz) using a multivariate data-driven approach. We found that alpha power time-locked to response was modulated by both cross-modality (visual vs. auditory) and cross-domain (verbal vs. nonverbal) probing of semantic object memory. In addition, retrieval trials showed greater changes in all frequency bands compared to non-retrieval trials across all stimulus types in both response-locked and stimulus-locked analyses, suggesting dissociable neural subcomponents involved in binding object features to retrieve a memory. We conclude that these findings support both modality/domain-dependent and modality/domain-independent mechanisms during semantic object memory retrieval. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This vital cognitive function has been related to cholinergic neuromodulation and, in independent work, to theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (9-14 Hz) band oscillations. However, the relationship between both aspects remains unclear. To fill this apparent gap, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and a within-subject design in healthy humans who either received the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (8 mg) or a placebo before they performed a Sternberg WM paradigm. Here, sequences of sample images were memorized for a delay of 5 s in three different load conditions (two, four or six items). On the next day, long-term memory (LTM) for the images was tested according to a remember/know paradigm. As a main finding, we can show that both theta and alpha oscillations scale during WM maintenance as a function of WM load; this resembles the typical performance decrease. Importantly, cholinergic stimulation via galantamine administration slowed down retrieval speed during WM and reduced associated alpha but not theta power, suggesting a functional relationship between alpha oscillations and WM performance. At LTM, this pattern was accompanied by impaired familiarity based recognition. These findings show that stimulating the healthy cholinergic system impairs WM and subsequent recognition, which is in line with the notion of a quadratic relationship between acetylcholine levels and cognitive functions. Moreover, our data provide empirical evidence for a specific role of alpha oscillations in acetylcholine dependent WM and associated LTM formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent neuroimaging studies indicate that learning motor skills is associated with subsequent modulation of resting-state functional connectivity in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices. The neuronal processes underlying the motor-learning-induced plasticity are not well understood. Here, we investigate changes in functional connectivity in source-reconstructed electroencephalography (EEG) following the performance of a single session of a dynamic force task in twenty young adults. Source activity was reconstructed in 112 regions of interest (ROIs) and the functional connectivity between all ROIs was estimated using the imaginary part of coherence. Significant changes in resting-state connectivity were assessed using partial least squares (PLS). We found that subjects adapted their motor performance during the training session and showed improved accuracy but with slower movement times. A number of connections were significantly upregulated after motor training, principally involving connections within the cerebellum and between the cerebellum and motor cortex. Increased connectivity was confined to specific frequency ranges in the mu-and beta-bands. Post hoc analysis of the phase spectra of these cerebellar and cortico-cerebellar connections revealed an increased phase lag between motor cortical and cerebellar activity following motor practice. These findings show a reorganization of intrinsic cortico-cerebellar connectivity related to motor adaptation and demonstrate the potential of EEG connectivity analysis in source space to reveal the neuronal processes that underpin neural plasticity.

Gamma rhythm had been linked with several cognitive functions such attention, memory and perception. In order to explore the understanding of the brain under the real environments, a driving simulator environment might be a best tool that stimulates the brain dynamic activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate cerebral gamma oscillatory differences in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions associated with psychological processes during simulated car driving. Neurophysiological signals of 5 healthy volunteers were recorded by using electroencephalography (EEG) during resting and simulated driving, respectively. Oscillatory differences in the gamma band were calculated by comparison between "resting" and "driving". "Resting" was the baseline, and oscillatory differences in the different regions during "driving" showed an increase in comparison with a baseline. The results indicated that brain oscillatory dynamics could play a role in cognitive processing, and might mediate the interaction between excitation and inhibition.

It differs from normal pregnancy where simple nausea and vomiting are seen frequently with unknown cause. The place and role of the brain in HG is unknown. Materials and Methods: Thirty-three healthy pregnant women and 30 patients diagnosed with HG admitted to Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology Department were included and electroencephalograph (EEG) signals of all patients obtained at Neurology Department were examined. These signals were evaluated with high math and examined with developed engineering methods. The sampling frequency of the EEG was 200 Hz. Data were obtained in the frequency-power axis using 0.1 Hz frequency resolution, Hamming windowing, and 0.5 overlap ratio with signals on the time axis on all channels. All sub-bands have formed with unearthed power spectral density as delta, theta, alpha, and beta and after being created was calculated spectral densities. Results: As a result, while showing significant changes as delta band for Fp1F3, theta band for C3P3, F3C3, Fp1F3, P3O1, T5O1, for other channels and sub-bands has not seen any significant changes with regard to average power spectral density. Conclusion: HG and normal pregnancies, when examined in terms of power spectral density, abnormalities were observed in the EEG signals in the left hemisphere frontal area of the delta band, fronto-centro-parietal, and parietal-occipital areas of the theta band. In light of the literature, neither cerebral abnormalities in HG could be displayed nor the place of abnormality could be shown. However, this study is the first to clearly show abnormalities of theta-delta band activity and differences of locations in the left cerebral hemisphere.

For instance, compared to wakefulness, during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep TMS elicits a larger positive-negative wave, fewer phase-locked oscillations, and an overall simpler response. However, many physiological variables also change when subjects go from wake to sleep, anesthesia, or coma. To avoid these confounding factors, we focused on NREM sleep only and measured TMS-evoked EEG responses before awakening the subjects and asking them if they had been conscious (dreaming) or not. As shown here, when subjects reported no conscious experience upon awakening, TMS evoked a larger negative deflection and a shorter phase-locked response compared to when they reported a dream. Moreover, the amplitude of the negative deflection-a hallmark of neuronal bistability according to intracranial studies-was inversely correlated with the length of the dream report (i.e., total word count). These findings suggest that variations in the level of consciousness within the same physiological state are associated with changes in the underlying bistability in cortical circuits.

FR visual marking is time consuming and prone to observer bias. We validate here a fully automatic HFO detector against seizure outcome. Methods: Pre-resection ECoG dataset (N = 14 patients) with visually marked HFOs were used to optimize the detector's parameters in the time-frequency domain. The optimized detector was then applied on a larger post-resection ECoG dataset (N = 54) and the output was compared with visual markings and seizure outcome. The analysis was conducted separately for ripples (80-250 Hz) and FRs (250-500 Hz). Results: Channel-wise comparison showed a high association between automatic detection and visual marking (p < 0.001 for both FRs and ripples). Automatically detected FRs were predictive of clinical outcome with positive predictive value PPV = 100% and negative predictive value NPV = 62%, while for ripples PPV = 43% and NPV = 100%. Conclusions: Our automatic and fully unsupervised detection of HFO events matched the expert observer's performance in both event selection and outcome prediction. Significance: The detector provides a standardized definition of clinically relevant HFOs, which may spread its use in clinical application.

In this study, we adopted nine network characteristics to verify their performance in the brain of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Weighted networks were derived from phase locking values on multichannel intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings when the patient is undergoing seizure attack. It's illustrated that network efficiency, vertex strength, transitivity and characteristic path were sensitive to the occurrence of seizures compared to other measurements. What's more, networks derived from gamma band neural oscillations performs more remarkable than other sub band signals while networks in delta band manifests trivial alterations during seizure process. Further research would focus on investigating characteristic network features in weighted networks and frequency dependency in epileptic brain of TLE.

EEG studies in healthy controls (HCs) have suggested that the increase in theta power observed after negative outcome is a marker of reward processing. Objective: To compare outcome-locked, event-related spectral perturbation in a gambling task in PD patients with and without ICDs and in HCs. Methods: Twelve PD patients with ICDs, 12 PD patients without ICDs and 14 HCs underwent EEG while performing a gambling task. The groups were compared in terms of (i) the peak EEG power in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency bands between 200 and 500 ms after the outcome, and (ii) time-frequency plots at Fz, FCz and Cz. Results: Positive outcomes were associated with greater theta power than negative outcomes in patients without ICDs and in HCs, but not in patients with ICDs. Patients with ICDs and HCs displayed greater theta power following unexpectedly high outcomes. HCs displayed greater beta power following high amplitude than low amplitude outcomes, whereas patients with ICD showed the opposite pattern. Conclusions: In PD, ICDs are associated with (i) weaker modulation of frontocentral theta power by reward valence, (ii) greater frontocentral theta power following unexpected, high outcomes, and (iii) a reversal of the effect of risk on beta oscillations. These observations are consistent with an impairment in prediction error computation in the medial prefrontal cortex.

Abnormalities of oscillatory gamma activity are supposed to reflect a core pathophysiological mechanism underlying cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia. The auditory evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) is known to be reduced across all stages of the disease. The present study aimed to elucidate alterations of an aeGBR-specific network mediated by gamma oscillations in the high-risk state of psychosis (HRP) by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) informed by electroencephalography (EEG). Methods. EEG and fMRI were simultaneously recorded from 27 HRP individuals and 26 healthy controls (HC) during performance of a cognitively demanding auditory reaction task. We used single trial coupling of the aeGBR with the corresponding blood oxygen level depending response (EEG-informed fMRI). Results. A gamma-band-specific network was significantly lower active in HRP subjects compared with HC (random effects analysis, P < .01, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons) accompanied by a worse task performance. This network involved the bilateral auditory cortices, the thalamus and frontal brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conclusions. For the first time we report a reduced activation of an aeGBR-specific network in HRP subjects brought forward by EEG-informed fMRI. Because the HRP reflects the clinical risk for conversion to psychotic disorders including schizophrenia and the aeGBR has repeatedly been shown to be altered in patients with schizophrenia the results of our study point towards a potential applicability of aeGBR disturbances as a marker for the prediction of transition of HRP subjects to schizophrenia.

Electroencephalogram signatures of ketamine anesthesia-induced unconsciousness	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Unconsciousness; Ketamine; Anesthesia; Slow oscillations; Gamma oscillations	PARABRACHIAL NUCLEUS; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; SEVOFLURANE; EEG; COHERENCE; PROPOFOL; HUMANS; POWER; NMDA; RAT	Objectives: Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist commonly administered as a general anesthetic. However, neural circuit mechanisms to explain ketamine anesthesia-induced unconsciousness in humans are yet to be clearly defined. Disruption of frontal-parietal network connectivity has been proposed as a mechanism to explain this brain state. However, this mechanism was recently demonstrated at subanesthetic doses of ketamine in awake-patients. Therefore, we investigated whether there is an electroencephalogram (EEG) signature specific for ketamine anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. Methods: We retrospectively studied the EEG in 12 patients who received ketamine for the induction of general anesthesia. We analyzed the EEG dynamics using power spectral and coherence methods. Results: Following the administration of a bolus dose of ketamine to induce unconsciousness, we observed a "gamma burst" EEG pattern that consisted of alternating slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) and gamma (similar to 27-40 Hz) oscillations. This pattern was also associated with increased theta oscillations (similar to 4-8 Hz) and decreased alpha/beta oscillations (similar to 10-24 Hz). Conclusions: Ketamine anesthesia-induced unconsciousness is associated with a gamma burst EEG pattern.

To discard the possible influence of medication, the relation between psychotic-like experiences (PLE) and EEG modulation in the general population was explored. MethodsEEG and PLE were assessed in 194 healthy subjects during a P300 paradigm. EEG modulation was assessed as changes from pre-stimulus to response windows in spectral entropy (SE; a measurement of signal irregularity), median frequency (MF; a quantifier of the frequency distribution of oscillatory activity) and theta, alpha, beta-1, beta-2 and gamma relative power (RP; a summary of the distribution of spectral components). ResultsA significant widespread decrease in SE and MF from baseline to response was found, with a significant increase in RP for theta and a decrease for higher frequency bands, supporting an increase in EEG regularity and a slowing of brain oscillations during the response. Furthermore, a significant association was found between SE modulation and distress of negative PLE, as well as between verbal memory and RP modulation for beta-1. Performance in verbal fluency was associated with the increase in theta RP during the response. Conclusion EEG irregularity of healthy subjects decreased at the expense of a larger contribution of theta RP and a decreased contribution of fast frequency bands. Subjects with smaller modulation showed poorer cognitive scores and greater distress of negative PLE.

For that purpose, a feature of iEEG to characterize the ictal state with high specificity and sensitivity is necessary. We evaluated the use of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of iEEG signals over a period of 24 h to detect the ictal and interictal states. PAC was estimated by using a synchronisation index (SI) for iEEG signals from seven patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. iEEG signals of the ictal state was characterised by a strong PAC between the phase of beta and the amplitude of high gamma. Furthermore, using SI values, the ictal state was successfully detected with significantly higher accuracy than by using the amplitude of high gamma alone. In conclusion, PAC accurately distinguished the ictal state from the interictal state.

We hypothesized that LRTCs could be controlled by engaging intrinsic neuroregulation through closed-loop neurofeedback stimulation. Methods: We used a closed-loop-stimulation paradigm where supra-threshold alpha-waves trigger visual flash stimuli while the subject performs the standard eyes-closed resting-state task. As a "sham" control condition, we applied similar stimulus sequences without the neurofeedback. Results: Over three sessions, a significant difference in the LRTCs of a-band oscillations (U = 89, p < 0.028, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and their scalp topography (T = -2.92, p < 0.010, T-test) emerged between the neurofeedback and sham conditions so that the LRTCs were stronger during neurofeedback than sham. No changes (F = 0.16, p > 0.69, ANOVA test) in the scalp topography of alpha-band power were observed in either condition. Conclusions: This study provides proof-of-concept for that EEG LRTCs, and hence critical brain dynamics, can be modulated with closed-loop stimulation in an automatic, involuntary fashion. We suggest that this modulation is mediated by an excitation-inhibition balance change achieved by the closed-loop neuroregulation. Significance: Automatic LRTC modulation opens novel avenues for both examining the functional roles of brain criticality in healthy subjects and for developing novel therapeutic approaches for brain disorders associated with abnormal LRTCs.

Methods: Experiments were conducted on adult 2- to 4-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Two groups of animals were studied: (1) the TBI group with depth and screw electrodes implanted immediately after the fluid percussion injury (FPI) procedure, and (2) a naive age-matched control group with the same electrode implantation montage. Pairs of tungsten microelectrodes (50 lm outer diameter) and screw electrodes were implanted in neocortex inside the TBI core, areas adjacent to TBI, and remote areas. EEG activity, recorded on the day of FPI, and continuously for 2 weeks, was analyzed for possible electrographic biomarkers of epileptogenesis. Video-EEG monitoring was also performed continuously in the TBI group to capture electrographic and behavioral seizures until the caps came off (28-189 days), and for 1 week, at 2, 3, and 6 months of age, in the control group. Results: Pathologic high-frequency oscillations (pHFOs) with a central frequency between 100 and 600 Hz, were recorded from microelectrodes, beginning during the first two post-FPI weeks, in 7 of 12 animals in the TBI group (58%) and never in the controls. pHFOs only occurred in cortical areas within or adjacent to the TBI core. These were associated with synchronous multiunit discharges and popSpikes, duration 1540 msec. Repetitive pHFOs and EEG spikes (rHFOSs) formed paroxysmal activity, with a unique arcuate pattern, in the frequency band 10-16 Hz in the same areas as isolated pHFOs, and these events were also recorded by screw electrodes. Although loss of caps prevented long-term recordings from all rats, pHFOs and rHFOSs occurred during the first 2 weeks in all four animals that later developed seizures, and none of the rats without these events developed late seizures. Significance: pHFOs, similar to those associated with epileptogenesis in the status rat model of epilepsy, may also reflect epileptogenesis after FPI. rHFOSs could be noninvasive biomarkers of epileptogenesis.

This study aimed to characterize functional connectivity in the healthy human newborn, and to identify the changes in connectivity related to vigilance states and to maturation during the early postnatal weeks. We recorded active and quiet sleep of 38 sleeping newborn babies using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) at 2 neonatal time points. Functional connectivity between brain areas was quantified with 3 different metrics: phase-phase correlations, amplitude-amplitude correlations (AACs), and phase-amplitude correlations. All functional connectivity measures changed significantly between vigilance states and matured rapidly after normal birth. The observed changes were frequency-specific, most salient in AAC coupling, and their development was compatible with the known development of structural cortico-cortical connectivity. The present findings support the view that emerging functional connectivity exhibits fundamental differences between sleep states months before the onset of genuine EEG signatures of sleep states. Moreover, our findings also support the idea that early cortical events entail different mechanisms of functional coupling needed to provide endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks.

In existing seizure detectors, the analysis of the nonlinear and nonstationary ECG signal is limited to the time-domain or frequency-domain. In this work, heart rate variability (HRV) extracted from ECG is analyzed using a Matching-Pursuit (MP) and Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) algorithm in order to effectively extract meaningful HRV features representative of seizure and nonseizure states. The EEG analysis relies on a common spatial pattern (CSP) based feature enhancement stage that enables better discrimination between seizure and nonseizure features. The EEG-based detector uses logical operators to pool SVM seizure onset detections made independently across different EEG spectral bands. Two fusion systems are adopted. In the first system, EEG-based and ECG-based decisions are directly fused to obtain a final decision. The second fusion system adopts an override option that allows for the EEG-based decision to override the fusion-based decision in the event that the detector observes a string of EEG-based seizure decisions. The proposed detectors exhibit an improved performance, with respect to sensitivity and detection latency, compared with the state-of-the-art detectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the second detector achieves a sensitivity of 100%, detection latency of 2.6 s, and a specificity of 99.91% for the MAJ fusion case. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

More Severe Insomnia Complaints in People with Stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Wake Resting-State EEG	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						resting-state; insomnia; sleep; HD-EEG; long-range temporal correlations; criticality; detrended fluctuation analysis; excitation-inhibition balance	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; SLEEP; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; TRANSITIONS; HYPERAROUSAL; CRITICALITY; SIGNATURES	The complaints of people suffering from Insomnia Disorder (ID) concern both sleep and daytime functioning. However, little is known about wake brain temporal dynamics in people with ID. We therefore assessed possible alterations in Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) in the amplitude fluctuations of band-filtered oscillations in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. We investigated whether LRTC differ between cases with ID and matched controls. Within both groups, we moreover investigated whether individual differences in subjective insomnia complaints are associated with LRTC. Resting-state high-density EEG (256-channel) was recorded in 52 participants with ID and 43 age- and sex-matched controls, during Eyes Open (EO) and Eyes Closed (EC). Detrended fluctuation analysis was applied to the amplitude envelope of band-filtered EEG oscillations (theta, alpha, sigma, beta-1, beta-2) to obtain the Hurst exponents (H), as measures of LRTC. Participants rated their subjective insomnia complaints using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Through general linear models, we evaluated whether H, aggregated across electrodes and frequencies, differed between cases and controls, or showed within-group associations with individual differences in ISI. Additionally, we characterized the spatio-spectral profiles of group differences and associations using non-parametric statistics. H did not differ between cases with ID and controls in any of the frequency bands, neither during EO nor EC. During EO, however, within-group associations between H and ISI indicated that individuals who experienced worse sleep quality had stronger LRTC. Spatio-spectral profiles indicated that the associations held most prominently for the amplitude fluctuations of parietal theta oscillations within the ID group, and of centro-frontal beta-1 oscillations in controls. While people suffering from insomnia experience substantially worse sleep quality than controls, their brain dynamics express similar strength of LRTC. In each group, however, individuals experiencing worse sleep quality tend to have stronger LRTC during eyes open wakefulness, in a spatio-spectral range specific for each group. Taken together, the findings indicate that subjective insomnia complaints involve distinct dynamical processes in people with ID and controls. The findings are in agreement with recent reports on decreasing LRTC with sleep depth, and with the hypothesis that sleep balances brain excitability.

In this work we demonstrated the usefulness of two nonlinear combinations of differential operators on intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings to study abnormal oscillations in human brain during intractable focal epileptic seizures. Each one dimensional time domain signal was visualized as the trajectory of a particle moving in a force field with one degree of freedom. Modeling of the temporal difference operators to be applied on the signals was inspired by the principles of classical Newtonian mechanics. Efficiency of one of the nonlinear combinations of the operators in distinguishing the seizure part from the background signal and the artifacts was established, particularly when the seizure duration was long. The resultant automatic detection algorithm is linear time executable and detects a seizure with an average delay of 5.02 s after the electrographic onset, with a mean 0.05/h false positive rate and 94% detection accuracy. The area under the ROC curve was 0.959. Another nonlinear combination of differential operators detects spikes (peaks) and inverted spikes (troughs) in a signal irrespective of their shape and size. It was shown that in a majority of the cases simultaneous occurrence of all the spikes and inverted spikes across the focal channels was more after the seizure offset than during the seizure, where the duration after the offset was taken equal to the duration of the seizure. It has been explained in terms of GABAergic inhibition of seizure termination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the presented method reduction of artifacts in EEG signal is not required. Besides, the method has low computational complexity. In order to select the best ICA decomposition, we conducted a comparative study of known ICA algorithms for the use in SSVEP detection. For feature extraction from ICA components, time-frequency analysis (STFT) was used. The algorithm was tested on real EEG signals recorded from 5 users, for 4 stimuli frequencies. The achieved SSVEP classification accuracy was in the range of 53-89%, for different users. The proposed algorithm can be successfully used in SSVEP based brain-computer interfaces.

Although neural signatures for working memory aspects of such tasks were recently also identified in human oscillatory EEG activity, homologue correlates of the comparison process are yet unknown. Here, we recorded EEG activity while participants decided which of two sequentially presented vibrotactile stimuli had a higher frequency. Because choices in this type of task are known to be systematically biased by the time-order effect, we applied Bayesian modeling to account for individual choice behavior. Using model-based EEG analysis, we found that upper beta band amplitude (approximate to 20-30 Hz) was modulated by participants' choices. The modulation emerged approximate to 750 msec before a behavioral response was given and was source-localized to premotor areas.Importantly, the choice-dependent modulation of beta band amplitude was invariant to different motor response mappings and reflected the categorical outcome of the subjective comparison between the two frequencies. Consistently, this pattern was evident for both correct and incorrect trials, indicating that the beta band amplitude mirrors the internal representation of the comparison outcome. Our data complement previous findings in nonhuman primates and corroborate that the beta band activity in premotor areas reflects the categorical outcome of a sensory comparison prior to translation into an effector-specific motor command.

In this paper, we propose a new method for background noise removal from single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded with a multi-channel EEG. An observed signal is separated into multiple signals with a multi-channel Wiener filter, whose coefficients are estimated based on a probabilistic generative model in the time-frequency domain. The main contribution is a method to estimate covariance matrices for each frequency bins of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representing different spatial spread of a multi-channel EEG signal according to frequencies. An experiment using a pseudo-ERP data set demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Once concerns are identified in a community setting, however, effective means are necessary to pinpoint those individuals who should go on to more complex and costly diagnostic evaluations (e.g., functional imaging). We tested 44 African American volunteers endorsing cognitive concerns (37 females, 7 males) age >= 65 years with CogState battery subtests and recorded resting-state EEG, with eyes closed. After current source density (CSD) transformations of EEG recordings we obtained spectral power for delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. We characterized CogState One Card Back Learning (OCL, memory) with diffusion model parameters drift rate, boundary and non decision time (NDT). Forward regression models showed that lower OCL drift rate, slower accumulation of information needed for decision making was linked to increased absolute and relative delta at occipital region. Lower drift rate was also linked to decrease in OCL theta power at parietal region, with no findings for ONB. Results show that cortical resting, eyes closed EEG rhythms are related to memory in African American seniors endorsing cognitive concerns. This study further supports the use of EEG as an easily accessible, cost-effective, culture-fair, and noninvasive clinical measurement that could provide potentially reliable diagnostic (and perhaps prognostic) information to differentiate at-risk from stable African American seniors.

Developmental differences in beta and theta power during sentence processing	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; Language; ERP; Development	LANGUAGE-DEVELOPMENT; SPHERICAL SPLINES; EEG; COMPREHENSION; CHILDREN; TIME; CONTEXT; WORDS; BRAIN; INCONGRUITY	Although very young children process ongoing language quickly and effortlessly, research indicates that they continue to improve and mature in their language skills through adolescence. This prolonged development may be related to differing engagement of semantic and syntactic processes. This study used event related potentials and time frequency analysis of EEG to identify developmental differences in neural engagement as children (ages 10-12) and adults performed an auditory verb agreement grammaticality judgment task. Adults and children revealed very few differences in comprehending grammatically correct sentences. When identifying grammatical errors, however, adults displayed widely distributed beta and theta power decreases that were significantly less pronounced in children. Adults also demonstrated a significant P600 effect, while children exhibited an apparent N400 effect. Thus, when identifying subtle grammatical errors in real time, adults display greater neural activation that is traditionally associated with syntactic processing whereas children exhibit greater activity more commonly associated with semantic processing. These findings support previous claims that the cognitive and neural underpinnings of syntactic processing are still developing in adolescence, and add to them by more clearly identifying developmental changes in the neural oscillations underlying grammatical processing. 2016 The Authors.

We proposed that operant conditioning of EEG in neurofeedback mode can be accompanied by changes in the relative power of EEG bands. However, the details on the change of the relative power of EEG bands during neurofeedback training course in autism are not yet well explored. In this study, we analyzed the EEG recordings of children diagnosed with autism and enrolled in a prefrontal neurofeedback treatment course. The protocol used in this training was aimed at increasing the ability to focus attention, and the procedure represented the wide band EEG amplitude suppression training along with upregulation of the relative power of gamma activity. Quantitative EEG analysis was completed for each session of neurofeedback using wavelet transform to determine the relative power of gamma and theta/beta ratio, and further to detect the statistical changes within and between sessions. We found a linear decrease of theta/beta ratio and a liner increase of relative power of gamma activity over 18 weekly sessions of neurofeedback in 18 high functioning children with autism. The study indicates that neurofeedback is an effective method for altering EEG characteristics associated with the autism spectrum disorder. Also, it provides information about specific changes of EEG activities and details the correlation between changes of EEG and neurofeedback indexes during the course of neurofeedback. This pilot study contributes to the development of more effective approaches to EEG data analysis during prefrontal neurofeedback training in autism.

Recent studies have shown that pain-evoked electroencephalography (EEG) responses could be used as a readout of perceived pain intensity. Existing EEG-based pain assessment is normally achieved by cross-individual prediction (i.e., to train a prediction model from a group of individuals and to apply the model on a new individual), so its performance is seriously hampered by the substantial inter-individual variability in pain-evoked EEG responses. In this study, to reduce the inter-individual variability in pain-evoked EEG and to improve the accuracy of cross-individual pain prediction, we examined the relationship between pain-evoked EEG, spontaneous EEG, and pain perception on a pain EEG dataset, where a large number of laser pulses ( >100) with a wide energy range were delivered. Motivated by our finding that an individual's pain-evoked EEG responses is significantly correlated with his/her spontaneous EEG in terms of magnitude, we proposed a normalization method for pain-evoked EEG responses using one's spontaneous EEG to reduce the inter-individual variability. In addition, a nonlinear relationship between the level of pain perception and pain-evoked EEG responses was obtained, which inspired us to further develop a new two-stage pain prediction strategy, a binary classification of low-pain and high-pain trials followed by a continuous prediction for high-pain trials only, both of which used spontaneous-EEG-normalized magnitudes of evoked EEG responses as features. Results show that the proposed normalization strategy can effectively reduce the inter-individual variability in pain-evoked responses, and the two-stage pain prediction method can lead to a higher prediction accuracy.

Time frequency analysis using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is used to compute spectrogram from the EEG data. The STFT is scaled to have gray level values on which Grey Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is computed. Texture descriptors such as correlation, energy, contrast, homogeneity and dissimilarity are calculated from the GLCM matrices. The texture descriptors are used to train a logistic regression classifier which is then used to classify the left and right motor imagery signals. The single-channel motor imagery classification system is tested offline with different subjects. The average offline accuracy is 87.6%. An online BCI system is implemented in openViBE with the single channel classification scheme. The stimuli presentations and feedback are implemented in Python and integrated with the openViBe BCI system.

Many existing methods for sleep stages classification mainly depend on the analysis of EEG signals in time or frequency domain to obtain a high classification accuracy. In this paper, the statistical features in time domain, the structural graph similarity and the K-means (SGSKM) are combined to identify six sleep stages using single channel EEG signals. Firstly, each EEG segment is partitioned into sub-segments. The size of a sub-segment is determined empirically. Secondly, statistical features are extracted, sorted into different sets of features and forwarded to the SGSKM to classify EEG sleep stages. We have also investigated the relationships between sleep stages and the time domain features of the EEG data used in this paper. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields better classification results than other four existing methods and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A 95.93% average classification accuracy is achieved by using the proposed method.

This effect might be directly related to neuronal desynchronization mediated by cholinergic neurotransmission. We investigated whether interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and high frequency oscillations-a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone -are evenly distributed across phasic and tonic REM sleep. We hypothesized that IEDs aremore suppressed during phasic REM sleep because of additional cholinergic drive. Methods: Twelve patients underwent polysomnography during long-term combined scalp-intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) recording. After sleep staging in the scalp EEG, we identified segments of REM sleep with rapid eye movements (phasic REM) and segments of REM sleep without rapid eye movements (tonic REM). In the intracerebral EEG, we computed the power in frequencies <30 Hz and from 30 to 500 Hz, and marked IEDs, ripples (>80 Hz) and fast ripples (>250 Hz). We grouped the intracerebral channels into channels in the seizure-onset zone (SOZ), the exclusively irritative zone (EIZ), and the normal zone (NoZ). Results: Power in frequencies <30 Hz was lower during phasic than tonic REM sleep (p < 0.001), most likely reflecting increased desynchronization. IEDs, ripples and fast ripples, were less frequent during phasic than tonic REM sleep (phasic REM sleep: 39% of spikes, 35% of ripples, 18% of fast ripples, tonic REM sleep: 61% of spikes, 65% of ripples, 82% of fast ripples; p < 0.001). In contrast to ripples in the epileptogenic zone, physiologic ripples were more abundant during phasic REM sleep (phasic REM sleep: 73% in NoZ, 30% in EIZ, 28% in SOZ, tonic REM sleep: 27% in NoZ, 70% in EIZ, 72% in SOZ; p < 0.001). Significance: Phasic REM sleep has an enhanced suppressive effect on IEDs, corroborating the role of EEG desynchronization in the suppression of interictal epileptic activity. In contrast, physiologic ripples were increased during phasic REM sleep, possibly reflecting REM-related memory consolidation and dreaming.

The "rules" governing these plasticity mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated longitudinal changes of cognitive functioning (intelligence quotient [IQ]) and assessed the performance of clinical, electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) variables for predicting IQ in children with Sturge Weber syndrome. METHODS: Thirty-three young children (mean age: 3.3 years at baseline) with unilateral Sturge Weber syndrome underwent MRI, scalp EEG, and neuropsychology evaluation twice, with a median follow-up of 2 years. None of the children had epilepsy surgery. Longitudinal IQ changes were calculated. Seizure variables, interictal EEG abnormalities, and extent and location of MRI brain involvement were correlated with IQ assessed at follow-up. RESULTS: Global IQ showed a highly variable course with both increases and decreases over time. Lower IQ at baseline was associated with interval IQ increase. In univariate analyses, lower outcome IQ was associated with baseline EEG abnormalities (P < 0.001), young age at seizure onset (P = 0.001), high seizure frequency (P = 0.02), and early frontal-lobe involvement on MRI (P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, EEG abnormalities at baseline remained a robust, independent predictor of outcome IQ, CONCLUSIONS: The early trajectory of cognitive changes in children with unilateral Sturge Weber syndrome is highly variable; children with improving IQ likely undergo effective unimpeded functional reorganization. Early onset, frequent seizures, and interictal epileptiform abnormalities on EEG likely interfere with this process resulting in poor cognitive functions. Future studies assessing interventions should target this high-risk subgroup to optimize cognitive outcome in Sturge Weber syndrome.

MOTIVATION AND MOTOR CORTICAL ACTIVITY CAN INDEPENDENTLY AFFECT MOTOR PERFORMANCE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						incentives; electroencephalography; beta-suppression; electromyography; premotor reaction time	BETA-OSCILLATIONS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; DOPAMINE	The present study explored the relationship between motor-preparatory electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, motivation, and motor performance (specifically pre-motor reaction time [RT]). Participants performed a RT task by squeezing a hand dynamometer in response to an auditory "go" signal. We recorded EEG and electromyography to index beta-suppression and premotor RT, respectively. Participants' motivation on each trial was modulated by offering monetary incentives at different magnitudes. Mixed-effect linear regression models showed that monetary incentive predicted premotor RT when controlling for beta-suppression, and beta-suppression independently predicted premotor RT. Thus, it appears motivation and beta-suppression can facilitate motor performance independent of one another. A plausible explanation of this effect is that motivation can affect motor performance independent of the motor cortex by influencing subcortical motor circuitry. (C) 2016 IBRO.

Whilst the appearence of the main frequency is usually considered as a transition from noisy complex dynamics of baseline EEG to more regular absence activity, the dynamical properties of this type of epileptiformic activity in genetic absence animal models was not studied precisely. Here, the estimation of the largest Lyapunov exponent from intracranial EEGs of 10 WAG/Rij rats (genetic model of absence epilepsy) was performed. Fragments of 10 seizures and 10 episodes of inter-ictal on-going EEG each of 4 s length were used for each animal, 3 cortical and 2 thalamic channels were analysed. The method adapted for short noisy data was implemented. Positive values of the largest Lyapunov exponent were found for baseline as well as for spike wave discharges (SWDs), with values for SWDs being significantly less than for inter-ictal baseline on-going activity. Current findings may indicate that on-going inter-ictal EEG and SWD are both chaotic processes. Also, the SWD activity was shown to be less chaotic than the baseline one.

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is utilized to decompose the recorded signals into several frequency bands, and signals corresponding to each frequency band (referred to as subband components) are reconstructed. Using "source-informed segmentation" technique, the subband components are then segmented into intervals during which the spatial distribution of the underlying ensembles of active and functionally connected neurons is expected to stay quasi-stationary. This is achieved through monitoring the running dominant left singular subspace of each subband component matrix for statistically significant shifts in its span over time. Finally, for each identified segment, the source matrix is analyzed for ensembles of functionally connected cortical points. These ensembles are localized through correlating their temporal activity to the dominant right singular vectors of the corresponding source matrix, during the segment. Depending on the number of extracted dominant right singular vectors, multiple ensembles of functionally connected cortical points can be localized per segment and subband. The proposed method is then used to explore the temporal evolution of functional connectivity during a visual oddball task, at scales spanning delta-, theta-, and alpha-bands. Results are presented and discussed.

Emerging technology enables this disorder detectable through monitoring of EEG signals. However, in working with EEG, the lack of methodological approach would lead to gargantuan of data and thus wastage in resources and time. Furthermore, placing of a large number of electrodes on the recording cap will cause discomfort to the subject, with data being more liable to false readings and artifacts. Recognizing the number of electrodes through proper localization plays a fundamental role in improving the overall performance of an EEG acquisition system, thus the objective of this research. This study involves the following phases: Data Collection, Data Acquisition and Data Analysis. Target population are normal and healthy subjects of age between 18 and 25. The EEG signals are recorded with electrodes at activation areas along the documented signal pathway of the brain (C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, T7, FC5) during reading and writing. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to transform the EEG in time domain into frequency domain so that signature features in frequency content during relaxation and sentence writing can be extracted. Results showed that relaxation drew on one dominant peak and the frequency content resides in the alpha sub-band while writing activity drew on two dominant peaks, one in alpha and the other in beta sub-band. The frequency range of EEG recorded during relaxation is 8-13 Hz while that during writing is 13-29 Hz, well within the alpha and beta subband for the different neuro-activity accordingly. Hence, it can be concluded from experimental results and findings from previous works that electrodes C3/C4, P3/P4, O1/O2, T7 and FC5 are suitable as optimal localized EEG electrode placement for neuro-pathway for reading-writing.

One plausible explanation for such variability may relate to different neuronal states defining the reactivity of the cortex to TMS. In this study intrinsic spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics were estimated with Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) in order to predict the inter-individual differences in the strength of intra-cortical facilitation (ICF) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) produced by paired-pulse TMS (ppTMS) of the left primary motor cortex. LRTC in the alpha frequency range were assessed from multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) obtained at rest before and after the application of and single-pulse TMS (spTMS) and ppTMS protocols. For the EEG session, preceding TMS application, we showed a positive correlation across subjects between the strength of ICF and LRTC in the fronto-central and parietal areas. This in turn attests to the existence of subject-specific neuronal phenotypes defining the reactivity of the brain to ppTMS. In addition, we also showed that ICF was associated with the changes in neuronal dynamics in the EEG session after the application of the stimulation. This result provides a complementary evidence for the recent findings demonstrating that the cortical stimulation with sparse non-regular stimuli might have considerable long-lasting effects on the cortical activity.

Although many networks appear modular and specific, global and nonspecific fMRI fluctuations also exist and both pose a challenge and present an opportunity for characterizing and understanding brain networks. Here, we used a multimodal approach to investigate the neural correlates to the global fMRI signal in the resting state. Like fMRI, resting-state power fluctuations of broadband and arrhythmic, or scale-free, macaque electrocorticography and human magnetoencephalography activity were correlated globally. The power fluctuations of scale-free human electroencephalography (EEG) were coupled with the global component of simultaneously acquired resting-state fMRI, with the global hemodynamic change lagging the broadband spectral change of EEG by similar to 5 s. The levels of global and nonspecific fluctuation and synchronization in scale-free population activity also varied across and depended on arousal states. Together, these results suggest that the neural origin of global resting-state fMRI activity is the broadband power fluctuation in scale-free population activity observable with macroscopic electrical or magnetic recordings. Moreover, the global fluctuation in neurophysiological and hemodynamic activity is likely modulated through diffuse neuromodulation pathways that govern arousal states and vigilance levels.

A real-time analysis during a simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition is essential when studying neurofeedback and conducting effective brain activity monitoring. However, the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts which are induced by heartbeat-related electrode movements in an MRI scanner severely contaminate the EEG signals and hinder a reliable real-time analysis. New method: The optimal basis sets (OBS) method is an effective candidate for removing BCG artifacts in a traditional offline EEG-fMRI analysis, but has yet to be applied to a real-time EEG-fMRI analysis. Here, a novel real-time technique based on OBS method (rtOBS) is proposed to remove BCG artifacts on a moment-to-moment basis. Real-time electrocardiogram R-peak detection procedure and sliding window OBS method were adopted. Results: A series of simulated data was constructed to verify the feasibility of the rtOBS technique. Furthermore, this method was applied to real EEG-fMRI data to remove BCG artifacts. The results of both simulated data and real EEG-fMRI data from eight healthy human subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of rtOBS in both the time and frequency domains. Comparison with existing methods: A comparison between rtOBS and real-time averaged artifact subtraction (rtAAS) was conducted. The results suggest the efficacy and advantage of rtOBS in the real-time removal of BCG artifacts. Conclusions: In this study, a novel real-time OBS technique was proposed for the real-time removal of BCG artifacts. The proposed method was tested using simulated data and applied to real simultaneous EEG-fMRI data. The results suggest the effectiveness of this method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Low-Power, 8-Channel EEG Recorder and Seizure Detector ASIC for a Subdermal Implantable System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Biomedical electronics; biomedical signal processing; electroencephalography; epilepsy; implantable biomedical devices; microelectronic implants	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER; CMOS	EEG remains the mainstay test for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy. Unfortunately, ambulatory EEG systems are far from ideal for patients who have infrequent seizures. These systems only last up to 3 days and if a seizure is not captured during the recordings, a definite diagnosis of the patient's condition cannot be given. This work aims to address this need by proposing a subdermal implantable, eight-channel EEG recorder and seizure detector that has two modes of operation: diagnosis and seizure counting. In the diagnosis mode, EEG is continuously recorded until a number of seizures are recorded. In the seizure counting mode, the system uses a low-power algorithm to track the number of seizures a patient has, providing doctors with a reliable count to help determine medication efficacy or other clinical endpoint. An ASIC that implements the EEG recording and seizure detection algorithm was designed and fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process. The ASIC includes eight EEG channels and is designed to minimize the system's power and size. The result is a power-efficient analog front end that requires 2.75 mu W per channel in diagnosis mode and 0.84 mu W per channel in seizure counting mode. Both modes have an input referred noise of approximately 1.1 mu Vrms.

GABAA circuit mechanisms are associated with ether anesthesia-induced unconsciousness	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Isoflurane; Desflurane; Ketamine; Slow oscillations; Alpha oscillations	INDUCED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM DYNAMICS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; MOLECULAR TARGETS; PROPOFOL; SLOW; KETAMINE; SEVOFLURANE; CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATION; COHERENCE	Objective: An emerging paradigm for understanding how anesthetics induce altered arousal is relating receptor targeting in specific neural circuits to electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. Enhanced gamma amino-butyric acid A (GABAA) inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) manifest with large-amplitude slow (0.1-1 Hz) and frontally coherent alpha (8-12 Hz) EEG oscillations during general anesthesia. Therefore, we investigated the EEG signatures of modern day derivatives of ether (MDDE) anesthesia to assess the extent to which we could obtain insights into MDDE anesthetic mechanisms. Methods: We retrospectively studied cases from our database in which patients received isoflurane anesthesia vs. isoflurane/ketamine anesthesia (n = 10 each) or desflurane anesthesia vs. desflurane/ketamine anesthesia (n = 9 each). We analyzed the EEG recordings with spectral power and coherence methods. Results: Similar to known GABAA circuit level mechanisms, we found that MDDE anesthesia induced large amplitude slow and frontally coherent alpha oscillations. Additionally, MDDE anesthesia also induced frontally coherent theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations. Reduction of GABAergic IPSCs with ketamine resulted in beta/gamma (13-40 Hz) oscillations, and significantly reduced MDDE anesthesia-induced slow, theta and alpha oscillation power. Conclusions: Large amplitude slow oscillations and coherent alpha and theta oscillations are moderated by ketamine during MDDE anesthesia. Significance: These observations are consistent with the notion that GABAA circuit-level mechanisms are associated with MDDE anesthesia-induced unconsciousness.

Advances have been achieved in part through the use of intracerebral recording methods such as stereo-electroencephalography (S-EEG), which has allowed a unique "in vivo" neurophysiological insight into focal epilepsy. Using S-EEG, the local features of physiological and pathological EEG activity in different cortical and subcortical structures have been better defined during the entire sleep-wake spectrum. For example, S-EEG has contributed to clarify the semiology of sleep-related seizures as well as highlight the specific epileptogenic networks involved during ictal activity. Moreover, intracerebral EEG recordings derived from patients with epilepsy have been valuable to study sleep physiology and specific sleep disorders. The occasional co-occurrence of NREM-related parasomnias in epileptic patients undergoing S-EEG investigation has permitted the recordings of such events, highlighting the presence of local electrophysiological dissociated states and clarifying the underlying pathophysiological substrate of such NREM sleep disorders. Based on these recent advances, the authors review and summarize the current and relevant S-EEG literature on sleep related hypermotor epilepsies and NREM-related parasomnias. Finally, novel data and future research hypothesis will be discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND.

To elucidate the alterations of cortical activities, resting-state electrophysiological activities were recorded from patients with mild (<30%; n = 10; age 57-85 years), moderate (30% to 50%; n = 11; age 66-88 years), and severe (>50%; n = 8; age 67-91 years) carotid stenosis. The current density and oscillatory power of the cortical sources were analyzed using the minimum norm estimates method combined with fast Fourier transform analysis. Our results indicate that the cortical current density among regions of the brain was similar, irrespective of the degree of carotid stenosis. With regard to the cortical oscillations, augmented theta activities in the bilateral parietal, left temporal, and left occipital regions and attenuated alpha activities in the bilateral frontal and right central regions were obtained in patients with severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis. We suggest that the source-based cortical oscillations at theta and alpha bands might reflect the alterations of the brain activities and characterize the altered neurophysiological mechanism of the brain with at least 50% occlusion of the carotid artery. Further longitudinal studies with larger populations are warranted to verify the present findings.

Therefore, this method is proposed to intercept early in the disease course those MCI subjects who are in a pre-symptomatic stage of an already established AD. This prediction index may help the clinician to adopt a better prevention/follow-up strategy. In this direction, the novel advances in EEG analysis for the evaluation of brain reactivity and connectivity-namely via innovative mathematical approach, i.e., graph theory-represent a promising tool for a non-invasive and easy-to-perform neurophysiological marker that could be used for the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of AD and to predict MCI progression to dementia.

A Generalized Coherence Framework for Detecting and Characterizing Nonlinear Interactions in the Nervous System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Basic and Clinical Multimodal Imaging (BaCI)	SEP 02-05, 2015	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS			Coherence; cross-frequency coupling; electroencephalogram (EEG); human proprioceptive system; nonlinear dynamics	BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; STATISTICS; CORTEX; MODEL	Objective: This paper introduces a generalized coherence framework for detecting and characterizing nonlinear interactions in the nervous system, namely cross-spectral coherence (CSC). CSC can detect different types of nonlinear interactions including harmonic and intermodulation coupling as present in static nonlinearities and also subharmonic coupling, which only occurs with dynamic nonlinearities. Methods: We verified the performance of CSC in model simulations with both static and dynamic nonlinear systems. We applied CSC to investigate nonlinear stimulus-response interactions in the human proprioceptive system. A periodic movement perturbation was imposed to the wrist when the subjects performed an isotonic wrist flexion. CSC analysis was performed between the perturbation and brain responses (electroencephalogram, EEG). Results: Both the simulation and the application demonstrated that CSC successfully detected different types of nonlinear interactions. High-order nonlinearities were revealed in the proprioceptive system, shown in harmonic and intermodulation coupling between the perturbation and EEG for all subjects. Subharmonic coupling was found in some subjects but not all. Conclusion: This paper provides a general tool to detect and characterize nonlinear nature and dynamics of the nervous system. The application of CSC on the experimental dataset indicates a complex nonlinear dynamics in the proprioceptive system. Significance: This novel framework 1) unveils the nonlinear neural dynamics in a more complete way than the existing coherence measures, and 2) is more suitable for estimating the input-output relation regarding both phase and amplitude compared to phase synchrony measures (which only consider phase coupling). Subharmonic coupling is reported in human proprioceptive system for the first time.	[Yang, Yuan; Solis-Escalante, Teodoro; van der Helm, Frans C.

GBA defined as the gamma index (I gamma) was calculated using the basal GBA (gamma(B)) and motor GBA (gamma(MOV)) PSD values. Results: The mean values of I gamma were (I gamma(R) (right hand) = 1.30, I gamma(L), (left hand) = 1.22). Manual laterality showed a correlation with I gamma. Conclusions: I gamma may provide a useful way of indirectly assessing operation of activated motor neuronal circuits. It could be applied to diagnosis of motor area pathologies and as follow up in rehabilitation processes. Likewise, I gamma could enable the assessment of motor capacity, physical training and manual laterality in sport medicine.

What can be found in scalp EEG spectrum beyond common frequency bands. EEG-fMRI study	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						multimodal neuroimaging; brain rhythms; blind decomposition; large scale brain networks	VARIATIONAL BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; SIGNAL; BRAIN; COMPONENTS; SIGNATURES; PATTERNS; ARTIFACT; RHYTHMS; MODEL	Objective. The scalp EEG spectrum is a frequently used marker of neural activity. Commonly, the preprocessing of EEG utilizes constraints, e.g. dealing with a predefined subset of electrodes or a predefined frequency band of interest. Such treatment of the EEG spectrum neglects the fact that particular neural processes may be reflected in several frequency bands and/or several electrodes concurrently, and can overlook the complexity of the structure of the EEG spectrum. Approach. We showed that the EEG spectrum structure can be described by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), a method which blindly uncovers the spatial-temporal-spectral patterns of EEG. We used an algorithm based on variational Bayesian statistics to reveal nine patterns from the EEG of 38 healthy subjects, acquired during a semantic decision task. The patterns reflected neural activity synchronized across theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands and spread over many electrodes, as well as various EEG artifacts. Main results. Specifically, one of the patterns showed significant correlation with the stimuli timing. The correlation was higher when compared to commonly used models of neural activity (power fluctuations in distinct frequency band averaged across a subset of electrodes) and we found significantly correlated hemodynamic fluctuations in simultaneously acquired fMRI data in regions known to be involved in speech processing. Further, we show that the pattern also occurs in EEG data which were acquired outside the MR machine. Two other patterns reflected brain rhythms linked to the attentional and basal ganglia large scale networks. The other patterns were related to various EEG artifacts. Significance. These results show that PARAFAC blindly identifies neural activity in the EEG spectrum and that it naturally handles the correlations among frequency bands and electrodes. We conclude that PARAFAC seems to be a powerful tool for analysis of the EEG spectrum and might bring novel insight to the relationships between EEG activity and brain hemodynamics.

Here, we examined resting state electroencephalographic activity in 21 healthy volunteers assessed in a placebo controlled, double-blind, randomized study involving administration of either a saline infusion or a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist. Frequency specific current source density (CSD) was assessed at sensor-level and source-level using eLORETA within regions of interest of a triple network model of schizophrenia (this model posits a dysfunctional switching between large-scale Default Mode and Central Executive networks by the monitor-controlling Salience Network). These CSDs were measured in each session along with subjective symptoms as indexed with the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale. Ketamine-induced CSD reductions in slow (delta/theta and alpha) and increases in fast (gamma) frequencies at scalp electrode sites were paralleled by frequency specific CSD changes in the Default Mode, Central Executive, and Salience networks. Subjective symptoms scores were increased with ketamine and ratings of depersonalization in particular were associated with alpha CSD reductions in general and in specific regions of interest in each of the three networks. These results tentatively support the hypothesis that pathological brain oscillations associated with hypofunctional NMDA receptor activity may contribute to the emergence of the perceptual/dissociate symptoms of schizophrenia.

However, the cortical responses to tonic pain, especially tonic pain originating from deep tissue, which was proposed to better resemble the clinical pain, are not well understood. Here we aimed to investigate electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to tonic muscle pain. EEG signals and pain perceptions of three order-counterbalanced conditions: innocuous condition (A, infusion of isotonic saline), noxious conditions with low (B) and medium (C) intensities (infusion of hypertonic saline) were recorded from 43 subjects. We observed the enhancement of gamma oscillations in frontal-central region in condition C, as compared to either condition A or B. Positive relationship between the amplitude of gamma oscillations and pain intensity was also observed in frontal-central region. Therefore, we provide novel evidence for the encoding of frontal-central gamma oscillations in tonic pain processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we tested whether analyzing high frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be used to determine the ictal onset zone in suspected bitemporal epilepsy and improve seizure outcome. Methods: We prospectively studied 13 patients with refractory temporal seizures who were treated over a 4-year period and underwent bilateral placement of intracranial electrodes. Subdural strips were used in all cases, and depth electrodes were implanted into mesial temporal lobes in 10 patients. The mean patient age was 30.92 years, and 30.7% of patients were male. Patients were monitored by conventional and wide-band frequency amplifiers. Results: Conventional invasive EEG monitoring of interictal periods showed bilateral epileptiform abnormalities in 12 patients (92.3%) and unilateral epileptiform abnormalities in one (7.7%), and monitoring of ictal periods revealed unilateral seizure origins in nine patients (69.2%) and bilateral origins in four ( 30.8%). In contrast, high frequency invasive EEG monitoring of interictal periods showed bilateral HFOs in seven patients (53.8%) and unilateral HFOs in six (46.2%), and monitoring of ictal periods revealed unilateral HFOs in all 10 patients who were tested. Three patients were not monitored during ictal periods because of time limitations. All 13 patients subsequently underwent a standard unilateral temporal lobectomy and have been followed-up for a minimum of 12 months. Eleven (84%) had a Class I outcome, one (8%) a Class II outcome, and one a Class III outcome. Significance: Bilateral placement of subdural strip and depth electrodes for seizure monitoring in patients with suspected bitemporal epilepsy is both safe and effective. Monitoring high frequency oscillations can help determine the laterality of the onset zone when localization using conventional EEG or brain MRI fails. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CCA uses pure sine and cosine reference templates with frequencies corresponding to the visual stimulation frequencies. These generic reference templates may not optimally reflect the natural SSVEP features obscured by the background EEG. This paper introduces a new approach that utilizes spatio-temporal feature extraction with multivariate linear regression (MLR) to learn discriminative SSVEP features for improving the detection accuracy. MLR is implemented on dimensionality-reduced EEG training data and a constructed label matrix to find optimally discriminative subspaces. Experimental results show that the proposed MLR method significantly outperforms CCA as well as several other competing methods for SSVEP detection, especially for time windows shorter than 1 second. This demonstrates that the MLR method is a promising new approach for achieving improved real-time performance of SSVEP-BCIs.

Reference-free removal of EEG-fMRI ballistocardiogram artifacts with harmonic regression	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; Ballistocardiogram; Pulse artifact; Artifact removal; Regression; Functional neuroimaging	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PULSE ARTIFACT; RECORDINGS; SCANNER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ACQUISITION; REDUCTION; SUBTRACTION; POTENTIALS	Combining electroencephalogram(EEG) recording and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers the potential for imaging brain activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. This potential remains limited by the significant ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts induced in the EEG by cardiac pulsation-related head movement within the magnetic field. We model the BCG artifact using a harmonic basis, pose the artifact removal problem as a local harmonic regression analysis, and develop an efficient maximum likelihood algorithm to estimate and remove BCG artifacts. Our analysis paradigm accounts for time-frequency overlap between the BCG artifacts and neurophysiologic EEG signals, and tracks the spatiotemporal variations in both the artifact and the signal. We evaluate performance on: simulated oscillatory and evoked responses constructed with realistic artifacts; actual anesthesia-induced oscillatory recordings; and actual visual evoked potential recordings. In each case, the local harmonic regression analysis effectively removes the BCG artifacts, and recovers the neurophysiologic EEG signals. We further show that our algorithm outperforms commonly used reference-based and component analysis techniques, particularly in low SNR conditions, the presence of significant time-frequency overlap between the artifact and the signal, and/or large spatiotemporal variations in the BCG. Because our algorithm does not require reference signals and has low computational complexity, it offers a practical tool for removing BCG artifacts from EEG data recorded in combination with fMRI.

This visual inspection by a human expert has two main drawbacks: it is very time consuming add subjective. New method: To detect artifacts and arousals in a reliable, systematic and reproducible automatic way, we developed an automatic detection based on time and frequency analysis with adapted thresholds derived from data themselves. Results: The automatic detection performance is assessed using 5 statistic parameters, on 60 whole night sleep recordings coming from 35 healthy volunteers (male and female) aged between 19 and 26. The proposed approach proves its robustness against inter- and intra-, subjects and raters' scorings, variability. The agreement with human raters is rated overall from substantial to excellent and provides a significantly more reliable method than between human raters. Comparison: Existing methods detect only specific artifacts or only arousals, and/or these methods are validated on short episodes of sleep recordings, making it difficult to compare with our whole night results. Conclusion: The method works on a whole night recording and is fully automatic, reproducible, and reliable. Furthermore the implementation of the method will be made available online as open source code. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our hypothesis was that longer tPCS duration would induce a differential effect on the EEG analysis and a longer duration of after effects on the EEG frequency bands. Materials and Methods: We conducted a double blind, sham controlled study in which forty healthy subjects were randomized to receive a single session of either 10, 20, 30 min of active (2 mA, random frequency between 6 and 10 Hz, ear clip montage) or sham tPCS. EEG was recorded before and after the intervention to assess tPCS induced after effects. Results: We found that 10 and 20 min of active tPCS induced a significant increase in alpha (p = 0.004) and theta (p = 0.006) coherence in the frontal region as compared with the sham stimulation. No significant changes were found with 30 min of stimulation (p < 0.05). The Kaplan Meier analysis showed that 10 and 20 min of tPCS induced after effects that lasted 50 min. Conclusions: These results evidence the nonlinear relationship between the stimulation duration and the tPCS after effects, suggesting the presence of homeostatic mechanisms.

We explore a complementary "complexity domain" approach based on multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis of EEG signals and discuss its relationships to standard sleep analysis and to that based on electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC). We observe a progressive decrease in complexity associated with decreased arousability, as measured by both conventional sleep scoring and CPC analysis. Furthermore, complexity analysis supports the contention that stage 2 non-REM sleep has distinct sub-phases that map to CPC high-and low-frequency coupled dynamics.

Previous reports from our lab have shown that those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have decreased activity and/or coherence in delta, theta, alpha and beta cognitive responses. In the current study, we investigated gamma responses in visual SEO and ERO in 15 patients with AD and in 15 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls. The following parameters were analyzed over the parietal-occipital regions in both groups: (i) latency of the maximum gamma response over a 0800 ms time window; (ii) the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each participant's averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses in 3 frequency ranges (25-30, 30-35, 40-48 Hz); and (iii) the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each participant's averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses over a 0-800 ms time block containing four divided time windows (0-200, 200-400, 400-600, and 600-800 ms). There were main group effects in terms of both latency and peak-to-peak amplitudes of gamma ERO. However, peak-to-peak gamma ERO amplitude differences became noticeable only when the time block was divided into four time windows. SEO amplitudes in the 25-30 Hz frequency range of the 0-200 ms time window over the left hemisphere were greater in the healthy controls than in those with AD. Gamma target ERO latency was delayed up to 138 ms in AD patients when compared to healthy controls. This finding may be an effect of lagged neural signaling in cognitive circuits, which is reflected by the delayed gamma responses in those with AD. Based on the results of this study, we propose that gamma responses should be examined in a more detailed fashion using multiple frequency and time windows. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We investigated whether ripples (80-250 Hz), superimposed on rolandic spikes in surface electroencephalography (EEG), can differentiate between different entities. MethodsIn this cohort study we analyzed the EEG studies of children with rolandic spikes without other EEG or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities. They were divided into the following three groups: (1) rolandic spikes but no epilepsy, (2) typical rolandic epilepsy, and (3) atypical and symptomatic rolandic epilepsy. Ripples superimposed on rolandic spikes were marked in 10 minutes of EEG, and compared to the number of seizures before the EEG. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the predictive value of ripples and spikes for having epilepsy (groups 2 and 3) and for differentiating benign courses (groups 1 or 2) from atypical and symptomatic epilepsy (group 3). Ripples were also marked in the time frequency spectrum of averaged rolandic spikes. ResultsRipples were found in 13 of 22 children. Children without epilepsy showed no ripples, except for a single child with only one ripple. The number of ripples showed a significant positive correlation with the number of seizures ( = 0.70, p = 0.001), whereas spikes had a borderline significant correlation ( = 0.43, p = 0.05). Presence of more than two ripples was a predictor for having seizures (area under the curve [AUC] 0.84), whereas spikes could not predict having seizures (AUC 0.53). More than five ripples predicted the difference between benign courses and atypical and symptomatic epilepsy (AUC 0.91, sensitivity 63%, specificity 100%). Ripples in the time frequency spectra appeared in all children and were not related to seizures. SignificanceAbsence of ripples on top of rolandic spikes predicts a relative benign clinical entity, whereas in the presence of several ripples, the child is likely to have more seizures than classical rolandic epilepsy, and pharmacologic treatment might be needed.

The aim of this study was to assess electro-clinical characteristics of seizures occurring before a corrected age of 40 weeks in neonates born prematurely. Method: Retrospective analysis of EEG-documented seizures in neonates born prematurely. Seizures in a group of term neonates served as controls. Results: Fifty-six prematurely born and 46 term born neonates were included. Median duration of seizures was 52 s in preterm and 96 s in term neonates. Seizures were focal or multifocal. In least mature neonates, they involved smaller regions of onset and remained localised. With increasing corrected age, propagation became more frequent. The electrographic pattern - maximal frequency of oscillation and the onset pattern also evolved with age. Electro-clinical seizures were observed in 25% of preterm versus 50% of term neonates; almost all electro-clinical seizures involved the central (motor) regions. Conclusion: Ictal EEG features undergo changes depending on corrected age. Most seizures are subclinical, thus EEG is essential for diagnosis. Significance: Relating ictal EEG pattern to corrected age can improve diagnosis and ultimately management. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Electroencephalography (EEG) represents an effective tool to allow the implementation of a BCI. The present paper describes a modular framework for the implementation of the graphic interface for binary BCIs based on the selection of symbols in a table. The proposed system is also designed to reduce the time required for writing text. This is made by including a motivational tool, necessary to improve the quality of the collected signals, and by containing a predictive module based on the frequency of occurrence of letters in a language, and of words in a dictionary. The proposed framework is described in a top-down approach through its modules: signal acquisition, analysis, classification, communication, visualization, and predictive engine. The framework, being modular, can be easily modified to personalize the graphic interface to the needs of the subject who has to use the BCI and it can be integrated with different classification strategies, communication paradigms, and dictionaries/languages. The implementation of a scenario and some experimental results on healthy subjects are also reported and discussed: the modules of the proposed scenario can be used as a starting point for further developments, and application on severely disabled people under the guide of specialized personnel.

This article describes the development of an adaptive game system that is designed to maximize player engagement by utilizing changes in real-time electroencephalography (EEG) to adjust the level of game demand. The research consists of four main stages: (1) the development of a conceptual framework upon which to model the interaction between person and system; (2) the validation of the psychophysiological inference underpinning the loop; (3) the construction of a working prototype; and (4) an evaluation of the adaptive game. Two studies are reported. The first demonstrates the sensitivity of EEG power in the (frontal) theta and (parietal) alpha bands to changing levels of game demand. These variables were then reformulated within the working biocybernetic control loop designed to maximize player engagement. The second study evaluated the performance of an adaptive game of Tetris with respect to system behavior and user experience. Important issues for the design and evaluation of closed-loop interfaces are discussed.

Methods: 27 participants, age 18-30, wore a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) and underwent in-laboratory overnight polysomnography (PSG). Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) metrics were determined from the PSG and included Delta, Theta, Alpha, Sigma, Beta and Gamma Band power at 5-min intervals. Wavelet Coherence Analysis was employed to determine the time varying and frequency specific coupling between glucose and EEG Band power. ANOVA was used to compare differences across fluctuation speeds and EEG bands. Results: There was a high degree of time varying and frequency specific coupling between glucose variations and EEG power in all EEG Bands during sleep. The average number of intervals of statistically significant coherence was highest for fluctuations periods between 10 and 30 min in all Bands (p < 0.0001 for each). Mean significant coherence was negatively correlated with hemoglobin A1c, a marker of glycemic control. Conclusions: The relationship between glucose and EEG power during sleep is time varying and frequency dependent in young adults with T1DM. Significance: Understanding the time varying mutual relationship between glucose changes and brain activity during sleep may have implications for disease management in T1DM.

Prefrontal cortex is the prominent cortical structure to which the MDT is connected. Measuring stress, attention and drowsiness levels and developing proper courses of action to improve the performance and productivity is greatly facilitated by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG). Reading is one of the principal information acquisition methods for human brain. Cortical mapping plays a very important role in strengthening the memory circuit connections in the brain. While reading, if words are capable of evoking corresponding visuals, it will cause to the creation of long term memory. This is how mnemonics work excellently in enriching one's vocabulary. High Alpha and Beta band powers of EEG signals are responsible for scaling up relaxation and attention levels of an individual respectively. In this paper major focus is placed on how an olfactory stimulus alters the strength of beta band oscillations of the prefrontal cortex. Along with that we discuss the way fragrance nature of environment, incense burning and synthetic perfume, affects the relaxation levels (Alpha band power) and the attention levels (Beta band power) of a subject by collecting EEG signals from primary visual cortex during a reading task of four minutes. Alpha and Beta band powers are drastically low in case of synthetic perfume fragrance compared to incense burning ambience.

Methods: Data for 13 epilepsy patients who showed an ictal event during MEG were analyzed. Several seconds of preictal data were localized in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands by using wavelet transformation and the sLORETA algorithm. The same analysis was performed with narrow time and frequency band. Localization concordances to the surgically resected area were compared. Results: Source localization in the gamma band for a 10 s window before ictal onset showed best concordance to the resection cavity. Eight of 13 patients showed sub-lobar concordance in the 10 s gamma band localization, whereas 3 showed concordance in the narrow time and frequency analysis. Four of 7 patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) achieved seizure-free outcome, and all 4 showed sub-lobar concordance. Conclusions: A 10 s time window gamma source localization method can be used to delineate the epileptogenic zone.

Coincident with these technological advances, there is an increased expectation to treat drug resistant epilepsy in dogs and cats by epilepsy surgery. However, the presurgical evaluation of epileptic animals, by using methodologies to detect the epileptogenic zone for example, have yet to become established in common practice. The epileptogenic zone, defined as the minimum amount of cortex to produce seizure freedom, consists of five conceptual cortical abnormal 'zones': symptomatogenic, irritative, seizure-onset, structurally abnormal (epileptogenic lesion) and functional deficit. These zones can now be detected by suitable modalities including ictal video monitoring, interictal non-invasive or invasive electroencephalography (EEG), ictal video-EEG, magnetoencephalography, structural and functional MRIs, or nuclear imaging. These diagnostic techniques are essential for selecting both appropriate patients and surgical techniques, and are also important in understanding the pathophysiology of epilepsy. This review describes the diagnostic techniques available for detecting each abnormal zone while considering the current veterinary status to realise future surgery for canine and feline epilepsy.

The thalamocortical circuit consists of reciprocal connections between the thalamus and cortex. The cortex sends strong excitatory feedback to the thalamus, however the function of which is unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of the thalamic metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1)-phospholipase C beta 4 (PLC beta 4) pathway in sleep control in PLC beta 4-deficient (PLC beta 4(-/-)) mice. The thalamic mGluR1-PLC beta 4 pathway contains synapses that receive corticothalamic inputs. In PLC beta 4(-/-) mice, the transition from wakefulness to the NREM sleep state was stimulated, and the NREM sleep state was stabilized, which resulted in increased NREM sleep. The power density of delta (d) waves increased in parallel with the increased NREM sleep. These sleep phenotypes in PLC beta 4(-/-) mice were consistent in TC-restricted PLC beta 4 knockdown mice. Moreover, in vitro intrathalamic oscillations were greatly enhanced in the PLC beta 4(-/-) slices. The results of our study showed that thalamic mGluR1-PLC beta 4 pathway was critical in controlling sleep architecture.

SSVEP is to stimulate the EEG signal to locate the desired goal of the experiment when a visual stimulus flickering with different constant frequencies and same duration. We aim to present a case study of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal by analyzing the frequency response of the red and green light. The stimulation is based on SSVEP by dividing the trial into two trials: single light and two lights. We considered three parameters that are light color, frequency and epoch interval. The optimal experimental results showed the classification accuracy rate of 74% and 75% for single and two color lights, respectively. The results can be considerably applied to the brain-computer interface (BCI) system.

To evaluate this method as a promising way to explore the neural mechanisms in ADHD, we calculated the MSE in EEG activity during the designed task. EEG data were collected from 13 outpatient boys with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD and 13 age- and gender matched normal control children during their doing multi-source interference task (MSIT). We estimated the MSE by calculating the sample entropy values of delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands over twenty time scales using coarse-grained procedure. The results showed increased complexity of EEG data in delta and theta frequency bands and decreased complexity in alpha frequency bands in ADHD children. The findings of this study revealed aberrant neural connectivity of kids with ADHD during interference task. The results showed that MSE method may be a new index to identify and understand the neural mechanism of ADHD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The role of alpha oscillations in deriving and maintaining spatial relations in working memory	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Abstract; EEG; Relational; Phase synchrony; Working memory	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG-ALPHA; PHASE SYNCHRONY; SINGLE NEURONS; NEURAL SYSTEM; BAND; ATTENTION; MAINTENANCE	Previous research has demonstrated distinct neural correlates for maintenance of abstract, relational versus concrete, sensory information in working memory (WM). Storage of spatial relations in WM results in suppression of posterior sensory regions, which suggests that sensory information is task-irrelevant when relational representations are maintained in WM. However, the neural mechanisms by which abstract representations are derived from sensory information remain unclear. Here, using electroencephalography, we investigated the role of alpha oscillations in deriving spatial relations from a sensory stimulus and maintaining them in WM. Participants encoded two locations into WM, then after an initial maintenance period, a cue indicated whether to convert the spatial information to another sensory representation or to a relational representation. Results revealed that alpha power increased over posterior electrodes when sensory information was converted to a relational representation, but not when the information was converted to another sensory representation. Further, alpha phase synchrony between posterior and frontal regions increased for relational compared to sensory trials during the maintenance period. These results demonstrate that maintaining spatial relations and locations in WM rely on distinct neural oscillatory patterns.

AUTOMATIC EEG EYE MOVEMENT ARTIFACTS REMOVAL USING INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS	VISNYK NTUU KPI SERIIA-RADIOTEKHNIKA RADIOAPARATOBUDUVANNIA			Ukrainian	Article						EEG; EOG; EEG artifacts removal; ICA	IDENTIFICATION; ICA	Background. Eye movement artifacts contained in EEG recordings hamper a lot the automatic processing and analysis of EEG signal. Therefore, the removal of such artifacts is important stage for any further signal processing. There are artifacts removal methods based on using wavelet transformation, regression analysis in the time and frequency domain, Principal component analysis and Independent component analysis. Methods. The novel method of automatic EEG eye movement artifacts removal based on Independent Component Analysis was proposed. The method utilizes the TDSEP algorithm for blind source separation. Own criteria for artifact components detection were used. The method was implemented with the Python programming language and tested on EEG signals recorded from two healthy volunteers. Results. Comparison of the effectiveness of the method was conducted with the participation of two experts. They were asked to review the EEG fragments before and after artifacts removal and evaluate the quality of artifacts removal. The average value of assessing the quality of artifacts removal was 4.83 for TDSEP based algorithm and 4.58 for FastICA based algorithm. Conclusion. The proposed method is more effective then method based on FastICA algorithm and using it for automatic EEG eye movement artifacts removal is expedient.	[Kytsun, P.

Since more than 70% of all accidents are related to human activities, detecting and mitigating human-related risks hold the key to improving the safety conditions within the construction industry. Previous research has revealed that the psychological and emotional conditions of workers can contribute to fatalities and injuries. Recent observations in the area of neural science and psychology suggest that inattentional blindness is one major cause of unexpected human related accidents. Due to the limitation of human mental workload, laborers are vulnerable to unexpected hazards while focusing on complicated construction tasks. Therefore, the ability to detect the mental conditions of workers could reduce unexpected injuries. However, there are currently no available measurement approaches or devices capable of monitoring construction workers' mental conditions. The research proposed in this paper aims to develop a measurement approach to evaluate hazards through neural time-frequency analysis. The experimental results show that neural signals are valid for mental load assessment of construction workers, especially the low frequency bands signals. The research also describes the development of a prototype for a wearable electro-encephalography (EEG) safety helmet that enables the collection of the neural information required as input for the measurement approach.

Estimating human emotions through Electroencephalogram (EEG) has become one of the challenging area today. The representation of electrical activity of human brain is an important feature of EEG signal. The emotion detection using EEG signal follows the steps of emotion elicitation stimuli, i.e, collection or creation of the database, pre-processing, feature extraction, feature reduction or selection and classification. The combination of Adaptive Filter (Finite Impulse Response, FIR), Time-Frequency Analysis (Daubechies Wavelet Transform) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier are used to detect the discrete emotions (happy, angry, sad and cry) of a human being using EEG signal.

The current article presents evidence suggesting that one of the mechanisms whereby cannabinoids induce psychosis is through the alteration in synchronized neural oscillations. Neural oscillations, particularly in the gamma (30-80 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) ranges, are disrupted in schizophrenia and are involved in various areas of perceptual and cognitive function. Regarding cannabinoids, preclinical evidence from slice and local field potential recordings has shown that central cannabinoid receptor (cannabinoid receptor type 1) agonists decrease the power of neural oscillations, particularly in the gamma and theta bands. Further, the administration of cannabinoids during critical stages of neural development has been shown to disrupt the brain's ability to generate synchronized neural oscillations in adulthood. In humans, studies examining the effects of chronic cannabis use (utilizing electroencephalography) have shown abnormalities in neural oscillations in a pattern similar to those observed in schizophrenia. Finally, recent studies in humans have also shown disruptions in neural oscillations after the acute administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary psychoactive constituent in cannabis. Taken together, these data suggest that both acute and chronic cannabinoids can disrupt the ability of the brain to generate synchronized oscillations at functionally relevant frequencies. Hence, this may represent one of the primary mechanisms whereby cannabinoids induce disruptions in attention, working memory, sensory-motor integration, and many other psychosis-related behavioral effects.

But the occurrence of mental load and fatigue when users stare at flickering stimuli is a critical problem in implementation of SSVEP-based BCIs. Based on electroencephalography (EEG) power indices a, theta, theta + a, ratio index theta/a and response properties of amplitude and SNR, this study quantitatively evaluated the mental load and fatigue in both of conventional flickering and the novel motion-reversal visual attention tasks. Results over nine subjects revealed significant mental load alleviation in motion-reversal task rather than flickering task. The interaction between factors of "stimulation type" and "fatigue level" also illustrated the motion-reversal stimulation as a superior anti-fatigue solution for long-term BCI operation. Taken together, our work provided an objective method favorable for the design of more practically applicable steady-state evoked potential based BCIs.

Our proposal uses delta, theta, alfa and beta rhythms to BCI system. From the spectral power, an efficient combination of ERD/ERS/laterality features was used. Because electroencephalogram signals are non-stationary type and highly vary over time and frequency, a detailed time-frequency analysis is applied. Features coming from time-frequency analysis, where eight frequency bands ranging from 0 to 32 Hz were chosen. Features vectors are classified by Gaussian classifier and the final performance is evaluated in cross-validation scheme. This novel approach was tested using the BCI competition IV data set 1. The detection of the left and right hand motor imagery task was very good, with a result of 96.4% using BCI-Competition -IV. When comparing results from others competing methods reported in the literature, our approach resulted the best and useful to create a self-paced BCI-system.

Recent findings suggest that the adult motor system is also involved in detecting others' rule violations. Yet, how this translates to everyday action errors (e.g., accidentally dropping something) and how error-sensitive motor activity for others' actions emerges are still unknown. In this study, we examined the role of the motor system in error monitoring. Participants observed successful and unsuccessful pincer grasp actions while their electroencephalography was registered. We tested infants (8- and 14-month-olds) at different stages of learning the pincer grasp and adults as advanced graspers. Power in Alpha- and Beta-frequencies was analysed to assess motor and visual processing. Adults showed enhanced motor activity when observing erroneous actions. However, neither 8- nor 14-month-olds displayed this error sensitivity, despite showing motor activity for both actions. All groups did show similar visual activity, that is more Alpha-suppression, when observing correct actions. Thus, while correct and erroneous actions were processed as visually distinct in all age groups, only the adults' motor system was sensitive to action correctness. Functionality of different brain oscillations in the development of error monitoring and mirroring is discussed.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of VNS on hippocampal field activity and compared the efficiency of different VNS paradigms. Hippocampal electroencephalography (EEG) and perforant path dentate field-evoked potentials were acquired before and during VNS in freely moving rats, using 2 VNS duty cycles: a rapid cycle (7 s on, 18 s off) and standard cycle (30 s on, 300 s off) and various output currents. VNS modulated the evoked potentials, reduced total power of the hippocampal EEG, and slowed the theta rhythm. In the hippocampal EEG, theta (4-8 Hz) and high gamma (75-150 Hz) activity displayed strong phase amplitude coupling that was reduced by VNS. Rapid-cycle VNS had a greater effect than standard-cycle VNS on all outcome measures. Using rapid cycle VNS, a maximal effect on EEG parameters was found at 300 mu A, beyond which effects saturated. The findings suggest that rapid-cycle VNS produces a more robust outcome than standard cycle VNS and support already existing preclinical evidence that relatively low output currents are sufficient to produce changes in brain physiology and thus likely also therapeutic efficacy.

Task-positive and task-negative networks and their relation to depression: EEG beamformer analysis	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Depression; EEG; Resting-state networks; Default mode network; Beamformer; Functional connectivity	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; HUMAN BRAIN; MEG; CORTEX; FREQUENCY	Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been associated with predominance of the default-mode network (DMN) over the task-positive network (TPN), which is considered a neurobiological base for ruminative responding. It is not known whether this predominance is a signature of the full-blown MDD or it already exists at preclinical stages. Besides, all relevant evidence has been obtained using fMRI, which allows for a precise spatial characterization of resting state networks (RSNs), but their neural correlates remain elusive. Here we show that after leakage correction of beamformer-projected resting EEG time series, seed-based oscillatory-power envelope correlation analysis allows revealing RSNs with significant similarity to respective fMRI RSNs. In a non-clinical sample, depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, are associated with predominance of DMN over TPN connectivity in the right insula and the right temporal lobe in the delta frequency band. These findings imply that in individuals with heightened level of depressive symptoms, emotional circuits are stronger connected with DMN than TPN and should be more easily engaged in self-referential rumination than in responding to environmental challenges. The study's findings are in agreement with fMRI evidence, thus confirming the neural base of the observed in fMRI research effects and showing that implicated in depression neural mechanism may already be in action even at preclinical stages.

J	Wei, ZH; Wei, QG				Wei, Zhonghai; Wei, Qingguo			The backtracking search optimization algorithm for frequency band and time segment selection in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; common spatial pattern; frequency band selection; time segment selection; EEG	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SPATIAL FILTERS; PARTICLE SWARM; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS; EXISTENCE; PATTERNS; RHYTHMS; CORTEX	Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a powerful algorithm for extracting discriminative brain patterns in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, its performance depends largely on the subject-specific frequency band and time segment. Accurate selection of most responsive frequency band and time segment remains a crucial problem. A novel evolutionary algorithm, the backtracking search optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal frequency band and the optimal combination of frequency band and time segment. The former is searched by a frequency window with changing width of which starting and ending points are selected by the backtracking optimization algorithm; the latter is searched by the same frequency window and an additional time window with fixed width. The three parameters, the starting and ending points of frequency window and the starting point of time window, are jointly optimized by the backtracking search optimization algorithm. Based on the chosen frequency band and fixed or chosen time segment, the same feature extraction is conducted by CSP and subsequent classification is carried out by Fisher discriminant analysis. The classification error rate is used as the objective function of the backtracking search optimization algorithm. The two methods, named BSA-F CSP and BSA-FT CSP, were evaluated on data set of BCI competition and compared with traditional wideband (8-30 Hz) CSP. The classification results showed that backtracking search optimization algorithm can find much effective frequency band for EEG preprocessing compared to traditional broadband, substantially enhancing CSP performance in terms of classification accuracy. On the other hand, the backtracking search optimization algorithm for joint selection of frequency band and time segment can find their optimal combination, and thus can further improve classification rates.

Predicting Brain Stimulation Treatment Outcomes of Depressed Patients Through the Classification of EEG Oscillations	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			NETWORK	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder that is characterized by negative thoughts, mood and behavior. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently emerged as a promising brain-stimulation treatment for MDD. A standard tDCS treatment involves numerous sessions that run over a few weeks, however, not all participants respond to this type of treatment. This study aims to predict which patients improve in mood and cognition in response to tDCS treatment by analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) of MDD patients that was collected at the start of tDCS treatment. This is achieved through classifying power spectral density (PSD) of resting-state EEG using support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminate analysis (LDA) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Participants were labelled as improved/not improved based on the change in mood and cognitive scores. The obtained classification results of all channel pair combinations are used to identify the most relevant brain regions and channels for this classification task. We found the frontal channels to be particularly informative for the prediction of the clinical outcome of the tDCS treatment. Subject independent results reveal that our proposed method enables the correct identification of the treatment outcome for seven of the ten participants for mood improvement and nine of ten participants for cognitive improvement. This represents an encouraging sign that EEG-based classification may help to tailor the selection of patients for treatment with tDCS brain stimulation.

We included 10 patients undergoing combined surface-intracranial EEG with >= 10 spikes in the surface EEG during the first 30 consecutive minutes of N3 sleep. FRs (>= 4 consecutive oscillations above 250 Hz with an amplitude clearly exceeding that of the background) on the surface EEG (F3-C3, C3-P3, Fz-Cz, Cz-Pz, F4-C4, C4-P4) were visually marked, and verified by two EEG experts. FRs were categorized as related to the SOZ, if localized in the brain lobe of the SOZ. Low-amplitude FRs with a rate of 0.09/min were found in 6/10 patients: two exhibited events related to the SOZ, three showed no relationship with the SOZ, and in one patient the SOZ was not identified. It may be possible to detect FRs with surface EEG using subdermal electrodes in patients with focal epilepsy. The relationship between surface FRs and the SOZ remains unclear. Future studies aiming at a higher spatial EEG coverage are needed to elucidate their significance.

In progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) polygraphy with simultaneous EMG-EEG recordings is a crucial tool for defining the characteristic of myoclonic jerks their topography over different muscles (namely antagonists), their time course and relationship with vigilance muscle activation and stimulations. Moreover on polygraphic recordings it is possible to detect EEG activities associated to myoclonic jerks and define their time relationship with myoclonus thus differentiating cortical types of myoclonus from subcorticallly generated ones. Tanks to the back averaging technique non obvious time-locked EEG potentials can be detected on polygraphy, furthermore in stimulus sensitive myoclonus the analysis can include the potential evoked by the somatosensory stimulus (SEP). The polygraphic recording also gives information on muscle activity suppression occurring after jerk or as pure negative myoclonus. Besides the time domain analysis, techniques based on frequency analysis have been developed to evaluate EEG-EMG coherence. The neurophysiological techniques provide investigators and clinicians with an invaluable information to define the type of myoclonus and its generating circuitry thus substantially contributing in the diagnosis and management of PMEs.

Distinction in EEG slow oscillations between chronic mild traumatic brain injury and PTSD	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Mild traumatic brain injury; PTSD; Electroencephalography; Resting state	RESTING STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BARRIER DISRUPTION; ATTENTION; CORRELATE; PREDICTION; DISORDERS; DYNAMICS; AROUSAL	Spectral information from resting state EEG is altered in acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and in disorders of consciousness, but there is disagreement about whether mTBI can elicit long term changes in the spectral profile. Even when identified, any long-term changes attributed to TBI can be confounded by psychiatric comorbidities such as PTSD, particularly for combat -related mTBI where postdeployment distress is commonplace. To address this question, we measured spectral power during the resting state in a large sample of service members and Veterans varying in mTBI history and active PTSD diagnosis but matched for having had combat blast exposure. We found that PTSD was associated with decreases in low frequency power, especially in the right temporoparietal region, while conversely, blast -related mTBI was associated with increases in low frequency power, especially in prefrontal and right temporal areas. Results support the idea that long-term neurophysiological effects of mTBI share some features with states of reduced arousal and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting a role for EEG in tracking the trajectory of recovery and persisting vulnerabilities to injury. Additionally, results suggest that EEG power reflects distinct pathophysiologies for current PTSD and chronic mTBI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We set the synthesis part as a parameter-tuning problem and obtain synthetic EEG-like data that visually resembles brain activity in the time and frequency domains. For the analysis counterpart, we use sparse approximation to decompose the signal in relevant events via Matching Pursuit. We improve this algorithm by incorporating the Gini Index as a stopping criteria; in this way, we promote sparse sources while, at the same time, eliminating one of the free parameters of Matching Pursuit. Results are presented using synthetic EEG and BCI competition data. Statistics of the model parameters are more informative and posses finer temporal resolution than classical methods such as Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation.

A detailed review of available cortical oscillation studies in ASD does not convey a clear-cut picture with respect to dysfunctional oscillation patterns in the gamma or other frequency ranges. Recent evidence suggests that instead of a general failure to activate or synchronize the cortex, there is greater intra-participant variability across behavioral, fMRI and EEG responses in ASD. Intra-individual fluctuations from one trial to another have been largely ignored in task-related neural oscillation studies of ASD, which instead have focused on mean changes in power. We highlight new avenues for the analysis of cortical oscillation patterns in ASD which are sensitive to trial-to-trial variability within the participant, in order to validate the significance of increased response variability as possible endophenotype of the disorder.

Comparative Study of Wavelet-Based Unsupervised Ocular Artifact Removal Techniques for Single-Channel EEG Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Artifact removal; electroencephalogram (EEG); ocular artifact; wavelet transform; single channel EEG	TRANSFORM; SUPPRESSION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a technique for recording the asynchronous activation of neuronal firing inside the brain with non-invasive scalp electrodes. Artifacts, such as eye blink activities, can corrupt these neuronal signals. While ocular artifact (OA) removal is well investigated for multiple channel EEG systems, in alignment with the recent momentum toward minimalistic EEG systems for use in natural environments, we investigate unsupervised and effective removal of OA from single-channel streaming raw EEG data. In this paper, the unsupervised wavelet transform (WT) decomposition technique was systematically evaluated for the effectiveness of OA removal for a single-channel EEG system. A set of seven raw EEG data set was analyzed. Two commonly used WT methods, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), were applied. Four WT basis functions, namely, haar, coif3, sym3, and bior4.4, were considered for OA removal with universal threshold and statistical threshold (ST). To quantify OA removal efficacy from single-channel EEG, five performance metrics were utilized: correlation coefficients, mutual information, signal-to-artifact ratio, normalized mean square error, and time frequency analysis. The temporal and spectral analysis shows that the optimal combination could be DWT with ST with coif3 or bior4.4 to remove OA among 16 combinations. This paper demonstrates that the WT can be an effective tool for unsupervised OA removal from single-channel EEG data for real-time applications.

In this paper, basing on the characteristic features of wavelet sub-band energy coefficient, an ideal approach has been implemented for ECG and EEG classification. The ECG and EEG signals are pre-processed using adaptive filter and further are decomposed into time-frequency representation by the use of wavelet transformation. These extracted wavelet coefficients are helpful in calculating certain statistical parameters. For the differentiation between normal and abnormal beats, the types of EEG and ECG beats are taken into consideration. For this classification, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used. The real time signals are obtained from medical and diagnostic centers for the analysis purposes.

Quantitative Electroencephalographic Analysis Provides an Early-Stage Indicator of Disease Onset and Progression in the zQ175 Knock-In Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease	SLEEP			English	Article						biomarker; EEG; Huntington's disease; sleep; zQ175 mouse	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; MUTANT HUNTINGTIN; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; TRACK-HD; SLEEP; PREMANIFEST; EXPRESSION; DEFICITS; BRAIN; ACTIVATION	Study Objectives: Patients with Huntington's disease (HD) show a high prevalence of sleep disorders that typically occur prior to the onset of motoric symptoms and neurodegeneration. Our understanding of the pathophysiological alterations in premanifest HD is limited, hindering the ability to measure disease modification in response to treatment. We used a full-length knock-in HD model to determine early changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and sleep that may predict the onset and progression of the disease. Methods: A 10-month longitudinal study was designed to determine the effect of the HD mutation on the EEG and sleep/wake changes in heterozygous (HET) and homozygous (HOM) zQ175 mice and wild-type (WT) littermates from 8 to 48 w of age. Mice were instrumented with tethered headmounts to record EEG/electromyography signals. Telemeters were implanted to continuously measure locomotor activity (LMA) and body temperature (T-b). Sleep deprivation (SDep) was performed at 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 48 w of age. Results: The HD mutation disrupted the EEG field potential from 8-12 w in an age-and mutant huntington dose-dependent manner, prior to changes in sleep/wake states, LMA, and Tb. Prominent effects of the HD mutation on the EEG included a progressive reduction in low frequency power, a slowing of rapid eye movement peak theta frequency, and the emergence of state-dependent beta/gamma oscillations. There was no effect of genotype on the relative increase in nonrapid eye movement delta power or sleep time in response to SDep. Conclusions: The expression of the Huntington's disease (HD) mutation results in complex EEG alterations that occur prior to deficits in behavioral measures and are one of the earliest phenotypes uncovered in this mouse model. Despite these EEG changes, homeostatic responses to sleep loss were preserved in HET and HOM zQ175 mice. Greater insight into the localization and response of these EEG alterations to novel therapies may enable early intervention and improve outcomes for patients with HD.

Methods: The posterior alpha activity (8-12 Hz) was measured in 30 typically developing children and 30 children with ADHD aged 7-10 years, using EEG while they performed a visuospatial covert attention task. We focused the analyses on typically developing boys (N = 9) and boys with ADHD (N = 17). Results: Alpha activity in typically developing boys was similar to previous results of healthy adults: it decreased in the hemisphere contralateral to the attended hemifield, whereas it relatively increased in the other hemisphere. However, in boys with ADHD this hemispheric lateralization in the alpha band was not obvious (group contrast, p =.018). A robust relation with behavioral performance was lacking in both groups. Conclusions: The ability to modulate alpha oscillations in visual regions with the allocation of spatial attention was clearly present in typically developing boys, but not in boys with ADHD. Significance: These results open up the possibility to further study the underlying mechanisms of ADHD by examining how differences in the fronto-striatal network might explain different abilities in modulating the alpha band activity.

Long-latency components of somatosensory evoked potentials during passive tactile perception of gratings	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			TOUCH; MODULATION	Perception of tactile stimuli elicits Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) that can be recorded via non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). However, it is not yet clear how SEPs localization, shape and latency are modulated by different stimuli during mechanical tactile stimulation of fingertips. The aim of this work is thus to characterize SEPs generated by the tactile perception of gratings during dynamic passive stimulation of the dominant fingertip by means of a mechatronic platform. Results show that a random sequence of stimuli elicited SEPs with two long-latency components: (i) a negative deflection around 140 ms located in the frontal-central-parietal side in the contralateral hemisphere; (ii) a positive deflection around 250 ms located in the frontal-central midline. Time-frequency analysis revealed significant continuous bilateral desynchronization in the alpha band throughout the passive stimulation. These results are a fundamental step towards building a model of brain responses during perception of tactile stimuli for future benchmarking studies.

NGE profiles showed a statistically significant progressive decrease of NGE values at epileptogenic focus-related channels as time for seizures occurrence approached. This result implies the progressive appearance of dominant Gabor atoms in the EEG tens of minutes prior to seizures, the detection and monitoring of which could further assist with improvement of the performance of seizure prediction algorithms.

However, these representations are computed with only one wavelet family and thus might not be able to match exactly with different features of various frequency bands. We thus introduce the Multi-family Discrete Wavelet Transform, a computationally tractable adaptive wavelet transform leading to sparse optimized representations which will select the optimal wavelet family at each frequency band. The approach is an optimized Discrete Wavelet Transform where at each level of the decomposition the best wavelet basis is selected as well as the optimum depth by means of information theory tools. This development is motivated by the need to have an unsupervised sparse representation of a priori unknown signals. Our representation is finally applied on intracranial EEG (iEEG) data in order to show its efficacy.

The sensitivity and significance of lateralized interictal slow activity on magnetoencephalography in focal epilepsy	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; Epileptogenic zone; MEG; Magnetic source imaging; Slowing	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; DELTA ACTIVITY; WAVE ACTIVITY; EEG-FMRI; LOCALIZATION; NETWORK; CONSCIOUSNESS; SEIZURES; SURGERY; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Asymmetric large-amplitude slow activity is sometimes observed on interictal electroencephalography (EEG) in epilepsy. However, few studies have examined slowing during magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings, which are performed primarily to localize interictal splices. Also, no prior investigations have compared the sensitivity of MEG to scalp EEG in detecting slow rhythms. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of focal epilepsy patients who received MEG followed by surgical resection at our institution. We examined MEG, simultaneous EEG, and long-term EEG recordings for prominent asymmetric slow activity (delta-range, 1-4 Hz), and evaluated post-operative seizure outcomes. Results: We studied 132 patients with >= 1 year post-operative follow-up (mean, 3.6 years). Mean age was 27 (range, 3-68) years, and 55% of patients were male. Asymmetric large-amplitude slow wave activity was observed on interictal MEG in 21 of 132 (16%) patients. Interictal slowing lateralized to the hemisphere of resection in all but one (95%) patient. Among the 21 patients with interictal MEG slowing, 11 (52%) individuals had similarly lateralized EEG slowing, 7 patients had no EEG slowing, and 3 had bilateral symmetric EEG slowing. Meanwhile, none of the 111 patients without lateralized MEG slowing had asymmetric EEG slowing, suggesting significantly higher sensitivity of MEG versus EEG in detecting asymmetric slowing (chi(2) = 63.4, p < 0.001). MEG slowing was associated with shorter epilepsy duration with an odds ratio of 5.4 (1.7-17.0, 95% confidence interval). At last follow-up, 92 (70%) patients were seizure free (Engel I outcome), with no difference in seizure freedom rates between patients with (71%) or without (69%) asymmetric MEG slowing (chi(2) = 0.4, p = 0.99). Significance: MEG has higher sensitivity than scalp EEG in detecting asymmetric slow activity in focal epilepsy, which reliably lateralizes to the epileptogenic hemisphere. Other uses of MEG beyond spike localization may further improve presurgical evaluations in epilepsy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Preliminary Study of the Association Among Metacognition and Resting State EEG in Schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; metacognition; EEG; gamma activity; resting state	SOCIAL COGNITION; SELF-REFLECTION; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; 1ST EPISODE; POWER; SYMPTOMS; ABNORMALITIES; NARRATIVES	Metacognition refers to a spectrum of activities that range from the consideration of discrete mental experiences, such as a specific thought or emotion, to the synthesis of discrete perceptions into integrated representations of the self and others as unique agents in the world. Metacognitive deficits have been observed in schizophrenia and linked with a number of behavioral correlates and outcomes. Less is known however about the neural systems associated with such processes. Establishing the link between brain activity and metacognition therefore is an essential next step. Resting state electroencephalography (EEG) provides one possible avenue for investigating this link. EEG studies in schizophrenia suggest that the gamma frequency range may have functional significance and be related to the disturbed information processing often observed in the disorder. In the present investigation, we assessed metacognition among 20 individuals with prolonged schizophrenia using the Metacognition Assessment Scale Abbreviated, who also participated in resting state EEG recording. We hypothesized that gamma activity would be associated with those domains of metacognition that require the most integration to perform, Decentration and Mastery. We then examined the association among gamma power and each metacognitive domain. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted across a spectrum of EEG activity. We found that increased gamma activity at rest was linked with decreased decentration. This suggests that hyperactivity in the gamma range may index disrupted processing and integration, and ultimately the metacognitive processes needed to form complex ideas about oneself and others and to see the world from multiple perspectives. This link provides additional evidence of how the biological roots of schizophrenia may culminate in a disrupted life.

Here, online resting-state spontaneous brain activation may be relevant to monitor tDCS neuromodulatory effects that can be measured using electroencephalography (EEG) in conjunction with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Method: We present a Kalman Filter based online parameter estimation of an autoregressive (ARX) model to track the transient coupling relation between the changes in EEG power spectrum and NIRS signals during anodal tDCS (2 mA, 10 min) using a 4 x 1 ring high-definition montage. Results: Our online ARX parameter estimation technique using the cross-correlation between log (base 10) transformed EEG band-power (0.5-11.25 Hz) and NIRS oxy-hemoglobin signal in the low frequency (<= 0.1 Hz) range was shown in 5 healthy subjects to be sensitive to detect transient EEG-NIRS coupling changes in resting-state spontaneous brain activation during anodal tDCS. Conventional sliding window cross-correlation calculations suffer a fundamental problem in computing the phase relationship as the signal in the window is considered time-invariant and the choice of the window length and step size are subjective. Here, Kalman Filter based method allowed online ARX parameter estimation using time varying signals that could capture transients in the coupling relationship between EEG and NIRS signals. Conclusion: Our new online ARX model based tracking method allows continuous assessment of the transient coupling between the electrophysiological (EEG) and the hemodynamic (NIRS) signals representing resting-state spontaneous brain activation during anodal tDCS.

Epileptogenic Source Imaging Using Cross-Frequency Coupled Signals From Scalp EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Basic and Clinical Multimodal Imaging (BaCI)	SEP 02-05, 2015	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS			Artifactual immunity; cross-frequency coupling; epilepsy; EEG source imaging (ESI); modulation index (MI)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY; EMG CONTAMINATION; SEIZURE FREEDOM; FOCAL EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; LOCALIZATION	Objective: The epileptogenic zone (EZ) is a brain region containing the sources of seizure genesis. Removal of the EZ is associated with cessation of seizures after resective surgical procedures, as measured by Engel Class I score. This study describes a novel EEG (electroencephalography) source imaging (ESI) method which uses cross-frequency coupled potential signals (SCFC) derived from scalp EEG. Methods: Scalp EEG were recorded from ten patients (20 seizures) suffering from epilepsy. The SCFC were constructed from the phase and amplitude of the lower and higher frequency rhythms at electrographic seizure onset. ESI was then performed using the SCFC. Validation of the technique was facilitated by forward and inverse computer modeling of known cortical sources, and the correspondence of the ESI with EZ in resected regions of patients. Results: For ten seizures sampled at or above 500 Hz from four patients, all estimated sources lay within the resected region, emphasizing the clinical importance of higher sampling rates. The SCFC demonstrated significant advantages over the "raw" scalp EEG, indicating its robust noise performance. Modeling investigations indicated that a signal-to-noise ratio above 0.2 was sufficient to achieve successful localization regarding EMG artifacts. Conclusion: The association of the estimated sources to the EZ suggests that cross-frequency coupling is a feature of the brain's neural networks, not of artifactual activity. The SCFC can effectively extract brain signals from a noisy background. Significance: We propose this approach to enhance the placement of intracranial electrode for surgical intervention.

Additionally, shrinkage of the temporoparietal cerebral area has been connected with an increase in alpha 3/alpha 2 electroencephalogram (EEG) power ratio in prodromal AD. Furthermore, a lower regional blood perfusion has been exhibited in patients with a higher alpha 3/alpha 2 proportion when contrasted with low alpha 3/alpha 2 proportion. Furthermore, a lower regional blood perfusion and reduced hippocampal volume has been exhibited in patients with higher alpha 3/alpha 2 when contrasted with lower alpha 3/alpha 2 EEG power ratio. Neuropsychological evaluation, EEG recording, and magnetic resonance imaging were conducted in 74 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Estimation of cortical thickness and alpha 3/alpha 2 frequency power ratio was conducted for each patient. A subgroup of 27 patients also underwent single-photon emission computed tomography evaluation. In view of alpha 3/alpha 2 power ratio, the patients were divided into three groups. The connections among cortical decay, cerebral perfusion, and memory loss were evaluated by Pearson's r coefficient. Results demonstrated that higher alpha 3/alpha 2 frequency power ratio group was identified with brain shrinkage and cutdown perfusion inside the temporoparietal projections. In addition, decay and cutdown perfusion rate were connected with memory shortfalls in patients with MCI. MCI subgroup with higher a3/a2 EEG power ratio are at a greater risk to develop AD dementia.

Its use is motivated by the fact that the EMD gives an effective time-frequency analysis of nonstationary signals. The intrinsic mode functions (IMF) obtained as a result of EMD give the decomposition of a signal according to its frequency components. We present the usage of upto third order temporal moments, and spectral features including spectral centroid, coefficient of variation and the spectral skew of the IMFs for feature extraction from EEG signals. These features are physiologically relevant given that the normal EEG signals have different temporal and spectral centroids, dispersions and symmetries when compared with the pathological EEG signals. The calculated features are fed into the standard support vector machine (SVM) for classification purposes. The performance of the proposed method is studied on a publicly available dataset which is designed to handle various classification problems including the identification of epilepsy patients and detection of seizures. Experiments show that good classification results are obtained using the proposed methodology for the classification of EEG signals. Our proposed method also compares favorably to other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods.

However, artifacts in EEG data introduced by theMR scanner still remain a major obstacle. This study, employing commonly used artifact correction steps, shows that head motion, one overlooked major source of artifacts in EEG-fMRI data, can cause plausible EEG effects and EEG-BOLD correlations. Specifically, low-frequency EEG (<20 Hz) is strongly correlated with in-scanner movement. Accordingly, minor head motion (<0.2 mm) induces spurious effects in a twofold manner: Small differences in task-correlated motion elicit spurious low-frequency effects, and, as motion concurrently influences fMRI data, EEG-BOLD correlations closely match motion-fMRI correlations. We demonstrate these effects in a memory encoding experiment showing that obtained theta power (similar to 3-7 Hz) effects and channel-level theta-BOLD correlations reflect motion in the scanner. These findings highlight an important caveat that needs to be addressed by future EEG-fMRI studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The residual aftereffects are akin to the plasticity mechanism of the brain and suggest the potential use of TMS for therapy. For years, TMS has been shown to transiently improve symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders, but the underlying neural correlates remain elusive. Recently, there is evidence that altered connectivity of brain network dynamics is the mechanism underlying symptoms of various neuropsychiatric illnesses. By combining TMS and electroencephalography (EEG), the functional connectivity patterns among brain regions, and the causal link between function or behaviour and a specific brain region can be determined. Nonetheless, the brain network connectivity are highly complex and involve the dynamics interplay among multitude of brain regions. In this review article, we present previous TMS-EEG co-registration studies, which explore the functional connectivity patterns of human cerebral cortex. We argue the possibilities of neural correlates of long-term potentiation/depression (LTP-/LTD)-like mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that drive the TMS aftereffects as shown by the dissociation between EEG and motor evoked potentials (MEP) cortical output. Here, we also explore alternative explanations that drive the EEG oscillatory modulations post TMS. The precise knowledge of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying TMS will help characterise disturbances in oscillatory patterns, and the altered functional connectivity in neuropsychiatric illnesses.

Analysis of Fractional Tools on EEG Compression	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION AND ELECTRONICS SYSTEMS (ICCES)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems (ICCES)	OCT 21-22, 2016	Coimbatore, INDIA	PPG Inst Technol, Elect Devices Soc, CFY, IEEE		EEG; FrFT; FrWT; Compression ratio; PSNR		Brain is the most vital organ that necessitates transmission of electrical signals(information) all over the body. Electrical signals generated from neurons is recorded by means of method known as Electroencephlography(EEG). These signal recordings usually takes around 2-8 hours of continuous monitoring and can extends over a week. So it places a huge problem on transmission and storage of EEG data. EEG signal compression has gaining more importance in biomedical field, because of limited storage capacity. The main objective of this work is to compare the performance of different Fractional compression tools on compression of an EEG signal. This paper exploits tools such as Compression ratio, Mean square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio on Fractional Fourier Transform and Fractional Wavelet transform for efficient compression of EEG signal. Fractional wavelet based time-fractional-frequency transform delivers a better compression, with compression ratio in the range of 27.23 with minimal mean square error for all EEG signals.	[Raj, C.

Neural network oscillatory activity is considered to be fundamentally important in coordinating neural activity throughout the brain. Hence, exploration of brain oscillations has become an indispensible tool to study the neural basis of mental illnesses. However, most of the studies in schizophrenia include medicated patients. This implicates the question to what extent are changes in the electrophysiological parameters genuine illness effects, genuine drug effects or a mixture of both. We here provide a short overview of the neuropharmacology of brain oscillations with respect to schizophrenia. The core assumption of the so-called "pharmaco-EEG" approach is that drug effects on mental and cognitive functions are reflected in changes in quantitative EEG parameters. Hence, clinical efficacy of drugs might be predicted on the basis of the neuropharmacology of electrophysiological measures, such as brain oscillations. Vice versa, knowledge of drug effects on brain oscillations can be of essence in understanding schizophrenia. However, the current literature lacks systematic findings, because of at least two problems. First, the pharmacology of most antipsychotic drugs is complex including interactions with several transmitter receptors. Second, the neuropathology of schizophrenia still has no pathognomonic signature. Even though it is presently not possible to clearly dissociate drug- and illness effects in neural oscillations, this review emphasizes future studies to foster the understanding of this relationship in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric diseases.

Multiscale temporal neural dynamics predict performance in a complex sensorimotor task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; CORTICAL NETWORKS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; RANGE; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; EEG; CRITICALITY; ATTENTION	Ongoing neuronal oscillations are pivotal in brain functioning and are known to influence subjects' performance. This modulation is usually studied on short time scales whilst multiple time scales are rarely considered. In our study we show that Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTCs) estimated from the amplitude of EEG oscillations over a range of time-scales predict performance in a complex sensorimotor task, based on Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI). Our paradigm involved eighty subjects generating covert motor responses to dynamically changing visual cues and thus controlling a computer program through the modulation of neuronal oscillations. The neuronal dynamics were estimated with multichannel EEG. Our results show that: (a) BCI task accuracy may be predicted on the basis of LRTCs measured during the preceding training session, and (b) this result was not due to signal-to-noise ratio of the ongoing neuronal oscillations. Our results provide direct empirical evidence in addition to previous theoretical work suggesting that scale-free neuronal dynamics are important for optimal brain functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Ripples on spikes show increased phase-amplitude coupling in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy seizure-onset zones	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; High-frequency oscillation; Epileptiform discharge; Ripple; Intracranial EEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HIGH GAMMA; 80-500 HZ; HIPPOCAMPAL; DISCHARGES; PATTERNS; SEQUENCES; DYNAMICS; NETWORK; MEMORY	ObjectiveRipples (80-150 Hz) recorded from clinical macroelectrodes have been shown to be an accurate biomarker of epileptogenic brain tissue. We investigated coupling between epileptiform spike phase and ripple amplitude to better understand the mechanisms that generate this type of pathologic ripple (pRipple) event. MethodsWe quantified phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) spike phase and ripple amplitude recorded from intracranial depth macroelectrodes during episodes of sleep in 12 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. PAC was determined by (1) a phasor transform that corresponds to the strength and rate of ripples coupled with spikes, and a (2) ripple-triggered average to measure the strength, morphology, and spectral frequency of the modulating and modulated signals. Coupling strength was evaluated in relation to recording sites within and outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). ResultsBoth the phasor transform and ripple-triggered averaging methods showed that ripple amplitude was often robustly coupled with epileptiform EEG spike phase. Coupling was found more regularly inside than outside the SOZ, and coupling strength correlated with the likelihood a macroelectrode's location was within the SOZ (p < 0.01). The ratio of the rate of ripples coupled with EEG spikes inside the SOZ to rates of coupled ripples in non-SOZ was greater than the ratio of rates of ripples on spikes detected irrespective of coupling (p < 0.05). Coupling strength correlated with an increase in mean normalized ripple amplitude (p < 0.01), and a decrease in mean ripple spectral frequency (p < 0.05). SignificanceGeneration of low-frequency (80-150 Hz) pRipples in the SOZ involves coupling between epileptiform spike phase and ripple amplitude. The changes in excitability reflected as epileptiform spikes may also cause clusters of pathologically interconnected bursting neurons to grow and synchronize into aberrantly large neuronal assemblies.

This paper presents a signal processing technique for a low cost brain machine interface (BMI) that uses spectral analysis and artificial neural network (ANN) to classify three mental states from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. In this study, a BMI system has been prototyped to classify the intention of moving an object up or down and at rest state. EEG signals are recorded using a consumer grade EEG acquisition device. The device is equipped with 14 electrodes but only 8 electrodes are used in this study. To evaluate the system performance, online classification experiments for three subjects are conducted. True positive and false positive rates are used as an evaluation index. Experiment results show that despite the high difficulty of the mental tasks, the proposed method is capable of achieving an overall true positive rate of up to 67% with 15 minutes of training time by a first time BMI user. Furthermore, offline analysis is carried out using the same EEG data to explore ways of using spectral analysis and ANN to reduce erroneous classifications. Analysis results show that by setting the classification threshold value higher, the false positive rate can be reduced. Another finding suggests that in contrast with the study results by other research teams, the use of multiple ANNs to classify three mental states do not improve the accuracy. Lastly, a hamming window size of 64 samples is found to be optimal for achieving real-time control when performing spectral analysis.

Although the number of papers related to brain oscillations rapidly increases, it is important to indicate the common principles governing the functioning of brain oscillations in the brain and body. Research scientists need a global view on the types of analysis, applications and existing oscillations. Further, scientists dealing with brain oscillations must have some knowledge from theoretical physics, system theory, and also general philosophy. The neuroscientists working on brain oscillations can mentally integrate several papers in the present report, and try to discover new avenues to augment knowledge on brain functions. A new take off in the search of brain oscillations indicates the strong need to survey this brunch of neuroscience in a broad panoply of science. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the mechanisms that guide such a temporally structured replay in humans, because previous studies used either unsuitable methods or paradigms to address this question. Here, we overcome these limitations by developing a new analysis method to detect the replay of temporal patterns in a paradigm that requires participants to mentally replay short sound or video clips. We show that memory reinstatement is accompanied by a decrease of low-frequency (8 Hz) power, which carries a temporal phase signature of the replayed stimulus. These replay effects were evident in the visual as well as in the auditory domain and were localized to sensory-specific regions. These results suggest low-frequency phase to be a domain-general mechanism that orchestrates dynamic memory replay in humans.

Indeed, in the current state of BCI research, there is always at least one expert involved in the first stages of any experimentation. On one hand, such experts really appreciate keeping a certain level of control on the tuning of user-specific parameters. On the other hand, we will show that their knowledge is extremely valuable for selecting a sparse set of significant time-frequency features. The expert selects these features through a visual analysis of curves highlighting differences between electroencephalographic activities recorded during the execution of various motor imagery tasks. We compare our method to the basic common spatial patterns approach and to two fully-automatic feature extraction methods, using dataset 2A of BCI competition IV. Our method (mean accuracy m = 83.71 +/- 14.6 std) outperforms the best competing method (m = 79.48 +/- 12.41 std) for 6 of the 9 subjects.

We aimed at clarifying its relationships with ictal high-frequency oscillations (iHFOs) shown to be a relevant marker of the seizure-onset zone. MethodsWe studied the correlation between FDG-PET and epileptogenicity maps in an unselected series of 37 successive patients having been explored with stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG). ResultsAt the group level, we found a significant correlation between iHFOs and FDG-PET interictal hypometabolism only in cases of temporal lobe epilepsy. This correlation was found with HFOs, and the same comparison between FDG-PET and ictal SEEG power of lower frequencies during the same epochs did not show the same significance. SignificanceThis finding suggests that interictal FDG-PET and ictal HFOs may share common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of ictogenesis in temporal lobe epilepsy, and combining both features may help to identify the seizure-onset zone.

Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients with depression experience spontaneous remission without any treatment. However, the relationship between electroencephalo-graphic ( EEG) functional connectivity and the spontaneous remission in depression remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated regional and network brain activity using EEG signals from a chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced mouse model of depression. After 1 (CRS1W) or 3 weeks (CRS3W) following the cessation of a 4-week-long CRS, mice were subjected to depression-associated behavioral tasks. EEG signals were obtained from eight cortical regions (frontal, somatosensory, parietal, and visual cortices in each hemisphere). Results: The CRS1W group exhibited behavioral dysfunctions in the open field and forced swim tasks, whereas the CRS3W group displayed normal levels of behaviors in those tasks. In a linear correlation analysis, the CRS1W group exhibited increased correlation coefficient values at all frequency bands (delta, 1.5-4; theta, 4-8; alpha, 8-12; beta, 12-30; gamma, 30-80 Hz) compared with the control group. However, the differences in delta-and gamma-frequency bands between the control and CRS1W groups were no longer observed in the CRS3W group. Persistent brain network homology revealed significantly different functional connectivity between the control and CRS1W groups, and it demonstrated a huge restoration of the decreased distances in the gamma-frequency band for the CRS3W group. Moreover, the CRS3W group displayed a similar strength of connectivity among somatosensory and frontal cortices as the control group. Conclusion: A mouse model of CRS-induced depression showed spontaneous behavioral remission of depressive behavior. Using persistent brain network homology analysis of EEG signals from eight cortical regions, we found that restoration of gamma activity at the network level is associated with behavioral remission.

Participants read fully correct sentences, sentences containing a semantic violation and "sentences" in which the order of the words was randomized. At the target word level, fixations on semantically unrelated words elicited a lower-beta band (13-18 Hz) desynchronization. At the sentence level, gamma power (31-55 Hz) increased linearly for syntactically correct sentences, but not when the order of the words was randomized. In the 300-900 ms time window after sentence onsets, theta power (4-7 Hz) was greater for syntactically correct sentences as compared to sentences where no syntactic structure was preserved (random words condition). We interpret our results as conforming with a recently formulated predictive coding framework for oscillatory neural dynamics during sentence-level language comprehension. Additionally, we discuss how our results relate to previous findings with serial visual presentation vs. self-paced reading.

Music is considered as a powerful tool for arousing emotions in human beings. This study recognized happy, sad, love and anger emotions in response to audio music tracks from electronic, rap, metal, rock and hiphop genres. Participants were asked to listen to audio music tracks of 1 min for each genre in a noise free environment. The main objectives of this study were to determine the effect of different genres of music on human emotions and indicating age group that is more responsive to music. Thirty men and women of three different age groups (15-25 years, 26-35 years and 36-50 years) underwent through the experiment that also included self reported emotional state after listening to each type of music. Features from three different domains i.e., time, frequency and wavelet were extracted from recorded EEG signals, which were further used by the classifier to recognize human emotions. It has been evident from results that MLP gives best accuracy to recognize human emotion in response to audio music tracks using hybrid features of brain signals. It is also observed that rock and rap genres generated happy and sad emotions respectively in subjects under study. The brain signals of age group (26-35 years) gave best emotion recognition accuracy in accordance to the self reported emotions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, while previous electroencephalography (EEG) research has demonstrated a reduction in the N400 response to words in a supportive context, it is often challenging to dissociate facilitation due to bottom-up spreading activation from facilitation due to top-down expectations. The goal of the current study was to specifically determine the cortical areas associated with facilitation due to top-down prediction, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings supplemented by EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a semantic priming paradigm. In order to modulate expectation processes while holding context constant, we manipulated the proportion of related pairs across 2 blocks (10 and 50% related). Event-related potential results demonstrated a larger N400 reduction when a related word was predicted, and MEG source localization of activity in this time-window (350-450 ms) localized the differential responses to left anterior temporal cortex. fMRI data from the same participants support the MEG localization, showing contextual facilitation in left anterior superior temporal gyrus for the high expectation block only. Together, these results provide strong evidence that facilitatory effects of lexical-semantic prediction on the electrophysiological response 350-450 ms postonset reflect modulation of activity in left anterior temporal cortex.

Modern anesthesia monitors uses EEG signals to derive Depth of Anesthesia (DoA) measures, which decreases monotonically with increasing anesthetic drug levels. This study aims to measure DoA using Wavelet Analysis of EEG signals and classify them according to the DoA. Wavelet Entropy (WE) of the EEG signal is extracted as a measure of DoA from the EEG signals collected during the four phases of general anesthesia called awake, induction, maintenance and recovery. In order to find out the wavelet entropy, EEG signals during anesthesia were decomposed into its constituent frequency bands, then WE were calculated from the approximation and detail coefficients. Artificial Neural networks (ANN) were implemented using the extracted WE features of EEG signals as inputs and then classifying anesthetic depth as awake, light anesthesia, moderate anaesthesia and deep anaesthesia. Finally extracted WE is compared with BIS index, which is a commercially available DoA monitor.	[Benzy, V. K.; Jasmin, E.

Here, we had the rare opportunity to record a delusional religious conversion in real time in a patient with right temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing continuous video-EEG. In this patient, a messianic revelation experience occurred several hours after a complex partial seizure of temporal origin, compatible with postictal psychosis (PIP). We analyzed the recorded resting-state EEG epochs separately for each of the conventional frequency bands. Topographical analysis of the bandpass filtered EEG epochs revealed increased activity in the low-gamma range (30-40 Hz) during religious conversion compared with activity during the patient's habitual state. The brain generator underlying this activity was localized to the left prefrontal cortex. This suggests that religious conversion in PIP is related to control mechanisms in the prefrontal lobe-related processes rather than medial temporal lobe-related processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the brain oscillatory activities synchronized by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered over the primary motor area in the time-frequency domain in patients with the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or in a minimally conscious state as compared to healthy controls. A time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform was used to characterize rapid modifications of oscillatory EEG rhythms induced by TMS in patients as compared to healthy controls. The pattern of EEG changes in the patients differed from that of healthy controls. In the controls there was an early synchronization of slow waves immediately followed by a desynchronization of alpha and beta frequency bands over the frontal and centro-parietal electrodes, whereas an opposite early synchronization, particularly over motor areas for alpha and beta and over the frontal and parietal electrodes for beta power, was seen in the patients. In addition, no relevant modification in slow rhythms (delta and theta) after TMS was noted in patients. The clinical impact of these findings could be relevant in neurorehabilitation settings for increasing the awareness of these patients and defining new treatment procedures.

Methods: The toolbox integrates visualizations of inter-electrode phase-locking relationships in peri-ictal epileptogenic networks with signal spectral properties and graph-theoretical network measures overlaid upon operating room images of the electrode grid. Functional connectivity between every electrode pair is evaluated over a sliding window indexed by phase synchrony. Results: Two case studies are presented to provide preliminary evidence for the application of the toolbox to guide network-based mapping of epileptogenic cortex and to distinguish these regions from eloquent brain networks. In both cases, epileptogenic cortex was visually distinct. Conclusion: We introduce moviEEG, a novel toolbox for animation of oscillatory network dynamics in iEEG data, and provide two case studies showing preliminary evidence for utility of the toolbox in delineating the epileptogenic zone. Significance: Despite evidence that atypical network synchronization has shown to be altered in epileptogenic brain regions, network based techniques have yet to be incorporated into clinical pre-surgical mapping. moviEEG provides a set of functions to enable easy visualization with network based techniques.

Methods: To learn the phasic event waveforms we propose a multiscale modeling process that is based on existing shift-invariant dictionary learning algorithms. For each channel, waveforms at different temporal scales are learned based on the assumption that only a few waveforms occur in any window of the time-series, but the same waveforms reoccur throughout the signal. Once the waveforms are learned, the timing and amplitude of the phasic event occurrences are estimated using matching pursuit. To summarize the waveforms learned across multiple channels and subjects, we analyze their frequency content, their similarity to Gabor-Morlet wavelets, and perform shift-invariant k-means to cluster the waveforms. A prototype waveform from each cluster is then tested for differential spatial patterns between different motor imagery conditions. Results: On multiple human EEG datasets, the learned waveforms capture key characteristics of signals they were trained to represent, with a consistency in waveform morphology and frequency content across multiple training sections and initializations. On multichannel datasets, the spatial amplitude patterns of the waveforms are also consistent and can be used to distinguish different modalities of motor imagery. Conclusion: We explored a methodology that can be used for modeling the recurrent waveforms in EEG traces. Significance: The methodology automatically identifies the most frequent phasic event waveforms in EEG, which could then be used as features for automatic evaluation and comparison of EEG during sleep, pathology, or mentally engaging tasks.

Pre-stimulus Alpha Oscillations and Inter-subject Variability of Motor Evoked Potentials in Single- and Paired-Pulse TMS Paradigms	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain stimulation; variability; paired-pulse; motor evoked potentials; electroencephalography; oscillations	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; EEG ALPHA; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; ONGOING OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS	Inter- and intra-subject variability of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to TMS is a well-known phenomenon. Although a possible link between this variability and ongoing brain oscillations was demonstrated, the results of the studies are not consistent with each other. Exploring this topic further is important since the modulation of MEPs provides unique possibility to relate oscillatory cortical phenomena to the state of the motor cortex probed with TMS. Given that alpha oscillations were shown to reflect cortical excitability, we hypothesized that their power and variability might explain the modulation of subject-specific MEPs to single- and paired-pulse TMS (spTMS, ppTMS, respectively). Neuronal activity was recorded with multichannel electroencephalogram. We used spTMS and two ppTMS conditions: intracortical facilitation (ICE) and short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). Spearman correlations were calculated within and across subjects between MEPs and the pre-stimulus power of alpha oscillations in low (8-10 Hz) and high (10-12 Hz) frequency bands. Coefficient of quartile variation was used to measure variability. Across-subject analysis revealed no difference in the pre-stimulus alpha power among the TMS conditions. However, the variability of high-alpha power in spTMS condition was larger than in the SICI condition. In ICF condition pre-stimulus high-alpha power variability correlated positively with MEP amplitude variability. No correlation has been observed between the pre-stimulus alpha power and MEP responses in any of the conditions. Our results show that the variability of the alpha oscillations can be more predictive of TMS effects than the commonly used power of oscillations and we provide further support for the dissociation of high and low-alpha bands in predicting responses produced by the stimulation of the motor cortex.

Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is a neurodevelopmental disease often exhibiting attentional deficits and learning disabilities, and is considered to model similar impairments common in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. In a previous study, we found that patients with NF1 are more prone to miss targets under overt attention conditions. This finding was interpreted as a result of increased occipito-parietal alpha oscillations. In the present study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to study alpha power modulations and the performance of patients with NF1 in a covert attention task. Covert attention was required in order to perceive changes (target offset) of a peripherally presented stimulus. Interestingly, alpha oscillations were found to undergo greater desynchronization under this task in the NF1 group compared with control subjects. A similar pattern of desynchronization was found for beta frequencies while no changes in gamma oscillations could be identified. These results are consistent with the notion that different attentional states and task demands generate different patterns of abnormal modulation of alpha oscillatory processes in NF1. Under covert attention conditions and while target offset was reported with relatively high accuracy (over 90% correct responses), excessive desynchronization was found. These findings suggest an abnormal modulation of oscillatory activity and attentional processes in NF1. Given the known role of alpha in modulating attention, we suggest that alpha patterns can show both abnormal increases and decreases that are task and performance dependent, in a way that enhanced alpha desynchronization may reflect a compensatory mechanism to keep performance at normal levels. These results suggest that dysregulation of alpha oscillations may occur in NF1 both in terms of excessive or diminished activation patterns.

The brain activity was monitored when subjects processed AV and V situations, which represented an emotional (positive or negative), interspecies (human-animal) interaction. Congruence (emotionally congruous or incongruous visual and auditory patterns) was also modulated. electroencephalography brain oscillations (from delta to beta) were analyzed and the cortical source localization (by standardized Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography) was applied to the data. Frequency band (mainly low-frequency delta and theta) showed a significant brain activity increasing in response to negative compared to positive interactions within the right hemisphere. Moreover, differences were found based on stimulation type, with an increased effect for AV compared with V. Finally, delta band supported a lateralized right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity in response to negative and incongruous interspecies interactions, mainly for AV. The contribution of cross-modality, congruence (incongruous patterns), and lateralization (right DLPFC) in response to interspecies emotional interactions was discussed at light of a "negative lateralized effect."

J	Zoefel, B; VanRullen, R				Zoefel, Benedikt; VanRullen, Rufin			EEG oscillations entrain their phase to high-level features of speech sound	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Oscillation; Phase entrainment; High-level; Speech; Auditory; Intelligibility	CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; PATTERNS; DYNAMICS; COMPREHENSION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISM; RESPONSES; GAMMA	Phase entrainment of neural oscillations, the brain's adjustment to rhythmic stimulation, is a central component in recent theories of speech comprehension: the alignment between brain oscillations and speech sound improves speech intelligibility. However, phase entrainment to everyday speech sound could also be explained by oscillations passively following the low-level periodicities (e.g., in sound amplitude and spectral content) of auditory stimulation-and not by an adjustment to the speech rhythm per se. Recently, using novel speech/noise mixture stimuli, we have shown that behavioral performance can entrain to speech sound even when high-level features (including phonetic information) are not accompanied by fluctuations in sound amplitude and spectral content. In the present study, we report that neural phase entrainment might underlie our behavioral findings. We observed phase-locking between electroencephalogram(EEG) and speech sound in response not only to original (unprocessed) speech but also to our constructed "high-level" speech/noise mixture stimuli. Phase entrainment to original speech and speech/noise sound did not differ in the degree of entrainment, but rather in the actual phase difference between EEG signal and sound. Phase entrainment was not abolished when speech/noise stimuli were presented in reverse (which disrupts semantic processing), indicating that acoustic (rather than linguistic) high-level features play a major role in the observed neural entrainment. Our results provide further evidence for phase entrainment as a potential mechanism underlying speech processing and segmentation, and for the involvement of high-level processes in the adjustment to the rhythm of speech.

We hypothesized that delta EROs were affected by age-related changes, which could be reflected in a visual oddball paradigm. Method: The study included two groups of subjects, 17 younger healthy elderly (mean age: 63.1 +/- 2.8 years) and 17 gender- and education-matched older healthy elderly (mean age: 79.6 +/- 5.2 years), who performed a visual oddball paradigm. EEG was recorded from F-3, F-z, F-4, C-3, C-z, C-4, P-3, P-z, P-4, O-1, O-z and O-2 locations. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of delta (0.5-3 Hz) target ERO responses during the post-stimulus 0-800 ms time window were measured. Repeated measures of ANOVA was used to analyze four locations (frontal, central, parietal, occipital), at three sagittal (left, midline, right) sites. Independent t-tests were applied for post-hoc analyses. Results: The older healthy elderly group had 16-25% lower values for the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes of delta ERO compared with the younger healthy elderly group over frontal (p < 0.003), central (p < 0.0001) and parietal (p < 0.007) locations [F-3.95 = 4396, p = 0.015] Furthermore, there was a moderate negative correlation between age and C-z peak-to-peak amplitude of target delta responses [r = -0.401, p < 0.02], indicating the notion that peak-to-peak amplitude of C-z decreases as age increases. Conclusion: In the present study younger healthy elderly showed significantly higher event-related delta responses than older healthy elderly at frontal, central and parietal locations. Moreover, delta ERO responses decreased in accordance with age. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lahane, PS; Thirugnanam, M				Lahane, Prashant S.; Thirugnanam, Mythili			Literature review of Human Stress analysis using EEG Signal.	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Brain-computer interface (BCI); Emotion recognition; Stress		At present Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology plays an important role in the field of biomedical. BCI can be used to identify human stress based on various emotion states - happy, sad, disgust, fear. Various techniques such as Neural networks (ANN), statistical methods, autoregressive model (AM), mixture of densities approach, independent component analysis (ICA), time-frequency analysis (TFA), bayes quadratic, hidden markov model (HMM) and linear discriminate analysis (LDA) have been used for EEG signal analysis. There are some issues which are being focused on while extracting features are - handling irrelevant and redundant features require more computation for decomposition of EEG signals. And the paper is considering following issues while carrying out classification - inability in processing complicated set of data, low performance when training data set is huge. This paper focuses on addressing above mentioned issues and appropriately analyzes various EEG signals which would in turn help us to improve the process of feature extraction and improve the accuracy in classification. In addition to acknowledging above problems, this paper proposes a framework which would be helpful in identifying human stress level and as a result, differentiate a normal or stressed person/subject.

Our aim was to assess the modulation of those properties and its association with subclinical psychosis and cognition in the general population. Method: Closeness centrality and small-worldness were compared between pre-stimulus baseline and response windows of an odd-ball task in 200 healthy individuals. The correlation between modulation of network parameters and clinical (scores in the Community Assessment of Psychological Experiences) and cognitive measures (performance in the dimensions included in the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia battery) was analyzed, as well as between these measures and the corresponding network parameters during baseline and response windows during task performance. Results: In the theta band, closeness centrality decreased and small-worldness increased in the response-window. Centrality and small-worldness modulation were, respectively, directly and inversely associated with subclinical symptoms. Conclusions: A widespread modulation of network properties in theta band was observed, with a transient increase of small-worldness during the response window, compatible with a transiently more integrated cortical activity associated to cognition. This supports the relevance of electroencephalography to study of normal and altered cognition and its substrates. A relative deficit in the ability to reorganize brain networks may contribute to subclinical psychotic symptoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 20 subjects with mean age of 53 years was recorded prior to and during 400 trials of SVIPT. They were executed within a single session with the non-dominant left hand, while receiving continuous visual feedback of the produced force trajectories. The behavioral data showed strong trial-by-trial performance variations for five clinically relevant metrics, which accounted for reaction time as well as for the smoothness and precision of the produced force trajectory. 18 out of 20 tested subjects remained after preprocessing and entered offline analysis. Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) was applied on EEG data of a short time interval prior to the start of each SVIPT trial. For 11 subjects, SPoC revealed robust oscillatory EEG subspace components, whose bandpower activity are predictive for the performance of the upcoming trial. Since SPoC may overfit to non-informative subspaces, we propose to apply three selection criteria accounting for the meaningfulness of the features. Across all subjects, the obtained components were spread along the frequency spectrum and showed a variety of spatial activity patterns. Those containing the highest level of predictive information resided in and close to the alpha band. Their spatial patterns resemble topologies reported for visual attention processes as well as those of imagined or executed hand motor tasks. In summary, we identified subject-specific single predictors that explain up to 36% of the performance fluctuations and may serve for enhancing neuroergonomics of motor rehabilitation scenarios.

In this respect, modern invasive clinical approaches in humans, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), offer a tremendous possibility to record subcortical brain activity, namely local field potentials (LFPs) representing coherent activity of neural assemblies from localized basal ganglia or thalamic regions. Notwithstanding the fact that invasive approaches in humans are applied only after medical indication and thus recorded data correspond to altered brain circuits, valuable insight can be gained regarding the presence of intact brain functions in relation to brain oscillatory activity and the pathophysiology of disorders in response to experimental cognitive paradigms. In this direction, a growing number of DBS studies in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) target not only motor functions but also higher level processes such as emotions, decision-making, attention, memory and sensory perception. Recent clinical trials also emphasize the role of DBS as an alternative treatment in neuropsychiatric disorders ranging from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to chronic disorders of consciousness (DOC). Consequently, we focus on the use of combined invasive (LFP) and non-invasive (EEG) human brain recordings in assessing the role of cortical-subcortical structures in cognitive and emotional processing trough experimental paradigms (e.g. speech stimuli with emotional connotation or paradigms of cognitive control such as the Flanker task), for patients undergoing DBS treatment.

Methods: The lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy was used. The acute phase of epilepsy was assessed by recording intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) activity for 1 day after status epilepticus (SE). The chronic phase of epilepsy, including spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs), was assessed by recording EEG activity for 28 days after SE. Average and peak spectral power of five frequency bands of EEG signals in CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus were analyzed with wavelet and digital filter. Results: FRs occurred in the hippocampus in the animal model. Significant dynamic changes in the spectral power of FRS were identified in CA1 and CA3. The average spectral power of ripples increased at 20 min before SE (p < 0.05), peaked at 10 min before diazepam injection. It decreased at 10 min after diazepam (p < 0.05) and returned to baseline after 1 h. The average spectral power of FRs increased at 30 min before SE (p < 0.05) and peaked at 10 min before diazepam. It decreased at 10 min after diazepam (p < 0.05) and returned to baseline at 2 h after injection. The dynamic changes were similar between average and peak spectral power of FRs. Average and peak spectral power of both ripples and FRs in the chronic phase showed a gradual downward trend compared with normal rats 14 days after SE. significance: The spectral power of HFOs may be utilized to distinguish between normal and pathologic HFOs. Ictal average and peak spectral power of FRs were two parameters for predicting acute epileptic seizures, which could be used as a new quantitative biomarker and early warning marker of seizure. Changes in interictal HFOs power in the hippocampus at the chronic stage may be not related to seizure occurrence.

J	Chand, GB; Dhamala, M				Chand, Ganesh B.; Dhamala, Mukesh			The salience network dynamics in perceptual decision-making	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CORTICAL NETWORK; INSULAR CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY; LOCALIZATION; SYSTEM; EEG	Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the network consisting of the right anterior insula (rAI), left anterior insula (lAI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is activated in sensory stimulus-guided goal-directed behaviors. This network is often known as the salience network (SN). When and how a sensory signal enters and organizes within SN before reaching the central executive network including the prefrontal cortices is still a mystery. Previous electrophysiological studies focused on individual nodes of SN, either on dACC or rAI, have reports of conflicting findings of the earliest cortical activity within the network. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are not able to answer these questions in the time-scales of human sensory perception and decision-making. Here, using clear and noisy face-house image categorization tasks and human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings combined with source reconstruction techniques, we study when and how oscillatory activity organizes SN during a perceptual decision. We uncovered that the beta-band (13-30 Hz) oscillations bound SN, became most active around 100 ms after the stimulus onset and the rAI acted as a main outflow hub within SN for easier decision making task. The SN activities (Granger causality measures) were negatively correlated with the decision response time (decision difficulty).

Precaution for volume conduction in rodent cortical electroencephalography using high-density polyimide-based microelectrode arrays on the skull	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						high-density EEG; theta; gamma; ketamine	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; RAT; EEG; NEOCORTEX; NEURONS; SLEEP; WAVES; TASK; MICE	In humans, significant progress has been made to link spatial changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral density, connectivity strength, and phase-amplitude modulation to neurological, physiological, and psychological correlates. In contrast, standard rodent EEG techniques employ only few electrodes, which results in poor spatial resolution. Recently, a technique was developed to overcome this limitation in mice. This technique was based on a polyimide-based microelectrode (PBM) array applied on the mouse skull, maintaining a significant number of electrodes with consistent contact, electrode impedance, and mechanical stability. The present study built on this technique by extending it to rats. Therefore, a similar PBM array, but adapted to rats, was designed and fabricated. In addition, this array was connected to a wireless EEG headstage, allowing recording in untethered, freely moving rats. The advantage of a high-density array relies on the assumption that the signal recorded from the different electrodes is generated from distinct sources, i.e., not volume-conducted. Therefore, the utility and validity of the array were evaluated by determining the level of synchrony between channels due to true synchrony or volume conduction during basal vigilance states and following a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Although the PBM array allowed recording with high signal quality, under both drug and drug-free conditions, high synchronization existed due to volume conduction between the electrodes even in the higher spectral frequency range. Discrimination existed only between frontally and centrally/distally grouped electrode pairs. Therefore, caution should be used in interpreting spatial data obtained from high-density PBM arrays in rodents.	[Stienen, P.

An abstract designed environment, with a degree of freedom from any visual reference in the physical world requests a completely different perception than a fully or semi-designed environment that has some correlation with the physical world. Maximal evidence on the manner in which the human brain is involved/operates in dealing with such novel perception comes from neuropsychology. Harnessing the tools and techniques involved in the domain of neuropsychology, the paper presents nee evidence on the role of pre-central gyrus in the perception of abstract spatial environments. In order to do so, the research team developed three different categories of designed environment with different characteristics: (1) Abstract environment, (2) Semi-designed environment, (3) Fully designed environment, as experimental sample environments. Perception of Fully-designed and semi-designed environments is almost the same, [maybe] since the brain can find a correlation between designed environments and already experienced physical world. In addition to this, the response to questionnaires accompanied with a list of buzzwords that have been provided after the experiments, also describe the characteristics of the chosen sample environments. Additionally, these results confirm the suitability of continuous electroencephalography (EEG) for studying Perception from the perspective of architectural environments.

We were particularly interested in the neurophysiological differences between children with learning disabilities not otherwise specified (LD-NOS), learning disabilities with verbal disabilities (LD-Verbal), and healthy control (HC) children. We applied 2 different approaches to examine the differences between the different groups. First, we calculated theta/beta and theta/alpha ratios in order to quantify the relationship between slow and fast EEG oscillations. Second, we used a recently developed method for analyzing spectral EEG, namely the group independent component analysis (gICA) model. Using these measures, we identified substantial differences between LD and HC children and between LD-NOS and LD-Verbal children in terms of their spectral EEG profiles. We obtained the following findings: (a) theta/beta and theta/alpha ratios were substantially larger in LD than in HC children, with no difference between LD-NOS and LD-Verbal children; (b) there was substantial slowing of EEG oscillations, especially for gICs located in frontal scalp positions, with LD-NOS children demonstrating the strongest slowing; (c) the estimated intracortical sources of these gICs were mostly located in brain areas involved in the control of executive functions, attention, planning, and language; and (d) the LD-Verbal children demonstrated substantial differences in EEG oscillations compared with LD-NOS children, and these differences were localized in language-related brain areas. The general pattern of atypical neurophysiological activation found in LD children suggests that they suffer from neurophysiological dysfunction in brain areas involved with the control of attention, executive functions, planning, and language functions. LD-Verbal children also demonstrate atypical activation, especially in language-related brain areas. These atypical neurophysiological activation patterns might provide a helpful guide for rehabilitation strategies to treat the deficiencies in these children with LD.

The examined subjects were: patients with severe atrophy of cerebral hemisphere (N= 35), patients after left (N= 34) and right (N= 32) stroke and healthy volunteers (N= 42). Resting state clusters having specific frequency pattern, topography and time of presence were discriminated from EEG for each group. Clusters observed in healthy subjects were almost or even completely absent in patients with ischemia. Their time of presence correlated directly with blood flow rates in head arteries and inversely with stenosis level in internal carotid artery. Further, there were clusters specific to patients groups, also being correlated with stenosis level. "Ischemic" clusters proved to be quite similar for patients with SACH and after right stroke, but they were completely different in patients after left stroke. Time of presence of these clusters correlated with cognitive tests scores. The results prove the resting EEG analysis to be applicable for ischemia diagnosis as an additional instrument.

The suggested reason for this influence is the strong recruitment of attention, planning, and working memory functions during playing a musical instrument. The purpose of the present work was twofold, namely to evaluate the general relationship between pre-stimulus electrophysiological activity and cognition, and more specifically the influence of musical expertise on working memory functions. With this purpose in mind, we used covariance mapping analyses to evaluate whether pre-stimulus electroencephalographic activity is predictive for reaction time during a visual working memory task (Sternberg paradigm) in musicians and non-musicians. In line with our hypothesis, we replicated previous findings pointing to a general predictive value of pre-stimulus activity for working memory performance. Most importantly, we also provide first evidence for an influence of musical expertise on working memory performance that could distinctively be predicted by pre-stimulus spectral power. Our results open novel perspectives for better comprehending the vast influences of musical expertise on cognition.

The pathogenesis of myoclonic seizures is not yet clear. There are very few studies on the focal surgical treatment of myoclonic seizures. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of myoclonic seizure onset in different bands of the intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) and their dynamic changes in temporal and spatial evolution. We studied four patients with myoclonic seizures who were under the focal resection of the epileptogenic zone. We retrospectively analyzed the semiology, electrocorticogram (ECoG) and imaging data of these patients, and conducted time-frequency analysis of broadband ECoG activity. We found that myoclonic seizures without clinical lateralizing signs could be improved by the resection of the epileptogenic zone. The ECoG power in different frequency bands increased to a peak at 0.5 s before the clinical seizure onset and decreased quickly afterwards. The power of alpha activity was highest during the preictal and ictal periods. The central zone had higher power than the epileptogenic zone in all frequency bands during the preictal period, but this difference was not statistically significant.

Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed that several brain regions are activated in response to eyes and eye gaze direction changes. However, it remains unclear whether the temporal pole is one of these regions. Furthermore, if the temporal pole is activated by these stimuli, the timing and manner in which it is activated also remain unclear. To investigate these issues, we analyzed intracranial electroencephalo-graphic data from the temporal pole that were obtained during the presentation of eyes and mosaics in averted or straight directions and their directional changes. Time-frequency statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed that the bilateral temporal poles exhibited greater gamma-band activation beginning at 215 ms in response to eyes compared with mosaics, irrespective of the direction. Additionally, the right temporal pole showed greater gamma-band activation beginning at 197 ms in response to directional changes of the eyes compared with mosaics. These results suggest that gamma-band oscillations in the temporal pole were involved in the processing of the presence of eyes and changes in eye gaze direction at a relatively late temporal stage compared with the posterior cortices.

We investigated the relationship between activity in attention control areas and attention-related modulation of posterior alpha activity using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans during cued visual-spatial attention. Correlating single-trial EEG alpha power with blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity, we found that BOLD in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and left middle frontal gyrus was inversely correlated with occipital alpha power. Importantly, in IPS, inverse correlations were stronger for alpha within the hemisphere contralateral to the attended hemifield, implicating the IPS in the enhancement of task-relevant sensory areas. Positive BOLD-alpha correlations were observed in sensorimotor cortices and the default mode network, suggesting a mechanism of active suppression over task-irrelevant areas. The magnitude of cue-induced alpha lateralization was positively correlated with BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, implicating a role of executive control in attention. These results show that IPS and frontal executive areas are the main sources of biasing influences on task-relevant visual cortex, whereas task-irrelevant default mode network and sensorimotor cortex are inhibited during visual attention.

Prior to imagery performance, individuals may acquire information on how to imagine the movement through either visual or auditory instructions. The purpose of this study was to determine differences in cerebral cortical activation during kinesthetic and visual imagery performance while following visual-and audio-guided imagery instructions. EEG recordings were collected from 28 participants and guided imagery instructions were given in two versions: audio and visual. The results revealed that lower alpha values (8-10 Hz) were greater when participants were performing kinesthetic imagery following auditory instructions as opposed to following visual instructions. Furthermore, lower alpha values were greater at the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere and greater at the right temporal site than the left temporal site. In the upper alpha band (11-13 Hz), results showed that values were greater at the temporal site in the right hemisphere than the temporal site in the left hemisphere. In addition, upper alpha values were greater at the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere and greater at the right temporal site than the left temporal site. The findings of this study suggest that electro-cortical measures can detect differences of the processes involved during guided imagery performance while following either audio or video instructions. In the applied setting, practitioners can implement neurofeedback techniques to assess the specific mental effort required by individuals following guided instructions to perform imagery.

Such directionality analysis (or effective connectivity analysis), based on non-invasive electrophysiological (electroencephalography-EEG) and hemodynamic (functional near infrared spectroscopy-fNIRS; and functional magnetic resonance imaging-fMRI) neuroimaging modalities can provide an estimate of the motor task-related information flow from one brain region to another. Since EEG, fNIRS and fMRI modalities achieve different spatial and temporal resolutions of motor-task related activation in the brain, the aim of this study was to determine the effective connectivity of cortico-cortical sensorimotor networks during finger movement tasks measured by each neuroimaging modality. Nine healthy subjects performed right hand finger movement tasks of different complexity (simple finger tapping-FT, simple finger sequence-SFS, and complex finger sequence-CFS). We focused our observations on three cortical regions of interest (ROIs), namely the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC), the contralateral premotor cortex (PMC) and the contralateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We estimated the effective connectivity between these ROIs using conditional Granger causality (GC) analysis determined from the time series signals measured by fMRI (blood oxygenation level-dependent-BOLD), fNIRS (oxygenated-O(2)Hb and deoxygenated-HHb hemoglobin), and EEG (scalp and source level analysis) neuroimaging modalities. The effective connectivity analysis showed significant bi-directional information flow between the SMC, PMC, and DLPFC as determined by the EEG (scalp and source), fMRI (BOLD) and fNIRS (O(2)Hb and HHb) modalities for all three motor tasks. However the source level EEG GC values were significantly greater than the other modalities. In addition, only the source level EEG showed a significantly greater forward than backward information flow between the ROIs. This simultaneous fMRI, fNIRS and EEG study has shown through independent GC analysis of the respective time series that a bi-directional effective connectivity occurs within a cortico-cortical sensorimotor network (SMC, PMC and DLPFC) during finger movement tasks.

The relationship of HFOs with seizures having different intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) morphological onsets, however, has shown significant relationships in experimental animals but has not been studied in humans. We investigated how interictal and ictal HFOs relate to different seizure-onset morphological patterns. Methods: We analyzed the most representative seizure type of 37 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent iEEG for diagnostic evaluation. According to the morphology, 211 seizure-onset zone channels were classified in six patterns (low-voltage fast activity; sharp activity at <= 13 Hz; low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spikes; burst of high-amplitude polyspikes; spike-and-wave activity; and delta brush). Interictal and ictal HFOs were compared between the six seizure-onset patterns. Results: Interictal ripple and fast ripple rates differed significantly across seizure-onset patterns (p < 0.001). Significant differences were also found for ictal HFOs density across the different seizure-onset patterns (p < 0.001). Sharp activity at <= 13 Hz was associated with the lowest interictal HFO rate suggesting either that the mechanism that generates this type of EEG morphology do not generate HFOs or possibly that this pattern is more likely to be generated in a region of seizure spread. Regarding the difference in HFO density between pre-ictal baseline and seizure-onset section across the six patterns, burst of high-amplitude polyspikes and delta brushes had the highest densities of both ripples and fast ripples (p < 0.001). Significance: We demonstrated that distinct seizure-onset patterns correlate specific interictal and ictal HFO profiles confirming that seizures with different morphological patterns likely have different mechanisms of generation. This study emphazises that, in clinical practice, seizure-onset patterns should be distinguished and specified when analyzing HFOs, particularly if they are used in presurgical evaluation to better localize the seizure-onset zone.

Three issues were addressed. 1) To what extent can early ERP components be described as transient evoked oscillations in specific frequency bands? 2) Total EEG power (TP) after a stimulus consists of pre-stimulus baseline power (BP), evoked power (EP), and induced power (IP), but what are their respective contributions? 3) The Phase Reset model proposes that BP predicts EP, while the evoked model holds that BP is unrelated to EP; which model is the most valid one? EEG results on NoGo trials for 123 individuals that took part in an experiment with emotional facial expressions were examined by computing ERPs and by performing wavelet analyses on the raw EEG and on ERPs. After performing several multiple regression analyses, we obtained the following answers. First, the P1, N1, and P2 components can by and large be described as transient oscillations in the alpha and theta bands. Secondly, it appears possible to estimate the separate contributions of EP, BP, and IP to TP, and importantly, the contribution of IP is mostly larger than that of EP. Finally, no strong support was obtained for either the Phase Reset or the Evoked model. Recent models are discussed that may better explain the relation between raw EEG and ERPs.

Decoding of task-relevant and task-irrelevant intracranial EEG representations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Intracranial EEG; Auditory perception; Multivariate analysis; Task-relevance	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; MODULATION; FMRI; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; STIMULI; OBJECTS	Natural stimuli consist of multiple properties. However, not all of these properties are equally relevant in a given situation. In this study, we applied multivariate classification algorithms to intracranial electroencephalography data of human epilepsy patients performing an auditory Stroop task. This allowed us to identify neuronal representations of task-relevant and irrelevant pitch and semantic information of spoken words in a subset of patients. When properties were relevant, representations could be detected after about 350 ms after stimulus onset. When irrelevant, the association with gamma power differed for these properties. Patients with more reliable representations of irrelevant pitch showed increased gamma band activity (35-64 Hz), suggesting that attentional resources allow an increase in gamma power in some but not all patients. This effect was not observed for irrelevant semantics, possibly because the more automatic processing of this property allowed for less variation in free resources. Processing of different properties of the same stimulus seems therefore to be dependent on the characteristics of the property. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[van de Nieuwenhuijzen, M.

Methods: In 11 infants with WS, ictal FOs were detected in a bipolar montage based on spectral and waveform criteria. Their temporal distribution was analyzed in terms of the positive peaks (trough point, TT) of identical EEG data in a referential montage. Among six EEG data sections defined according to TT, the number of FOs, peak power values, and peak frequencies were compared. Results: We identified a total of 1014 FOs (946 gamma and 68 ripple oscillations), which clustered closely at TT. The number of gamma oscillations in the 1 s epoch including TT was significantly higher than those in the prior and subsequent phases. Peak power values and frequencies tended to be higher in these positive phase sections. Conclusions: The temporal association of FO clustering and positive slow waves in the ictal EEGs of ES indicated that active neuronal firing related to FOs underlies the generation of ESs and their ictal slow waves.

Unpredicted Pitch Modulates Beta Oscillatory Power during Rhythmic Entrainment to a Tone Sequence	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						sensory prediction; beta band; EEG oscillations; rhythmic entrainment; pitch; attention; auditory cortex; oddball	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN; EEG-DATA; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION	Extracting temporal regularities in external stimuli in order to predict upcoming events is an essential aspect of perception. Fluctuations in induced power of beta band (15-25 Hz) oscillations in auditory cortex are involved in predictive timing during rhythmic entrainment, but whether such fluctuations are affected by prediction in the spectral (frequency/pitch) domain remains unclear. We tested whether unpredicted (i.e., unexpected) pitches in a rhythmic tone sequence modulate beta band activity by recording EEG while participants passively listened to isochronous auditory oddball sequences with occasional unpredicted deviant pitches at two different presentation rates. The results showed that the power in low-beta (15-20 Hz) was larger around 200-300 ms following deviant tones compared to standard tones, and this effect was larger when the deviant tones were less predicted. Our results suggest that the induced beta power activities in auditory cortex are consistent with a role in sensory prediction of both "when" (timing) upcoming sounds will occur as well as the prediction precision error of "what" (spectral content in this case). We suggest, further, that both timing and content predictions may co-modulate beta oscillations via attention. These findings extend earlier work on neural oscillations by investigating the functional significance of beta oscillations for sensory prediction. The findings help elucidate the functional significance of beta oscillations in perception.

Neural oscillations in Temporoparietal lobes under Inhibitory Control in a Naturalistic situation	2016 IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING (BIBE)	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)	OCT 31-NOV 02, 2016	Taichung, TAIWAN	IEEE, ASIA UNIV, MINIST EDUC, IEEE Comp Soc, Minist Sci & Technol		Stop signal task; Inhibitory control; electroencephalography (EEG); functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); preSMA; rTPJ	FMRI	The stop-signal paradigm has been commonly applied as a measure of inhibitory control due to its exclusive ability to capture theoretically important parameters related to the response inhibition. To observe the inhibitory function in realistic environmental settings, we designed a battlefield scenario (BFS), which is inspired by real condition like open fire between soldier and terrorist for saving civilian because terrorism is serious problem worldwide. The stop-signal task has been widely adopted as a way to parametrically quantify the response inhibition process. This study compared the response inhibition in two different scenarios: One used traditional simple visual symbols as go and stop signals i.e. symbol scenario (SBS), and the other translated the typical design into a battlefield scenario. The outcomes confirmed that both scenarios induced increased activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and pre supplementary motor area (preSMA), which have been associated to response inhibition. Particularly, in right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) we found both higher BOLD activation and EEG power modulation in the battlefield scenario than in the traditional scenario after the stop stimulus onset.

Methods: The maturational trend for sigma (11-15 Hz) power was evaluated in an accelerated longitudinal study of three overlapping age cohorts (n = 92) covering ages 6 to 18 y. Semiannually, sleep electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from participants sleeping at home in their normal sleep environment while keeping their current school night schedules. Results: Sigma frequencies became faster with age. The frequency of the 11-15 Hz spectral peak increased linearly. Sigma frequency power (SFP) declined with age, but its trajectory was complex (cubic). Power in a group of low sigma subfrequencies declined with age. Power in a group of high sigma frequencies increased with age. Power in subfrequencies within 11-15 Hz also showed different trends across the night, with lower frequencies increasing across NREM periods and higher frequencies decreasing across NREM periods. The upper and lower boundaries for the sigma frequencies that changed across NREMPs shifted upward with age. Conclusions: We hypothesize that these maturational brain changes result from synaptic elimination which decreases sleep depth and streamlines circuits. SFP displays a maturational trajectory different from both delta and theta power. Theories on the function of sigma must be reconciled with its maturational trajectory. These findings further demonstrate the value of sleep EEG for studying noninvasively the complex developmental brain changes of adolescence.

In the present study we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to directly assess the effects of cerebellar theta-burst stimulation (TBS) over the controlateral primary motor cortex (M1) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in a group of healthy volunteers. We found a TBS-dependent bidirectional modulation over TMS-evoked activity; specifically, cTBS increased whereas iTBS decreased activity between 100 and 200 ms after TMS, in a similar manner over both M1 and PPC areas. On the oscillatory domain, TBS induced specific changes over M1 natural frequencies of oscillation: TMS-evoked alpha activity was decreased by cTBS whereas beta activity was enhanced by iTBS. No effects were observed after sham stimulation. Our data provide novel evidence showing that the cerebellum exerts its control on the cortex likely by impinging on specific set of interneurons dependent on GABA-ergic activity. We show that cerebellar TBS modulates cortical excitability of distant interconnected cortical areas by acting through common temporal, spatial and frequency domains.

In this study, we evaluated the specific binding of TAK-063 using in vitro autoradiography (ARG) and the modulation of brain activity using pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). [H-3]TAK-063 significantly accumulated in the caudate-putamen (CPu), ventral pallidum (VP), substantia nigra (SN), hippocampus (Hipp), and amygdala (Amy), but not in the frontal cortex (Fcx), brainstem (Bs), or cerebellum (Cb) in an ARG study using rat brain sections. [H-3]TAK-063 accumulation in the CPu was more than eighteen-fold higher than that in the Hipp and Amy. TAK-063 at 0.3 mg/kg increased the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the striatum and Amy, and decreased it in the Fcx in a phMRl study with anesthetized rats. TAK-063 at 0.3 mg/kg significantly reduced the ketamine-induced increase in EEG gamma power both in awake and anesthetized rats. TAK-063 at 0.2 mg/kg (35% PDE10A occupancy in monkeys) also reduced the ketamine-induced increase in EEG gamma power in awake monkeys. In line with the EEG data, TAK-063 at 0.3 mg/kg reversed the ketamine-induced BOLD signal changes in the cortex, Bs, and Cb in a phMRI study with anesthetized rats. These data suggest that TAK-063 at about 30% PDE10A occupancy modulates activities of multiple brain regions through activation of neuronal circuits in rats and monkeys. (C) 2016 IBRO.

In the present work, we studied two CGE-FoS epileptic patients with simultaneous EEG-fMRI. We aim to identify brain areas that are specifically related to the pathology by identifying the brain networks that are related to the EEG brain altered rhythms. Three main analyses were performed: EEG standalone, where the voltage fluctuations in delta, alpha, and beta EEG bands were obtained; fMRI standalone, where resting-state fMRI ICA analyses for opened and closed eyes conditions were computed per subject; and, EEG-informed fMRI, where EEG delta, alpha and beta oscillations were used to analyze fMRI. Patient 1 showed EEG abnormalities for lower beta band EEG brain rhythm. Fluctuations of this rhythm were correlated with a brain network mainly composed by temporo-frontal areas only found in the closed eyes condition. Patient 2 presented alterations in all the EEG brain rhythms (delta, alpha, beta) under study when closing eyes. Several biologically relevant brain networks highly correlated (r>0.7) to each other in the closed eyes condition were found. EEG-informed fMRI results in patient 2 showed hypersynchronized patterns in the fMRI correlation spatial maps. The obtained findings allow a differential diagnosis for each patient and different profiles with respect to healthy volunteers. The results suggest a different disruption in the functional brain networks of these patients that depends on their altered brain rhythms. This knowledge could be used to treat these patients by novel brain stimulation approaches targeting specific altered brain networks in each patient.

Among others, reduced brain oxygenation accounts for neurological adverse outcomes after CPB. The aim of the present study was to ascertain if and how continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) during CPB is affected by hematocrit level and what should be the minimum value to avoid significant frequency band shifts on the EEG. A comparative study design was used with 16 subjects undergoing elective mitral valve repair/replacement. EEG was continuously recorded during the surgical procedure (from anesthesia induction to 20 min after CPB end). Data were marked at relevant time points (T-0: before CPB start; T-1: after 30 min from CPB beginning; T-2: at CPB end), and the following 2 min EEG analyzed with a fast Fourier transform to obtain relative power for delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. A general linear model for repeated measure was used to study interactions of time (T-0, T-1, and T-2), EEG frequency band, and topographical distribution. The relative powers for each electrode were calculated and represented using topographic maps. Power spectrum differences between time points (T-2-T-1; T-2-T-0; T-1-T-0) were calculated for each electrode, and differences > 10%, considered indicative of neuronal sufferance, were included in further analysis. Cutoff hemoglobin values that maximize the proportion of correctly classified EEG band shifts were obtained by previous definition were obtained. At T-2, diffuse EEG slowing in delta and theta bands was detected; a minor slowing over anterior regions was evident at T-1 for the theta band. Decrements in EEG power greater than 10% were detected only for the delta band at T-2. Hemoglobin concentration levels at which no slowing increase was evident were 9.4 mg/dL (Ht: 28.2%) at T-1 and 9.2 mg/dL (Ht: 27.6%) at T-2. EEG burst-suppression pattern related to a lesser degree of slowing at T-2. In conclusion, we propose hemoglobin cutoff levels that prevent EEG slowing indicative of neuronal sufferance. In addition, burst-suppression EEG patterns offer higher central nervous system protection as measured on EEG.

Multi-channel EEG was recorded in 20 younger (mean = 24.65-year-old, 10 male) and 20 middle-aged participants (mean = 46.40-year-old, 10 male) during performance of a Sternberg task. EEG power and coherence measures were analyzed in different frequency bands. Significant interactions emerged between age and gender in memory performance and concomitant EEG parameters, suggesting that the aging process differentially influences men and women. Middle-aged women showed a lower short-term memory performance compared to young women, which was accompanied by decreasing delta and theta power and increasing brain connectivity with age in women. In contrast, men showed no age-related decline in short-term memory performance and no changes in EEG parameters. These results provide first evidence of age-related alterations in EEG activity underlying memory processes, which were already evident in the middle years of life in women but not in men.

Ictal and interictal findings are evaluated in light of findings from cortical stimulation of eloquent cortex to determine the area of resection. Patients and methods: Patients with ICEEG electrodes and subsequent surgical resection were retrospectively identified. Only the first 15 s of ictal activity, which was divided into five 3-s epochs, was considered. Every electrode in each patient was considered a separate observation in a logistic regression model to predict whether the cortex under a given electrode was included in the planned resection. Results: 19 included patients had a total of 37 unique seizures. Recordings from a total of 1306 electrodes were analyzed. The strongest predictors of resection of cortex underlying a given electrode was the presence of low-voltage fast activity in Epoch 1, rhythmic spikes in Epoch 1, interictal paroxysmal fast activity, and low-voltage fast activity in Epoch 2. High-amplitude beta spikes and rhythmic slow waves were also significant predictors in Epoch I. Interictal spikes had a higher odds ratio of affecting the planned resection if described as "continuous" or "very frequent". The presence of motor or language cortex were the strongest negative predictors of resecting underlying cortex. Conclusions: Here we describe a novel model of ictal and interictal patterns significantly associated with the inclusion of cortex underlying a given ICEEG electrode in the surgical resection plan.

Role of Alpha-Band Oscillations in Spatial Updating across Whole Body Motion	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						parietal cortex; oscillations; visual stability; self-motion; vestibular; electroencephalography	HUMAN PARIETAL CORTEX; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL SPACE; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; EYE-MOVEMENTS; MAINTENANCE; SUPPRESSION; INCREASES; EEG	When moving around in the world, we have to keep track of important locations in our surroundings. In this process, called spatial updating, we must estimate our body motion and correct representations of memorized spatial locations in accordance with this motion. While the behavioral characteristics of spatial updating across whole body motion have been studied in detail, its neural implementation lacks detailed study. Here we use electroencephalography (EEG) to distinguish various spectral components of this process. Subjects gazed at a central body-fixed point in otherwise complete darkness, while a target was briefly flashed, either left or right from this point. Subjects had to remember the location of this target as either moving along with the body or remaining fixed in the world while being translated sideways on a passive motion platform. After the motion, subjects had to indicate the remembered target location in the instructed reference frame using a mouse response. While the body motion, as detected by the vestibular system, should not affect the representation of body-fixed targets, it should interact with the representation of a world-centered target to update its location relative to the body. We show that the initial presentation of the visual target induced a reduction of alpha band power in contralateral parieto-occipital areas, which evolved to a sustained increase during the subsequent memory period. Motion of the body led to a reduction of alpha band power in central parietal areas extending to lateralparieto-temporal areas, irrespective of whether the targets had to be memorized relative to world or body. When updating a world-fixed target, its internal representation shifts hemispheres, only when subjects' behavioral responses suggested an update across the body midline. Our results suggest that parietal cortex is involved in both self-motion estimation and the selective application of this motion information to maintaining target locations as fixed in the world or fixed to the body.

NONLINEAR INTERACTIONS IN THE THALAMOCORTICAL LOOP IN ESSENTIAL TREMOR: A MODEL-BASED FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						nonlinear modeling; spectral analysis; coherence; EEG; local field potentials; essential tremor	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS; CORRELATED CORTICAL ACTIVITY; CEREBELLAR THALAMUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; TIME-SERIES; COHERENCE; CORTEX	There is increasing evidence to suggest that essential tremor has a central origin. Different structures appear to be part of the central tremorogenic network, including the motor cortex, the thalamus and the cerebellum. Some studies using electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) show linear association in the tremor frequency between the motor cortex and the contralateral tremor electromyography (EMG). Additionally, high thalamomuscular coherence is found with the use of thalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings and tremulous EMG in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Despite a well-established reciprocal anatomical connection between the thalamus and cortex, the functional association between the two structures during "tremor-on" periods remains elusive. Thalamic (Vim) LFPs, ipsilateral scalp EEG from the sensorimotor cortex and contralateral tremor arm EMG recordings were obtained from two patients with essential tremor who had undergone successful surgery for DBS. Coherence analysis shows a strong linear association between thalamic LFPs and contralateral tremor EMG, but the relationship between the EEG and the thalamus is much less clear. These measurements were then analyzed by constructing a novel parametric nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) model. This new approach uncovered two distinct and not overlapping frequency "channels" of communication between Vim thalamus and the ipsilateral motor cortex, defining robustly "tremor-on" versus "tremor-off" states. The associated estimated nonlinear time lags also showed non-overlapping values between the two states, with longer corticothalamic lags (exceeding 50 ms) in the tremor active state, suggesting involvement of an indirect multisynaptic loop. The results reveal the importance of the nonlinear interactions between cortical and subcortical areas in the central motor network of essential tremor. This work is important because it demonstrates for the first time that in essential tremor the functional interrelationships between the cortex and thalamus should not be sought exclusively within individual frequencies but more importantly between cross-frequency nonlinear interactions. Should our results be successfully reproduced on a bigger cohort of patients with essential tremor, our approach could be used to create an on-demand closed-loop DBS device, able to automatically activate when the tremor is on.

Previous work showed that motor memory seems to rely on different memory components (e.g., implicit, explicit). However, it is still unknown if explicit components contribute to the retrieval of motor memories formed by dynamic adaptation tasks and which neural correlates are linked to memory retrieval. We investigated the lower and higher gamma bands of subjects' electroencephalography during encoding and retrieval of a dynamic adaptation task. A total of 24 subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment and control group. Both groups adapted to a force field A on day 1 and were re-exposed to the same force field A on day 3 of the experiment. On day 2, treatment group learned an interfering force field B whereas control group had a day rest. Kinematic analyses showed that control group improved their initial motor performance from day 1 to day 3 but treatment group did not. This behavioral result coincided with an increased higher gamma band power in the electrodes over prefrontal areas on the initial trials of day 3 for control but not treatment group. Intriguingly, this effect vanished with the subsequent re-adaptation on day 3. We suggest that improved re-test performance in a dynamic motor adaptation task is contributed by explicit memory and that gamma bands in the electrodes over the prefrontal cortex are linked to these explicit components. Furthermore, we suggest that the contribution of explicit memory vanishes with the subsequent re-adaptation while task automaticity increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The transition from the ether anesthetic to nitrous oxide is associated with a switch in the putative mechanisms and sites of anesthetic action. We investigated whether there is an electroencephalogram (EEG) marker of this transition. Methods: We retrospectively studied the ether anesthetic to nitrous oxide transition in 19 patients with EEG monitoring receiving general anesthesia using the ether anesthetic sevoflurane combined with oxygen and air. Results: Following the transition to nitrous oxide, the alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations associated with sevoflurane dissipated within 3-12 min (median 6 min) and were replaced by highly coherent large-amplitude slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations that persisted for 2-12 min (median 3 min). Conclusions: Administration of high-dose nitrous oxide is associated with transient, large amplitude slow-delta oscillations. Significance: We postulate that these slow-delta oscillations may result from nitrous oxide-induced blockade of major excitatory inputs (NMDA glutamate projections) from the brainstem (parabrachial nucleus and medial pontine reticular formation) to the thalamus and cortex. This EEG signature of high-dose nitrous oxide may offer new insights into brain states during general anesthesia. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Recent work has demonstrated ictal ISA to be more widespread in expression than originally understood. Analysis of ISA by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) may help to clarify its localizing value, namely the focal versus widespread expression of ISA. Methods: The ictal SEEG records for fifteen consecutive adult patients were retrospectively analyzed, using both conventional (1.6-70 Hz) and infraslow (0.01-0.1 Hz) bandpass filters. When justified, seizures were averaged in the infraslow band to clarify their stereotypy. Wavelets were used to quantify the time-frequency characteristics of ISA. Results: All clinical seizures were found to possess ISA, and this was markedly invariant across seizures in a given patient. ISA showed biphasic peaks in power, both at ictal onset and offset, with this most prominent in the anatomical structures implicated by conventional analysis. In addition, ISA demonstrated an association with low voltage fast activity, and possessed a more restricted field than conventional activity. Conclusions: ISA is both widespread (anatomically distributed) and focal (closed electric field). Seizures possess an infraslow spatiotemporal signature. Significance: Beyond representing a "focus'' of paroxysmal activity, ISA must arise from a network process as a component of wideband ictal dynamics. How this relates to clinical definition of the epileptogenic zone requires further study. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The goal of this study was to characterize these parameters of a new rat substrain showing several alterations related to schizophrenia. Methods: Male rats of the new substrain, developed by selective breeding after combined subchronic ketamine treatment and postweaning social isolation, and naive Wistar ones group-housed without any interventions were involved in the present study. At the age of 3 months, animals were implanted with cortical electroencephalography electrodes. Auditory evoked potentials during paired-click stimuli and power of oscillation in different frequency bands were determined with and without acute ketamine (20 mg/kg) treatment. Results: Regarding the auditory evoked potentials, the latency of P2 was delayed and the amplitude of N1 peak was lower in the new substrain. The new substrain showed increased power of oscillations in the theta, alpha and beta bands, while decreased power was detected in delta and gamma2 bands (52-70 Hz) compared with control animals. Acute ketamine treatment increased the gamma1 band (30-48 Hz) power in both groups, while it elicited significant changes only in the new substrain in the total power and in alpha, beta and gamma2 bands. Conclusions: The validation of the translational utility of this new rat substrain by electrophysiological investigations revealed that these rats show abnormalities that may model a part of the neurophysiological deficits observed in schizophrenia.

Fast fMRI can detect oscillatory neural activity in humans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						oscillations; hemodynamics; imaging; BOLD	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; BOLD FMRI; BALLOON MODEL; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN ACTIVATION; IMPULSE-RESPONSE; SLOW WAVES	Oscillatory neural dynamics play an important role in the coordination of large-scale brain networks. High-level cognitive processes depend on dynamics evolving over hundreds of milliseconds, so measuring neural activity in this frequency range is important for cognitive neuroscience. However, current noninvasive neuroimaging methods are not able to precisely localize oscillatory neural activity above 0.2 Hz. Electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography have limited spatial resolution, whereas fMRI has limited temporal resolution because it measures vascular responses rather than directly recording neural activity. We hypothesized that the recent development of fast fMRI techniques, combined with the extra sensitivity afforded by ultra-high-field systems, could enable precise localization of neural oscillations. We tested whether fMRI can detect neural oscillations using human visual cortex as a model system. We detected small oscillatory fMRI signals in response to stimuli oscillating at up to 0.75 Hz within single scan sessions, and these responses were an order of magnitude larger than predicted by canonical linear models. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI and simulations based on a biophysical model of the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity suggested that the blood oxygen level-dependent response becomes faster for rapidly varying stimuli, enabling the detection of higher frequencies than expected. Accounting for phase delays across voxels further improved detection, demonstrating that identifying vascular delays will be of increasing importance with higher-frequency activity. These results challenge the assumption that the hemodynamic response is slow, and demonstrate that fMRI has the potential to map neural oscillations directly throughout the brain.

Objective: To investigate the effects of theta transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied to the frontal cortex on reversal learning. Methods: Healthy volunteers participated in a sham-controlled between subjects design. TACS at 1 mA peak-to-peak was administered during a reward-punishment reversal learning task. Resting state EEG was measured before and after tACS and the task. Results: Active tACS improved learning ability, but at the same time interfered with applying the rule to optimize behavior. Furthermore, a significant decrease in frontal theta-beta EEG ratios was observed following active tACS.

Patients with schizophrenia (ScZ) often experience a loss of coherent perception and hence, they might also show dysfunctional multisensory processing. In this high-density electroencephalography study, we investigated the neural signatures of the McGurk illusion, as a phenomenon of speech-specific multisensory processing. In the McGurk illusion lip movements are paired with incongruent auditory syllables, which can induce a fused percept. In ScZ patients and healthy controls we compared neural oscillations and event-related potentials (ERPs) to congruent audiovisual speech stimuli and McGurk illusion trials, where a visual /ga/ and an auditory /pa/ was often perceived as /ka/. There were no significant group differences in illusion rates. The EEG data analysis revealed larger short latency ERPs to McGurk illusion compared with congruent trials in controls. The reversed effect pattern was found in ScZ patients, indicating an early audiovisual processing deficit. Moreover, we observed stronger suppression of medio-central alpha-band power (810 Hz, 550-700 ms) in response to McGurk illusion compared with control trials in the control group. Again, the reversed pattern was found in SCZ patients. Moreover, within groups, alpha-band suppression was negatively correlated with the McGurk illusion rate in ScZ patients, while the correlation tended to be positive in controls. The topography of alpha-band effects indicated an involvement of auditory and/or frontal structures. Our study suggests that short latency ERPs and long latency alpha-band oscillations reflect abnormal multisensory processing of the McGurk illusion in ScZ.

Flicker Regularity Is Crucial for Entrainment of Alpha Oscillations	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; entrainment; alpha; flicker; SSVEP; oscillations; visual perception	VISUAL-STIMULATION; DISCRIMINATION PERFORMANCE; TEMPORAL EXPECTATION; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; EEG ALPHA; TOP-DOWN; ATTENTION; INHIBITION; TOOLBOX; CORTEX	Previous studies have shown that alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in human electroencephalogram (EEG) modulate perception via phase-dependent inhibition. If entrained to an external driving force, inhibition maxima and minima of the oscillation appear more distinct in time and make potential phase-dependent perception predictable. There is an ongoing debate about whether visual stimulation is suitable to entrain alpha oscillations. On the one hand, it has been argued that a series of light flashes results in transient event-related responses (ERPs) superimposed on the ongoing EEG. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that alpha oscillations become entrained to a series of light flashes if they are presented at a certain temporal regularity. This raises the question under which circumstances a sequence of light flashes causes entrainment, i.e., whether an arrhythmic stream of light flashes would also result in entrainment. Here, we measured detection rates in response to visual targets at two opposing stimulation phases during rhythmic and arrhythmic light stimulation. We introduce a new measure called "behavioral modulation depth" to determine differences in perception. This measure is capable of correcting for inevitable artifacts that occur in visual detection tasks during visual stimulation. The physical concept of entrainment predicts that increased stimulation intensity should produce stronger entrainment. Thus, two experiments with medium (Experiment 1) and high (Experiment 2) stimulation intensity were performed. Data from the first experiment show that the behavioral modulation depth (alpha phase-dependent differences in detection threshold) increases with increasing entrainment of alpha oscillations. Furthermore, individual alpha phase delays of entrained alpha oscillations determine the behavioral modulation depth: the largest behavioral modulation depth can be found if targets presented during the minimum of the entrained oscillation are compared to those presented during the maximum. In the second experiment stimulation with higher light intensity during both rhythmic and arrhythmic stimulation lead to an increased behavioral modulation depth, supposedly as a consequence of stronger entrainment during rhythmic stimulation. Altogether, our results reveal evidence for rhythmic and arrhythmic visual stimulation to induce fundamentally different processes in the brain: we suggest that rhythmic but not arrhythmic stimulation interacts with ongoing alpha oscillations via entrainment.

An emerging view is that neuronal oscillations coordinate the cellular assemblies that code the content of WM. In line with this view, previous work has demonstrated that oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) plays a role in WM maintenance, but the exact contributions of this activity have remained unclear. Here, we used an inverted spatial encoding model in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) to test whether the topographic distribution of alpha-band activity tracks spatial representations held in WM. Participants in three experiments performed spatial WM tasks that required them to remember the precise angular location of a sample stimulus for 1,000-1,750 ms. Across all three experiments, we found that the topographic distribution of alpha-band activity tracked the specific location that was held in WM. Evoked (i.e., activity phase-locked to stimulus onset) and total (i.e., activity regardless of phase) power across a range of low-frequency bands transiently tracked the location of the sample stimulus following stimulus onset. However, only total power in the alpha band tracked the content of spatial WM throughout the memory delay period, which enabled reconstruction of location-selective channel tuning functions (CTFs). These findings demonstrate that alpha-band activity is directly related to the coding of spatial representations held in WM and provide a promising method for tracking the content of this online memory system.

Electroencephalographically-indexed alterations in baseline neural oscillations by nicotine have previously been reported in both smokers and non-smokers, however, little is known about the effects of MAO inhibition in combination with nicotine on resting state EEG. In a sample of 24 healthy non-smoking males, the effects of 6 mg nicotine gum, as well as MAO-A inhibition via 75 mg moclobemide, were investigated in separate and combined conditions over four separate test sessions. Drug effects were observed in the alpha(2), beta(2), and theta band frequencies. Nicotine increased alpha(2) power, and moclobemide decreased beta(2) power. Theta power was decreased most robustly by the combination of both drugs. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the nicotinic and MAO inhibiting properties of tobacco may differentially influence fast-wave oscillations (alpha(2) and beta(2)), while acting in synergy to influence theta oscillations.

Performance analysis of a DRL-less AFE for battery-powered wearable EEG	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Bioelectric circuit; Driven-right-leg (DRL); Power-line interference; Modular EEG; Wearable EEG	INTERFERENCE	The driven-right-leg (DRL) circuit has been commonly used in the wall-powered EEG systems to reduce common-mode interference in the bio-potential amplifier. However, DRL circuit imposes limitations on the number of channels preventing modular development, and its effectiveness is diminished for a newer generation of battery-powered EEG systems. We present a performance investigation of DRL-less EEG circuit by designing a single-channel EEG with a novel Analog Front End (AFE) that contains a differential amplifier followed by a high-Q active notch filter. The prototyped wearable EEG system has been validated to record neural signals with and without the DRL circuit. The time domain and frequency domain signals show that the designed AFE is not impacted significantly (maximum 4 dB difference) by the DRL elimination and maintains similar signal quality. The customized EEG with and without DRL offers CMRR of 72.98 dB and 71.74 dB, respectively, at 60 Hz (power-line interference range in the USA), whereas CMRR of 72.64 dB and 71.01 dB, respectively, at 20 Hz (representative EEG signal range). DRL elimination allows us to envision a sensor-level modular EEG system for neural monitoring in non-clinical environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: We automatically detected HFOs in intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of 45 patients. We characterized the interaction between the HFOs and the amplitude and phase of automatically detected slow waves during sleep. We computed features associated with HFOs, and compared classic features such as rate, amplitude, duration, and frequency to novel features related to the interaction between HFOs and slow waves. To quantify the practical significance of the difference in these features we classified the channels as recording from normal/epileptic regions using logistic regression. We assessed the results in different brain regions to study differences in the HFO characteristics at the lobar level. Results: We found a clear difference in the coupling between the phase of slow waves during sleep and the occurrence of HFOs. In channels recording physiologic activity, the HFOs tend to occur after the peak of the deactivated state of the slow wave, and in channels with epileptic activity, the HFOs occur more often before this peak. This holds for HFOs in the ripple (80-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-500 Hz) bands, and different regions of the brain. When using this interaction to automatically classify channels as recording from normal/epileptic brain regions, the performance is better than when using other HFO characteristics. We confirmed differences in the HFO characteristics in mesiotemporal structures and in the occipital lobe. Significance: We found the association between slow waves and HFOs to be different in normal and epileptic brain regions, emphasizing their different origin. This is also of practical significance, since it improves the separation between channels recording from normal and epileptic brain regions.

Graph analysis of EEG resting state functional networks in dyslexic readers	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Functional connectivity; Network; Graph theory; Minimum spanning tree; Dyslexia	MINIMUM SPANNING TREE; COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; FMRI CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL SYSTEMS; CHILDREN; TASK; ORGANIZATION; DISRUPTION; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Neuroimaging research suggested a mixed pattern of functional connectivity abnormalities in developmental dyslexia. We examined differences in the topological properties of functional networks between 29 dyslexics and 15 typically reading controls in 3rd grade using graph analysis. Graph metrics characterize brain networks in terms of integration and segregation. Method: We used EEG resting-state data and calculated weighted connectivity matrices for multiple frequency bands using the phase lag index (PLI). From the connectivity matrices we derived minimum spanning tree (MST) graphs representing the sub-networks with maximum connectivity. Statistical analyses were performed on graph-derived metrics as well as on the averaged PLI connectivity values. Results: We found group differences in the theta band for two graph metrics suggesting reduced network integration and communication between network nodes in dyslexics compared to controls. Conclusion: Collectively, our findings point to a less efficient network configuration in dyslexics relative to the more proficient configuration in the control group. Significance: Graph metrics relate to the intrinsic organization of functional brain networks. These metrics provide additional insights on the cognitive deficits underlying dyslexia and, thus, may advance our knowledge on reading development. Our findings add to the growing body literature suggesting compromised networks rather than specific dysfunctional brain regions in dyslexia.

The secondary goal was to compare the EEG signal complexity values for monochords with those for progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), an alternative therapy for relaxation. Forty cancer patients were randomly allocated to one of the two relaxation groups, MC and PMR, over a period of six months; continuous EEG signals were recorded during the first and last sessions. EEG signals were analyzed by applying signal mode complexity, a measure of complexity of neuronal oscillations. Across sessions, both groups showed a modulation of complexity of beta-2 band (20-29 Hz) at midfrontal regions, but only MC group showed a modulation of complexity of theta band (3.5-7.5 Hz) at posterior regions. Therefore, the neuronal complexity patterns showed different changes in EEG frequency band specific complexity resulting in two different types of interventions. Moreover, the different neural responses to listening to monochords and PMR were observed after regular relaxation interventions over a short time span.

The combination of TAES and anesthesia has been proved valid in enhancing the anesthetic effects but its mechanisms are still not clear. Methods: In this study, we investigated the effect of TAES on anesthesia with an electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillation analysis on surgery patients anesthetized with propofol, a widely-used anesthetic in clinical practice. EEG was continuously recorded during light and deep propofol sedation (target-controlled infusion set at 1.0 and 3.0 mu g/mL) in ten surgery patients with pituitary tumor excision. Each concentration of propofol was maintained for 6 min and TAES was given at 2-4 min. The changes in EEG power spectrum at different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and the coherence of different EEG channels were analyzed. Results: Our result showed that, after TAES application, the EEG power increased at alpha and beta bands in light sedation of propofol, but reduced at delta and beta bands in deep propofol sedation (p < 0.001). In addition, the EEG oscillation analysis showed an enhancement of synchronization at low frequencies and a decline in synchronization at high frequencies between different EEG channels in either light or deep propofol sedation. Conclusions: Our study showed evidence suggested that TAES may have different effects on propofol under light and deep sedation. TAES could enhance the sedative effect of propofol at low concentration but reduce the sedative effect of propofol at high concentration.

In addition, some potentials occur depending on receptor activations during the stimulated state. The aim of this study is to investigate bioelectrical changes of the brain against taste stimuli. Bioelectrical changes were recorded and measured objectively via electroencephalograhpy (EEG). Five healthy volunteers (2 females; mean age: 24.6 years) participated to the study. Current study was conducted in Dokuz Eylul University Biophysics Department, Five Senses Laboratory. Taste stimuli were delivered via Gustometer (Burghart MT, Germany). These tastes were bitter, sour, sweet, salty, and umami. As a result of EEG data analysis amplitude-time graphs were obtained for all participants. Continuous wavelet transform was applied to brain responses to taste stimuli for detailed analysis. These responses were investigated on scalogram. The highest peak to peak maximum amplitude value was measured on sour taste (11.46 mu V). The aim of the future studies is to topologically demonstrate the brain responsiveness to jive basic taste, and also to make contributions to literature about the activations in frequency time domain.

The suitability of the NIG probability distribution function is illustrated using statistical measures. A support vector machine is employed as the classifier of the EEG signals, wherein the NIG parameters are used as features. The performance of the proposed method is studied using a publicly available benchmark EEG database for various classification cases that include healthy, inter-ictal (seizure-free interval) and ictal (seizure), non-seizure and seizure, healthy and seizure, and inter-ictal and ictal, and compared with that of several recent methods. It is shown that in almost all the cases, the proposed method can provide 100 % accuracy with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity while being faster as compared to the time-frequency analysis-based and EMD techniques.

Data-Driven Multimodal Sleep Apnea Events Detection	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						EEG; Sleep apnea semantic interpretation; Data-driven biomedical data processing; Bio-inspired data processing; Semantic biomedical data interpretation	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; BRAIN COMPUTER-INTERFACE; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; EEG; SEPARATION	A novel multimodal and bio-inspired approach to biomedical signal processing and classification is presented in the paper. This approach allows for an automatic semantic labeling (interpretation) of sleep apnea events based the proposed data-driven biomedical signal processing and classification. The presented signal processing and classification methods have been already successfully applied to real-time unimodal brainwaves (EEG only) decoding in brain-computer interfaces developed by the author. In the current project the very encouraging results are obtained using multimodal biomedical (brainwaves and peripheral physiological) signals in a unified processing approach allowing for the automatic semantic data description. The results thus support a hypothesis of the data-driven and bio-inspired signal processing approach validity for medical data semantic interpretation based on the sleep apnea events machine-learning-related classification.

The bio-detection uses the Ag/Ag-Cl electrode sensor to extract the head skin's micro EEG signal, and uses the differential chopper-LNA circuit to cancel the 1/f, dc-offset voltage and other noises. On one hand, the hardware accelerator uses the STFT(short time fourier transform) multiple filtering channels and the HT(hilbert transform) method, for decomposing the instant amplitude envelop and instant frequency of each sub-channel. On the other hand, when the detected SI(sleepiness indicator) signal triggers the minimum 3-stage CPU, the software thread uses the HHT(hilbert huang transform) method to get the IMF(intrinsic mode function) components from the non-statistical and non-stable EEG signal, then the design executes the Tsallis entropy complexity analysis with the pipeline CPU, which consumes about 20pJ/instruction. The transmitter uses ping/pang switching matrix, the burst TD-OFDM (time division-orthogonal frequency division multiplex) scheme and the power-adaptation algorithm to give a balance design between the frequency utility and the energy consumption. To increase the throughput and to decrease power consumption mostly caused by the wireless channel's idle CS (carrier sensing) operation, the channel wake-upping/monitoring and the data transmitting/receiving circuits are separated, which reduces the energy consumption by about 30x The design uses one-hop star topology to compose the reduced network architecture. Also, the design mainly uses the CG (clock gating) and PG (power gating) methods to decrease the chip's dynamic and leakage energy consumption respectively.

An experiment was conducted to record neural activity and facial micro-expressions of participants while they are looking at pictures stimuli from the IAPS (International Affective Picture System). Camera-based facial expression detection software (FACET) was used to assess facial micro-expressions of a participant with high accuracy. Machine learning algorithm was fed with time-domain and frequency-domain features of one second EEG signals with the corresponding facial expression data as ground truth in the training phase. The classifier provides outputs representing facial emotional reactions dynamics in fully automatic and non-intrusive way without the need to a camera.

Although the neural responses to felt and observed tactile stimuli between an inanimate object and a part of the human body have been vastly explored, the neural responses to observed human interaction involving touch are not well understood. Considering that the observation of social touch involves vicarious sharing of emotions, we hypothesized that levels of empathic traits modulate the neural responses to observed touch and focused on the attenuation in the mu\alpha rhythm (8-13Hz), a neural marker that has been related to sensorimotor resonance. Fifty-four participants observed photos depicting social touch, nonsocial touch, or no touch while their electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded. Results showed that interindividual differences in levels of empathic traits modulated both behavioral and electrophysiological responses to human social touch, such that highly empathic participants evaluated human social touch as inducing more pleasant emotions and exhibited greater mu suppression upon observation of human social touch compared to less empathic participants. Specifically, both the behavioral and the electrophysiological responses to observed social touch were predicted by levels of personal distress, a measure of emotional contagion. These findings indicate that the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to observed social touch are modulated by levels of empathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cortical and hippocampal atrophy supports early diagnosis of AD in MCI subjects, while frontal event-related oscillations (EROS) at delta frequencies (<4 Hz) are appealing markers for this purpose, as they are both cost-effective and largely available. The present study tested the hypothesis that these EROs reflect cortical frontal neurodegeneration in the continuum between normal and amnesic MCI subjects. EROs and volumetric MRI data were recorded in 28 amnesic MCI and in 28 healthy elderly controls (HCs). EROs were collected during a standard visual oddball paradigm including frequent (66.6%) and rare (33.3%; targets to be mentally counted) stimuli. Peak-to-peak amplitude of delta target EROs (<4 Hz) was measured. Volume of frontal cortex was estimated from MRIs. Frontal volume was lower in MCI compared to the HC group. Furthermore, widespread delta target EROs were lower in amplitude in the former than in the latter group. Finally, there was a positive correlation between frontal volume and frontal delta target EROs in MCI and HC subjects as a whole group. These results suggest that frontal delta EROs reflect frontal neurodegeneration in the continuum between normal and amnesic MCI subjects. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Case, JL; Arruda, JE; VanWormer, LA				Case, Jason L.; Arruda, James E.; VanWormer, Lisa A.			Modeling cyclic variations in sustained human performance as measured by reaction time and the flash visual evoked potential-P2	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Arousal; Attention; EEG; Oscillation/time frequency analyses	CORTICAL ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; RHYTHMIC OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS; ATTENTION; CORTEX; MODULATION; CAT; SELECTIVITY; HANDEDNESS	Recent research suggests that sustained attention is punctuated by periodic lapses that produce cyclic variations in sustained human performance. Research conducted by our laboratory (Arruda, Zhang, Amoss, Coburn, & Aue, 2009) and by the laboratories of others (Aue, Arruda, Mass, & Stanny, 2009; Smith, Valentino, & Arruda, 2003) suggests that sustained human performance cycles approximately every 1.5 and 5.2 min. Further, it has been suggested that a norepinephrine based arousal system may be responsible for these variations. Unfortunately, both cholinergic and noradrenergic pathways are known to mediate attention and it is unclear from previous research whether one or both of the identified cycles is related to cholinergic functioning. Consequently, the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the validity of the 1.5 and the 5.2 min cycles using both reaction time and a cortical marker of cholinergic activity the flash visual evoked potential P2 (FVEP-P2). Twenty-seven participants performed a 15-min continuous performance task. A spectral analysis procedure was used to detect the prevalence of the 1.5 and 5.2 min cycles in both performance and cortical activity. While the results of these analyses support the validity of the 1.5 and 52 min cycles in sustained human performance, only the 52 min cycle was detected in cortical activity (i.e., the FVEP-P2 amplitudes) using model fitting. Consequently, the results of the present investigation support the validity of the 1.5 and 5.2 min cycles and extend the findings of previous research by implicating acetylcholine in the 5.2 min cycle.

However, psychophysiological basis of EI and it's interconnection with progress in studying process is still actual. EI components reflects the ability to regulate the emotions. Ability to regulate the emotions and to be involved emotionally is effective strategy of achievements in educational process. Purpose of present research is EEG study of EI among adolescents and it's interrelation with their achievements in educational process. Following methods were used: 1) TMMS questionnaire for EI; 2) EEG - electroencephalography Neuron Spectrum-1; 3) Grade Point Average (GPA) information was used as an indicator of educational achievement of the paricipants. As a result, present study showed that the reappraisal strategy of emotional regulation (by J. Gross, 2002), during educational task is significantly correlated with the scales of TMMS questionnaire (attention to emotion 0.185** and repair 0.237**), which reflects in left frontal gamma rhythm activation. In addition, theta rhythm well known as "emotional rhythm" has positive correlation with repair scale 0.239**. The effective emotional regulation strategy during educational process could lead the adolescents for better progress in their studies by using the emotions as major source of information. EI could be a predictor of success in perception and mastering the educational information, which supported by activity of left frontal gamma rhythm and theta rhythm oscillations.

DNA samples extracted from cheek swabs and resting-state EEG recorded at 60 standard leads were collected from young (YW, N = 86, 18-35 years) and older (OW, N = 45; 55-80 years) healthy women. We have shown that advanced age was associated with increased posterior EEG desynchronization in S'/S'. S' (LG allele was grouped with S alleles owing to its functional equivalence and this group was labeled as S') genotype carriers denoted by decrease of delta - beta1 current source density, and to a lesser extent in L/L homozygotes denoted by decrease in delta activity. In heterozygotes OW, as compared with heterozygotes YW, higher source density estimates of betal in frontal and temporal cortex were observed. Age differences were more pronounced in the right hemisphere in S'/S' and L/L carriers and in the left hemisphere in heterozygotes. We also found that in OW, current source density estimates of theta, alphal, alpha2, alpha3 and betal sources in the right occipital lobe were higher in S'/L than in S'/S' carriers. These results may have implications for understanding 5-HTT-dependent variation in the effect of aging on brain activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Default mode network (DMN), is a functional connection of brain regions that are activated while subjects are not in task positive state or not focused on the outside world. In this study, EEG was used for human brain signals recording while all subjects were asked to sit down quietly on a chair with eyes closed and thinking about some parts of their own body, such as left and right hands, left and right ears, lips, nose, and the images of faces that they were familiar with as well as doing some simple mathematical calculation. The time is marker when the image is formed in the subject's mind. By analyzing brain activity maps 300ms right before the time marked instant for each of the 4 wave bands, Delta, Theta, Alpha and Beta waves. We found that for most EEG datasets during this 300ms, Delta wave activity would mostly locate at the frontal lobe or the visual cortex, and the change and movement of activities are slow. Theta wave activity tended to rotate along the edge of cortex either clockwise or counterclockwise. Beta wave behaved like inquiry types of oscillations between any two regions spread over the cortex. Alpha wave activity looks like a mix of the Theta and Beta activities but more close to Theta activity. From the observation we feel that Beta and high Alpha are playing utility role for information inquiry. Theta and low Alpha are likely playing the role of binding and imagination formation in DMN operations.

Recent work showed that during sequential integration of visual inputs, stimuli that fall in the preferred phase of slow (1-3 Hz), endogenous EEG activity carry greater weight in subsequent judgment. Here, we asked two questions. Firstly, is this phenomenon modality-specific, or is it supramodal? Secondly, does this effect occur at the level of sequential encoding, or only during decision formation? We analyzed scalp EEG recordings from healthy human participants while they compared the approximate number of visual, auditory or somatosensory pulses in two successive intervals (N1 and N2). Despite differences in activity evoked in different domains, a common, slowly-oscillating (similar to 3Hz) choice-predictive signal was observed in all three modalities with a maximum coincident with pulse onset. Critically, this signal was present during N2 (when a decision was being formed) but absent during N1 (when perceptual information was encoded, but no decision could be made). In other words, rhythmic gain control during sequential processing is a supramodal phenomenon that occurs while information is integrated towards a categorical decision. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Each of the ten players was recorded the QEEGs for three times; twice before the competition (once a week) and a week after the competition. The results of the delta frequency band illustrated that the higher performance players had more connectivity compared to before competition and normal condition (after competition). This reveals the efficient immediate decision making index in term of the brain connectivity (Coherence). Moreover, the QEEG coherence and the average performance score from coach were also synchronized. According to these results, we can conclude that the QEEG coherence could be efficiently used to predict the performance of the sport player during the competition.

So far, there is no publication reporting naturalistic and continuous music related components based on EEG phase characteristics. In this work, we explore the brain response to long natural music using only EEG phase characteristics. Benefiting from multiway representation, the Ordered PARAFAC model decomposition, and pattern correlation analysis, related phase factors can be extracted and reveal that the alpha and theta oscillations and central and occipital area are most relevant to the music stimulus, which is consistent with not only the previous work but also the results of corresponding EEG amplitude characteristics. Moreover, phase factors can be combined to identify plausible real brain activities elicited by music. Our studies attest to the effectiveness of EEG phase characteristics in exploring the brain response to naturalistic and continuous music.

Although a variety of WFDs see frequent application in electrophysiological research, including the short time Fourier transform, continuous wavelets, bandpass filtering and multitaper-based approaches, each carries certain drawbacks related to computational efficiency and spectral leakage. This work surveys the advantages of a WFD not previously applied in electrophysiological settings. New methods: A computationally efficient form of complex demodulation, the demodulated band transform (DBT), is described. Results: DBT is shown to provide an efficient approach to spectral estimation with minimal susceptibility to spectral leakage. In addition, it lends itself well to adaptive filtering of non-stationary narrowband noise. Comparison with existing methods: A detailed comparison with alternative WFDs is offered, with an emphasis on the relationship between DBT and Thomson's multitaper. DBT is shown to perform favorably in combining computational efficiency with minimal introduction of spectral leakage.

However, previous works did not consider emotional oscillations within a single musical piece. In this research, we propose a continuous music-emotion recognition approach based on brainwave signals. While considering the subject-dependent and changing-over-time characteristics of emotion, our experiment included self-reporting and continuous emotion annotation in the arousal-valence space. Fractal dimension (FD) and power spectral density (PSD) approaches were adopted to extract informative features from raw EEG signals and then we applied emotion classification algorithms to discriminate binary classes of emotion. According to our experimental results, FD slightly outperformed PSD approach both in arousal and valence classification, and FD was found to have the higher correlation with emotion reports than PSD. In addition, continuous emotion recognition during music listening based on EEG was found to be an effective method for tracking emotional reporting oscillations and provides an opportunity to better understand human emotional processes.

Here, we present a neural mass model of the thalamocortical system during natural non-REM sleep, which is able to generate fast sleep spindles (12-15 Hz), slow oscillations (<1 Hz) and K-complexes, as well as their distinct temporal relations, and response to auditory stimuli. We show that with the inclusion of detailed calcium currents, the thalamic neural mass model is able to generate different firing modes, and validate the model with EEG-data from a recent sleep study in humans, where closed-loop auditory stimulation was applied. The model output relates directly to the EEG, which makes it a useful basis to develop new stimulation protocols.

It has been developed a videogame, as a particular kind of serious games from health, which promotes the exercise of cognitive abilities. The participants were ten healthy children between 7 to 12 years old, selected because of their developmental age. Mechanics included in the videogame have been evaluated and related to the processing of new information and user response in preliminary works. The hypothesis of the current work refers to how specific mechanics that are involved in platform-videogames cause activation in the electroencephalogram waves according to cognitive processes such as short-time memory, attention and concentration. It has been analyzed through the magnitude of EEG frequency bands. The results are consistent by showing a differential activation during several game mechanics. With these results we can conclude that the videogame promotes activation and exercise in areas related to the mentioned cognitive skills when the participants are playing the videogame mainly during particular mechanics.

The proposed audiovisual design aims to further enhance the non-verbal communication of the emotions contained in music through the use of color ambience lighting which dynamically changes according to musical harmonies. The novel tone-color mapping principle was created and technically realized with a program application which communicates the structural analysis of music to the Philips HUE (R) lighting. Effects of the audiovisual musical experience on cortical activity were assessed in an electroencephalography (EEG) pilot study, and significant effects were observed in cortical areas related to semantic processing and theory of mind. Due to relevance of these regions for the proposed application of the audiovisual environment in therapy for ASD children with Alexithymia II, it is suggested that further experimental work is carried out in order to test its effectiveness in treating Alexithymia as a negative factor in social interactions of individuals with ASD.

However, how this occurs at the neural level remains unclear. It has been suggested that spontaneous alpha-band neural oscillations represent rhythms of the perceptual system that periodically modulate perceptual judgments. We hypothesized that these oscillations instantiate the effects of expectations. While collecting scalp EEG, participants performed a detection task that orthogonally manipulated perceptual expectations and attention. Trial-by-trial retrospective confidence judgments were also collected. Results showed that, independent of attention, prestimulus occipital alpha phase predicted the weighting of expectations on yes/no decisions. Moreover, phase predicted the influence of expectations on confidence. Thus, expectations periodically bias objective and subjective perceptual decision-making together before stimulus onset. Our results suggest that alpha-band neural oscillations periodically transmit prior evidence to visual cortex, changing the baseline from which evidence accumulation begins. In turn, our results inform accounts of how expectations shape early visual processing.

A potential mechanism to establish accurate temporal coordination among these paths is through the synchronization of neuronal activity to a common rhythm of neuronal firing. Previous EEG studies have suggested that theta oscillatory activity might be crucial in the integration of information from motivational and attentional paths that converge into the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) during reward-guided learning. However, due to the low spatial resolution of EEG, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Here, by combining EEG and fMRI, we show that theta oscillations serve as common substrate for the engagement of separated sub-regions within the mPFC (the pre-Supplementary Motor Area and the dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex), underlying different cognitive operations (encoding of outcome valence and unsigned prediction errors) through separate functional paths (the Salience and the Central Executive Networks).

J	Kilicarslan, A; Grossman, RG; Contreras-Vidal, JL				Kilicarslan, Atilla; Grossman, Robert G.; Contreras-Vidal, Jose Luis			A robust adaptive denoising framework for real-time artifact removal in scalp EEG measurements	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain machine interfaces; EEG; real-time artifact removal; brain computer interfaces; denoising; EOG	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ELECTRODE IMPEDANCE; AUTOMATIC REMOVAL; OCULAR ARTIFACT	Objective. Non-invasive measurement of human neural activity based on the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) allows for the development of biomedical devices that interface with the nervous system for scientific, diagnostic, therapeutic, or restorative purposes. However, EEG recordings are often considered as prone to physiological and non physiological artifacts of different types and frequency characteristics. Among them, ocular artifacts and signal drifts represent major sources of EEG contamination, particularly in real-time closed -loop brain machine interface (BMI) applications, which require effective handling of these artifacts across sessions and in natural settings. Approach. We extend the usage of a robust adaptive noise cancelling (ANC) scheme (H-infinity filtering) for removal of eye blinks, eye motions, amplitude drifts and recording biases simultaneously. We also characterize the volume conduction, by estimating the signal propagation levels across all EEG scalp recording areas due to ocular artifact generators. We find that the amplitude and spatial distribution of ocular artifacts vary greatly depending on the electrode location. Therefore, fixed filtering parameters for all recording areas would naturally hinder the true overall performance of an ANC scheme for artifact removal. We treat each electrode as a separate sub-system to be filtered, and without the loss of generality, they are assumed to be uncorrelated and uncoupled. Main results. Our results show over 95-99.9% correlation between the raw and processed signals at non -ocular artifact regions, and depending on the contamination profile, 40-70% correlation when ocular artifacts are dominant. We also compare our results with the offline independent component analysis and artifact subspace reconstruction methods, and show that some local quantities are handled better by our sample -adaptive real-time framework. Decoding performance is also compared with multi -day experimental data from 2 subjects, totaling 19 sessions, with and without H filtering of the raw data. Significance. The proposed method allows real-time adaptive artifact removal for EEG-based closed-loop BMI applications and mobile EEG studies in general, thereby increasing the range of tasks that can be studied in action and context while reducing the need for discarding data due to artifacts. Significant increase in decoding performances also justify the effectiveness of the method to be used in real-time closed -loop BMI applications.

Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated different brain activities related to errors. Meanwhile, the recognition of error-related brain activity as one aspect of performance monitoring has been reported for potential applications in clinical neuroscience and brain-machine interface, where single-trial analysis and classification would provide novel insights on dynamic brain responses to errors. However, procedures of selecting features, as well as procedures of single-trial classification, are not fully investigated for optimal performance. In the present study, we investigated the performance of different configurations of feature extractions in both temporal and frequency domains, for discriminating response errors in a color-word matching Stroop task. Motivated by our previous investigations, we evaluated both temporal and frequency features with component signals, which were obtained from EEG signals via an independent component analysis (ICA). Five component signals (independent components, ICs), originated from the frontal, motor, parietal, and occipital areas, were included in detecting error-related brain activity from single-trial EEG data. The results showed that better performance can be achieved by optimizing time window and frequency range of selected features, sampling scheme of feature-related data, and training of classifiers. However, a simple combination of features from multiple component signals can only slightly improve the detection performance of errors in single-trial data as compared to the frontal IC only. More importantly, it is indicated that four ICs other than the frontal one also carry similar discriminative information about errors in both temporal and frequency domains. The fact suggests flexible means in detecting errors from EEG beyond the frontal brain areas, which might be very valuable in practical applications such that the frontal area is not accessible.

Indeed, a simple steady-state auditory click stimulation paradigm at gamma frequency (similar to 40 Hz) has been reproducibly shown to reduce entrainment as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) in patients. However, some investigators have reported increased phase locking factor (PLF) and power in response to 40 Hz auditory stimulus in patients. Interestingly, preclinical literature also reflects this contradiction. We investigated whether a graded deficiency in NMDA transmission can account for such disparate findings by administering subanesthetic ketamine (1-30 mg/kg, i.v.) or vehicle to conscious rats (n = 12) and testing their EEG entrainment to 40 Hz click stimuli at various time points (similar to 7-62 min after treatment). In separate cohorts, we examined in vivo NMDA channel occupancy and tissue exposure to contextualize ketamine effects. We report a robust inverse relationship between PLF and NMDA occupancy 7 min after dosing. Moreover, ketamine could produce inhibition or disinhibition of the 40 Hz response in a temporally dynamic manner. These results provide for the first time empirical data to understand how cortical NMDA transmission deficit may lead to opposite modulation of the auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Importantly, our findings posit that 40 Hz ASSR is a pharmacodynamic biomarker for cortical NMDA function that is also robustly translatable. Besides schizophrenia, such a functional biomarker may be of value to neuropsychiatric disorders like bipolar and autism spectrum where 40 Hz ASSR deficits have been documented.

In this paper we aimed to explore the temporal correlations of broadband neuronal oscillation in poststroke depression. Resting state EEGs of 16 electrodes in 16 poststroke depression (PSD), 18 poststroke non-depression (PSND) and 18 healthy control (HC) subjects were analyzed by means of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), a quantitative measurement of LRTC. The results indicated that LRTC of broadband oscillation in PSD subjects was still preserved and had similar spatial distribution to non-depression subjects, but attenuated especially in left hemisphere and frontal and posterior temporal regions of right hemisphere. Moreover, a linear correlation between the severity of psychiatric symptoms and attenuation of LRTC was observed in stroke subjects. ROC curves indicated a high discriminating ability of scaling exponents in prefrontal regions distinguishing PSD from PSND, suggesting the feasibility for LRTC as assessment indicators to PSD.

One factor that affects duration estimates is the temporal structure of stimuli that fill an interval. For example, regular filling (isochronous interval) leads to an overestimation of perceived duration as compared to irregular filling (anisochronous interval). In the present article, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the neural basis of this subjective lengthening of perceived duration with isochrony. In a two-interval forced choice task, participants judged which of two intervals lasts longer - one always being isochronous, the other one anisochronous. Response proportions confirm the subjective overestimation of isochronous intervals. At the neural level, isochronous sequences are associated with enhanced pairwise phase consistency (PPC) at the stimulation frequency, reflecting the brain's entrainment to the regular stimulation. The PPC over the entrainment channels is further enhanced for isochronous intervals that are reported to be longer, and the magnitude of this PCC effect correlates with the amount of perceptual bias. Neural entrainment has been proposed as a mechanism of attentional selection, enabling increased neural responsiveness toward stimuli that arrive at an expected point in time. The present results support the proposed relationship between neural response magnitudes and temporal estimates: An increase in neural responsiveness leads to a more pronounced representation of the individual stimuli filling the interval and in turn to a subjective increase in duration.

However, they did not have an explanation for this pattern of findings. This pattern is consistent, however, with the theta hypothesis of hypnotic responsivity. Further examination of the associations between brain oscillations and response to hypnosis is needed to determine if specific oscillations such as theta (a) actually facilitate response to some hypnotic suggestions, (b) merely reflect hypnotic responding, or (c) reflect another factor that itself plays a causal role in response to hypnosis.

Striatal Dopaminergic Innervation Regulates Subthalamic Beta-Oscillations and Cortical-Subcortical Coupling during Movements: Preliminary Evidence in Subjects with Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta oscillations; motor control; movement disorders; imaging; Parkinson's disease; subthalamic nucleus; coherence analysis	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; BASAL GANGLIA; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NUCLEUS; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; SUPPRESSION; RECORDINGS; MODULATION	Activation of the basal ganglia has been shown during the preparation and execution of movement. However, the functional interaction of cortical and subcortical brain areas during movement and the relative contribution of dopaminergic striatal innervation remains unclear. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals in four patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) off dopaminergic medication during a multi-joint motor task performed with their dominant and non-dominant hand. Recordings were performed by means of a fully-implantable deep brain stimulation (DBS) device at 4 months after surgery. Three patients also performed a single-photon computed tomography (SPECT) with [I-123]N-omega-fluoropropyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane (FP-CIT) to assess striatal dopaminergic innervation. Unilateral movement execution led to event-related desynchronization (ERD) followed by a rebound after movement termination event-related synchronization (ERS) of oscillatory beta activity in the STN and primary sensorimotor cortex of both hemispheres. Dopamine deficiency directly influenced movement-related beta-modulation, with greater beta-suppression in the most dopamine-depleted hemisphere for both ipsi- and contralateral hand movements. Cortical-subcortical, but not interhemispheric subcortical coherencies were modulated by movement and influenced by striatal dopaminergic innervation, being stronger in the most dopamine-depleted hemisphere. The data are consistent with a role of dopamine in shielding subcortical structures from an excessive cortical entrapment and cross-hemispheric coupling, thus allowing fine-tuning of movement.

They were divided into four conditions according to the two contraction levels of the left-hand muscles and whether visual feedback existed for the right hand. Measures of coherence and power spectrum were calculated from EEG and EMG data and statistically analyzed to identify changes in corticomuscular coupling and oscillatory activity. Results showed that compared with the unimanual task, a significant increase in the mean corticomuscular coherence of the right hand was found when left-hand muscles contracted at 5% of the maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC). No significant changes were found when the contraction level was 50% of the MVC. Furthermore, both the increase of muscle contraction levels and the elimination of visual feedback for right hand can significantly decrease the corticomuscular coupling in right hand during bimanual tasks. In summary, the involvement of moderate left-hand muscle contractions resulted in an increase tendency of corticomuscular coherence in right hand while strong left-hand muscle contractions eliminated it. We speculated that the perturbation of activities in one corticospinal tract resulted from the movement of the opposite hand can enhance the corticomuscular coupling when attention distraction is limited.

It is the most common non-offensive way to analyse brain healthiness on the basis of chaotic theory. Normal person's EEG signals are different from the people who suffer from epilepsy, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer's diseases in many respects, namely amplitude, frequency, statistical features and in general dynamic behaviour. The findings indicate EEG signals are non-linear and chaotic. EEG signal was considered as chaotic time series in the research. Diagnosis of diseases was conducted using analysis of chaotic parameters. They include Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension. For this end, appropriate algorithms were rendered to extract necessity parameters for reconstructing phase space and calculated chaotic indices with relative consideration. The findings showed patients are recognised from healthy persons. It was also possible to distinguish two types of epilepsy, namely grand mal and temporal lobe. The results showed acceptable way of predicating epilepsy. Visual diagnosis of disorders by EEG is a big challenge for neurologist as complexity of the brain dysfunctions. This research can be useful for physicians to diagnose and predict diseases.

Identifying Objective EEG Based Markers of Linear Vection in Depth	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						vection; self-motion perception; optic flow processing; EEG; psychophysiology; ERSP	SELF-MOTION; ORIENTING REFLEX; OPTIC-FLOW; PERCEPTION; JITTER; BRAIN; PCA	This proof-of-concept study investigated whether a time-frequency EEG approach could be used to examine vection (i.e., illusions of self-motion). In the main experiment, we compared the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) data of 10 observers during and directly after repeated exposures to two different types of optic flow display (each was 352 wide by 291-high and provided 20 s of motion stimulation). Displays consisted of either a vection display (which simulated constant velocity forward self-motion in depth) or a control display (a spatially scrambled version of the vection display). ERSP data were decomposed using time-frequency Principal Components Analysis (t-f PCA). We found an increase in 10 Hz alpha activity, peaking some 14 s after display motion commenced, which was positively associated with stronger vection ratings. This followed decreases in beta activity, and was also followed by a decrease in delta activity; these decreases in EEG amplitudes were negatively related to the intensity of the vection experience. After display motion ceased, a series of increases in the alpha band also correlated with vection intensity, and appear to reflect vection-and/ormotion-aftereffects, as well as later cognitive preparation for reporting the strength of the vection experience. Overall, these findings provide support for the notion that EEG can be used to provide objective markers of changes in both vection status i.e., "vection/no vection") and vection strength.

Brain Connectivity Dissociates Responsiveness from Drug Exposure during Propofol-Induced Transitions of Consciousness	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BISPECTRAL INDEX; EEG CHANGES; FREQUENCY; NETWORKS; AWARENESS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MECHANISMS; EMERGENCE; MIDAZOLAM	Accurately measuring the neural correlates of consciousness is a grand challenge for neuroscience. Despite theoretical advances, developing reliable brain measures to track the loss of reportable consciousness during sedation is hampered by significant individual variability in susceptibility to anaesthetics. We addressed this challenge using high-density electroencephalography to characterise changes in brain networks during propofol sedation. Assessments of spectral connectivity networks before, during and after sedation were combined with measurements of behavioural responsiveness and drug concentrations in blood. Strikingly, we found that participants who had weaker alpha band networks at baseline were more likely to become unresponsive during sedation, despite registering similar levels of drug in blood. In contrast, phase-amplitude coupling between slow and alpha oscillations correlated with drug concentrations in blood. Our findings highlight novel markers that prognosticate individual differences in susceptibility to propofol and track drug exposure. These advances could inform accurate drug titration and brain state monitoring during anaesthesia.

This includes physiological resting alpha oscillations identified and interpreted already by Hans Berger, EEG slowing and paroxysms (K-complexes, vertex sharp waves) during sleep described by Alfred Loomis, on the one hand, and pathological EEG activity (interictal epileptiform potentials), on the other. Of similar interest are electrophysiological phenomena discussed in cognitive neuroscience, e.g. gamma binding indicating interregional brain communication. Non-invasive simultaneous EEG-combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on the blood oxygen level-dependent signal allows addressing the opening question. Hans Berger's idea of deciphering his contemporaries' thoughts remains unfulfilled to this day. Nevertheless, we have arrived at the formulation of simple concepts how some surface EEG phenomena might relate to brain function. From this, new perspectives on cognition and epilepsy syndromes emerge including future treatment strategies.

These responses are heritable traits, and potential endophenotypes for clinical phenotypes. These stimuli also cause responses in oscillatory activity, both evoked responses phase-locked to stimulus presentation and phase-independent induced responses. Here, we investigate whether phase-locked and phase-independent oscillatory responses are heritable traits. Oscillatory responses were examined in EEG recordings from 213 twin pairs (91 monozygotic and 122 dizygotic twins) performing a visual oddball task. After group Independent Component Analysis (group-ICA) and time-frequency decomposition, individual differences in evoked and induced oscillatory responses were compared between MZ and DZ twin pairs. Induced (phase-independent) oscillatory responses consistently showed the highest heritability (24-55%) compared to evoked (phase-locked) oscillatory responses and spectral energy, which revealed lower heritability at 1-35.6% and 4.5-32.3%, respectively. Since the phase-independent induced response encodes functional aspects of the brain response to target stimuli different from evoked responses, we conclude that the modulation of ongoing oscillatory activity may serve as an additional endophenotype for behavioral phenotypes and psychiatric genetics.

The entire system designed is divided into three sub sections viz. design of low cost EEG amplifier, design of 5 digit robotic hand and providing an Interface between the two using LabVIEW environment. The EEG amplifier is designed using a low cost IC's LM324N and LM358. The simulation and real time implementation of FFT results match for the designed EEG amplifier. The construction of robotic hand were made using PVC tubing and Al-rubber-Al, with miniature metal gear motors of 71 RPM placed inside the palm. The analysis of motor was carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK for with and without load. The interface between these two is provided under LabVIEW environment with NI USB DAQ-6009. The analysis for closure and opening of fingers is carried out based on thought process for three different subjects with different age groups ranges from 20 to 50 years. The results indicate that a peak signal is obtained in between the frequency range of 21 and 22 Hz with amplitude varying from 0.030 to 0.035 V. The robotic hand consumed current of 50 mA with 12 V DC supply when in action.	[Sandesh, R.

Sometimes it cannot be identified whether the subject is silent or has been attacked by epilepsy. In this paper, authors have taken an attempt to distinguish among these two cases. The approach is very simple and does not make any complicacy by introducing the classifiers. It is based on the efficient features only. Initially, the spectral features have been obtained using Fourier transform and chirp Z-transform. Further for characterizing the specific frequency, the time-frequency analysis using wavelet transform has been done with the cepstral coefficients depicted in the result. The cepstrum of the said EEG signals shows clearly the difference among them. Fast Fourier transform (FFT), chirp Z-transform (CZT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) have been exploited to characterize the signals.

Regional and network relationship in the intracranial EEG second spectrum	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Resting state networks; Coherence; Intracranial; EEG	RESTING STATE NETWORKS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS; DEFAULT MODE; FLUCTUATIONS; COHERENCE; CORTEX	Objective: We examined low-frequency amplitude modulations of band power time-series, i. e. the second spectrum, of the intracranial EEG (icEEG) for evidence of support for spatial relationships between different parts of the brain and within the default mode network (DMN). Methods: We estimated magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) of the running power in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands for one-hour background icEEG epochs recorded from 9 patients. We isolated two test areas within the DMN and one control area outside it. We tested if the relationship between DMN areas was stronger than the relationship between each of these areas and the control location, and between all intrahemispheric contact pairs with similar intercontact distance. Results: We observed very low values of second spectrum relationship between different parts of the brain, except at very short distances. These relationships are strongest in the delta band and decrease with increasing frequency, with gamma band relationships being the weakest. Our DMN-specific analysis showed no enhanced connectivity in the second spectrum in DMN locations in any frequency band. Conclusions: Though we observed significantly nonzero relationships in lower frequency bands, second spectrum relationships are consistently very low across the entire brain in every frequency band. Significance: This study suggests a lack of support for the DMN in the icEEG second spectrum. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Prolongation of ERP latency and reaction time (RT) in simultaneous EEG/fMRI data acquisition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG/fMRI; Reaction time; Posterior N100; P300; Electromagnetic effect; Experimental environment	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; STATIC MAGNETIC-FIELDS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACTS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; BLIND SEPARATION; ODDBALL PARADIGM; P300 RECORDINGS; BRAIN	Background: Recording EEG and fMRI data simultaneously inside a fully-operating scanner has been recognized as a novel approach in human brain research. Studies have demonstrated high concordance between the EEG signals and hemodynamic response. However, a few studies reported altered cognitive process inside the fMRI scanner such as delayed reaction time (RT) and reduced and/or delayed N100 and P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) components. New method: The present study investigated the influence of electromagnetic field (static magnetic field, radio frequency (RF) pulse, and gradient switching) and experimental environment on posterior N100 and P300 ERP components in four different settings with six healthy subjects using a visual oddball task: (1) classic fMRI acquisition inside the scanner (e.g., supine position, mirror glasses for stimulus presentation), (2) standard behavioral experiment outside the scanner (e.g., seated position, keyboard response), (3) controlled fMRI acquisition inside the scanner (e.g., organic light-emitting diode (OLED) goggles for stimulus presentation) inside; and (4) modified behavioral experiment outside the scanner (e.g., supine position, OLED goggles). Results: The study findings indicated that the experimental environment in simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition could substantially delay NIP, P300 latency, and RT inside the scanner, and was associated with a reduced N1P amplitude. Comparison with existing methods: There was no effect of electromagnetic field in the prolongation of RT, N1P and P300 latency inside the scanner. NIP, but not P300, latency was sensitive to stimulus presentation method inside the scanner. Conclusion: Future simultaneous EEG/fMRI data collection should consider experimental environment in both design and analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several approaches; including ERP, time-frequency analysis and, more recently, regression and stimulus reconstruction approaches; have been suggested for solving this problem. In this work, we study the problem of correlating of EEG signals to different sets of sound sources with the goal of identifying the single source to which the listener is attending. Here, we propose a method for finding the number of parameters needed in a regression model to avoid overlearning, which is necessary for determining the attended sound source with high confidence in order to solve the cocktail party problem.

Recent studies showed that neural oscillations' patterns in Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma sub-bands play a main role in brain's emotional processing. The main goal of this study is to classify two different emotional states by means of EEG data recorded through a single-electrode EEG headset. Nineteen young subjects participated in an EEG experiment while watching a video clip that evoked three emotional states: neutral, relaxation and scary. Following each video clip, participants were asked to report on their subjective affect by giving a score between 0 to 10. First, recorded EEG data were preprocessed by stationary wavelet transform (SWT) based denoising to remove artifacts. Afterward, the distribution of power in time-frequency space was obtained using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and then, the mean value of energy was calculated for each EEG sub-band. Finally, 46 features, as the mean energy of frequency bands between 4 and 50 Hz, containing 689 instances-for each subject -were collected in order to classify the emotional states. Our experimental results show that EEG dynamics induced by horror and relaxing movies can be classified with average classification rate of 92% using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We also compared the performance of SVM to K-nearest neighbors (K-NN). The results show that K-NN achieves a better classification rate by 94% accuracy. The findings of this work are expected to pave the way to a new horizon in neuroscience by proving the point that only single-channel EEG data carry enough information for emotion classification.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold promise in restoring communication for patients with completely locked-in stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, these patients cannot use existing EEG-based BCIs, arguably because such systems rely on brain processes that are impaired in the late stages of ALS. In this work, we introduce a novel BCI designed for patients in late stages of ALS based on high-level cognitive processes that are less likely to be affected by ALS. Approach. We trained two ALS patients via EEG-based neurofeedback to use self-regulation of theta or gamma oscillations in the precuneus for basic communication. Because there is a tight connection between the precuneus and consciousness, precuneus oscillations are arguably generated by high-level cognitive processes, which are less likely to be affected by ALS than processes linked to the peripheral nervous system. Main results. Both patients learned to self-regulate their precuneus oscillations and achieved stable online decoding accuracy over the course of disease progression. One patient achieved a mean online decoding accuracy in a binary decision task of 70.55% across 26 training sessions, and the other patient achieved 59.44% across 16 training sessions. We provide empirical evidence that these oscillations were cortical in nature and originated from the intersection of the precuneus, cuneus, and posterior cingulate. Significance. Our results establish that ALS patients can employ self-regulation of precuneus oscillations for communication. Such a BCI is likely to be available to ALS patients as long as their consciousness supports communication.

In the present study we investigated whether electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be reliably measured when the subject is in walking condition. 5 subjects were recruited to perform motor tasks (making their fists with left or right hand) in two sessions, which included the control session (sitting in the armchair) and the experimental session (walking on the treadmill). Two sessions were conducted in the same environment. The mean classification accuracies are 70% (seated) and 66% (walking), so a bit lower classification accuracies when walking compared to that when sitting in the condition of performing motor execution for most subjects. Moreover, the motor and sensory cortices were activated and obvious ERD of contralateral area can be seen when performing motor execution no matter the subject was sitting or walking, and no obvious artifacts according to the presented time-frequency analysis. This leads us to conclude that it is possible to establish a mobile BCI system based on portable EEG devices.

Modification of Brain Oscillations via Rhythmic Light Stimulation Provides Evidence for Entrainment but Not for Superposition of Event-Related Responses	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; visual flicker; individual alpha frequency; Arnold tongue; intermittency; parietal cortex; steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP); superposition	EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; MECHANISM; TRANSIENT; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	The functional relevance of brain oscillations in the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz) has been repeatedly investigated through the use of rhythmic visual stimulation. The underlying mechanism of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) measured in EEG during rhythmic stimulation, however, is not known. There are two hypotheses on the origin of SSVEPs: entrainment of brain oscillations and superposition of event related responses (ERPs). The entrainment but not the superposition hypothesis justifies rhythmic visual stimulation as a means to manipulate brain oscillations, because superposition assumes a linear summation of single responses, independent from ongoing brain oscillations. Here, we stimulated participants with a rhythmic flickering light of different frequencies and intensities. We measured entrainment by comparing the phase coupling of brain oscillations stimulated by rhythmic visual flicker with the oscillations induced by arrhythmic jittered stimulation, varying the time, stimulation frequency, and intensity conditions. In line with a theoretical concept of entrainment (the so called Arnold tongue), we found the phase coupling to be more pronounced with increasing stimulation intensity as well as at stimulation frequencies closer to each participant's intrinsic frequency. Only inside the Arnold tongue did the conditions significantly differ from the jittered stimulation. Furthermore, even in a single sequence of an SSVEP, we found non-linear features (intermittency of phase locking) that contradict the linear summation of single responses, as assumed by the superposition hypothesis. Our findings provide unequivocal evidence that visual rhythmic stimulation entrains brain oscillations, thus validating the approach of rhythmic stimulation as a manipulation of brain oscillations.

However, the mechanism and sequential responses are still ambiguous. This study aims to reveal the mechanism of cardiovascular and autonomic responses and the related scalp positions that regulate the autonomic nerves system (ANS) during MA task. Methods: 34 healthy male subjects aged between 19 and 27 years old (mean age 23.6 +/- 2.3 years) were recruited in. Electrocardiogram, impedance cardiography, beat-to-beat blood pressure and electroencephalography were measured simultaneously and continuously during the experiments. And the analysis of time-frequency, approximate entropy and Pearson correlation coefficient were adopted. For statistical comparison, paired t test is utilized in the study. Results: The results showed that mental arithmetic task increased heart rate (from 72.35 +/- 1.88 to 80.38 +/- 2.34), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: from 112.09 +/- 3.23 to 126.79 +/- 3.44; diastolic blood pressure: from 74.15 +/- 1.93 to 81.20 +/- 1.97), and cardiac output (from 8.71 +/- 0.30 to 9.68 +/- 0.35), and the mental arithmetic induced physiological responses could be divided into two stages, the first stage (10-110 s) and late stage (150-250 s). The high frequency power component (HF) of HRV decreased during MA, but the normalized low frequency power component (nLF) and LF/HF ratio of HRV increased only at the late stage. Moreover, during first stage, the correlations between approximate entropy of electroencephalography at Fp2, Fz, F4, F7 and the corresponding time-frequency results of HF were significant. During the late stage, the correlations between approximate entropy of electroencephalography at Fp2, Fz, C3, C4 and the corresponding nLF was significant. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that (1) mental stress induces time-dependent ANS activity and cardiovascular response. (2) Parasympathetic activity is lower during mental arithmetic task, but sympathetic nerve is activated only during late stage of mental arithmetic task. (3) Brain influences the cardiac activity through prefrontal and temporal cortex with the activation of ANS during mental arithmetic.

Yet the feature extraction itself can be computationally demanding, and may rapidly exhaust the meager energy supply available to the sensor node. General-purpose time-frequency analysis techniques, such as the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are widely used, but are computationally demanding and may represent overkill. This work presents a feature extraction technique for biopotential time-frequency analysis, based on the modulation of finite sample differences.

Here, we investigated how the relationship between event-related power changes in the EEG (ERPC) and BOLD responses varies for the typical EEG frequency bands and depending on the distance between the fMRI voxel and the EEG recording site. As cognitive task we chose an auditory Stroop experiment. We observed that for small distances event-related BOLD responses were positively correlated with ERPC in the gamma band, just as, in contrast to previous studies, in the alpha band. BOLD responses were negatively correlated with EEG power in the delta range for regions close to the EEG recording site.	[Kranz, T.

J	Zhang, T; Chen, WZ; Li, MY				Zhang Tao; Chen Wan-Zhong; Li Ming-Yang			Automatic seizure detection of electroencephalogram signals based on frequency slice wavelet transform and support vector machine	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						electroencephalogram signal; frequency slice wavelet transform; support vector machine	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; EEG	Over 50 million people all over the world are suffering from epilepsy. It is of great significance to achieve automatic seizure detection in electroencephalogram (EEG) signal for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In order to achieve automatic diagnosis of epilepsy, a multitude of automated computer aided diagnostic techniques have been proposed. However, only a few of studies lay emphasis on the effects of different rhythm signals. To explore the influence of rhythm signals on classification accuracy, a newly-developed time-frequency analysis method called frequency slice wavelet transform (FSWT), which is able to locate arbitrary time-frequency range with the use of frequency slice function and whose inverse transformation only relies on fast Fourier transform, is employed to extract five different rhythm signals, namely delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) from original EEG signal. Subsequently, for extracting the nonlinear and linear features, the approximate entropy of each rhythm signal and fluctuation index of adjacent rhythm signals are calculated to reflect the variation characteristics of rhythm signals and they are flocked together to form the nine-dimensional feature vectors. Finally, the extracted vectors are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) which is optimized by genetic algorithms (GA) for classification. Specifically, since the parameters of SVM are associated with the final classification accuracy and appropriate parameters could lead to a remarkable result, GA is applied to parameter optimization, half of the obtained vectors are randomly selected as a training set for training, and the remaining vectors constitute a testing set to test the established model. Experimental results of the proposed approach, which is employed in a public epileptic EEG dataset obtained from department of epitology at Bonn University for validation indicate that the proposed method in this study can carry out the task of classifying normal, inter-ictal and epileptic seizure EEG signals with a high classification accuracy (98.33%), a sensitivity of 99%, a specificity of 99%, and a positive predictive value of 99.5%. The presented approach provides an outstanding scheme for the automatic diagnosis of epilepsy, and the directions of our further research may include the application of the proposed method to the diagnosis of other disorders.

Right hemisphere frontotemporal functional connectivity during encoding and retrieval, measured via EEG alpha coherence, statistically predicted performance on recency but not recognition judgments for the abstract paintings. Theta coherence, however, did not predict performance. Likewise, cognitive flexibility statistically predicted performance on recency judgments, but not recognition. These findings suggest that recognition and recency operate via separate electrophysiological and executive mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compensatory effects were shown for schizophrenic patients when recorded with closed eyes. This effect has not been evaluated in respect to hallucination status. Methods: Gamma responses to 40 Hz stimulation were recorded in 15 AVH patients, 25 healthy controls and 11 NH patients with closed eyes. Mean and peak evoked amplitude and phase-locking index, peak time and maximal frequency were extracted for early-and late-latency responses and compared between groups. Results: Phase-locking of early, but not late-latency gamma was diminished in schizophrenic patients independently on hallucination status. Peak entrainment time was delayed in hallucinating patients. Magnitude and frequency of early-latency response correlated to negative symptoms. Conclusions: In AVH patients, entrainment at gamma frequency was "normal" when eyes were closed. In contrast to never hallucinating subjects, entrainment to stimulation was delayed in AVH. The early-latency gamma response, standing for early sensory stimulus processing, on the contrary, was impaired in SZ irrespective of prevalence of hallucinations and was not modulated by subjects' general state; however its magnitude might be related to the expression of negative symptomatology. Significance: Evaluation of auditory entrainment in both open eyes and closed eyes conditions is informative. Frequency and timing information of both early-latency and late-latency responses helps to uncover different aspects of impairment in schizophrenia patients.

J	Kayser, SJ; McNair, SW; Kayser, C				Kayser, Stephanie J.; McNair, Steven W.; Kayser, Christoph			Prestimulus influences on auditory perception from sensory representations and decision processes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						perception; oscillatory brain activity; EEG; single-trial decoding; prestimulus effects	NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG PHASE; SPEECH; DISCRIMINATION; REFLECT; FLUCTUATIONS; MODULATION; POWER	The qualities of perception depend not only on the sensory inputs but also on the brain state before stimulus presentation. Although the collective evidence from neuroimaging studies for a relation between prestimulus state and perception is strong, the interpretation in the context of sensory computations or decision processes has remained difficult. In the auditory system, for example, previous studies have reported a wide range of effects in terms of the perceptually relevant frequency bands and state parameters (phase/power). To dissociate influences of state on earlier sensory representations and higher-level decision processes, we collected behavioral and EEG data in human participants performing two auditory discrimination tasks relying on distinct acoustic features. Using single-trial decoding, we quantified the relation between prestimulus activity, relevant sensory evidence, and choice in different task-relevant EEG components. Within auditory networks, we found that phase had no direct influence on choice, whereas power in task-specific frequency bands affected the encoding of sensory evidence. Within later-activated frontoparietal regions, theta and alpha phase had a direct influence on choice, without involving sensory evidence. These results delineate two consistent mechanisms by which prestimulus activity shapes perception. However, the timescales of the relevant neural activity depend on the specific brain regions engaged by the respective task.

ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE FRONTAL CORTEX ENHANCES SLOW-FREQUENCY EEG ACTIVITY AND SLEEPINESS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (osc-tDCS); resting EEG; EEG synchronization; sleepiness; sleep onset; frontal cortex	MOTOR CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; THETA ACTIVITY; MEMORY; TDCS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS	Our aim was to enhance the spontaneous slow-frequency EEG activity during the resting state using oscillating transcranial direct currents (tDCS) with a stimulation frequency that resembles the spontaneous oscillations of sleep onset. Accordingly, in this preliminary study, we assessed EEG after-effects of a frontal oscillatory tDCS with different frequency (0.8 vs. 5 Hz) and polarity (anodal, cathodal, and sham). Two single-blind experiments compared the after effects on the resting EEG of oscillatory tDCS [Exp. 1 = 0.8 Hz, 10 subjects (26.2 +/- 2.5 years); Exp. 2 = 5 Hz, 10 subjects (27.4 +/- 2.4 years)] by manipulating its polarity. EEG signals recorded (28 scalp derivations) before and after stimulation [slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz), delta (1-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta 1 (1315 Hz) and beta 2 (16-24 Hz)] were compared between conditions as a function of polarity (anodal vs. cathodal vs. sham) and frequency of stimulation (0.8 vs. 5 Hz). We found a significant relative enhancement of the delta activity after the anodal tDCS at 5 Hz compared to that at 0.8 Hz. This increase, even though not reaching the statistical significance compared to sham, is concomitant to a significant increase of subjective sleepiness, as assessed by a visual analog scale. These two phenomena are linearly related with a regional specificity, correlations being restricted to cortical areas perifocal to the stimulation site. We have shown that a frontal oscillating anodal tDCS at 5 Hz results in an effective change of both subjective sleepiness and spontaneous slow-frequency EEG activity. These changes are critically associated to both stimulation polarity (anodal) and frequency (5 Hz). However, evidence of frequency-dependence seems more unequivocal than evidence of polarity-dependence. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assuming that multistable perception activates a fronto-parietal network, we contrast the results of mature and developing cognitive systems to deduce the developmental status of underlying structures from behavioral performances and functional EEG parameters. We analyzed the topographical distribution, amplitude characteristics and inter-trial variability of a reversal related delta response that accompanies perceptual switches between the two alternative percepts of an ambiguous motion pattern. Fourteen ten-year old children and an adult control group indicated changes of perceived motion directions by a button-press. EEG was recorded from frontal, central, parietal, and occipital locations of both hemispheres. Behavioral data shows a considerably lower reversal rate within the children sample, suggesting that the related mechanisms are not yet operating on an adult level. In contrast to findings in adults, the involved delta component emerges as part of an unspecific posterior activation, suggesting that a cortical specialization process has not been accomplished yet. On frontal locations the ten-year old children fail to yield a stable component. The synchronized fronto-parietal activity in adults may constitute the result of a specialization process that determined connection patterns and functionally tuned the involved areas. This implies a deficit in timing and temporal sequencing of neuronal activity in children, mainly attributable to a less functional differentiated PFC that has not been fully integrated yet into the cognitive ensemble.

In the context of social communication, the voice is the most important sound category. However, the existing studies do not directly address whether and how the salience of an unexpected vocal change in an auditory sequence influences the orientation of attention. In this study, frequent tones were interspersed with task-relevant infrequent tones and task-irrelevant infrequent vocal sounds (neutral, happy and angry vocalizations). Eighteen healthy college students were asked to count infrequent tones. A combined event-related potential (ERP) and EEG time-frequency approach was used, with the focus on the P3 component and on the early auditory evoked gamma band response, respectively. A spatial-temporal principal component analysis was used to disentangle potentially overlapping ERP components. Although no condition differences were observed in the 210-310 ms window, larger positive responses were observed for emotional than neutral vocalizations in the 310-410 ms window. Furthermore, the phase synchronization of the early auditory evoked gamma oscillation was enhanced for happy vocalizations. These findings support the idea that the brain prioritizes the processing of emotional stimuli, by devoting more attentional resources to salient social signals even when they are not task-relevant.

The main goal of the paper is to help people with severe motor disabilities (i.e., spinal cord injuries) and to provide them with a new way of communication and control options. In this paper, offline analysis of the data collected is used to make the user able of controlling the movement of the electronic wheelchair. The data are collected during a session in which four subjects with age about 25 +/- 1 years were tested. The adaptive-network based fuzzy inference system algorithm is then applied for the classification method with some parameters. In the offline analysis, the implemented method shows a significant performance in the classification accuracy level and it gives an accuracy level of more than 90%. This result suggests that using the adaptive-network based fuzzy inference system algorithm can improve real time operation of the current BCI system.

Electrophysiologically, these processes are reflected in synchronized oscillations. We present the first study exploring the effects of a stroke causing Broca's aphasia on these processes and specifically on synchronized functional WM networks. We used high-density EEG and coherence analysis to map WM networks in ten Broca's patients and ten healthy controls during verbal WM task. Our results demonstrate that a stroke resulting in Broca's aphasia also alters two distinct WM networks. These theta and gamma functional networks likely reflect the executive and the phonological processes, respectively. The striking imbalance between task-related theta synchronization and desynchronization in Broca's patients might represent a disrupted balance between task-positive and WM-irrelevant functional networks. There is complete disintegration of left fronto-centroparietal gamma network in Broca's patients, which could reflect the damaged phonological loop. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Viewing from a lifespan perspective, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) data of three age samples: young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults. Stimuli consisted of temporally degraded sentences in Swedish-a language unfamiliar to all participants. We found age-related differences in phonetic pattern matching when participants were presented with envelope-degraded sentences, whereas no such age-effect was observed in the processing of fine-structure-degraded sentences. Irrespective of age, during speech processing the EEG data revealed a relationship between envelope information and the theta band (4-8 Hz) activity. Additionally, an association between fine-structure information and the gamma band (30-48 Hz) activity was found. No interaction, however, was found between acoustic manipulation of stimuli and age. Importantly, our main finding was paralleled by an overall enhanced power in older adults in high frequencies (gamma: 30-48 Hz). This occurred irrespective of condition. For the most part, this result is in line with the Asymmetric Sampling in Time framework (Poeppel in Speech Commun 41:245-255, 2003), which assumes an isomorphic correspondence between frequency modulations in neurophysiological patterns and acoustic oscillations in spoken language. We conclude that speech-specific neural networks show strong stability over adulthood, despite initial processes of cortical degeneration indicated by enhanced gamma power. The results of our study therefore confirm the concept that sensory and cognitive processes undergo multidirectional trajectories within the context of healthy aging.

This spatial mnemonic combines the core cognitive processes commonly linked to medial temporal lobe (MTL) activity: spatial and associative memory processes. During such processes, fMRI studies consistently demonstrate MTL activity, while electrophysiological studies have emphasized the important role of theta oscillations (3-8 Hz) in the MTL. However, it is still unknown whether increases or decreases in theta power co-occur with increased BOLD signal in the MTL during memory encoding. To investigate this question, we recorded EEG and fMRI separately, while human participants used the spatial method of loci or the pegword method, a similarly associative but nonspatial mnemonic. The more effective spatial mnemonic induced a pronounced theta power decrease source localized to the left MTL compared with the nonspatial associative mnemonic strategy. This effect was mirrored by BOLD signal increases in the MTL. Successful encoding, irrespective of the strategy used, elicited decreases in left temporal theta power and increases in MTL BOLD activity. This pattern of results suggests a negative relationship between theta power and BOLD signal changes in the MTL during memory encoding and spatial processing. The findings extend the well known negative relation of alpha/beta oscillations and BOLD signals in the cortex to theta oscillations in the MTL.

To increase the number of selectable targets, joint frequency and phase-coding is sometimes used but it has only been tested in offline settings. In this study, we report on an online, hierarchical SSVEP spelling application that relies on joint frequency-phase coded targets, and, in addition, propose a new decoding scheme based on spatiotemporal beamforming combined with time-domain EEG analysis. Experiments on 17 healthy subjects confirm that with our new decoding scheme, accurate spelling can be performed in an online setting, even when using short stimulation lengths (1 sec) and closely separated stimulation frequencies (1 Hz).

MethodsHRV parameters were extracted from single-lead electrocardiography data collected during video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 14 patients with newly diagnosed TLE in a resting, awake, and supine state. HRV parameters in the time and frequency domains included low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), standard deviation of all consecutive R wave intervals (SDNN), and square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent R wave intervals (RMSSD). Cardiovagal index (CVI), cardiosympathetic index (CSI), and approximate entropy (ApEn) were also studied. ResultsFrequency domain analysis showed significantly higher preictal, ictal, and postictal LF/HF ratio compared to the interictal state. Similarly, the LF component increased progressively and was significantly higher during the ictal state compared to interictal and preictal states. RR interval values were lower in the ictal state compared to basal and preictal states and in the postictal state compared to the preictal state. Interictal RMSSD was significantly higher compared to all other states, and ictal SDNN was significantly higher compared to all other states. Ictal CSI was significantly higher compared to preictal and interictal states, whereas preictal CVI was lower than in basal and ictal states. In addition, ictal ApEn was significantly lower than interictal and preictal ApEn. Interictal CVI was lower in left TLE compared to right TLE. In addition, in left TLE, ictal CVI was higher than interictal CVI, whereas in right TLE, CVI was lower in the preictal state compared to all other states. SignificanceOur data suggest an ictal sympathetic overdrive with partial recovery in the postictal state. Higher sympathetic tone and vagal tone imbalance may induce early autonomic dysfunction and increase cardiovascular risk in patients affected by TLE.

J	Niefind, F; Dimigen, O				Niefind, Florian; Dimigen, Olaf			Dissociating parafoveal preview benefit and parafovea-on-fovea effects during reading: A combined eye tracking and EEG study	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Eye tracking; Eye-fixation related potentials; Delayed parafovea-on-fovea effect; Preview benefit; Boundary technique	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; E-Z READER; TIME-COURSE; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; MOVEMENT CONTROL; FIXATION; FREQUENCY; FAMILIARITY; REPETITION	During reading, the parafoveal processing of an upcoming word n+1 can influence word recognition in two ways: It can affect fixation behavior during the preceding fixation on word n (parafovea-on-fovea effect, POF), and it can facilitate subsequent foveal processing once word n+1 is fixated (preview benefit). While preview benefits are established, evidence for POF effects is mixed. Recently, it has been suggested that POF effects exist, but have a delayed impact on saccade planning and thus coincide with preview benefits measured on word n+1. We combined eye movement and EEG recordings to investigate and separate neural correlates of POF and preview benefit effects. Participants read lists of nouns either in a boundary paradigm or the RSVP-with-flankers paradigm, while we recorded fixation- or event-related potentials (FRPs/ERPs), respectively. The validity and lexical frequency of the word shown as preview for the upcoming word n+1 were orthogonally manipulated. Analyses focused on the first fixation on word n+1. Preview validity (correct vs. incorrect preview) strongly modulated fixation times and electrophysiological N1 amplitudes, replicating previous findings. Importantly, gaze durations and FRPs measured on word n+1 were also affected by the frequency of the word shown as preview, with low-frequency previews eliciting a sustained, N400-like centroparietal negativity. Results support the idea that POF effects exist but affect word recognition with a delay. Lastly, once word n+1 was fixated, its frequency also modulated N1 amplitudes in ERPs and FRPs. Taken together, we separated immediate and delayed effects of parafoveal processing on brain correlates of word recognition.

There is a recent trend to detect more than one of these signals in one system to create a hybrid BCI. However, in this case, EEG data were always divided into groups and analyzed by the separate processing procedures. As a result, the interactive effects were ignored when different types of BCI tasks were executed simultaneously. In this work, we propose an improved tensor based multiclass multimodal scheme especially for hybrid BCI, in which EEG signals are denoted as multiway tensors, a nonredundant rank-one tensor decomposition model is proposed to obtain nonredundant tensor components, a weighted fisher criterion is designed to select multimodal discriminative patterns without ignoring the interactive effects, and support vector machine (SVM) is extended to multiclass classification. Experiment results suggest that the proposed scheme can not only identify the different changes in the dynamics of brain oscillations induced by different types of tasks but also capture the interactive effects of simultaneous tasks properly. Therefore, it has great potential use for hybrid BCI.

We recorded multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) from healthy younger and older adults in a Go/NoGo task, and examined the aging effects on synchronous brain networks with graph theoretical analysis. We found that in both age groups, brain networks in theta, alpha or beta band for either response execution (Go) or response inhibition (NoGo) condition showed prominent small-world property. Furthermore, small-world property of brain networks showed significant differences between different task conditions. Further analyses of node degree suggested that frontal-central theta band phase synchrony was enhanced during response inhibition, whereas during response execution, increased phase synchrony was observed in beta band over central-parietal regions. More interestingly, these task-related modulations on brain networks were well preserved and even more robust in older adults compared with younger adults. Taken together, our findings not only suggest that response control involves synchronous brain networks in functionally-distinct frequency bands, but also indicate an increase in the recruitment of brain network resources due to normal aging.

Previous research identified a network of cortical regions that is relevant for motor sequence learning, namely primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, superior parietal cortex, and subcortical regions, including basal ganglia and cerebellum. Here, we investigated learning-related changes in oscillatory activity (theta, alpha and gamma power) and cross-frequency interactions (theta- and alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling) within cortical regions during sensorimotor memory formation. EEG was recorded from a large group of participants (n = 73) performing the serial reaction time task (SRTT). Posterior parietal alpha power was larger early-on during sequence learning and smaller in later sessions. Alpha/low-gamma (8-13 Hz and 30-48 Hz) phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was significantly smaller during sequence learning over right superior parietal cortex and frontal cortex. During the transition from sequential stimuli to random stimuli, participants made more errors, indicating that they still implicitly attempted to implement the learned motor sequence. At the same time, alpha/low-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was found to be smaller during the transition relative to later random trials. Our results show that learning and implementing a learned motor sequence reduces alpha/low-gamma PAC over parietal and frontal cortex. Fronto-parietal alpha/low-gamma PAC might be relevant for visuomotor mapping which becomes less relevant once the motor sequence has been encoded. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

High-density Electroencephalographic Acquisition in a Rodent Model Using Low-cost and Open-source Resources	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 117; electroencephalography (EEG); electromyography (EMG); neuroscience; mouse; medicine; chronic implant; affordable; open source; high-density; seizure; sleep; anesthesia	SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	Advanced electroencephalographic analysis techniques requiring high spatial resolution, including electrical source imaging and measures of network connectivity, are applicable to an expanding variety of questions in neuroscience. Performing these kinds of analyses in a rodent model requires higher electrode density than traditional screw electrodes can accomplish. While higher-density electroencephalographic montages for rodents exist, they are of limited availability to most researchers, are not robust enough for repeated experiments over an extended period of time, or are limited to use in anesthetized rodents. (1-3) A proposed low-cost method for constructing a durable, high-count, transcranial electrode array, consisting of bilaterally implantable headpieces is investigated as a means to perform advanced electroencephalogram analyses in mice or rats. Procedures for headpiece fabrication and surgical implantation necessary to produce high signal to noise, low-impedance electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals are presented. While the methodology is useful in both rats and mice, this manuscript focuses on the more challenging implementation for the smaller mouse skull. Freely moving mice are only tethered to cables via a common adapter during recording. One version of this electrode system that includes 26 electroencephalographic channels and 4 electromyographic channels is described below.

We employed an attention network test (ANT) to measure the subjects' work performance indirectly and used herbal extracts to reduce ocular oxidative stress. Thirty-two subjects participated in either an experimental group (wearing glasses containing herbal extracts) or a control group (wearing glasses without herbal extracts). During the ANT experiment, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) data and measured button responses. In addition, electrocardiogram (ECG) data were collected before and after the experiments. The EOG results showed that the experimental group exhibited a reduced number of eye blinks per second during the experiment and faster button responses with a smaller variation than did the control group; this group also showed relatively more sustained tension in their ECG results. In the EEG analysis, the experimental group had significantly greater cognitive processing, with larger P300 and parietal 2-6Hz activity, an orienting effect with neural processing of frontal area, high beta activity in the occipital area, and an alpha and beta recovery process after the button response. We concluded that reducing blue-light-induced oxidative stress with herbal extracts may be associated with reducing the number of eye blinks and enhancing attentive performance.

This could imply that perception and cognition operate periodically, as a succession of cycles mirroring the underlying oscillations. This age-old notion of discrete perception has resurfaced in recent years, fueled by advances in neuroscientific techniques. Contrary to earlier views of discrete perception as a unitary sampling rhythm, contemporary evidence points not to one but several rhythms of perception that may depend on sensory modality, task, stimulus properties, or brain region. In vision, for example, a sensory alpha rhythm (similar to 10 Hz) may coexist with at least one more rhythm performing attentional sampling at around 7 Hz. How these multiple periodic functions are orchestrated, and how internal sampling rhythms coordinate with overt sampling behavior, remain open questions.

Previous studies have shown the relation between event-related EEG and sensory-cognitive representation and revealed that categorization of presented object can be successfully recognized using recorded EEG signals when subjects view objects. Here, EEG signals in conjunction with a multivariate pattern recognition technique were used for investigating the possibility to identify conceptual representation based on the presentation of 12 semantic categories of objects (5 exemplars per category). Using multivariate stimulus decoding methods, surprisingly, we demonstrate that how objects are discriminated from phase pattern of EEG signals across the time in low-frequency band (1-4 Hz), but not from power of oscillatory brain signals in the same frequency band. In contrast, discrimination accuracy from the power of EEG signals has significantly higher than the performance from phase of EEG signal in the high-frequency band (20-30 Hz). Moreover, our results indicate that how the accuracy of prediction changes between various areas of brain continuously across the time. In particular, we find that, during the object categorization task, the inter-trial phase coherence in low-frequency band is significantly higher than other frequency in various regions of interests. This measure is associated with decoding pattern across the time. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying conceptual representation can be mediated by the phase of oscillatory neural activity.

Resting state EEG correlates of memory consolidation	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Memory consolidation; Sleep; Resting state; Mindwandering; EEG; Slow oscillation; Alpha; Verbal memory	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL REPLAY; LONG-TERM; PROCEDURAL MEMORY; DEPENDENT MEMORY; BARREL CORTEX; DAYTIME NAP; AWAKE STATE	Numerous studies demonstrate that post-training sleep benefits human memory. At the same time, emerging data suggest that other resting states may similarly facilitate consolidation. In order to identify the conditions under which non-sleep resting states benefit memory, we conducted an EEG (electroencephalographic) study of verbal memory retention across 15 min of eyes-closed rest. Participants (n = 26) listened to a short story and then either rested with their eyes closed, or else completed a distractor task for 15 min. A delayed recall test was administered immediately following the rest period. We found, first, that quiet rest enhanced memory for the short story. Improved memory was associated with a particular EEG signature of increased slow oscillatory activity (<1 Hz), in concert with reduced alpha (8-12 Hz) activity. Mindwandering during the retention interval was also associated with improved memory. These observations suggest that a short period of quiet rest can facilitate memory, and that this may occur via an active process of consolidation supported by slow oscillatory EEG activity and characterized by decreased attention to the external environment. Slow oscillatory EEG rhythms are proposed to facilitate memory consolidation during sleep by promoting hippocampal-cortical communication. Our findings suggest that EEG slow oscillations could play a significant role in memory consolidation during other resting states as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Visualization of brain activation during the performance of attention-demanding tasks	2016 IEEE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE INFORMATICS & COGNITIVE COMPUTING (ICCI*CC)			English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)	AUG 22-23, 2016	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, ICIC, IEEE ICCI CC	Stanford Univ	Sustained attention; Electroencephalography; Event related synchronization; Event related Desynchronization; Task performance; Cognitive process	ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS	Attention is the primary cognitive process to induce a response to a stimulus. Maintaining the attentive state continuously for a prolonged period of time is known as sustained attention which is vital for performing any task. The present study aims at evaluating the activation of different brain regions while performing an attention requiring task. A standard attention task called the Visual Continuous Performance test was employed for the study. The analysis is achieved with the help of electroencephalography (EEG) recorded simultaneously during the entire period of execution of task. The task report detailing the errors committed, reaction time is generated automatically and indicates the level of performance. The relative theta and gamma power were significantly higher (p=0.05) during task when compared to that determined during rest, whereas in alpha band the relative power was significantly higher (p=0.05) during rest when compared to task. Event related synchronization (ERS) and Event related Desynchronization (ERD) in relative theta power and relative alpha power respectively was observed particularly in the parietal cognitive processing electrodes (associated with attention). Theta synchronisation and alpha desynchronization is associated with good performance; this was supported by the task performance result which reported a minimum of errors. These event-related changes helped sustain attention and a visualization of the activated brain regions was accomplished for a better depiction of the findings.

This is, generally, a very difficult, tedious and time-consuming task. The limitations of manual sleep stage scoring have escalated the demand for developing Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC) systems. Sleep stage classification refers to identifying the various stages of sleep and is a critical step in an effort to assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of related sleep disorders. The aim of this paper is to survey the progress and challenges in various existing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal-based methods used for sleep stage identification at each phase; including pre-processing, feature extraction and classification; in an attempt to find the research gaps and possibly introduce a reasonable solution. Many of the prior and current related studies use multiple EEG channels, and are based on 30 s or 20 s epoch lengths which affect the feasibility and speed of ASSC for real-time applications. Thus, in this paper, we also present a novel and efficient technique that can be implemented in an embedded hardware device to identify sleep stages using new statistical features applied to 10 s epochs of single-channel EEG signals. In this study, the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database was used. The proposed methodology achieves an average classification sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 89.06%, 98.61% and 93.13%, respectively, when the decision tree classifier is applied. Finally, our new method is compared with those in recently published studies, which reiterates the high classification accuracy performance.

Neurobiological Correlates of Inhibition of the Right Broca Homolog during New-Word Learning	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						rTMS; language; learning; picture naming; EEG	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; STATE-DEPENDENCY; PLASTICITY; APHASIA; EEG; RECOVERY	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated beneficial effects on motor learning. It would be important to obtain a similar enhancement for verbal learning. However, previous studies have mostly assessed short-term effects of rTMS on language performance and the effect on learning is largely unknown. This study examined whether an inhibition of the right Broca homolog has long-term impact on neural processes underlying the acquisition of new words in healthy individuals. Sixteen young participants trained a new-word learning paradigm with rare, mostly unknown objects and their corresponding words immediately after continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) or sham stimulation of right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in a cross-over design. Neural effects were assessed with electroencephalography (EEG) source power analyses during the naming task as well as coherence analyses at rest 1 day before and after training. Inhibition of the right Broca homolog did not affect new word learning performance at the group level. Behavioral and neural responses to cTBS were variable across participants and were associated with the magnitude of resting-state alpha-band coherence between the stimulated area and the rest of the brain before stimulation. Only participants with high intrinsic alpha-band coherence between the stimulated area and the rest of the brain before stimulation showed the expected inhibition during naming and greater learning performance. In conclusion, our study confirms that cTBS can induce lasting modulations of neural processes which are associated with learning, but the effect depends on the individual network state.

Specifically, a recent combined EEG-fMRI study suggested that a prestimulus oscillation at around 7 Hz represents open and closed windows for perceptual integration by modulating connectivity between lower order occipital and higher order parietal brain regions. We here utilized brief event-related transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to specifically modulate this prestimulus 7 Hz oscillation, and the synchrony between parietal and occipital brain regions. To this end we tested for a causal role of this particular prestimulus oscillation for perceptual integration. The EEG was acquired at the same time allowing us to investigate frequency specific after effects phase-locked to stimulation offset. On a behavioural level our results suggest that tACS did modulate perceptual integration, however, in an unexpected manner. On an electrophysiological level our results suggest that brief tACS does induce oscillatory entrainment, as visible in frequency specific activity phase-locked to stimulation offset. Together, our results do not strongly support a causal role of prestimulus 7 Hz oscillations for perceptual integration. However, our results suggest that brief tACS is capable of modulating oscillatory activity in a temporally sensitive manner.

Additionally, effective detection of mild depression at an earlier stage remains an urgent problem that must be solved. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) activities were recorded from 37 participants during processing of facial expression stimuli. With both high-gamma and low-gamma bands, the coherence in the right hemisphere of normal controls was greater than that of mildly depressive subjects, especially for electrodes P8, TP8, C4, FC4, and F8. In the low gamma band, the clustering coefficients of healthy controls in the prefrontal lobe (AF4, AFz, AF3, FC5, F4, and F6) and the parietal lobe (PO3, PO4, and P2) were significantly higher than those of mildly depressive subjects. The ratio of the characteristic path length between the functional network of the mildly depressed group and the small-world network was greater than 1. For the normal group, the ratio was near 1. This research contributes to the study of the cognitive process of mild depression. In our study, the results show closer cooperation in the brain areas of right hemisphere in normal controls during the cognitive process compared with the mildly depressed group, while the activity of the prefrontal and parietal regions in mild depression was significantly lower than that of normal controls. At the same time, in terms of the characteristic path length, the functional network of the mildly depressed group deviates from the small-world network.

In order to determine the number EEG behaviours, the cluster centers of the EEG features were tested using subtractive clustering (SC). The maximum number of three clusters centers was identified and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) was employed to segregate the data features into similar group. In order to test which clusters number gives highest classification, the FCM was executed separately for three clusters and two clusters. Subsequently, the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) was used to classify the three clusters and two clusters and the classification rates were compared. The classification results showed that the number of two clusters give higher classification rate which was 100%.

Topology, Cross-Frequency, and Same-Frequency Band Interactions Shape the Generation of Phase-Amplitude Coupling in a Neural Mass Model of a Cortical Column	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; GRANGER CAUSALITY; GAMMA; THETA; EEG; CORTEX; ALPHA; INTERNEURONS	Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) where the phase of a low-frequency rhythm modulates the amplitude of a higher frequency, is becoming an important indicator of information transmission in the brain. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its generation remain undetermined. A realistic, yet tractable computational model of the phenomenon is thus needed. Here we analyze a neural mass model of a cortical column, comprising fourteen neuronal populations distributed across four layers (L2/3, L4, L5 and L6). A control analysis showed that the conditional transfer entropy (cTE) measure is able to correctly estimate the flow of information between neuronal populations. Then, we computed cTE from the phases to the amplitudes of the oscillations generated in the cortical column. This approach provides information regarding directionality by distinguishing PAC from APC (amplitude-phase coupling), i.e. the information transfer from amplitudes to phases, and can be used to estimate other types of CFC such as amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC) and phase-phase coupling (PPC). While experiments often only focus on one or two PAC combinations (e.g., theta-gamma or alpha-gamma), we found that a cortical column can simultaneously generate almost all possible PAC combinations, depending on connectivity parameters, time constants, and external inputs. PAC interactions with and without an anatomical equivalent (direct and indirect interactions, respectively) were analyzed. We found that the strength of PAC between two populations was strongly correlated with the strength of the effective connections between the populations and, on average, did not depend on whether the PAC connection was direct or indirect. When considering a cortical column circuit as a complex network, we found that neuronal populations making indirect PAC connections had, on average, higher local clustering coefficient, efficiency, and betweenness centrality than populations making direct connections and populations not involved in PAC connections. This suggests that their interactions were more effective when transmitting information. Since approximately 60% of the obtained interactions represented indirect connections, our results highlight the importance of the topology of cortical circuits for the generation of the PAC phenomenon. Finally, our results demonstrated that indirect PAC interactions can be explained by a cascade of direct CFC and same-frequency band interactions, suggesting that PAC analysis of experimental data should be accompanied by the estimation of other types of frequency interactions for an integrative understanding of the phenomenon.

It is widely assumed that memory encoding is associated with information transfer from sensory regions via the rhinal cortex into the hippocampus. Retrieval of information should then be associated with transfer in the reverse direction. However, experimental evidence for this mechanism is still lacking. Here, we show in human intracranial EEG data during two independent recognition memory paradigms that rhinal-hippocampal information flow significantly changes its directionality from encoding to retrieval. Using a novel phase-based method to analyze directional coupling of oscillations, coupling values were more positive (i.e., from rhinal cortex to the hippocampus) during encoding as compared to retrieval. These effects were observed in the delta (1-3 Hz) range where rhinal-hippocampal post-stimulus phase synchronization increased most robustly across both experiments.

Coupling between Theta Oscillations and Cognitive Control Network during Cross-Modal Visual and Auditory Attention: Supramodal vs Modality-Specific Mechanisms	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CORTICAL NETWORKS; BRAIN NETWORKS; HUMAN CORTEX; EEG; DYNAMICS; HUMANS; ALPHA; SENSORIMOTOR; FACILITATION; COMPETITION	Cortical theta band oscillations (4-8 Hz) in EEG signals have been shown to be important for a variety of different cognitive control operations in visual attention paradigms. However the synchronization source of these signals as defined by fMRI BOLD activity and the extent to which theta oscillations play a role in multimodal attention remains unknown. Here we investigated the extent to which cross-modal visual and auditory attention impacts theta oscillations. Using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI paradigm, healthy human participants performed an attentional vigilance task with six cross-modal conditions using naturalistic stimuli. To assess supramodal mechanisms, modulation of theta oscillation amplitude for attention to either visual or auditory stimuli was correlated with BOLD activity by conjunction analysis. Negative correlation was localized to cortical regions associated with the default mode network and positively with ventral premotor areas. Modality-associated attention to visual stimuli was marked by a positive correlation of theta and BOLD activity in fronto-parietal area that was not observed in the auditory condition. A positive correlation of theta and BOLD activity was observed in auditory cortex, while a negative correlation of theta and BOLD activity was observed in visual cortex during auditory attention. The data support a supramodal interaction of theta activity with of DMN function, and modality-associated processes within fronto-parietal networks related to top-down theta related cognitive control in cross-modal visual attention. On the other hand, in sensory cortices there are opposing effects of theta activity during cross-modal auditory attention.

To understand the system's dynamics it is important to detect such recurrence domains, but it is challenging to extract them from experimental neuroscience datasets due to the large trial-to-trial variability. The proposed methodology extracts recurrent metastable states in univariate time series by transforming datasets into their time-frequency representations and computing recurrence plots based on instantaneous spectral power values in various frequency bands. Additionally, a new statistical inference analysis compares different trial recurrence plots with corresponding surrogates to obtain statistically significant recurrent structures. This combination of methods is validated by applying it to two artificial datasets. In a final study of visually evoked Local Field Potentials in partially anesthetized ferrets, the methodology is able to reveal recurrence structures of neural responses with trial-to-trial variability. Focusing on different frequency bands, the delta-band activity is much less recurrent than alpha-band activity. Moreover, a-activity is susceptible to pre-stimuli, while delta-activity is much less sensitive to pre stimuli. This difference in recurrence structures in different frequency bands indicates diverse underlying information processing steps in the brain.

Magnetoencephalography for the Detection of intervention Effects of a Specific Nutrient Combination in Patients With Mild Alzheimer's Disease: Results from an Exploratory Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; brain networks; clinical trial; Alzheimer's disease; medical nutrition	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DIURNAL-VARIATIONS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; BRAIN NETWORKS; EEG; MEG; SOUVENAID; PATTERNS	Synaptic loss is an early pathological finding in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with memory impairment. Changes in macroscopic brain activity measured with electro-and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG) in AD indicate synaptic changes and may therefore serve as markers of intervention effects in clinical trials. EEG peak frequency and functional networks have shown, in addition to improved memory performance, to be sensitive to detect an intervention effect in mild AD patients of the medical food Souvenaid containing the specific nutrient combination Fortasyn (R) Connect, which is designed to enhance synapse formation and function. Here, we explore the value of MEG, with higher spatial resolution than EEG, in identifying intervention effects of the nutrient combination by comparing MEG spectral measures, functional connectivity, and networks between an intervention and a control group. Quantitative markers describing spectral properties, functional connectivity, and graph theoretical aspects of MEG from the exploratory 24-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled Souvenir II MEG sub-study (NTR1975, http://www.trialregister.nl) in drug naive patients with mild AD were compared between a test group (n = 27), receiving Souvenaid, and a control group (n = 28), receiving an isocaloric control product. The groups were unbalanced at screening with respect to Mini-Mental State Examination. Peak frequencies of MEG were compared with EEG peak frequencies, recorded in the same patients at similar time points, were compared with respect to sensitivity to intervention effects. No consistent statistically significant intervention effects were detected. In addition, we found no difference in sensitivity between MEG and EEG peak frequency. This exploratory study could not unequivocally establish the value of MEG in detecting interventional effects on brain activity, possibly due to small sample size and unbalanced study groups. We found no indication that the difference could be attributed to a lack of sensitivity of MEG compared with EEG. MEG in randomized controlled trials is feasible but its value to disclose intervention effects of Souvenaid in mild AD patients needs to be studied further.	[van Straaten, Elisabeth C.

Dual temporal encoding mechanisms in human auditory cortex: Evidence from MEG and EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory cortex; Auditory steady state response; Envelope following response; Temporal encoding; Gamma band response	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; AMPLITUDE-MODULATED SOUNDS; HUMAN BRAIN; REPETITIVE TRANSIENTS; AWAKE MONKEY; SPEECH; OSCILLATIONS; TONES; TIME; PERCEPTION	Current hypotheses about language processing advocate an integral relationship between encoding of temporal information and linguistic processing in the brain. All such explanations must accommodate the evident ability of the perceptual system to process both slow and fast time scales in speech. However most cortical neurons are limited in their capability to precisely synchronise to temporal modulations at rates faster than about 50 Hz. Hence, a central question in auditory neurophysiology concerns how the full range of perceptually relevant modulation rates might be encoded in the cerebral cortex. Here we show with concurrent noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements that the human auditory cortex transitions between a phase-locked (PL) mode of responding to modulation rates below about 50 Hz, and a non-phase-locked (NPL) mode at higher rates. Precisely such dual response modes are predictable from the behaviours of single neurons in auditory cortices of non-human primates. Our data point to a common mechanistic explanation for the single neuron andMEG/EEG results and support the hypothesis that two distinct types of neuronal encoding mechanisms are employed by the auditory cortex to represent a wide range of temporal modulation rates. This dual encoding model allows slow and fast modulations in speech to be processed in parallel and is therefore consistent with theoretical frameworks in which slow temporal modulations (such as rhythm or syllabic structure) are akin to the contours or edges of visual objects, whereas faster modulations (such as periodicity pitch or phonemic structure) are more like visual texture.

J	Fischer, P; Tan, HL; Pogosyan, A; Brown, P				Fischer, Petra; Tan, Huiling; Pogosyan, Alek; Brown, Peter			High post-movement parietal low-beta power during rhythmic tapping facilitates performance in a stop task	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						finger tapping; motor inhibition; sensorimotor synchronization; stop signal	ANTICIPATORY MOTOR CONTROL; HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; OSCILLATORY SYNCHRONY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; ADAPTATION; TIME; EEG; CONNECTIVITY	Voluntary movements are followed by a post-movement electroencephalography (EEG) beta rebound, which increases with practice and confidence in a task. We hypothesized that greater beta modulation reflects less load on cognitive resources and may thus be associated with faster reactions to new stimuli. EEG was recorded in 17 healthy subjects during rhythmically paced index finger tapping. In a STOP condition, participants had to interrupt the upcoming tap in response to an auditory cue, which was timed such that stopping was successful only in similar to 50% of all trials. In a second condition, participants carried on tapping twice after the stop signal (CONTINUE condition). Thus the conditions were distinct in whether abrupt stopping was required as a second task. Modulation of 12-20Hz power over motor and parietal areas developed with time on each trial and more so in the CONTINUE condition. Reduced modulation in the STOP condition went along with reduced negative mean asynchronies suggesting less confident anticipation of the timing of the next tap. Yet participants were more likely to stop when beta modulation prior to the stop cue was more pronounced. In the STOP condition, expectancy of the stop signal may have increased cognitive load during movement execution given that the task might have to be stopped abruptly. However, within this condition, stopping ability was increased if the preceding tap was followed by a relatively larger beta increase. Significant, albeit weak, correlations confirmed that increased post-movement beta power was associated with faster reactions to new stimuli, consistent with reduced cognitive load.

Time-frequency coefficients at various scales were usually transformed into a 1-D array using only a single or a few signal channels. The steady improvement of biomedical recording techniques has increasingly permitted the registration of a high number of channels. However, WT-PCA is not applicable to high-dimensional recordings due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problem. In this study, we present a multiscale two-directional 2-D principal component analysis method for the efficient and effective extraction of essential feature information from high-dimensional signals. Multiscale matrices constructed in the first step incorporate the spatial correlation and physiological characteristics of subband signals among channels. In the second step, the two-directional 2-D PCA operates on the multiscale matrices to reduce the dimension, rather than vectors in conventional PCA. Results are presented from an experiment to classify 20 hand movements using 89-channel EMG signals recorded in stroke survivors, which illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for a high-dimensional biomedical signal analysis.

Sustained Aftereffect of alpha-tACS Lasts Up to 70 min after Stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); transcranial electrical stimulation (TES); aftereffect; EEG; alpha oscillations	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; INCREASES; DYNAMICS; LEVEL	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been repeatedly demonstrated to increase power of endogenous brain oscillations in the range of the stimulated frequency after stimulation. In the alpha band this aftereffect has been shown to persist for at least 30 min. However, in most experiments the aftereffect exceeded the duration of the measurement. Thus, it remains unclear how the effect develops beyond these 30 min and when it decays. The current study aimed to extend existing findings by monitoring the physiological aftereffect of tACS in the alpha range for an extended period of 90 min post-stimulation. To this end participants received either 20 min of tACS or sham stimulation with intensities below their individual sensation threshold at the individual alpha frequency (IAF). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired during 3 min before and 90 min after stimulation. Subjects performed a visual vigilance task during the whole measurement. While the enhanced power in the individual alpha band did not return back to pre-stimulation baseline in the stimulation group, the difference between stimulation and sham diminishes after 70 min due to a natural alpha increase of the sham group.

The aim of this study was to validate a computational method using EEG covariance (or connectivity) matrices to detect a change in brain activity related to breathing. In 17 healthy subjects, EEG was recorded during resting unloaded breathing (RB), voluntary sniffs, and breathing against an inspiratory threshold load (ITL). EEG were analyzed by the specially developed covariance-based classifier, event-related potentials, and time-frequency (T-F) distributions. Nine subjects repeated the protocol. The classifier could accurately detect ITL and sniffs compared with the reference period of RB. For ITL, EEG-based detection was superior to airflow-based detection (P < 0.05). A coincident improvement in EEG-airflow correlation in ITL compared with RB (P < 0.05) confirmed that EEG detection relates to breathing. Premotor potential incidence was significantly higher before inspiration in sniffs and ITL compared with RB (P < 0.05), but T-F distributions revealed a significant difference between sniffs and RB only (P < 0.05). Intraclass correlation values ranged from poor (-0.2) to excellent (1.0). Thus, as for conventional event-related potential analysis, the covariance-based classifier can accurately predict a change in brain state related to a change in respiratory state, and given its capacity for near "real-time" detection, it is suitable to monitor the respiratory state in respiratory and critically ill patients in the development of a brain-ventilator interface.

Emotion recognition, thus, plays an important role in the design of HMI. Electroencephalogram (EEG) shows the internal emotional state changes of a person very effectively as compared to other traditional methods such as face recognition, gesture recognition, speech recognition, etc. Thus, EEG has gained the attention of researchers in recent years for recording brain activity in HMI design. Emotion recognition can be regarded as a pattern recognition task, hence it includes basic steps likes preprocessing, feature extraction and feature classification. Many different techniques exist for extracting important features from the EEG signal such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Statistical features, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Frequency domain feature extraction using Fourier Transform (FT), Short time Fourier Transform (STFT), etc. The techniques implemented in this paper are Higher Order Crossings (HOC), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Hjorth features. A comparative study of these methods is undertaken.	[Patil, Anita; Panat, A.

Methods: Electroencephalographic data were compared between young (age 23 +/- 3) and older adults (age 64 +/- 7) in terms of event-related spectral perturbation in alpha and beta bands during a go/nogo task. Results: Age selectively influenced beta rhythms, with younger compared to older adults showing, first, less attenuation during movement preparation and execution, and, second, a greater rebound after movement end. Alpha rhythms differed after response inhibition, with an additional alpha rebound occurring in older, but not younger adults. Conclusion: The results indicate neural over-recruitment in healthy aging, which appears most likely linked to alterations in multiple factors associated with sensory and cognitive aspects of motor control, and which does not consistently or directly impact response speed. Significance: The results imply that sensorimotor alpha and beta rhythms may reflect different neural trajectories in aging. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Here, we show that EGO properties dynamically change during the sensory-evoked response, including (i) a progressive decrease in the EGOs' dominant frequency, (ii) a decrease in the gamma trough amplitudes, and (iii) a reduction in the multiple unit firings in association with each consecutive EGOs' trough. Circular statistics of the multiple unit activity in relation to EGOs revealed a progressive decrease in the Rayleigh vector amplitude yet without any significant change in its angle. Thus, EGO properties and synchronization of the cortical barrel units dynamically change through the time course of the sensory-evoked response in the neonatal rat barrel cortex.

Physiological and Perceptual Sensory Attenuation Have Different Underlying Neurophysiological Correlates	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; force matching; gamma oscillations; median nerve stimulation; sensory attenuation; somatosensory cortex	SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEDIAN NERVE-STIMULATION; TACTILE STIMULATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; PREDICTION; MODULATION; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; FORCE	Sensory attenuation, the top-down filtering or gating of afferent information, has been extensively studied in two fields: physiological and perceptual. Physiological sensory attenuation is represented as a decrease in the amplitude of the primary and secondary components of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) before and during movement. Perceptual sensory attenuation, described using the analogy of a persons' inability to tickle oneself, is a reduction in the perception of the afferent input of a self-produced tactile sensation due to the central cancellation of the reafferent signal by the efference copy of the motor command to produce the action. The fields investigating these two areas have remained isolated, so the relationship between them is unclear. The current study delivered median nerve stimulation to produce SEPs during a force-matching paradigm (used to quantify perceptual sensory attenuation) in healthy human subjects to determine whether SEP gating correlated with the behavior. Our results revealed that these two forms of attenuation have dissociable neurophysiological correlates and are likely functionally distinct, which has important implications for understanding neurological disorders in which one form of sensory attenuation but not the other is impaired. Time-frequency analyses revealed a negative correlation over sensorimotor cortex between gamma-oscillatory activity and the magnitude of perceptual sensory attenuation. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that gamma-band power is related to prediction error and that this might underlie perceptual sensory attenuation.

Abnormal time course of low beta modulation in non-fluent preschool children: A magnetoencephalographic study of rhythm tracking	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Stuttering; Beta oscillations; Children; Rhythm; Timing; EEG/MEG	SPEECH PRODUCTION; OSCILLATIONS; SYSTEMS; FLUENT; DEFICIT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; LATERALIZATION; NETWORK; GAMMA; EEG	Stuttering is a disorder of speech affecting millions of people around the world. Whilst the exact aetiology of stuttering remains unknown, it has been hypothesised that it is a disorder of the neuralmechanisms that support speech timing. In this article, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine activity from auditory regions of the brain in stuttering and non-stuttering children aged 3-9 years. For typically developing children, we found that MEG oscillations in the beta band responded to rhythmic sounds with a peak near the time of stimulus onset. In contrast, stuttering children showed an opposite phase of beta band envelope, with a trough of activity at stimulus onset. These results suggest that stuttering may result from abnormalities in predictive brain responses which are reflected in abnormal entrainment of the beta band envelope to rhythmic sounds.

We investigate EEG activity of healthy partipants executing a reaching task under variable degrees of prism-induced visuo-motor distortion and visual occlusion of the initial arm trajectory. This task introduces directional errors of different magnitudes. The discrepancy between predicted and actual movement directions (i.e. the error), at the time when visual feedback (hand appearance) became available, elicits a signal that triggers on-line movement correction. Analysis were performed on 25 EEG channels. For each participant, the median value of the angular error of all reaching trials was used to partition the EEG epochs into high-and low-error conditions. We computed event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) time-locked either to visual feedback or to the onset of movement correction. ERSP time-locked to the onset of visual feedback showed that fm. increased in the high-but not in the low-error condition with an approximate time lag of 200 ms. Moreover, when single epochs were sorted by the degree of motor error, fm. started to increase when a certain level of error was exceeded and, then, scaled with error magnitude. When ERSP were time-locked to the onset of movement correction, the fm. increase anticipated this event with an approximate time lead of 50 ms. During successive trials, an error reduction was observed which was associated with indices of adaptations (i.e., aftereffects) suggesting the need to explore if theta oscillations may facilitate learning. To our knowledge this is the first study where the EEG signal recorded during reaching movements was time-locked to the onset of the error visual feedback. This allowed us to conclude that theta oscillations putatively generated by anterior cingulate cortex activation are implicated in error processing in semi-naturalistic motor behaviours.

Binaural beats increase interhemispheric alpha-band coherence between auditory cortices	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Alpha band; EEG; Phase synchrony; Dichotic digit test; Interhemispheric synchronization	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG ACTIVITY; INTEGRATION; SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; CAT; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS	Binaural beats (BBs) are an auditory illusion occurring when two tones of slightly different frequency are presented separately to each ear. BBs have been suggested to alter physiological and cognitive processes through synchronization of the brain hemispheres. To test this, we recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) at rest and while participants listened to BBs or a monaural control condition during which both tones were presented to both ears. We calculated for each condition the interhemispheric coherence, which expressed the synchrony between neural oscillations of both hemispheres. Compared to monaural beats and resting state, BBs enhanced interhemispheric coherence between the auditory cortices. Beat frequencies in the alpha (10 Hz) and theta (4 Hz) frequency range both increased interhemispheric coherence selectively at alpha frequencies. In a second experiment, we evaluated whether this coherence increase has a behavioral aftereffect on binaural listening. No effects were observed in a dichotic digit task performed immediately after BBs presentation. Our results suggest that BBs enhance alpha-band oscillation synchrony between the auditory cortices during auditory stimulation. This effect seems to reflect binaural integration rather than entrainment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Detection of Sleep Apnea Using Sub-frame Based Temporal Variation of Energy in Beta Band in EEG	2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WIE CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING (IEEE WIECON-ECE 2016)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International WIE Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (IEEE WIECON-ECE)	DEC 19-21, 2016	AISSMS IOIT, Pune, INDIA	IEEE, IEEE Pune Sect, WIE Affin Grp, IEEE Bangalore Sect, WIE Affin Grp	AISSMS IOIT	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis; Sleep Apnea; Sub-frame; Beta band energy; temporal variation; feature extraction; classification		Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that affects one's breathing during sleep. A large number of people all over the world are suffering from this disease. Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides electrical activity of the brain signal that enables physicians to diagnose and monitor sleep apnea events. In this paper, an efficient scheme for classifying apnea and non-apnea events of an apnea patient is proposed based on temporal variation of Beta band energy in a frame of EEG data. Unlike conventional approaches, instead of extracting features from the whole frame at a time, a given test frame of EEG signal is divided into overlapping sub-frames and spectral characteristics are extracted from each pre-processed sub-frame. By investigating the spectro-temporal characteristics of all the traditional frequency bands of EEG signal, it is found that the temporal variation of spectral energy in Beta band plays the dominant role in classifying apnea and non-apnea events. Statistical features are extracted from the temporal pattern of Beta band energy and are used in K nearest neighborhood classifier. Extensive experimentation is carried out on several apnea patients with various apnea indices and a very satisfactory apnea detection performance is achieved in comparison to that obtained by some existing methods.

As the concept of functional connectivity has been introduced into neuroscience research in the recent years, the aim of this study is to investigate the functional connectivity in the brain when working memory load reaches the capacity. 32-channel electroencephalographs (EEGs) were recorded for 16 healthy subjects, while they performed a visual working memory task with load 1-6. Individual working memory capacity was calculated according to behavioral results. Short-time Fourier transform was used to determine the principal frequency band (theta band) related to working memory. The functional connectivity among EEGs was measured by the directed transform function (DTF) via spectral Granger causal analysis. The capacity was 4 calculated from the behavioral results. The power was focused in the frontal midline region. The strongest connectivity strengths of EEG theta components from load 1 to 6 distributed in the frontal midline region. The curve of DTF values vs load numbers showed that DTF increased from load 1 to 4, peaked at load 4, then decreased after load 4. This study finds that the functional connectivity between EEGs, described quantitatively by DTF, became less strong when working memory load exceeded the capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of twenty patients undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring. EEG and ECoG were recorded simultaneously from the central and occipital scalp and subjacent subdural electrodes removed (median 46 mm, interquartile 27-65) from the craniotomy. The power spectral density (PSD) of artifact-free EEG and ECoG segments and ratio of the scalp EEG to subjacent ECoG PSD was calculated. Results: Overall both ECoG and scalp EEG power decreased by over three orders of magnitude from delta to gamma frequency band with an empirical inverse power relationship. The ratio of scalp EEG to ECoG PSD decreased across the delta and theta frequency bands, remained the same across the alpha, beta and low gamma bands, but increased at the higher frequency bands. Conclusions: EEG PSD mirrored changes in ECoG PSD across the frequency bands. As ECoG power continued to decrease above 42 Hz, extracranial voltage sources contributed to a greater fraction of scalp EEG power. Significance: Monitoring the gamma frequency band using scalp EEG was limited by low power on ECoG and masking by extracranial voltage sources.

Our objective is to automatically redact false HFO detections, facilitating clinical use of interictal HFOs. Methods: Intracranial EEG data from 23 patients were processed with automated detectors of HFOs and artifacts. HFOs not concurrent with artifacts were labeled quality HFOs (qHFOs). Methods were validated by human review on a subset of 2000 events. The correlation of qHFO rates with the seizure onset zone (SOZ) was assessed via (1) a retrospective asymmetry measure and (2) a novel quasi-prospective algorithm to identify SOZ. Results: Human review estimated that less than 12% of qHFOs are artifacts, whereas 78.5% of redacted HFOs are artifacts. The qHFO rate was more correlated with SOZ (p = 0.020, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and resected volume (p = 0.0037) than baseline detections. Using qHFOs, our algorithm was able to determine SOZ in 60% of the ILAE Class I patients, with all algorithmically-determined SOZs fully within the resected volumes. Conclusions: The algorithm reduced false-positive HFO detections, improving the precision of the HFO-biomarker. Significance: These methods provide a feasible strategy for HFO detection in real-time, continuous EEG with minimal human monitoring of data quality.

Correlation of Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography- (LORETA-) defined current source density time series were computed between two cortical areas (region of interest, ROI). Analyses were based on broad-band EEGfC results. Groups were compared by statistical parametric network (SPN) method. Statistically significant differences between group EEGfC values were emphasized at p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparison by local false discovery rate (FDR). Results: (1) Bilaterally increased beta EEGfC occurred in the BECTS group as compared to the controls. Greatest beta abnormality emerged between frontal and frontal, as well as frontal and temporal ROIs. (2) Locally increased EEGfC emerged in all frequency bands in the right parietal area. Conclusions: Areas of increased EEGfC topographically correspond to cortical areas that, based on relevant literature, are related to speech and attention deficit in BELTS children.

Modern neuroimaging techniques have expanded the scientific interest in the study of brain connectivity to include the intact as well as disordered brain. Methods: In this review, we describe the most common techniques used to measure functional and structural connectivity, including resting state functional MRI, diffusion MRI, and electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography coherence. We also review the most common analytical approaches used for examining brain interconnectivity associated with these various imaging methods. Results: This review presents a critical analysis of the assumptions, as well as methodological limitations, of each imaging and analysis approach. Conclusions: The overall goal of this review is to provide the reader with an introduction to evaluating the scientific methods underlying investigations that probe the human connectome.

Test-retest reliability of a single-channel, wireless EEG system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Test-retest reliability; Portable; NeuroSky ThinkGear; Adults; Youth	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SPECTRAL PARAMETERS; POWER SPECTRA; LONG-TERM; CHILDREN; PERFORMANCE; DEPRESSION; STABILITY; ANXIETY; ADULTS	Recording systems to acquire electroencephalogram (EEG) data are traditionally lab-based. However, there are shortcomings to this method, and the ease of use and portability of emerging wireless EEG technologies offer a promising alternative. A previous validity study demonstrated data derived from a single-channel, wireless system (NeuroSky ThinkGear, San Jose, California) is comparable to EEG recorded from conventional lab-based equipment. The current study evaluated the reliability of this portable system using test-retest and reliable change analyses. Relative power (RP) of delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands was derived from EEG data obtained from a single electrode over FP1 in 19 healthy youth (10-17 years old), 21 healthy adults (1828 years old), and 19 healthy older adults (55-79 years old), during eyes-open, eyes-closed, auditory oddball, and visual n-back conditions. Intra-class correlations (ICCs) and Coefficients of Repeatability (CRs) were calculated from RP data re-collected one-day, one-week, and one-month later. Participants' levels of mood and attention were consistent across sessions. Eyes-closed resting EEG measurements using the portable device were reproducible (ICCs 0.76-0.85) at short and longer retest intervals in all three participant age groups. While still of at least fair reliability (ICCs 0.57-0.85), EEG obtained during eyes-open paradigms was less stable, and any change observed over time during these testing conditions can be interpreted utilizing the CR values provided. Combined with existing validity data, these findings encourage application of the portable EEG system for the study of brain function. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phase of Spontaneous Slow Oscillations during Sleep Influences Memory-Related Processing of Auditory Cues	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						memory consolidation; memory reactivation; phase; slow oscillation; slow-wave sleep	REACTIVATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; REPLAY; EEG; NEOCORTEX	Slow oscillations during slow-wave sleep (SWS) may facilitate memory consolidation by regulating interactions between hippocampal and cortical networks. Slow oscillations appear as high-amplitude, synchronized EEG activity, corresponding to upstates of neuronal depolarization and downstates of hyperpolarization. Memory reactivations occur spontaneously during SWS, and can also be induced by presenting learning-related cues associated with a prior learning episode during sleep. This technique, targeted memory reactivation (TMR), selectively enhances memory consolidation. Given that memory reactivation is thought to occur preferentially during the slow-oscillation upstate, we hypothesized that TMR stimulation effects would depend on the phase of the slow oscillation. Participants learned arbitrary spatial locations for objects that were each paired with a characteristic sound (eg, cat-meow). Then, during SWS periods of an afternoon nap, one-half of the sounds were presented at low intensity. When object location memory was subsequently tested, recall accuracy was significantly better for those objects cued during sleep. We report here for the first time that this memory benefit was predicted by slow-wave phase at the time of stimulation. For cued objects, location memories were categorized according to amount of forgetting from pre-to post-nap. Conditions of high versus low forgetting corresponded to stimulation timing at different slow-oscillation phases, suggesting that learning-related stimuli were more likely to be processed and trigger memory reactivation when they occurred at the optimal phase of a slow oscillation. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of memory reactivation during sleep, supporting the idea that reactivation is most likely during cortical upstates.

Material/Methods: C57BL/6 mice were administered 10% ethanol in drinking water for 9 weeks. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring was then used to assess seizure frequency after alcohol and rapamycin treatment. In addition, mouse neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells were treated ethanol for 3 days and subsequently treated with AKT inhibitor LY294002 for 2-12 h. The in vitro kinase assay was performed for determining mTOR activity. Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of P-AKT, P-S6K, and P-S6. Result: Long-term ethanol treatment markedly increased the seizure frequency of C57/BL6 mice over time. Moreover, ethanol treatment increased the expression level of P-S6 over time. Ethanol-induced seizure can be reversed by rapamycin. In addition, the in vitro kinase assay showed mTOR activity was activated by ethanol. Compared with NG108-15 cells treated without both ethanol and LY294002, ethanol increased the expression level of P-AKT, P-S6K, and P-S6, whereas LY294002 had opposite effects on expression levels of these proteins. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that long-term alcohol intake increases the risk of epilepsy via activation of mTOR signaling. Moreover, ethanol-induced mTOR activation may be dependent on the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. The key molecules involved in AKT-mTOR signaling pathway may serve as potential targets in the treatment of epilepsy.

In particular, oscillations have been suggested to play a major role in formation of communication channels between brain regions. It has been previously suggested that gamma coherence increases during communication between hemispheres when subjects perceive a horizontal motion in Stroboscopic Alternative Motion (SAM) stimulus. In addition, disruption of this coherence may change the horizontal perception of SAM. In this study, we investigated the changes of Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC) in EEG signals from parietal and occipital cortices during horizontal and vertical perception of SAM. Our results suggested that while the strength of CFC in parietal electrodes showed no significant change, CFC in P3-P4 electrode-pair demonstrated a significant correlation during horizontal perception of SAM. Therefore, the CFC between theta- and gamma-band oscillations seems to be correlated with changes in functional interactions between brain regions. Accordingly, we propose that in addition to gamma coherence, CFC is perhaps another neurophysiological mechanism involved in neural communication.

J	Grandy, TH; Garrett, DD; Schmiedek, F; Werkle-Bergner, M				Grandy, Thomas H.; Garrett, Douglas D.; Schmiedek, Florian; Werkle-Bergner, Markus			On the estimation of brain signal entropy from sparse neuroimaging data	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PHYSIOLOGICAL TIME-SERIES; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; ALPHA; COMPLEXITY; VARIABILITY; NOISE; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; AGE	Multi-scale entropy (MSE) has been recently established as a promising tool for the analysis of the moment-to-moment variability of neural signals. Appealingly, MSE provides a measure of the predictability of neural operations across the multiple time scales on which the brain operates. An important limitation in the application of the MSE to some classes of neural signals is MSE's apparent reliance on long time series. However, this sparse-data limitation in MSE computation could potentially be overcome via MSE estimation across shorter time series that are not necessarily acquired continuously (e.g., in fMRI block-designs). In the present study, using simulated, EEG, and fMRI data, we examined the dependence of the accuracy and precision of MSE estimates on the number of data points per segment and the total number of data segments. As hypothesized, MSE estimation across discontinuous segments was comparably accurate and precise, despite segment length. A key advance of our approach is that it allows the calculation of MSE scales not previously accessible from the native segment lengths.

A total of 26 schizophrenia patients who received MECT were recruited. EEG recording was initiated at 30 min before 1st and 6th MECT and terminated on the 2nd day. Images without artifacts were selected for the analysis of delta,theta,alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta bands. The wave energy at each frequency, index of waves at different bands from the same lead, index of waves at the same band from different leads, time of epileptic discharge, time of resting state, and time to the stable EEG were determined and compared. Results: The energy of slow waves increased. a waves reduced, but. waves increased in the frontotemporal area. The index of. waves increased. After resting state, brainwaves first occurred in the frontal area. Significant difference was observed in the time to waves returning to normal (P = 0.05). Conclusions: After MECT, the. waves in the same lead increases, and its energy also elevates; a wave in the frontotemporal area reduces; there is transient reduction in cerebral function during MECT. After electric resting state, brainwaves mainly occur in the frontal area, and the time to brainwaves returning to normal reduces over time after MECT.

Recently, single-trial sigma-bursts were detected in human scalp EEG using 29-channel low-noise recordings in an electromagnetically shielded room. To achieve clinical applicability, this study aimed to establish a protocol using only 8 EEG channels in an unshielded environment and to quantify the variability of sigma-bursts. Methods: Median nerve SEPs were recorded in 10 healthy subjects using a custom-built low-noise EEG amplifier. A detection algorithm for single-trial sigma-bursts was trained as combination of spatiotemporal filters and a non-linear classifier. The single-trial responses were probed for the presence of significant increases of amplitude and variability. Results: Single-trial sigma-burst detection succeeded with Detection Rates and Positive Predictive Values above 80% in subjects with high SNR. A significant inter-trial variability in the amplitudes of early low-frequency SEPs and sigma-bursts could be demonstrated. Conclusions: Single-trial sigma-bursts can be detected on scalp-EEG using only 8 EEG channels in an electromagnetically disturbed environment. The combination of dedicated hardware and detection algorithms allows quantifying and describing their variability. Significance: The variability of population spikes in the human somatosensory cortex can be traced non-invasively in a clinical setting. (c) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Participants were assigned to either an audio exercise in mindful breathing or an audio control condition, and then completed a Stroop task while EEG was recorded. The primary EEG measure of interest was error-related alpha suppression (ERAS), an index of self-monitoring in which alpha power is reduced, suggesting mental engagement, following errors compared to correct responses. Participants in the mindful-breathing condition showed increased alpha power during the listening exercise and enhanced ERAS during the subsequent Stroop task. These results indicate enhanced error-monitoring among those in the mindful-breathing group.

The identification of direct links between neuroimaging signals and corresponding genetic factors can reveal cellular-level mechanisms behind the measured macroscopic signals and contribute to the use of imaging signals as probes of genetic function. To uncover possible genetic determinants of the most prominent brain signal oscillation, the parieto-occipital 10-Hz alpha rhythm, we measured spontaneous brain activity with magnetoencephalography in 210 healthy siblings while the subjects were resting, with eyes closed and open. The reactivity of the alpha rhythm was quantified from the difference spectra between the two conditions. We focused on three measures: peak frequency, peak amplitude and the width of the main spectral peak. In accordance with earlier electroencephalography studies, spectral peak amplitude was highly heritable (h(2)>0.75). Variance component-based analysis of 28000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers revealed linkage for both the width and the amplitude of the spectral peak. The strongest linkage was detected for the width of the spectral peak over the left parieto-occipital cortex on chromosome 10 (LOD=2.814, nominal P<0.03). This genomic region contains several functionally plausible genes, including GRID1 and ATAD1 that regulate glutamate receptor channels mediating synaptic transmission, NRG3 with functions in brain development and HRT7 involved in the serotonergic system and circadian rhythm. Our data suggest that the alpha oscillation is in part genetically regulated, and that it may be possible to identify its regulators by genetic analyses on a realistically modest number of samples.

However, the frequency band divisions in rats were typically based on empirical spectral distribution from limited channels information. In the present study, functionally relevant frequency bands across vigilance states and brain regions were identified using factor analysis based on 9 channels EEG signals recorded from multiple brain areas in rats. We found that frequency band divisions varied both across vigilance states and brain regions. In particular, theta oscillations during REM sleep were subdivided into two bands, 5-7 and 8-11 Hz corresponding to the tonic and phasic stages, respectively. The spindle activities of SWS were different along the anterior-posterior axis, lower oscillations (similar to 16 Hz) in frontal regions and higher in parietal (similar to 21 Hz). The delta and theta activities co-varied in the visual and auditory cortex during wakeful rest. In addition, power spectra of beta oscillations were significantly decreased in association cortex during REM sleep compared with wakeful rest. These results provide us some new insights into understand the brain oscillations across vigilance states, and also indicate that the spatial factor should not be ignored when considering the frequency band divisions in rats.

Using selected TF distributions (TFDs), TF feature extraction is performed on multi-channel recordings using channel fusion and feature fusion approaches. Following the findings of previous studies, a TF feature set is defined to include three complementary categories: signal related features, statistical features and image features. Multi-class strategies are then used to improve the classification algorithm robustness to artifacts. The optimal subset of TF features is selected using the wrapper method with sequential forward feature selection (SFFS). In addition, a new proposed measure for TF feature selection is shown to improve the sensitivity of the classifier (while slightly reducing total accuracy and specificity). As an illustration, the TF approach is applied to the design of a system for detection of seizure activity in real newborn EEG signals. Experimental results indicate that: (1) The compact kernel distribution (CKD) outperforms other TFDs in classification accuracy; (2) a feature fusion strategy gives better classification than a channel fusion strategy; e.g. using all TF features, the CKD achieves a classification accuracy of 82% with feature fusion, which is 4% more than the channel fusion approach; (3) the SFFS wrapper feature selection method improves the classification performance for all TFDs; e.g. total accuracy is improved by 4.6%; (4) the multi-class strategy improves the seizure detection accuracy in the presence of artifacts; e.g. a total accuracy of 86.61% with one vs. one multi-class approach is achieved i.e. 0.91% more than the binary classification approach. The results obtained on a large practical real data set confirm the improved performance capability of TF features for knowledge based systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG signals are highly subject specific and non-stationary. One of the most challenging tasks is to classify motion intentions since the recorded EEG signals have inherent non-stationarities which are due to changes in the signal properties over time within as well as across sessions. Thus it becomes difficult to achieve a stable operation of BCI. Method: We present a novel filtering method based on the multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) using subject independent BCI (MEMD-SI-BCI) for classification of motor imagery (MI) based EEG signals to achieve enhanced BCI. A subject independent BCI can be used immediately by the new user without using the user's training data. The MEMD method helps to utilize the cross channel information and enhance localization properties. It decomposes multichannel EEG signals into a set of multivariate intrinsic mode functions (MIMFs). These MIMFs can be considered narrow-band, amplitude and frequency modulated (AM-FM) signals. The statistical property, namely, mean frequency measure of these MIMFs has been used to combine these MIMFs to compute the enhanced EEG signals which have major contributions due to mu and beta rhythms over the motor cortex region. The objective of the proposed method is to filter EEG signals before feature extraction and classification to enhance the features separability and ultimately the BCI task classification performance. The common spatial pattern (CSP) feature has been computed from the enhanced EEG signals and has been used as a feature set for classification of left hand and right hand MIs using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based classification method. Results: We have achieved an improvement of > 11% in the evaluation stage using the MEMD-SI-BCI method when compared with SI-BCI. Significance: This study helps to develop BCI systems with intuitive motor imaginations, thus facilitates broad use of noninvasive BCIs. We have evaluated our method on publicly available BCI competition IV dataset 2A and have obtained improved performance.

Abnormal Frontal Theta Oscillations Underlie the Cognitive Flexibility Deficits in Children With High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						autism spectrum disorders; cognitive flexibility; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; theta; event-related spectral perturbation	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; CARD SORTING TEST; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; COMPUTERIZED VERSION; REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; SHIFTING-DEFICITS; EEG-ALPHA	Objective: Deficits in cognitive flexibility have been suggested to underlie the repetitive and stereotyped behavior in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because cognitive flexibility is primarily mediated by the frontal lobe, where structural and functional abnormalities have been extensively found in these individuals, it is conceivable that their deficits in cognitive flexibility are related to abnormal activations of the frontal lobe. The present study investigates cognitive flexibility and its underlying neurophysiological activities as indicated by theta oscillations in children with ASD. Method: Twenty-five children with high-functioning ASD and 25 IQ-and age-matched typically developing (TD) children were subjected to neuropsychological assessments on cognitive flexibility and electroencephalography recordings. Results: The children with ASD performed significantly worse than the TD children across the tasks of cognitive flexibility, including the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). These children also demonstrated a reduced increase of the theta power localized in multiple brain regions, including various sectors of the frontal lobe at the late stage (i.e., 600 ms-900 ms poststimulus interval) but not the early stage (i.e., 250 ms-550 ms poststimulus interval) of the performance of the modified WCST. The suppressed late frontal theta activities were further shown to be significantly correlated with a poorer performance on the cognitive flexibility measures. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that abnormal activations of multiple cortical regions, especially the frontal lobe, form the neural basis of the cognitive flexibility deficits in children with ASD. In addition, we found an EEG marker of cognitive flexibility which could be used to monitor treatment outcomes objectively.

Background electroencephalogram oscillations are also different between periods with (phasic state) and periods without (tonic state) eye movements. In Study 1, previous findings analysing electroencephalogram spectral power in phasic and tonic rapid eye movement sleep were replicated, and analyses extended to the high gamma range (52-90 Hz). In Study 2, phasic and tonic spectral power differences within a group of 4-8-year-old children were examined. Based on the polysomnographic data of 20 young adults, the phasic state yielded increased delta and theta power in anterior sites, as well as generally decreased high alpha and beta power in comparison to the tonic state. Moreover, phasic periods exhibited greater spectral power in the lower and the higher gamma band. Interestingly, children (n = 18) exhibited a different pattern, showing increased activity in the low alpha range during phasic periods. Moreover, during phasic in contrast to tonic rapid eye movement sleep, increased low and high gamma and enhanced low gamma band power emerged in anterior and posterior regions, respectively. The current findings show that spectral activity within the high gamma range substantially contributes to the differences between phasic and tonic rapid eye movement sleep, especially in adults. Moreover, the current data underscore the heterogeneity of rapid eye movement sleep, and point to marked differences between young adults and children regarding phasic/tonic electroencephalogram spectral power. These results suggest that the differentiation between phasic and tonic rapid eye movement periods undergoes maturation.

Analysing Wireless EEG based Functional Connectivity Measures with Respect to Change in Environmental Factors	2016 3RD IEEE EMBS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE BHI)	FEB 24-27, 2016	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE EMBS, IEEE, Journal of Biomed & Hlth Informat, IEEE Commun Soc			EXERCISE	In this paper we present a systematic exploration to formulate a predictive model of the human cognitive process with the changing environmental conditions at workplace. We select six different environmental conditions with small change in temperature/ventilation representative of realistic work environment having manual control. EEG data were acquired through 19-channel wireless system from three participants and CO2, Temperature, Relative humidity were recorded throughout the six conditions. The EEG data was pre-processed using an artifact reduction algorithm and 129 neurophysiological features were extracted from functional connectivity measures using complex network analysis. The environmental data were processed to generate 15 time/frequency domain features. Five best features selected through a ranking algorithm for all the variables across the six conditions were processed to formulate a model (environmental parameters as predictors) using retrospective 10-fold cross-validation in conjunction with multiple linear regression. The model was prospectively evaluated over 10 runs on a test set to predict the EEG variable across the six conditions and parameters corresponding to the run producing least root mean square error were reported. Our exploration shows that the condition having no modulation of the ambient environmental parameters reflects the optimum condition for predicting the EEG features using the examined environmental parameters.

Real-Time Detection and Monitoring of Acute Brain Injury Utilizing Evoked Electroencephalographic Potentials	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Animal models; biomarkers; focused ultrasound; somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs); traumatic brain injury (TBI)	INTENSITY FOCUSED ULTRASOUND; CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; TRANSCALLOSAL INHIBITION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; SPREADING DEPRESSION; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; NETWORK ACTIVITY; GOLDEN HOUR; IN-VIVO; EEG	Rapid detection and diagnosis of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can significantly improve the prognosis for recovery. Helmet-mounted sensors that detect impact severity based on measurements of acceleration or pressure show promise for aiding triage and transport decisions in active, field environments such as professional sports or military combat. The detected signals, however, report on the mechanics of an impact rather than directly indicating the presence and severity of an injury. We explored the use of cortical somatosensory evoked electroencephalographic potentials (SSEPs) to detect and track, in real-time, neural electrophysiological abnormalities within the first hour following head injury in an animal model. To study the immediate electrophysiological effects of injury in vivo, we developed an experimental paradigm involving focused ultrasound that permits continuous, real-time measurements and minimizes mechanical artifact. Injury was associated with a dramatic reduction of amplitude over the damaged hemisphere directly after the injury. The amplitude systematically improved over time but remained significantly decreased at one hour, compared with baseline. In contrast, at one hour there was a concomitant enhancement of the cortical SSEP amplitude evoked from the uninjured hemisphere. Analysis of the inter-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) also revealed significant changes in low-frequency components and an increase in EEG entropy up to 30 minutes after injury, likely reflecting altered EEG reactivity to somatosensory stimuli. Injury-induced alterations in SSEPs were also observed using noninvasive epidermal electrodes, demonstrating viability of practical implementation. These results suggest cortical SSEPs recorded at just a few locations by head-mounted sensors and associated multiparametric analyses could potentially be used to rapidly detect and monitor brain injury in settings that normally present significant levels of mechanical and electrical noise.

To address this, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) from 22 subjects while presenting a set of individually matched whole musical excerpts varying in valence and arousal. Independent component analysis was applied to decompose the EEG data into functionally distinct brain processes. A k-means cluster analysis calculated on the basis of a combination of spatial (scalp topography and dipole location mapped onto the Montreal Neurological Institute brain template) and functional (spectra) characteristics revealed 10 clusters referring to brain areas typically involved in music and emotion processing, namely in the proximity of thalamic-limbic and orbitofrontal regions as well as at frontal, fronto-parietal, parietal, parieto-occipital, temporo-occipital and occipital areas. This analysis revealed that arousal was associated with a suppression of power in the alpha frequency range. On the other hand, valence was associated with an increase in theta frequency power in response to excerpts inducing happiness compared to sadness. These findings are partly compatible with the model proposed by Heller, arguing that the frontal lobe is involved in modulating valenced experiences (the left frontal hemisphere for positive emotions) whereas the right parieto-temporal region contributes to the emotional arousal.

Cytoarchitectonic studies have shown that the structure of those microcircuits differs between cortical regions, but very little is known about interregional differences of their intrinsic dynamics at a macro-scale in human. We developed here a new method aiming at mapping the dynamical properties of cortical microcircuits non-invasively using the coupling between robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography. We recorded the responses evoked by the stimulation of 18 cortical targets largely covering the accessible neocortex in 22 healthy volunteers. Specific data processing methods were developed to map the local source activity of each cortical target, which showed inter-regional differences with very good interhemispheric reproducibility. Functional signatures of cortical microcircuits were further studied using spatio-temporal decomposition of local source activities in order to highlight principal brain modes. The identified brain modes revealed that cortical areas with similar intrinsic dynamical properties could be distributed either locally or not, with a spatial signature that was somewhat reminiscent of resting state networks. Our results provide the proof of concept of "functional cytoarchitectonics", that would guide the parcellation of the human cortex using not only its cytoarchitecture but also its intrinsic responses to local perturbations. This opens new avenues for brain modelling and physiopathology readouts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we present a new method, namely the irregular-resampling auto-spectral analysis (IRASA), to separate fractal and oscillatory components in the power spectrum of neurophysiological signal according to their distinct temporal and spectral characteristics. In this method, we irregularly resampled the neural signal by a set of non-integer factors, and statistically summarized the auto-power spectra of the resampled signals to separate the fractal component from the oscillatory component in the frequency domain. We tested this method on simulated data and demonstrated that IRASA could robustly separate the fractal component from the oscillatory component. In addition, applications of IRASA to macaque electrocorticography and human magnetoencephalography data revealed a greater power-law exponent of fractal dynamics during sleep compared to wakefulness. The temporal fluctuation in the broadband power of the fractal component revealed characteristic dynamics within and across the eyes-closed, eyes-open and sleep states. These results demonstrate the efficacy and potential applications of this method in analyzing electrophysiological signatures of large-scale neural circuit activity.

Yet, while non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is commonly included in preclinical safety studies, pre-dose or post-dose EEG assessments are not. Industry practices as they relate to preclinical seizure liability and sleep assessments are not well characterized and the extent of preclinical EEG testing varies between organizations. In the current paper, we discuss the various aspects of preclinical EEG to characterize drug-induced seizure risk and sleep disturbances, as well as describe the use of these data in a regulatory context. An overview of EEG technology-its correct application and its limitations, as well as best practices for setting up the animal models is presented. Sleep and seizure detection are discussed in detail. A regulatory perspective on the use of EEG data is provided and, tying together the previous topics is a discussion of the translational aspects of EEG. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, considering different levels of arousing elicitations, how such a brain dynamics is affected by emotional pleasant/ unpleasant (valence) elicitation is not fully understood. To this aim, we propose an Electroencephalographic (EEG)-based preliminary study in which 22 healthy subjects were elicited through affective pictures gathered from the International Affective Picture System. Considering 4 arousing levels, each of which including two valence levels (pleasant and unpleasant), we investigated EEG power spectra and functional connectivity. Focusing on gamma oscillations (> 32 Hz), because of their known sensitivity to valence changes, results revealed no significant changes between pleasant/unpleasant elicitation when lower and higher arousing level occurred. Conversely, valence changes in the intermediate arousing sessions were associated with changes in the prefrontal and occipital regions. Additionally, different arousing levels of pleasant elicitations affected short-range connectivity over the right hemisphere, whereas different arousing levels of unpleasant elicitations affected medium-range connectivity over the left hemisphere.

Recent findings challenge the longstanding dogma of alpha-band oscillations as the signature of a passively idling brain state but diverge in terms of interpretation. Despite firm correlations with behavior, the mechanistic role of the alpha-rhythm in brain function remains debated. We suggest that three large-scale brain networks involved in different facets of top-down cognitive control differentially modulate a-oscillations, ranging from power within and synchrony between brain regions. Thereby, these networks selectively influence local signal processing, widespread information exchange, and ultimately perception and behavior.

Anomaly in neural phase coherence accompanies reduced sensorimotor integration in adults who stutter	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Speech motor adaptation; Neural oscillations; Neural phase coherence; EEG; Stuttering	AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; SPEECH PRODUCTION; NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; FLUENT SPEAKERS; BRAIN NETWORK; EEG DATA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; TIME	Despite advances in our understanding of the human speech system, the neurophysiological basis of stuttering remains largely unknown. Here, it is hypothesized that the speech of adults who stutter (AWS) is susceptible to disruptions in sensorimotor integration caused by neural miscommunication within the speech motor system. Human speech unfolds over rapid timescales and relies on a distributed system of brain regions working in a parallel and synchronized manner, and a breakdown in neural communication between the putative brain regions could increase susceptibility to dysfluency. Using a speech motor adaptation paradigm under altered auditory feedback with simultaneous recording of EEG, the oscillatory cortical dynamics was investigated in stuttering and fluent adults (FA). Auditory feedback perturbation involved the shifting of the formant frequencies of the target vowel sound. Reduced adaptation in response to the feedback error was observed in AWS and was accompanied by differences in EEG spectral powers and anomalies in phase coherence evolving over the course of speech motor training. It is understood that phase coherence possibly captures neural communication within speech motor networks. Thus, the phase coherence network of the two groups exhibited differences involving the EEG frequency bands. These findings in anomalous neural synchrony provide novel evidence for compromised neuronal communication at short time scales within the speech motor network of AWS.

Methods: We assessed the individualised prediction of psychosis by detecting specific patterns of beta and gamma oscillations using machine-learning algorithms. Prediction models were trained and tested on 53 neuroleptic-naive patients with a clinical high-risk for psychosis. Of these, 18 later transitioned to psychosis. All patients were followed up for at least 3 years. For an honest estimation of the generalisation capacity, the predictive performance of the models was assessed in unseen test cases using repeated nested cross-validation. Results: Transition to psychosis could be predicted from current-source density (CSD; area under the curve [AUC]=0.77), but not from lagged phase synchronicity data (LPS; AUC=0.56). Combining both modalities did not improve the predictive accuracy (AUC=0.78). The left superior temporal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule and the precuneus most strongly contributed to the prediction of psychosis. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CSD measurements extracted from clinical resting state EEG can help to improve the prediction of psychosis on a single-subject level.

It has been associated with theta (4-8 Hz) power in electrophysiological recordings and, independently, with BOLD effects in a network including the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Although the notion of the hippocampus coordinating neocortical activity by synchronization in the theta range is common among theoretical models of recollection, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is scarce. To address this apparent gap in our understanding of memory processes, we combined EEG and fMRI during a remember/know recognition task. We can show that recollection-specific theta-alpha (4-13 Hz) effects are correlated with increases in hippocampal connectivity with the PFC and, importantly, the striatum, areas that have been linked repeatedly to retrieval success. Together, our results provide compelling evidence that low-frequency oscillations in the theta and alpha range provide a mechanism to functionally bind the hippocampus, PFC, and striatum during successful recollection.

In particular, measures quantifying the coupling between the phase of slow oscillations and the amplitude of fast oscillations have been applied to a wide range of data recorded from animals and humans. Some of the measures applied to detect phase-amplitude coupling have been criticized for being sensitive to nonsinusoidal properties of the oscillations and thus spuriously indicate the presence of coupling. While such instances of spurious identification of coupling have been observed, in this commentary we give concrete examples illustrating cases when the identification of cross-frequency coupling can be trusted. These examples are based on control analyses and empirical observations rather than signal-processing tools. Finally, we provide concrete advice on how to determine when measures of phase-amplitude coupling can be considered trustworthy.

J	Ghoraani, B				Ghoraani, Behnaz			Class-specific discriminant time-frequency analysis using novel jointly learnt non-negative matrix factorization	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; Non-negative matrix factorization; Data retrieval; Data localization	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SOURCE SEPARATION	Time-frequency (TF) representation has found wide use in many challenging signal processing tasks including classification, interference rejection, and retrieval. Advances in TF analysis methods have led to the development of powerful techniques, which use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to adaptively decompose the TF data into TF basis components and coefficients. In this paper, standard NMF is modified for TF data, such that the improved TF bases can be used for signal classification applications with overlapping classes and data retrieval. The new method, called jointly learnt NMF (JLNMF) method, identifies both distinct and shared TF bases and is able to use the decomposed bases to successfully retrieve and separate the class-specific information from data. The paper provides the framework of the proposed JLNMF cost function and proposes a projected gradient framework to solve for limit point stationarity solutions. The developed algorithm has been applied to a synthetic data retrieval experiment and epileptic spikes in EEG signals of infantile spasms and discrimination of pathological voice disorder. The experimental results verified that JLNMF successfully identified the class-specific information, thus enhancing data separation performance.

Age-related differences in EEG beta activity during an assessment of ankle proprioception	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/S); Slow passive movement; Response time; Proprioception; Aging; Electroencephalography	POSTURAL-CONTROL; MOTOR CORTEX; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; REACTION-TIME; MOVEMENT; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; HUMANS	The aim of this work was to compare cortical beta oscillatory activity between young (YA) and older (OA) adults during the assessment of ankle proprioception. We analyzed the response time (RT) to kinesthetic perception and beta event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) in response to passive ankle movement applied at a slow speed, 0.5 degrees/s. The relationship between ERD/ERS and RT was investigated by classifying the signals into fast-, medium-, and slow-RT. The results showed a temporal relationship between beta oscillation changes and RT for both groups, i.e., earlier ERD and ERS were obtained for trials with faster response time. ERD was larger and delayed in OA compared to the YA, and beta ERS was present only for OA. These findings suggest that a less efficient proprioceptive signaling reaching the brain of OA requires a higher level of brain processing and hence the differences in ERD potentials between YA and OA. Furthermore, the occurrence of ERS in OA might represent a compensatory strategy of active cortical resetting for adequate sensorimotor behavior due to the age-related reduced peripheral input and neuromuscular impairments. Altered balance between excitatory and inhibitory intracortical activity in older adults presumably explains the changes in beta oscillations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Alterations in High-Frequency Neuronal Oscillations in a Cynomolgus Macaque Test of Sustained Attention Following NMDA Receptor Antagonism	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SELECTIVE VISUAL-ATTENTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PARVALBUMIN INTERNEURONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; KETAMINE; SYNCHRONIZATION	A growing body of evidence indicates that neuronal oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) are disturbed in schizophrenic patients during cognitive processes and may represent an endophenotype of the disease. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been used experimentally to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms including cognitive deficits in animals and humans. Here we characterized neuronal oscillations and event-related potentials (ERPs) in Cynomolgus macaques fully trained to perform a continuous performance test (CPT) in the presence and absence of the NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). Macaques (n = 8) were trained to touch 'target' stimuli and ignore 'distractor' stimuli presented randomly on a touchscreen. Subsequently, all subjects were implanted with epidural EEG electrodes over frontal (FC) and parietal cortices (PC) and later tested under vehicle (saline, i.m.) or acute PCP (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.m.) conditions. Compared with vehicle treatment, PCP produced a significant dose-dependent decrease in CPT performance accuracy and increased reaction times. Furthermore, PCP elevated the amplitudes of 'low' (30-50 Hz) and 'high' (51-80 Hz) gamma oscillations in FC and PC around target presentations for all correct responses. The CPT accuracy was inversely correlated with the gamma band amplitude in the presence of PCP. Additionally, PCP delayed the N100 peak latency in FC, and prolonged and suppressed the cognitively relevant P300 component of mean ERPs in FC and PC, respectively. The NMDA receptor antagonist-induced alteration in neuronal oscillations and ERPs may contribute to the observed cognitive deficits in macaques, and enhance our understanding of EEG recordings as a translatable biomarker.

J	Schneider-Luftman, D				Schneider-Luftman, Deborah			p-Value combiners for graphical modelling of EEG data in the frequency domain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Partial coherence; Multivariate time series; Multiple hypothesis testing; p-Value combiners; Electroencephalogram (EEG) data	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Background: In the graphical modelling of brain data, we are interested in estimating connectivity between various regions of interest, and evaluating statistical significance in order to derive a network model. This process involves aggregating results across frequency ranges and several patients, in order to obtain an overall result that can serve to construct a graph. New method: In this paper, we propose a method based on p-value combiners, which have never been used in applications to EEG data analysis. This new method is split into two aspects: frequency-wide tests and group-wide tests. The first step can be effectively adjusted to control for false detection rate. Results: This two-step protocol is applied to EEG data collected from distinct groups of mental health patients, in order to draw graphical models for each group and highlight structural connectivity differences. Using the method proposed, we show that it is possible to reliably achieve this while effectively controlling for false connections detection. Comparison with existing method(s): Conventionally, the Hoim's Stepdown procedure is used for this type of problem, as it is robust to type I errors. However, it is known to be conservative and prone to false negatives. Furthermore, unlike the proposed methods, it does not directly output a decision rule on whether to accept or reject a statement. Conclusions: The proposed methodology offers significant improvements over the stepdown procedure in terms of error rate and false negative rate across the network models, as well as in term of applicability.

The aim of the present study is to compare the baseline of EEG signals in SHRs and Wistar rats using Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) during the three phases of KA model (acute, latent and chronic). The SHRs showed higher baseline relative power of delta waves in the left frontal cortex and lower gamma-HF waves in the left frontal and left/right parietal cortex, respectively, compared to Wistar rats. During the acute phase, both absolute and relative power of fast EEG bands (gamma-HF) was lower in the left/right frontal and the left/right parietal cortex in SHRs compared to Wistar rats. During the latent phase, no difference in the power of the investigated bands was detected between the two strains. During the chronic epileptic phase, the SHRs were characterized with higher power of HF oscillations than Wistar rats both in the frontal and parietal cortex without brain lateralization while theta, alpha and beta bands were with diminished power in the left parietal cortex of SHRs compared to normotensive Wistar rats. Taken together, the presented results suggest that the increased delta waves and lower gamma-HF waves in the frontal/parietal cortex are associated with a higher seizure susceptibility of SHRs compared to Wistar rats while fastest oscillations has a critical role in seizure generation and propagation of hypertensive rats.

Hemispheric asymmetry non-linear analysis of EEG during emotional responses from idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						EEG; Emotion; Hemispheric lateralization; Non-linear methods; Parkinson's disease	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; TIME-SERIES; DYNAMICAL ANALYSIS; PRACTICAL METHOD; RECOGNITION; STATE; CLASSIFICATION; METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION; INVENTORY	Recent studies show right hemisphere has a unique contribution to emotion processing. The present study investigated EEG using non-linear measures during emotional processing in PD patients with respect to motor symptom asymmetry (i.e., most affected body side). We recorded 14-channel wireless EEGs from 20 PD patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls (HC) by eliciting emotions such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust. PD patients were divided into two groups, based on most affected body side and unilateral motor symptom severity: left side-affected (LPD, n = 10) or right side-affected PD patients (RPD, n = 10). Nonlinear analysis of these emotional EEGs were performed by using approximate entropy, correlation dimension, detrended fluctuation analysis, fractal dimension, higher order spectra, hurst exponent (HE), largest Lyapunov exponent and sample entropy. The extracted features were ranked using analysis of variance based on F value. The ranked features were then fed into classifiers namely fuzzy K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine to obtain optimal performance using minimum number of features. From the experimental results, we found that (a) classification performance across all frequency bands performed well in recognizing emotional states of LPD, RPD, and HC; (b) the emotion-specific features were mainly related to higher frequency bands; and (c) predominantly LPD patients (inferred right-hemisphere pathology) were more impaired in emotion processing compared to RPD, as showed by a poorer classification performance. The results suggest that asymmetric neuronal degeneration in PD patients may contribute to the impairment of emotional communication.

In these closed-loop applications, a brain switch detects the motor intention from brain signals, e.g., scalp EEG, and triggers a neuroprosthetic device, either to deliver sensory feedback or to mimic real movements, thus re-establishing the compromised sensory motor control loop and promoting neural plasticity. In this context, single trial detection of motor intention with short latency is a prerequisite. The performance of the event detection from EEG recordings is mainly determined by three factors: the type of motor imagery (e.g., repetitive, ballistic), the frequency band (or signal modality) used for discrimination (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and MRCP, i.e., movement-related cortical potential), and the processing technique (e.g., time-series analysis, sub-band power estimation). In this study, we investigated single trial EEG traces during movement imagination on healthy individuals, and provided a comprehensive analysis of the performance of a short-latency brain switch when varying these three factors. The morphological investigation showed a cross-subject consistency of a prolonged negative phase in MRCP, and a delayed beta rebound in sensory-motor rhythms during repetitive tasks. The detection performance had the greatest accuracy when using ballistic MRCP with time-series analysis. In this case, the true positive rate (TPR) was similar to 70% for a detection latency of similar to 200 ms. The results presented here are of practical relevance for designing BCI systems for motor function rehabilitation.

We investigated the neural correlates of workload buildup in a fine visuomotor task called the boundary avoidance task (BAT). The BAT has been known to induce naturally occurring failures of human-machine coupling in high performance aircraft that can potentially lead to a crash-these failures are termed pilot induced oscillations (PIOs). Approach. We recorded EEG and pupillometry data from human subjects engaged in a flight BAT simulated within a virtual 3D environment. Main results. We find that workload buildup in a BAT can be successfully decoded from oscillatory features in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Information in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma spectral bands of the EEG all contribute to successful decoding, however gamma band activity with a lateralized somatosensory topography has the highest contribution, while theta band activity with a fronto-central topography has the most robust contribution in terms of real-world usability. We show that the output of the spectral decoder can be used to predict PIO susceptibility. We also find that workload buildup in the task induces pupil dilation, the magnitude of which is significantly correlated with the magnitude of the decoded EEG signals. These results suggest that PIOs may result from the dysregulation of cortical networks such as the locus coeruleus (LC)-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) circuit. Significance. Our findings may generalize to similar control failures in other cases of tight man-machine coupling where gains and latencies in the control system must be inferred and compensated for by the human operators. A closed-loop intervention using neurophysiological decoding of workload buildup that targets the LC-ACC circuit may positively impact operator performance in such situations.

Humans tend to pursue products with aesthetic values and make buying decisions based on their aesthetic preferences. The existence of neuromarketing is to understand consumer responses toward marketing stimuli by using imaging techniques and recognition of physiological parameters. Numerous studies have been done to understand the relationship between human, art and aesthetics. In this paper, we present a novel preference-based measurement of user aesthetics using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for virtual 3D shapes with motion. The 3D shapes are designed to appear like bracelets, which is generated by using the Gielis superformula. EEG signals were collected by using a medical grade device, the B-Alert X10 from advance brain monitoring, with a sampling frequency of 256 Hz and resolution of 16 bits. The signals obtained when viewing 3D bracelet shapes were decomposed into alpha, beta, theta, gamma and delta rhythm by using time-frequency analysis, then classified into two classes, namely like and dislike by using support vector machines and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers respectively.

The conventional assumptions of stationarity and autonomicity break down in the case of living systems because they are thermodynamically open, and thus constantly interacting with their environments. This leads to an inherent time-variability and results in highly nonlinear, time-dependent dynamics. The aim of signal analysis usually is to gain insight into the behavior of the system from which the signal originated. Here, a range of signal analysis methods is presented and applied to extract information about time-varying oscillatory modes and their interactions. Methods are discussed for the characterization of signals and their underlying nonautonomous dynamics, including time-frequency analysis, decomposition, coherence analysis and dynamical Bayesian inference to study interactions and coupling functions. They are illustrated by being applied to cardiovascular and EEG data. The recent introduction of chronotaxic systems provides a theoretical framework within which dynamical systems can have amplitudes and frequencies which are time-varying, yet remain stable, matching well the characteristics of life. We demonstrate that, when applied in the context of chronotaxic systems, the methods presented facilitate the accurate extraction of the system dynamics over many scales of time and space.

Such dynamic programming-based techniques like DTW are now the backbone and driver of most bioinformatics methods and discoveries. In neuroscience it has had far less use, though this has begun to change. We wanted to explore new ways of applying DTW, not simply as a measure with which to cluster or compare similarity between features but in a conceptually different way. We have used DTW to provide a more interpretable spectral description of the data, compared to standard approaches such as the Fourier and related transforms. The DTW approach and standard discrete Fourier transform (DI-I) are assessed against benchmark measures of neural dynamics. These include EEG microstates, EEG avalanches, and the sum squared error (SSE) from a multilayer perceptron (MLP) prediction of the EEG time series, and simultaneously acquired FMRI BOLD signal. We explored the relationships between these variables of interest in an EEG-FMRI dataset acquired during a standard cognitive task, which allowed us to explore how DTW differentially performs in different task settings. We found that despite strong correlations between DTW and DFT-spectra, DTW was a better predictor for almost every measure of brain dynamics. Using these DTW measures, we show that predictability is almost always higher in task than in rest states, which is consistent to other theoretical and empirical findings, providing additional evidence for the utility of the DTW approach.

Working memory performance inversely predicts spontaneous delta and theta-band scaling relations	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Resting-state EEG; Theta; Delta; Scaling relations; Working memory; Detrended-fluctuation analysis	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; CRITICALITY; NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR	Electrophysiological studies have strongly implicated theta-band activity in human working memory processes. Concurrently, work on spontaneous, non-task-related oscillations has revealed the presence of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) within sub-bands of the ongoing EEG, and has begun to demonstrate their functional significance. However, few studies have yet assessed the relation of LRTCs (also called scaling relations) to individual differences in cognitive abilities. The present study addressed the intersection of these two literatures by investigating the relation of narrow-band EEG scaling relations to individual differences in working memory ability, with a particular focus on the theta band. Fifty-four healthy adults completed standardized assessments of working memory and separate recordings of their spontaneous, non-task-related EEG. Scaling relations were quantified in each of the five classical EEG frequency bands via the estimation of the Hurst exponent obtained from detrended fluctuation analysis. A multilevel modeling framework was used to characterize the relation of working memory performance to scaling relations as a function of general scalp location in Cartesian space. Overall, results indicated an inverse relationship between both delta and theta scaling relations and working memory ability, which was most prominent at posterior sensors, and was independent of either spatial or individual variability in band-specific power. These findings add to the growing literature demonstrating the relevance of neural LRTCs for understanding brain functioning, and support a construct-and state-dependent view of their functional implications.

Odors enhance slow-wave activity in non-rapid eye movement sleep	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						odor; olfaction; sleep; smell	EVOKED K-COMPLEX; EEG; BRAIN; STIMULATION; DISTURBANCE; PATTERNS; SPINDLES; YOUNG; WAKE	Most forms of suprathreshold sensory stimulation perturb sleep. In contrast, presentation of pure olfactory or mild trigeminal odorants does not lead to behavioral or physiological arousal. In fact, some odors promote objective and subjective measures of sleep quality in humans and rodents. The brain mechanisms underlying these sleep-protective properties of olfaction remain unclear. Slow oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) are a marker of deep sleep, and K complexes (KCs) are an EEG marker of cortical response to sensory interference. We therefore hypothesized that odorants presented during sleep will increase power in slow EEG oscillations. Moreover, given that odorants do not drive sleep interruption, we hypothesized that unlike other sensory stimuli odorants would not drive KCs. To test these hypotheses we used polysomnography to measure sleep in 34 healthy subjects (19 women, 15 men; mean age 26.5 +/- 2.5 yr) who were repeatedly presented with odor stimuli via a computer-controlled air-dilution olfactometer over the course of a single night. Each participant was exposed to one of four odorants, lavender oil (n = 13), vetiver oil (n = 5), vanillin (n = 12), or ammonium sulfide (n = 4), for durations of 5, 10, and 20 s every 9-15 min. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that odor presentation during sleep enhanced the power of delta (0.5-4 Hz) and slow spindle (9-12 Hz) frequencies during non-rapid eye movement sleep. The increase was proportionate to odor duration. In addition, odor presentation did not modulate the occurrence of KCs. These findings imply a sleep-promoting olfactory mechanism that may deepen sleep through driving increased slow-frequency oscillations.

Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is one of the important forms of this interaction where the amplitude of higher frequency oscillations is modulated by the phase of lower frequency activity. Here, we studied the dynamic variations of PAC of high (gamma and ripple) and low (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) frequency bands in patients with focal epilepsy in different sleep stages during the interictal period, in an attempt to see if coupling is different in more or less epileptogenic regions. Sharp activities were excluded to avoid their effect on the PAC. The results revealed that the coupling intensity was generally the highest in stage N3 of sleep and the lowest in rapid eye movement sleep. We also compared the coupling strength in different regions [seizure onset zone (SOZ), exclusively irritative zone, and normal zone]. PAC between high and low frequency rhythms was found to be significantly stronger in the SOZ compared to normal regions. Also, the coupling was generally more elevated in spiking channels outside the SOZ than in normal regions. We also examined how the power in the delta band correlates to the PAC, and found a mild but statistically significant correlation between slower background activity in epileptic channels and the elevated coupling in these channels. The results suggest that an elevated PAC may reflect some fundamental abnormality, even after exclusion of sharp activities and even in the interictal period. PAC may therefore contribute to understanding the underlying dynamics of epileptogenic brain regions.

Here, we investigated the neural correlates of spatial and nonspatial attention in humans using intracranial electroencephalography. The topography and number of electrodes showing significant event-related desynchronization (ERD) or event-related synchronization (ERS) in different frequency bands were studied in 13 epileptic patients. Performance was not significantly different between the two conditions. In both conditions, ERD in the low-frequency bands and ERS in the high-frequency bands were present bilaterally in the parietal cortex (prominently on the right hemisphere) and frontal regions. In addition to these common changes, spatial attention involved right-lateralized activity that was maximal in the right superior parietal lobule (SPL), whereas nonspatial attention involved wider brain networks including the bilateral parietal, frontal, and temporal regions, but still had maximal activity in the right parietal lobe. Within the parietal lobe, spatial attention involved ERD or ERS in the right SPL, whereas nonspatial attention involved ERD or ERS in the right inferior parietal lobule. These findings reveal that common as well as different brain networks are engaged in spatial and nonspatial attention. (C) 2016 The Authors Human Brain Mapping Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We not only study the basic mechanism of sustained attention, but also study how the disturbance affects the nervous system of sustained attention. In this paper, we introduce the research background and purpose of sustained attention, focus on the effect of visual disturbance stimulation. By designing the experiments (sustained attention task, SAT and distractor condition sustained attention task, dSAT), we obtain induced brain waves with or without visual disturbance and measure them, and we analyze human EEG information from which we extract ERP (Event Related Potential) component and conduct discriminatory analysis. Then we study the reaction mechanism of the brain. Using behavioral analysis, ERP time domain analysis and SSVEP (Steady State Visual Evoked Potential) time-frequency analysis technology, we compare the results of two kinds of experiments (SAT and dSAT) to explore the physiological mechanism of sustained attention with disturbance or not. It is found that disturbance reduces the amplitude of N2, extends the start latency of P300. A new idea and method of using SSVEP to predict the attention and behavior is proposed. This experiment has an important practical significance on the study of cognitive processes of thinking and operating mechanism of the brain, at the same time, has some social significance for considering the pros and cons of real life people being used to multi-task execution status.

We determined if consideration of the spectral frequency bands of coupled slow-waves could distinguish between epileptogenic and physiological HFOs. Methods: We studied a consecutive series of 13 children with focal epilepsy who underwent extraoperative electrocorticography. We measured the occurrence rate of HFOs during slow-wave sleep at each electrode site. We subsequently determined the performance of HFO rate for localization of seizureonset sites and undesirable detection of nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites defined by neurostimulation. We likewise determined the predictive performance of modulation index: M-I(XHz)&(YHz), reflecting the strength of coupling between amplitude of HFOsXHz and phase of slow-wave(YHz). The predictive accuracy was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) on receiver-operating characteristics analysis. Results: Increase in HFO rate localized seizure-onset sites (AUC >= 0.72; p < 0.001), but also undesirably detected nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC >= 0.58; p < 0.001). Increase in MI(HFOs)&(3-4Hz) also detected both seizure-onset (AUC >= 0.74; p < 0.001) and nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC >= 0.59; p < 0.001). Increase in subtraction-M-IHFOs [defined as subtraction of MI(HFOs)&(0.5-1Hz) from MI(HFOs)&(3-4Hz)] localized seizure-onset sites (AUC >= 0.71; p < 0.001), but rather avoided detection of nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC <= 0.42; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our data suggest that epileptogenic HFOs may be coupled with slow-wave(3-4Hz) more preferentially than slow-wave(0.5-1Hz), whereas physiologic HFOs with slow-wave(0.5-1Hz) more preferentially than slow-wave(3-4Hz) during slow-wave sleep. Significance: Further studies in larger samples are warranted to determine if consideration of the spectral frequency bands of slow-waves coupled with HFOs can positively contribute to presurgical evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy.

In the present study, to extend this focus beyond sensorimotor rhythms, we investigate associative brain areas that are also related with motor learning skills. Based on experimental data from twenty-one healthy subjects, resting-state EEG recorded prior to the experiment was used to predict motor learning performance during a force-field adaptation task in which subjects performed center-out reaching movements disturbed by an external force-field. A broad resting-state beta-power configuration was found to be predictive of motor adaptation rate. Our findings suggest that resting EEG beta-power is an indicator of subjects' ability to learn new motor skills and adapt to different sensorimotor states. This information can be further exploited in a novel BCI-based stroke rehabilitation approach we propose.

It has been reported that rhinal and hippocampal EEG measures reflecting the stability of phases across trials are better suited to distinguish subsequently remembered from forgotten trials than event-related potentials or amplitude-based measures. Theoretical models suggest that the phase of EEG oscillations reflects neural excitability and influences cellular plasticity. However, while previous studies have shown that the stability of phase values across trials is indeed a relevant predictor of subsequent memory performance, the effect of absolute single-trial phase values has been little explored. Here, we reanalyzed intracranial EEG recordings from the mediotemporal lobe of 27 epilepsy patients performing a continuous word recognition paradigm. Two-class classification using a support vector machine was performed to predict subsequently remembered vs. forgotten trials based on individually selected frequencies and time points. We demonstrate that it is possible to successfully predict single-trial memory formation in the majority of patients (23 out of 27) based on only three single-trial phase values given by a rhinal phase, a hippocampal phase, and a rhinal-hippocampal phase difference. Overall classification accuracy across all subjects was 69.2% choosing frequencies from the range between 0.5 and 50 Hz and time points from the interval between -0.5 s and 2 s. For 19 patients, above chance prediction of subsequent memory was possible even when choosing only time points from the prestimulus interval (overall accuracy: 65.2%). Furthermore, prediction accuracies based on single-trial phase surpassed those based on single-trial power. Our results confirm the functional relevance of mediotemporal EEG phase for long-term memory operations and suggest that phase information may be utilized for memory enhancement applications based on deep brain stimulation.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether similar alterations can be observed in patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP), a state characterised by pathological features occurring in both late prodromal patients and initial phases of frank schizophrenic psychoses. Methods: We assessed resting-state electroencephalographic data of 31 antipsychotic-naive FEP patients and 29 healthy controls (HC). We investigated the three-dimensional (3D) current source density (CSD) distribution and lagged phase synchronisation (LPS) of oscillations across small-scale and large-scale brain networks. We additionally investigated LPS relationships with clinical symptoms using linear mixed-effects models. Results: Compared to HC, FEP patients demonstrated abnormal CSD distributions in frontal areas of the brain; while decreased oscillations were found in the low frequencies, an increase was reported in the high frequencies (P<0.01). Patients also exhibited deviant LPS in the high frequencies, whose dynamics changed over increasing 3D cortico-cortical distances and increasing psychotic symptoms. Conclusions: These results indicate that in addition to prefrontal cortical abnormalities, altered synchronised neural oscillations are also present, suggesting possible disruptions in cortico-cortical communications. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of emerging schizophrenic psychoses.

To explore these processes, contact heat-evoked potentials (CHEPs) were recorded in humans with electroencephalography (EEG) technique during a delayed matching-to-sample task, a working memory task involving presentations of two successive painful heat stimuli (S-1 and S-2) with different intensities separated by a 2-s interval (the memorization period). At the end of the task, the subject was required to discriminate the stimuli by indicating which (S-1 or S-2) induced more pain. A control task was used, in which no active discrimination was required between stimuli. All event-related potential (ERP) analysis was aligned to the onset of S-1. EEG activity exhibited two successive CHEPs: an N2-P2 complex (similar to 400 ms after onset of S-1) and an ultralate component (ULC, similar to 900 ms). The amplitude of the N2-P2 at vertex, but not the ULC, was significantly correlated with stimulus intensity in these two tasks, suggesting that the N2-P2 represents neural coding of pain intensity. A late negative component (LNC) in the frontal recording region was observed only in the memory task during a 500-ms period before onset of S-2. LNC amplitude differed between stimulus intensities and exhibited significant correlations with the N2-P2 complex. These indicate that the frontal LNC is involved in maintenance of intensity of pain in working memory. Furthermore, alpha-band oscillations observed in parietal recording regions during the late delay displayed significant power differences between tasks. This study provides in the temporal domain previously unidentified neural evidence showing the neural processes involved in working memory of painful stimuli.

Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition of microexpressions (with duration of less than 200 ms) and macroexpressions (with duration of greater than 200 ms). We used an affective priming paradigm in which a picture of a facial expression is the prime and an emotional word is the target, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine neural activities associated with recognizing microexpressions and macroexpressions. The results showed that there were significant main effects of duration and valence for N170/vertex positive potential. The main effect of congruence for N400 is also significant. Further, sLORETA showed that the brain regions responsible for these significant differences included the inferior temporal gyrus and widespread regions of the frontal lobe. Furthermore, the results suggested that the left hemisphere was more involved than the right hemisphere in processing a microexpression. The main effect of duration for the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was significant, and the theta oscillations (4 to 8 Hz) increased in recognizing expressions with a duration of 40 ms compared with 300 ms. Thus, there are different EEG/ERPs neural mechanisms for recognizing microexpressions compared to recognizing macroexpressions.

J	de Cheveigne, A				de Cheveigne, Alain			Sparse time artifact removal	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; MEG; LFP; ECoG; Artifact; Myogenic; ICA; Sensor noise	ELECTROMYOGENIC ARTIFACTS; MUSCLE ARTIFACTS; EEG; EMG; NOISE	Background: Muscle artifacts and electrode noise are an obstacle to interpretation of EEG and other electrophysiological signals. They are often channel-specific and do not fully benefit from component analysis techniques such as ICA, and their presence reduces the dimensionality needed by those techniques. Their high-frequency content may mask or masquerade as gamma band cortical activity. New method: The sparse time artifact removal (STAR) algorithm removes artifacts that are sparse in space and time. The time axis is partitioned into an artifact-free and an artifact-contaminated part, and the correlation structure of the data is estimated from the covariance matrix of the artifact-free part. Artifacts are then corrected by projection of each channel onto the subspace spanned by the other channels. Results: The method is evaluated with both simulated and real data, and found to be highly effective in removing or attenuating typical channel-specific artifacts. Comparison with existing methods: In contrast to the widespread practice of trial removal or channel removal or interpolation, very few data are lost. In contrast to ICA or other linear techniques, processing is local in time and affects only the artifact part, so most of the data are identical to the unprocessed data and the full dimensionality of the data is preserved. Conclusions: STAR complements other linear component analysis techniques, and can enhance their ability to discover weak sources of interest by increasing the number of effective noise-free channels.

The current paper proposes an application of methods from visual analytics to time-frequency energy distribution in ECG signals, with the goal of studying heart rate variability from the main ECG band corresponding to heart rate. Such an approach can complement standard time- and frequency-domain techniques for heart rate variability assessment. Multiresolution wavelet entropy was computed from continuous wavelet transforms using windows of user-specified length and overlap. An interactive tool provides visualization of multiresolution entropy heat maps. This approach was used to compare ECG wavelet entropy in subjects during resting and stressor conditions. The interactive visual representation allows a detailed examination of wavelet entropy, revealing time-varying differences in the complexity of the underlying ECGs that are not evident in traditional measures.

Methods: Permutation conditional mutual information (PCMI) was used to calculate the coupling strength and direction of rsEEG signals between different brain areas of 19 aMCI and 20 normal control (NC) with T2DM on 7 frequency bands: Delta, Theta, Alpha1, Alpha2, Beta1, Beta2 and Gamma. The difference in coupling strength or direction of rsEEG between two groups was calculated. The correlation between coupling strength or direction of rsEEG and score of different neuropsychology scales were also calculated. Results: We have demonstrated that PCMI can calculate effectively the coupling strength and directionality of EEG signals between different brain regions. The significant difference in coupling strength and directionality of EEG signals was found between the patients of aMCI and NC with T2DM on different brain regions. There also existed significant correlation between sex or age and coupling strength or coupling directionality of EEG signals between a few different brain regions from all subjects. Conclusions: The coupling strength or directionality of EEG signals calculated by PCMI are significantly different between aMCI and NC with T2DM. Significance: These results showed that the coupling strength or directionality of EEG signals calculated by PCMI might be used as a biomarker in distinguishing the aMCI from NC with T2DM.

We hypothesized that interference between attention and action in freezers would be revealed by differences in cortical modulation during this dual task. Methods: Attention during step preparation was modulated by means of an auditory oddball discrimination task. EEG oscillations in different frequency bands were measured for the attentional stimulus and the motor stimulus. Results: Over the 500 ms following the sound, low-frequency power increased in all three groups. This was followed by a power decrease in mid-range frequencies after both target and standard sounds in the healthy controls and in the non-FoG group. In contrast, EEG oscillations in the beta band were impaired in the FoG group, who notably failed to display event-related desynchronization after perceiving the sound. Conclusions: An attentional stimulus was able to trigger event-related desynchronization before motor preparation in the non-FoG group but not in the FoG group. Significance: In the FoG group, stimulus discrimination was maintained but the coupling between attention and motor preparation was impaired.

Decoding and Reconstructing the Focus of Spatial Attention from the Topography of Alpha-band Oscillations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PARIETAL; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISM; REPRESENTATIONS; COMMUNICATION; MODULATIONS; INFORMATION; MAINTENANCE; INCREASES; FRAMEWORK	Many aspects of perception and cognition are supported by activity in neural populations that are tuned to different stimulus features (e.g., orientation, spatial location, color). Goal-directed behavior, such as sustained attention, requires a mechanism for the selective prioritization of contextually appropriate representations. A candidate mechanism of sustained spatial attention is neural activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), whose power in the human EEG covaries with the focus of covert attention. Here, we applied an inverted encoding model to assess whether spatially selective neural responses could be recovered from the topography of alpha-band oscillations during spatial attention. Participants were cued to covertly attend to one of six spatial locations arranged concentrically around fixation while EEG was recorded. A linear classifier applied to EEG data during sustained attention demonstrated successful classification of the attended location from the topography of alpha power, although not from other frequency bands. We next sought to reconstruct the focus of spatial attention over time by applying inverted encoding models to the topography of alpha power and phase. Alpha power, but not phase, allowed for robust reconstructions of the specific attended location beginning around 450 msec postcue, an onset earlier than previous reports. These results demonstrate that posterior alpha-band oscillations can be used to track activity in feature-selective neural populations with high temporal precision during the deployment of covert spatial attention.

What can cognitive neuroscience tell us about human development?	17TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	17th European Conference on Developmental Psychology	SEP 08-12, 2015	Braga, PORTUGAL	European Assoc Dev Psychol, Univ Minho			SPEECH-PERCEPTION; WILLIAMS-SYNDROME; CONDUCT PROBLEMS; RACE; FACE; CHILDREN; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; INFANCY; OSCILLATIONS	The increasing availability of safe, noninvasive neuroimaging techniques has led to an explosion in cognitive neuroscience research on infants, children, and adolescents. Two justifications for this research are: (1) that neuroscience methods can tell us more about the mechanisms underpinning development than behavioural studies alone, and (2) that the insights gained will have a feed- forward impact on clinical and educational practice and policy. Given recent scepticism towards both arguments, this paper brings together examples from different fields within developmental cognitive neuroscience to discuss specific cognitive domains and both typical and atypical pediatric populations, using a variety of different neuroimaging technologies. The paper addresses the progress made in developmental psychology by the use of functional near- infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography/event related potentials (EEG/ERP) in both typical and atypical development. It is argued that cognitive neuroscience has provided new hypotheses that have served to drive the field forward and clarify developmental mechanisms, as well as neural markers for working memory training and for distinguishing behavioural scores " in the normal range" from their atypical neural underpinnings.

The dynamic nature of physiological variables such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) may provide alternate means for detecting these transitions. However, previous research examining EEG and cognitive performance is largely confined to samples with diagnosed cognitive impairments, and research examining non-impaired, and occupation specific samples, is limited. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between frontal pole and central EEG and cognitive performance in a sample of male and female nurses, and to determine the significance of these associations. Fifty seven nurses participated in the study, in which two lead bipolar EEG was recorded at positions Fp(1) (frontal polar), Fp(2), C-3 (central) and C-4 during a baseline and an active phase involving the common neuropsychological Stroop test. Participants' cognitive performance was assessed using the minimental state exam (MMSE) and Cognistat screening tools. Significant correlations between EEG beta activity and the outcome of MMSE and Cognistat were revealed, where an increased beta activity was associated to an increased global cognitive performance. Additionally, domain specific cognitive performance was also significantly associated to various EEG variables. The study identified potential EEG biomarkers for global and domain specific cognitive performance, and provides initial groundwork for the development of future EEG based biomarkers for detection of cognitive pathologies.

These metrics include root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). However, this study adopts a new approach to model validation in phase and frequency domains. The study proposes frequency coherence and phase synchronization methods quantified into frequency coherence index (FCI) and phase lock value (PLV), respectively. To get more in-depth insight of the model's performance, important visual indicators based on wavelet cross-spectrum (WCS) and wavelet coherence analysis (WCA) are presented. Two different widely used solar radiation models based on artificial neural network (ANN) namely, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), are analysed. The proposed techniques are used to exploit weaknesses and strengths of the models. Anomalies in phase and frequency components are identified and the information is used to increase their performance. The MLP is modified into a non-linear autoregressive recurrent exogenous neural networks (NARX-NN) using recursive filtering. Results show that NARX-NN corrects the phase differences, filters out the faulty frequency components and increases the time domain validation metric, i.e. R-2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Reports have also demonstrated that neural activity can be affected by stimulus sequence context information (i.e., the number and type of preceding stimuli). Stemming from prior work demonstrating that theta and delta index separable processes during response inhibition, the current study assessed sequence context in a go/no-go paradigm in which the number of go stimuli preceding each no-go was selectively manipulated. Principal component analysis of time-frequency representations revealed differential modulation of evoked theta and delta related to sequence context, where delta increased robustly with additional preceding go stimuli, while theta did not. Findings are consistent with the view that theta indexes simpler initial salience-related processes, while delta indexes more varied and complex processes related to a variety of task parameters.

Associative encoding involves similar hippocampal networks but, paradoxically, is also characterized by theta power decreases. Here, we investigated how theta activity relates to associative encoding of place contexts resulting in accurate navigation. Using MEG, we found that slow-theta (2-5 Hz) power negatively correlated with subsequent spatial accuracy for virtual contextual locations in posterior hippocampus and other cortical structures involved in spatial cognition. A rare opportunity to simultaneously record MEG and intracranial EEG in an epilepsy patient provided crucial in sights: during power decreases, slow-theta in right anterior hippocampus and left inferior frontal gyrus phaseled the left temporal cortex and predicted spatial accuracy. Our findings indicate that decreased slow-theta activity reflects local and long-range neural mechanisms that encode accurate spatial contexts, and strengthens the view that local suppression of low-frequency activity is essential for more efficient processing of detailed information.

We here recorded EEG in three Locked-in syndrome (LIS) and four Vegetative State/Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (VS/UWS) patients while they listened to the voice of a family member or an unfamiliar voice during a passive. Data indicate that, in a passive listening condition, the familiar voice induces stronger alpha desynchronization than the unfamiliar one. In an active condition, the target evoked stronger alpha desynchronization in controls, two LIS patients and one VS/UWS patient. Results suggest that self-relevant familiar voice stimuli can engage additional attentional resources and might allow the detection of otherwise hidden signs of instruction-following and thus residual awareness. Further studies are necessary to find sensitive paradigms that are suited to find subtle signs of cognition and awareness in DOC patients. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Frontal and motor cortex contributions to response inhibition: evidence from electrocorticography	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						beta oscillations; electrocorticography; high gamma; motor control; stop-signal task	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; BETA; PREMOTOR; STOP; AREA; EEG	Changes in the environment require rapid modification or inhibition of ongoing behavior. We used the stop-signal paradigm and intracranial recordings to investigate response preparation, inhibition, and monitoring of task-relevant information. Electrocorticographic data were recorded in eight patients with electrodes covering frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex, and time-frequency analysis was used to examine power differences in the beta (13-30 Hz) and high-gamma bands (60-180 Hz). Over motor cortex, beta power decreased, and high-gamma power increased during motor preparation for both go trials (Go) and unsuccessful stops (US). For successful stops (SS), beta increased, and high-gamma was reduced, indexing the cancellation of the prepared response. In the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), stop signals elicited a transient high-gamma increase. The MFG response occurred before the estimated stop-signal reaction time but did not distinguish between SS and US trials, likely signaling attention to the salient stop stimulus. A postresponse high-gamma increase in MFG was stronger for US compared with SS and absent in Go, supporting a role in behavior monitoring. These results provide evidence for differential contributions of frontal subregions to response inhibition, including motor preparation and inhibitory control in motor cortex and cognitive control and action evaluation in lateral prefrontal cortex.

Midfrontal theta tracks action monitoring over multiple interactive time scales	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cognitive control; Oscillations; Theta; Scale-free; Criticality; Action monitoring; Long-range temporal autocorrelations	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; RESPONSE CONFLICT; COGNITIVE CONTROL; EEG DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; ERRORS; NETWORKS; MEMORY; BRAIN	Quickly detecting and correcting mistakes is a crucial brain function. EEG studies have identified an idiosyncratic electrophysiological signature of online error correction, termed midfrontal theta. Midfrontal theta has so far been investigated over the fast time-scale of a few hundred milliseconds. But several aspects of behavior and brain activity unfold over multiple time scales, displaying "scale-free" dynamics that have been linked to criticality and optimal flexibility when responding to changing environmental demands. Here we used a novel line-tracking task to demonstrate that midfrontal theta is a transient yet non-phase-locked response that is modulated by task performance over at least three time scales: a few hundred milliseconds at the onset of a mistake, task performance over a fixed window of the previous 5 s, and scale-free-like fluctuations over many tens of seconds. These findings provide novel evidence for a role of midfrontal theta in online behavioral adaptation, and suggest new approaches for linking EEG signatures of human executive functioning to its neurobiological underpinnings.

This hypothesis was inspired by studies in humans involving NMDAR antagonists that trigger SZ symptoms. Animal models of SZ using neuropharmacology and genetic knockouts have successfully replicated some of the key observations in human subjects involving alteration of gamma band oscillations (GBO) observed in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography signals. However, it remains to be seen if NMDAR hypofunction in PV+ neurons is fundamental to the phenotype observed in these models. In this review, we discuss some of the key computational models of GBO and their predictions in the context of NMDAR hypofunction in INs. While PV+ INs have been the main focus of SZ studies in animal models, we also discuss the implications of NMDAR hypofunction in other types of INs using computational models for GBO modulation in the visual cortex.

The Effectiveness of Visual Short-Time Neurofeedback on Brain Activity and Clinical Characteristics in Alcohol Use Disorders: Practical Issues and Results	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurofeedback; alcohol use disorder; electroencephalography; therapeutic community	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; QUESTIONNAIRE; PSYCHOTHERAPY; PERSONALITY; POPULATION; DEPRESSION; COHERENCE; DIAGNOSIS; AMPLITUDE	The present study was carried out to examine the efficacy of alpha/theta neurofeedback (NF) with a new visual paradigm in a cohort of alcohol use disordered (AUD) patients (n = 25) treated in an Austrian therapeutic community center. The experimental study design focused on changes in absolute and relative resting EEG band power as well as in clinical variables, including depression (Beck Depresion Inventory [BDI-V]), psychiatric symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory [BSI], coping (Freiburg Questionnaire on Coping with Illness [FKV-lis]), psychotherapy motivation (Therapy Motivation Questionnaire [FPTM-23]), sense of coherence (Sense of Coherence Scale [SOC-13]), posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory [PPR]), and alcohol cravings (Alcohol Craving Questionnaire [ACQ]). For measuring training effects, participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: an experimental group (EG, n = 13) and a control group (CG, n = 12). Patients in EG received 12 sessions of visual NF training over a period of 6 weeks to enhance alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) frequency band power in addition to the standard treatment program of the rehabilitation center. Participants in CG received no additional NF intervention. The multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed a change by trend in absolute alpha and theta power in the EG. Even though no MANCOVA effects were found in the clinical scales, AUD patients reported increasing control of their brain activity during the course of NF. However, changes in several clinical scales (BDI-V, BSI, FKV-lis, PPR) from pre- to posttest were observed only in the EG contrary to the CG. The findings of this pilot study provide first evidence for the practicality and effectiveness of visual short-term NF as an additive intervention in the therapeutic community.

We perform extensive simulations to compare the activity generated on the scalp by different models of cortical activation, based on intracranial EEG findings reported in the literature. The spatial activation is modeled as a cortical patch of constant activation or as random sets of small generators (0.1 to 3 cm(2) each) concentrated in a cortical region. Temporal activation models for the generation of oscillatory activity are either equal phase or random phase across the cortical patches. The results show that smooth or random spatial activation profiles produce scalp electric potential distributions with the same shape. Also, in the generation of oscillatory activity, multiple cortical generators with random phase produce scalp activity attenuated on average only 2 to 4 times compared to generators with equal phase. Sparse asynchronous cortical generators can produce measurable scalp EEG. This is a possible explanation for seemingly paradoxical observations of simultaneous disorganized intracranial activity and scalp EEG signals.

It also raises important pathophysiologic issues concerning mechanisms of seizure generation. Until now, several seizure-onset patterns have been described using distinct recording methods (subdural, depth electrode), mostly in temporal lobe epilepsies or with heterogeneous neocortical lesions. Methods: We analyzed data from a cohort of 53 consecutive patients explored by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and with pathologically confirmed malformation of cortical development (MCD; including focal cortical dysplasia [FCD] and neurodevelopmental tumors [NDTs]). Results: We identified six seizure-onset patterns using visual and time-frequency analysis: low-voltage fast activity (LVFA); preictal spiking followed by LVFA; burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA; slow wave/DC shift followed by LVFA; theta/alpha sharp waves; and rhythmic spikes/spike-waves. We found a high prevalence of patterns that included LVFA (83%), indicating nevertheless that LVFA is not a constant characteristic of seizure onset. An association between seizure-onset patterns and histologic types was found (p = 001). The more prevalent patterns were as follows: (1) in FCD type I LVFA (23.1%) and slow wave/baseline shift followed by LVFA (15.4%); (2) in FCD type II burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA (31%), LVFA (27.6%), and preictal spiking followed by LVFA (27.6%); (3) in NDT, LVFA (54.5%). We found that a seizure-onset pattern that included LVFA was associated with favorable postsurgical outcome, but the completeness of the EZ resection was the sole independent predictive variable. Significance: Six different seizure-onset patterns can be described in FCD and NDT. Better postsurgical outcome is associated with patterns that incorporate LVFA.

Here, we show that the pattern of theta oscillation in response to varying cognitive demands reflects stable individual differences in the personality trait epistemic motivation: Individuals with high levels of epistemic motivation recruit relatively more cognitive resources in response to situations possessing high, compared to low, cognitive demand; individuals with low levels do not show such a specific response. Our results provide direct evidence for the theory of the construct need for cognition and add to our understanding of the neural processes underlying theta oscillations. More generally, we provide an explanation how individual differences in personality traits might be represented on a neural level.

Twenty-three healthy men (20-35 years) were subjected to 3-fold mapping in a feedback loop (EEG alpha-rhythm biofeedback with acoustic reinforcement). This procedure was performed at the beginning, middle, and end of the course. During the first neurofeedback training session, deactivation (p < 0.001) was found in the right angular gyrus, supramarginal, and superior temporal gyri, Brodmann area 39, and cerebellum. Activation (p < 0.001) was observed in the medial frontal and cingulate gyri, motor areas of both hemispheres, and Brodmann area 32. During final (third) neurofeedback training session, we observed strong deactivation (p < 0.05 with FDR) of zones responsible for spatial thinking and motor functions: left medial frontal and left medial temporal gyri; right postcentral, lingual, and superior frontal gyri; insula and right side of the cerebellum; and precuneus and cuneus (Brodmann areas 6, 9, 7, 31, 8, 13, and 22). Changes in the alpha wave power were most pronounced in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex of the left hemisphere (Brodmann areas 2L and 5L).	[Kozlova, L. I.; Shtark, M. B.; Mel'nikov, M.

EEG recording was performed on 34 participants. EEG coherence was computed over 171 pairs of electrodes across both hemispheres in different frequency bands and Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) was applied for source analysis. The EEG coherence results showed that higher functional interaction exists between anterior-posterior long-range coherence for all four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta) for both within left and right hemispheres compared with anterior and posterior short-range coherence. Further, source localization analysis demonstrated that a significant increase in delta and theta at the bilateral frontal lobes as well as in beta activity at the left temporal lobe; while a significant decrease of alpha over right parietal, beta over frontal and posterior parieto-occipital regions during learning process. To conclude, the frontal lobe is highly recruited in multimedia learning compared with baseline eyes open. In addition, it is also actively interacting with temporal lobe and posterior parieto-occipital regions to facilitate perceptual, encoding and retrieval of prior knowledge during learning.

We investigated the functional relevance of this scarcely understood process in two experiments in human participants. Wepresented stimuli to the left or right of fixation at encoding, followed by an episodicmemorytest with centrally presented retrieval cues. This allowed us to track the reactivation of lateralized sensorymemorytraces during retrieval. Successful episodic retrieval led to a very early (similar to 100-200 ms) reactivation of lateralized alpha/beta (10-25 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) power decreases in the visual cortex contralateral to the visual field at encoding. Applying rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation to interfere with early retrieval processing in the visual cortex led to decreased episodic memory performance specifically for items encoded in the visual field contralateral to the site of stimulation. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that episodic memory functionally relies on very rapid reactivation of sensory information.

ECoG signals are often decomposed into several frequency bands, among which the so-called high-gamma band (80-250 Hz) has been proposed to reflect local cortical functions near the cortical surface below the ECoG electrodes. It is typically assumed that the lower the frequency bands, the lower the spatial resolution of the signals; thus, there is not much to gain by analyzing the event-related changes of the ECoG signals in the lower-frequency bands. However, differences across frequency bands have not been systematically investigated. To address this issue, we recorded ECoG activity from two awake monkeys performing a retinotopic mapping task. We characterized the spatiotemporal profiles of the visual responses in the time-frequency domain. We defined the preferred spatial position, receptive field (RF), and response latencies of band-limited power (BLP) (i.e., alpha [3.9-11.7 Hz], beta [15.6-23.4 Hz], low [30-80 Hz] and high [80-250 Hz] gamma) for each electrode and compared them across bands and time-domain visual evoked potentials (VEPs). At the population level, we found that the spatial preferences were comparable across bands and VEPs. The high-gamma power showed a smaller RF than the other bands and VEPs. The response latencies for the alpha band were always longer than the latencies for the other bands and fastest in VEPs. Comparing the response profiles in both space and time for each cortical region (V1, V4+, and TEO/TE) revealed regional idiosyncrasies. Although the latencies of visual responses in the beta, low-, and high-gamma bands were almost identical in V1 and V4+, beta and low-gamma BLP occurred about 17 ms earlier than high-gamma power in TEO/TE. Furthermore, TEO/TE exhibited a unique pattern in the spatial response profile: the alpha and high-gamma responses tended to prefer the foveal regions, whereas the beta and low-gamma responses preferred the peripheral visual fields with larger RFs. This suggests that neurons in TEO/TE first receive less selective spatial information via beta and low-gamma BLP but later receive more fine-tuned spatial foveal information via high-gamma power. This result is consistent with a hypothesis previously proposed by Nakamura et al. (1993) that states that visual processing in TEO/TE starts with coarse-grained information, which primes subsequent fine-grained information. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ECoG can be a potent tool for investigating the nature of the neural computations in each cortical region that cannot be fully understood by measuring only the spiking activity, through the incorporation of the knowledge of the spatiotemporal characteristics across all frequency bands.

Beta EEG reflects sensory processing in active wakefulness and homeostatic sleep drive in quiet wakefulness	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						insomnia; sleep deprivation; sleep homeostasis; vibrissal sensory activation	DYNAMICS; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; HZ	Markers of sleep drive (<10 Hz; slow-wave activity and theta) have been identified in the course of slow-wave sleep and wakefulness. So far, higher frequencies in the waking electroencephalogram have not been examined thoroughly as a function of sleep drive. Here, electroencephalogram dynamics were measured in epochs of active wake (wake characterized by high muscle tone) or quiet wake (wake characterized by low muscle tone). It was hypothesized that the higher beta oscillations (15-35 Hz, measured by local field potential and electroencephalography) represent fundamentally different processes in active wake and quiet wake. In active wake, sensory stimulation elevated beta activity in parallel with gamma (80-90 Hz) activity, indicative of cognitive processing. In quiet wake, beta activity paralleled slow-wave activity (1-4 Hz) and theta (5-8 Hz) in tracking sleep need. Cerebral lactate concentration, a measure of cerebral glucose utilization, increased during active wake whereas it declined during quiet wake. Mathematical modelling of state-dependent dynamics of cortical lactate concentration was more precisely predictive when quiet wake and active wake were included as two distinct substates rather than a uniform state of wakefulness. The extent to which lactate concentration declined in quiet wake and increased in active wake was proportionate to the amount of beta activity. These data distinguish quiet wake from active wake. Quiet wake, particularly when characterized by beta activity, is permissive to metabolic and electrophysiological changes that occur in slow-wave sleep. These data urge further studies on state-dependent beta oscillations across species.

Cognitive Loading-Related Changes in the Coherence of EEG Rhythms in Hard-of-Hearing Adolescents	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						coherence; EEG rhythms; hearing loss; adolescents; cognitive loading		We recorded EEG activity in 82 12- to 15-year-old adolescents suffering from sensorineural hearing loss (II or III degree) and 80 secondary-school similar-age pupils with normal hearing. Four pairs of recording electrodes (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital) were used. The recording was performed under resting conditions and during the performance of the Raven test, which provided the action of cognitive loading. In hard-of-hearing boys and girls in the resting state, the number of lead pairs with significant or high coherence of oscillations of the EEG rhythms (coherence coefficients, CC, 0.51 to 0.70 and 0.71 to 1.00, respectively) usually exceeded the respective figures in normally hearing adolescents. In boys of both groups performing the cognitive test, the number of lead pairs with the CCs exceeding 0.50 increased in most cases. This was especially significantly manifested with respect to theta activity in hard-of-hearing boys; a focus of intense coherence of theta oscillations was formed in subjects of this group in the right temporal area. In girls of both groups, cognitive loading usually did not induce considerable increases in the coherence of EEG rhythms; the number of lead pairs with CC values > > 0.50 either remained unchanged or even decreased. Thus, hard-of-hearing adolescents (especially boys subjected to cognitive loading) demonstrated an intense trend toward increase in coherence relations between remote cortical loci (generalization of coherence), i.e., toward the formation of more extensive associative networks. Changes in the spatial organization of coherent relationships under the action of cognitive loading demonstrate certain gender specificity.

Within these regions, beta/gamma phase-synchronization supports the integration of sensory functions, while synchronization in theta/alpha bands supports the regulation of attentional functions. A key challenge is to understand which mechanisms integrate neuronal processing across these distinct frequencies and thereby the sensory and attentional functions. We investigated whether such integration could be achieved by cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). Using concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography, we found that CFS was load-dependently enhanced between theta and alpha gamma and between alpha and beta-gamma oscillations during VWM maintenance among visual, FP, and dorsal attention (DA) systems. CFS also connected the hubs of within-frequency-synchronized networks and its strength predicted individual VWM capacity. We propose that CFS integrates processing among synchronized neuronal networks from theta to gamma frequencies to link sensory and attentional functions.

A typical example of this phenomenon is the attentional blink, where participants show a robust deficit in reporting the second of two targets (T2) in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream. Previous electroencephalographical (EEG) studies showed that neural correlates of correct T2 report are not limited to the RSVP period, but extend before visual stimulation begins. In particular, reduced oscillatory neural activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) before the onset of the RSVP has been linked to lower T2 accuracy. We therefore examined whether auditory rhythmic stimuli presented at a rate of 10 Hz (within the alpha band) could increase oscillatory alpha-band activity and improve T2 performance in the attentional blink time window. Behaviourally, the auditory rhythmic stimulation worked to enhance T2 accuracy. This enhanced perception was associated with increases in the posterior T2-evoked N2 component of the event-related potentials and this effect was observed selectively at lag 3. Frontal and posterior oscillatory alpha-band activity was also enhanced during auditory stimulation in the pre-RSVP period and positively correlated with T2 accuracy. These findings suggest that ongoing fluctuations can be shaped by sensorial events to improve the allocation of attention in time. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is an algorithm to decompose an EEG signal into multiple oscillating functions, where the slow oscillation functions belongs to the EB artifact. However, the algorithm is relatively slow for real time processing due to the iterative nature of EMD and the fact that interpolation of large number of data points consumes a lot of computer resources. In this research work, the cubic Hermite spline interpolation (CHSI) and the Akima spline interpolation (ASI) are investigated for their performance and their ability to retain the decomposition accuracy compared to the classical EMD algorithm. The ASI has produced the highest correlation coefficient, lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), lowest percentage root means square difference (PRD), better Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and faster computation time in decomposing an artificial EEG signal. These results have revealed that the ASI technique in EMD is more accurate and faster than the conventional Cubic spline interpolation (CSI) technique.

Memory can be divided into two categories, i.e., long term memory and short term memory (STM). STM or working memory (WM) stores information for a short span of time and it is used for information manipulations and fast response activities. WM is generally involved in the higher cognitive functions of the brain. Different studies have been carried out by researchers to understand the WM process. Most of these studies were based on neuroimaging modalities like fMRI, EEG, MEG etc., which use standalone processes. Each neuroimaging modality has some pros and cons. For example, EEG gives high temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution. On the other hand, the fMRI results have a high spatial resolution but poor temporal resolution. For a more in depth understanding and insight of what is happening inside the human brain during the WM process or during cognitive tasks, high spatial as well as high temporal resolution is desirable. Over the past decade, researchers have been working to combine different modalities to achieve a high spatial and temporal resolution at the same time. Developments of MRI compatible EEG equipment in recent times have enabled researchers to combine EEG-fMRI successfully. The research publications in simultaneous EEG-fMRI have been increasing tremendously. This review is focused on the WM research involving simultaneous EEG-fMRI data acquisition and analysis. We have covered the simultaneous EEG-fMRI application in WM and data processing. Also, it adds to potential fusion methods which can be used for simultaneous EEG-fMRI for WM and cognitive tasks.

Expectation of a negative outcome can lead to pain enhancement (nocebo hyperalgesia) and can alter the response to therapeutic interventions. The present study characterizes EEG alteration related to pain facilitation by nocebo. Thirty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to the nocebo or control group. Five-minute EEG was recorded under: resting state, tonic innocuous heat and tonic noxious heat before and after the application of a sham inert cream to the non dominant volar forearm combined with cognitive manipulation. The intensity and unpleasantness of heat-induced pain increased after cognitive manipulation in the nocebo group compared to control and was associated with enhanced low alpha (8-10 Hz) activity. However, changes in alpha activity were predicted by catastrophizing but not by pain intensity or unpleasantness, which suggest that low alpha power might reflect brain activity related to negative cognitive affective responses to pain.

Direct effects of EO on brain function remained largely to be confirmed with scientific proof. This study aimed to demonstrate quantifiable and reproducible effects of commercial vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) EO inhalation on sleep-waking and electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns in adult male Wistar rats. The experiments were conducted during November 2013 - February 2014. Materials and Methods: The following electrode implantation on the skull, control, and treated animals were subjected for EEG recording while inhaling water and vetiver EO (20 and 200 mu l), respectively. Fast Fourier transform was used for analysis of EEG power spectrum. Results: One-way ANOVA analysis confirmed that vetiver EO inhalation significantly increased total waking and reduced slow-wave sleep time. Moreover, EO inhalation decreased alpha and beta1 activity in both frontal and parietal cortices and increased gamma activity in the frontal cortex. Changes in these frequencies began almost from the start of the inhalation. Conclusion: These data suggest refreshing properties of vetiver EO on electrical brain activity and alertness.

Effect of sampling rate and filter settings on High Frequency Oscillation detections	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High Frequency Oscillations; Ripple; Fast ripple; Sampling rate; Anti-aliasing filter	NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; HZ; RESECTION; EEG	Objective: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) are being studied as a biomarker of epilepsy, yet it is unknown how various acquisition parameters at different centers affect detection and analysis of HFOs. This paper specifically quantifies effects of sampling rate (FS) and anti-aliasing filter (AAF) positions on automated HFO detection. Methods: HFOs were detected on intracranial EEG recordings (17 patients) with 5 kHz FS. HFO detection was repeated on downsampled and/or filtered copies of the EEG data, mimicking sampling rates and low-pass filter settings of various acquisition equipment. For each setting, we compared the HFO detection sensitivity, HFO features, and ability to identify the ictal onset zone. Results: The relative sensitivity remained above 80% for either FS >= 2 kHz or AAF >= 500 Hz. HFO feature distributions were consistent (AUROC < 0.7) down to 1 kHz FS or 200 Hz AAF. HFO rate successfully identified ictal onset zone over most settings. HFO peak frequency was highly variable under most parameters (Spearman correlation < 0.5). Conclusions: We recommend at least FS >= 2 kHz and AAF >= 500 Hz to detect HFOs. Additionally, HFO peak frequency is not robust at any setting: the same HFO event can be variably classified either as a ripple (< 200 Hz) or fast ripple (> 250 Hz) under different acquisition settings. Significance: These results inform clinical centers on requirements to analyze HFO rates and features. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Dysfunction of sensory oscillations in Autism Spectrum Disorder	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Autism Spectrum Disorder; Oscillation; Perception; Sensory processing; Synchronization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REDUCED THALAMIC VOLUME; EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PEAK GAMMA FREQUENCY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; 1ST-DEGREE RELATIVES; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent developmental disability characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Recently, anomalous sensory and perceptual function has gained an increased level of recognition as an important feature of ASD. A specific impairment in the ability to integrate information across brain networks has been proposed to contribute to these disruptions. A crucial mechanism for these integrative processes is the rhythmic synchronization of neuronal excitability across neural populations; collectively known as oscillations. In ASD there is believed to be a deficit in the ability to efficiently couple functional neural networks using these oscillations. This review discusses evidence for disruptions in oscillatory synchronization in ASD, and how disturbance of this neural mechanism contributes to alterations in sensory and perceptual function. The review also frames oscillatory data from the perspective of prevailing neurobiologically-inspired theories of ASD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oscillations Go the Distance: Low-Frequency Human Hippocampal Oscillations Code Spatial Distance in the Absence of Sensory Cues during Teleportation	NEURON			English	Article							THETA ACTIVITY; MEMORY FORMATION; NAVIGATION; MOVEMENT; RAT; INTEGRATION; RETRIEVAL; SYNCHRONY; VISION; FIELDS	Low-frequency (delta/theta band) hippocampal neural oscillations play prominent roles in computational models of spatial navigation, but their exact function remains unknown. Some theories propose they are primarily generated in response to sensorimotor processing, while others suggest a role in memory-related processing. We directly recorded hippocampal EEG activity in patients undergoing seizure monitoring while they explored a virtual environment containing teleporters. Critically, this manipulation allowed patients to experience movement through space in the absence of visual and self-motion cues. The prevalence and duration of low-frequency hippocampal oscillations were unchanged by this manipulation, indicating that sensorimotor processing was not required to elicit them during navigation. Furthermore, the frequency-wise pattern of oscillation prevalence during teleportation contained spatial information capable of classifying the distance teleported. These results demonstrate that movement-related sensory information is not required to drive spatially informative low-frequency hippocampal oscillations during navigation and suggest a specific function in memory-related spatial updating.

A photonic crystal with an active zone as small as 13 mu mx13 mu mx0.7 mu m can be easily designed to obtain a resonance Q value in the order of 1000. These resonances are then employed in electric field (E-field) sensing applications exploiting the electro optic (EO) effect of lithium niobate. A local field factor that is calculated locally for each FDTD cell is proposed to accurately estimate the sensitivity of GR based E-field sensor. The local field factor allows well agreement between simulations and reported experimental data therefore providing a valuable method in optimizing the GR structure to obtain high sensitivities. When these resonances are associated with sub-picometer optical spectrum analyzer and high field enhancement antenna design, an E-field probe with a sensitivity of 50 mu V/m could be achieved. The results of our simulations could be also exploited in other EO based applications such as EEG (Electroencephalography) or ECG (Electrocardiography) probe and E-field frequency detector with an 'invisible' probe to the field being detected etc. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America	[Qiu, Wentao; Ndao, Abdoulaye; Bernal, Maria-Pilar; Baida, Fadi Issam] Univ Besancon Franche Comte, UMR CNRS 6174, Inst FEMTO ST, Dept Opt PM Duffieux, 15B Ave Montboucons, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Lu, Huihui] Jinan Univ, Dept Optoelect Engn, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China		Baida, FI (corresponding author), Univ Besancon Franche Comte, UMR CNRS 6174, Inst FEMTO ST, Dept Opt PM Duffieux, 15B Ave Montboucons, F-25030 Besancon, France.	fadi.baida@femto-st.fr	Baida, Fadi/AAB-3826-2021; LU, Huihui/M-4924-2013	LU, Huihui/0000-0002-8761-5723	ANR ASTRID project "Esencyal" [ANR-13-ASTR-001901]; "Labex ACTION" program [ANR-11-LABX-01-01]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61405075]; Franche Comte region	ANR ASTRID project "Esencyal"(French National Research Agency (ANR)); "Labex ACTION" program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Franche Comte region(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte)	This paper has been supported by the ANR ASTRID project "Esencyal" (ANR-13-ASTR-001901), the "Labex ACTION" program (ANR-11-LABX-01-01) and the supercomputer facilities of the Mesocentre de calcul de Franche-Comte.

An observed signal is separated into multiple signals with a multi-channel Wiener filter whose coefficients are estimated based on parameter estimation of a probabilistic generative model that locally models the amplitude of each separated signal in the time-frequency domain. Effectiveness of using prior information about covariance matrices to estimate model parameters and frequency dependent covariance matrices were shown through an experiment with a simulated event-related potential data set.

This study aims to investigate methods for obtaining higher information transfer rate (ITR) through duty cycle and brightness variation of visual stimuli for steady-state visual evoked potential-based BCI. Although previous studies were concentrated on either duty cycle or brightness of stimuli separately, our study focused on the change of duty cycle and brightness of stimuli at the same time. Duty cycle values of 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 80% were used. During the experiment, 16 flickering stimuli with a frequency range between 5 and 20Hz were used on liquid crystal display. Subjects gazed to the flickers which had frequencies of 6, 12 and 15Hz. Canonical correlation analyses (CCA), a multivariate statistical method, was used for channel selection and frequency detection. According to the CCA, the maximum average accuracy of the experiment was 96.88% when the frequency of flicker was in beta band and its duty cycle was 40% with a brightness tuning wave. Under the same conditions stated above, average ITR was improved 25.38% according to the most commonly used flicker model which is square wave and has 50% duty cycle.

Goal-oriented modulation of alpha has been studied extensively. In visual spatial attention, alpha over the region of visual cortex corresponding to the attended location decreases, signifying increased excitability to facilitate the processing of impending stimuli. In contrast, in retention of verbal working memory, alpha over visual cortex increases, signifying decreased excitability to gate out stimulus input to protect the information held online from sensory interference. According to the prevailing model, this goal-oriented biasing of sensory cortex is effected by top-down control signals from frontal and parietal cortices. The present study tests and substantiates this hypothesis by (a) identifying the signals that mediate the top-down biasing influence, (b) examining whether the cortical areas issuing these signals are task specific or task independent, and (c) establishing the possible mechanism of the biasing action. High-density human EEG data were recorded in two experimental paradigms: a trial-by-trial cued visual spatial attention task and a modified Sternberg working memory task. Applying Granger causality to both sensor-level and source-level data we report the following findings. In covert visual spatial attention, the regions exerting top-down control over visual activity are lateralized to the right hemisphere, with the dipoles located at the right frontal eye field (FEF) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) being the main sources of top down influences. During retention of verbal working memory, the regions exerting top-down control over visual activity are lateralized to the left hemisphere, with the dipoles located at the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) being the main source of top-down influences. In both experiments, top down influences are mediated by alpha oscillations, and the biasing effect is likely achieved via an inhibition-disinhibition mechanism.

Coherence measures, which quantify synchrony, are affected by concurrent brain activities, commonly subsumed as noise. New method: Using Monte-Carlo simulation, we analysed the properties of circular statistics and how those are affected by noise. We considered three different models of neuroelectric signal generation, which are an additive model, phase-reset, and reciprocal phase-interaction. Using the receiver-operating characteristic method, we compared the performances of currently implemented algorithms for coherence detection such as phase-coherence or phase-locking factor, magnitude-squared coherence, and phase-lagging index, all based on circular statistics, and a more general approach to synchrony, using measures of mutual information. We compared inter-trial coherence as a method for signal detection with coherence between multiple sources as measure of source interaction and connectivity. Results: Charts of performance characteristics showed that the choice of methods depend on the underlying signal generation model. Detection of coherence requires in general a higher signal-to-noise ratio than detection of the signal itself, and again, the difference in performance depends strongly on the underlying model of signal generation. Comparison with existing methods: Previous comparisons of the performances of different algorithms for signal detection and coherence have not considered systematically the underlying neural generation mechanisms. Conclusion: Detection of coherence generated by additive signals or a phase-reset requires largely higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to signal detection. Only in case of true phase interaction, signal detection and coherence measures are similarly sensitive. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The multiscale entropy: Guidelines for use and interpretation in brain signal analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Multiscale entropy (MSE); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Brain signal variability; Brain network dynamics; Power spectrum (PS); Multiscale root-mean-square-successive-difference (MRMSSD)	PHYSIOLOGICAL TIME-SERIES; LIFE-SPAN DIFFERENCES; EEG COMPLEXITY; VARIABILITY; APPROXIMATE; DYNAMICS; SPECTRUM; HEALTHY	Background: Multiscale entropy (MSE) estimates the predictability of a signal over multiple temporal scales. It has been recently applied to study brain signal variability, notably during aging. The grounds of its application and interpretation remain unclear and subject to debate. Method: We used both simulated and experimental data to provide an intuitive explanation of MSE and to explore how it relates to the frequency content of the signal, depending on the amount of (non)linearity and stochasticity in the underlying dynamics. Results: The scaling and peak-structure of MSE curves relate to the scaling and peaks of the power spectrum in the presence of linear autocorrelations. MSE also captures nonlinear autocorrelations and their interactions with stochastic dynamical components. The previously reported crossing of young and old adults' MSE curves for EEG data appears to be mainly due to linear stochastic processes, and relates to young adults' EEG dynamics exhibiting a slower time constant. Comparison with existing methods: We make the relationship between MSE curve and power spectrum as well as with a linear autocorrelation measure, namely multiscale root-mean-square-successive difference, more explicit. MSE allows gaining insight into the time-structure of brain activity fluctuations. Its combined use with other metrics could prevent any misleading interpretations with regard to underlying stochastic processes. Conclusions: Although not straightforward, when applied to brain signals, the features of MSE curves can be linked to their power content and provide information about both linear and nonlinear autocorrelations that are present therein.

Methods: Seventeen EEG recordings with bilateral synchronous discharges of focal (focal group-FG: 10) and generalized (generalized group-GG: 7) epilepsy patients were selected for spikes and ripples marking; the spike-normalized ripple rate was calculated in each hemisphere (right/left - anterior/posterior) and a ripple-dominant hemisphere (the one with the highest rate) was identified. Concordance in FG between the ripple dominant hemisphere and the hemisphere of clinical lateralization was evaluated. The ripple-dominant/ripple-nondominant spike-normalized ripple rate ratio was studied to compare groups. Results: In FG the hemisphere of clinical lateralization and the ripple-dominant hemisphere were 100% concordant. In GG only 3/7 patients showed ripples (vs 10/10 FG), all with anterior dominance. No difference in hemisphere ripple dominance between groups was found. Conclusions: Ripples in secondary bilateral synchrony help to lateralize the epileptic focus but do not help to differentiate between focal and generalized epilepsy. This is the first report of visually identified ripples in idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Significance: Ripples confirm the clinical lateralization of the epileptic focus in secondary bilateral synchrony but cannot distinguish between focal and generalized epilepsy.

High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HFrTMS) over DLPFC reportedly reduces drug craving. Its effects on neuropsychological, behavioural and neurophysiological are unclear. Methods: We assessed psychological, behavioural and neurophysiological effects of 4 sessions of 10-min adjunctive HFrTMS over the left DLPFC during two weeks during a residential programme for alcohol detoxification. Participants were randomized to active HFrTMS (10 Hz, 100% motor threshold) or sham. Immediately before the first and after the last session, 32-channels EEG was recorded and alcohol craving Visual Analogue Scale, Symptom Check List-90-R, Numeric Stroop task and Go/No-go task administered. Tests were repeated at 1-month follow-up. Results: 17 subjects (mean age 44.7 years, 4 F) were assessed. Active rTMS subjects performed better at Stroop test at end of treatment (p = 0.036) and follow up (p = 0.004) and at Go-NoGo at end of treatment (p = 0.05) and follow up (p = 0.015). Depressive symptoms decreased at end of active treatment (p = 0.036). Active-TMS showed an overall decrease of fast EEG frequencies after treatment compared to sham (p=0.026). No significant modifications over time or group emerged for craving and number of drinks at follow up. Conclusion: 4 HFrTMS sessions over two weeks on the left DLPFC can improve inhibitory control task and selective attention and reduce depressive symptoms. An overall reduction of faster EEG frequencies was observed. Nonetheless, this schedule is ineffective in reducing craving and alcohol intake. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation with Sawtooth Waves: Simultaneous Stimulation and EEG Recording	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						tACS; EEG; sawtooth; alpha; oscillations	MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CURRENT DIRECTION; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; POWER	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has until now mostly been administered as an alternating sinusoidal wave. Despite modern tACS stimulators being able to deliver alternating current with any arbitrary shape there has been no systematic exploration into the relative benefits of different waveforms. As tACS is a relatively new technique there is a huge parameter space of unexplored possibilities which may prove superior or complimentary to the traditional sinusoidal waveform. Here, we begin to address this with an investigation into the effects of sawtooth wave tACS on individual alpha power. Evidence from animal models suggests that the gradient and direction of an electric current should be important factors for the subsequent neural firing rate; we compared positive and negative ramp sawtooth waves to test this. An additional advantage of sawtooth waves is that the resulting artifact in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording is significantly simpler to remove than a sine wave; accordingly we were able to observe alpha oscillations both during and after stimulation. We found that positive ramp sawtooth, but not negative ramp sawtooth, significantly enhanced alpha power during stimulation relative to sham (p 0.01). In addition we tested for an after-effect of both sawtooth and sinusoidal stimulation on alpha power but in this case did not find any significant effect. This preliminary study paves the way for further investigations into the effect of the gradient and direction of the current in tACS which could significantly improve the usefulness of this technique.

The three main ERPs, i.e., N170, P300, N400 were obtained after appropriate time windows selection for different response peaks and averaging EEG waveforms from all trials for each channel. Following that, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was applied on each ERP waveform and a vector of six morphological CWT-based features was constructed and fed to two well-known classifiers, i.e., SVM and k-NN. The selected ERPs were drawn from those channels where they are known to be observed more frequently. The experimental results have shown that P300 provides higher classification rates than N170 and N400, reaching a classification accuracy of 76%. Moreover, SVM and k-NN showed similar performance, with the latter being slightly more efficient. Finally, gender factorization of data contributed to a maximum classification accuracy of 80%. The proposed analysis paves the way for better understanding of the activity of the brain in different attention scenarios as reflected in the CWT domain, exploring the time-frequency characteristics of the related ERPs, contributing to the detection of potential attention disorders.

Noninvasive brain stimulation with temporally patterned waveforms such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have been proposed to modulate these oscillations. Thus, these stimulation modalities represent promising new approaches for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses in which these oscillations are impaired. However, the mechanism by which periodic brain stimulation alters endogenous oscillation dynamics is debated and appears to depend on brain state. Here, we demonstrate with a static model and a neural oscillator model that recurrent excitation in the thalamo-cortical circuit, together with recruitment of cortico-cortical connections, can explain the enhancement of oscillations by brain stimulation as a function of brain state. We then performed concurrent invasive recording and stimulation of the human cortical surface to elucidate the response of cortical oscillations to periodic stimulation and support the findings from the computational models. We found that (1) stimulation enhanced the targeted oscillation power, (2) this enhancement outlasted stimulation, and (3) the effect of stimulation depended on behavioral state. Together, our results show successful target engagement of oscillations by periodic brain stimulation and highlight the role of nonlinear interaction between endogenous network oscillations and stimulation. These mechanistic insights will contribute to the design of adaptive, more targeted stimulation paradigms.

Moreover, electrical brain activity is associated with memory functions. However, the interplay between all these effects has been investigated only scarcely. The present study investigated the extent to which the power of resting -state electroencephalographic (EEG) frequencies mediates the impact of aging on verbal and visuospatial memory. Seventy healthy participants with 22 to 83 years of age completed a visuospatial and verbal learning and memory test and provided eyes -open and eyes -closed resting -state EEG data. Robust age -related effects on behavioral and EEG data were observed. Mediation analyses showed that the relative power of the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency band in fronto-central locations partly explained the negative age -related effect on delayed recall in the verbal memory task. The relative power of the alpha II (10-12 Hz) frequency band in mainly parietal locations partly explained the negative impact of age on immediate and delayed recall in the visuospatial task. Results indicate that spontaneous brain activity carries specific information about aging processes and predicts the level of competence in verbal and visuospatial memory tasks.

Oligodendroglia-like cells (OLCs) have been observed in surgical specimens from children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. We hypothesize that OLCs recruit multiple-lobe epileptogenic zones in pediatric pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. MethodsWe examined the surgical specimens from 30 children who underwent epilepsy surgery (1.8- to 16.9-years-old; mean age 9.7 years). Immunohistochemical assays of OLCs were performed using Olig2, which is a marker of OLC. OLC populations in three sites (gray matter, gray-white matter junction, and white matter) were counted. We also performed immunohistochemical staining with neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for neuronal and astroglial markers, respectively. NeuN- and GFAP-positive cells were distinguished from OLCs. OLC results were compared with seizure types, scalp and intracranial video-electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), surgical resection area, histopathologic diagnosis, and seizure outcome. ResultsHistopathologic diagnosis consisted of 14 cases of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD; type I; 4, type II; 9, type III; one); 6 cases of oligodendrogliosis; 6 cases of astrocytic gliosis; 2 cases of hyaline protoplasmic astrocytopathy; and 2 cases of tuberous sclerosis. Fifteen children (50%) underwent multiple-lobe resections after intracranial video-EEG. There was a positive correlation between the number of resected electrodes and the OLC population in the white matter (correlation coefficient 0.581, p = 0.001) and at the gray-white matter junction- (correlation coefficient 0.426, p = 0.027). OLC populations in both areas were increased significantly in nine children with epileptic spasms (ES) (gray-white matter junction [p = 0.021] and white matter [p = 0.025]), and nine nonfocal ictal scalp EEG findings (gray-white matter junction [p = 0.04] and white matter [p = 0.042]). The OLC population in white matter was significantly increased in children with 11 nonfocal interictal scalp EEG findings (p = 0.01), with 15 multiple-lobe resections (p = 0.028). SignificancePharmacoresistant epilepsy in children with increased OLCs presented with nonfocal epileptiform discharges on scalp EEG and ES, and they required multiple-lobe resections. We found increased populations of subcortical OLCs in the extensive epileptogenic zone.

Based on our previous results, Stochastic resonance (SR) is proposed, as a WSD method on EEG signals, for the first time. This novel methodology takes advantage of noise transitions on a non-linear, bi-stable, double well system. These transitions are synchronized with brain oscillations embedded in the EEG signal, achieving the desired brain waves enhancement. More over, our methodology modifies the bistable well separation and depth modulation on the Duffing system, having as target point the maximum SNR hence, recovering most of the input waveform shape. Dataset from the international BCI competition IV was used in this research, with an estimated SNR of -24dB. After stochastic resonance processing, the resulting signal enhancement on the desired mu - beta band was observed, with an output SNR of 1.31dB during motor imagery and 1.41dB on resting states. In order to demonstrate the signal processing methodology applicability, a single EEG trial is reported from 17 channels processed. Also, for comparative purposes, dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) was applied to the same EEG signal. The results exhibit comparable, or even a better, signal enhancement with SR methodology than DWT processing.

Preliminary evidence of reduced brain network activation in patients with post-traumatic migraine following concussion	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sport-related concussion; Brain network activation; Electroencephalography; Post-traumatic migraine	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HIGH-SCHOOL; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RECOVERY; SPORT; IMPACT; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT; PREDICTORS	Post-traumatic migraine (PTM) (i.e., headache, nausea, light and/or noise sensitivity) is an emerging risk factor for prolonged recovery following concussion. Concussions and migraine share similar pathophysiology characterized by specific ionic imbalances in the brain. Given these similarities, patients with PTM following concussion may exhibit distinct electrophysiological patterns, although researchers have yet to examine the electrophysiological brain activation in patients with PTM following concussion. A novel approach that may help differentiate brain activation in patients with and without PTM is brain network activation (BNA) analysis. BNA involves an algorithmic analysis applied to multichannel EEG-ERP data that provides a network map of cortical activity and quantitative data during specific tasks. A prospective, repeated measures design was used to evaluate BNA (during Go/NoGo task), EEG-ERP, cognitive performance, and concussion related symptoms at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-injury intervals among athletes with a medically diagnosed concussion with PTM (n=15) and without (NO-PTM) (n=22); and age, sex, and concussion history matched controls without concussion (CONTROL) (n=20). Participants with PTM had significantly reduced BNA compared to NO-PTM and CONTROLS for Go and NoGo components at 3 weeks and for NoGo component at 4 weeks post-injury. The PTM group also demonstrated a more prominent deviation of network activity compared to the other two groups over a longer period of time. The composite BNA algorithm may be a more sensitive measure of electrophysiological change in the brain that can augment established cognitive assessment tools for detecting impairment in individuals with PTM.

We describe the conditions for HFO detection in ECoG and scalp EEG in intraoperative recordings. Methods: During neurosurgical interventions in six patients under propofol anesthesia, the SEP was recorded from subdural electrode strips (15 recordings) and from scalp electrodes (10/15 recordings). We quantified the spatial attenuation of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of N20 and HFO along the contacts of the electrode strip. We then compared the SNR of ECoG and simultaneous scalp EEG in a biophysical framework. Results: HFO detection under propofol anesthesia was demonstrated. Visual inspection of strip cortical recordings revealed phase reversal for N20 in 14/15 recordings and for HFO in 10/15 recordings. N20 had higher maximal SNR (median 33.5 dB) than HFO (median 23 dB). The SNR of N20 attenuated with a larger spatial extent (median 7.2 dB/cm) than the SNR of HFO (median 12.3 dB/cm). We found significant correlations between the maximum SNR (rho = 0.58, p = 0.025) and the spatial attenuation (rho = 0.86, p < 0.001) of N20 and HFO. In 3/10 recordings we found HFO in scalp EEG. Based on the spatial attenuation and SNR in the ECoG, we estimated the scalp EEG amplitude ratio N20/HFO and found significant correlation with recorded values (rho = 0.65, p = 0.049). Conclusions: We proved possible the intraoperative SEP HFO detection under propofol anesthesia. The spatial attenuation along ECoG contacts represents a good estimator of the area contributing to scalp EEG. The SNR and the spatial attenuation in ECoG recordings provide further insights for the prediction of HFO detectability in scalp EEG. The results obtained in this context may not be limited to SEP HFO, but could be generalized to biological signatures lying in the same SNR and frequency range. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Interestingly, each subject reveals an individual frequency of the auditory gamma-band response (GBR) that coincides with the peak in the auditory steady state response (ASSR). A common resonance frequency of auditory cortex seems to underlie both the individual frequency of the GBR and the peak of the ASSR. This review sheds light on the functional role of oscillatory gamma activity for auditory processing. For successful processing, the auditory system has to track changes in auditory input over time and store information about past events in memory which allows the construction of auditory objects. Recent findings support the idea of gamma oscillations being involved in the partitioning of auditory input into discrete samples to facilitate higher order processing. We review experiments that seem to suggest that inter-individual differences in the resonance frequency are behaviorally relevant for gap detection and speech processing. A possible application of these resonance frequencies for brain computer interfaces is illustrated with regard to optimized individual presentation rates for auditory input to correspond with endogenous oscillatory activity.

Different techniques have been reported in literature to detect driver's drowsiness, but almost all the prevailing systems only alert the driver if drowsiness is detected. Consequently, the drowsy driver continues driving, with a high risk of devastating accident. In this paper, we proposed and verified an EEG based system which not only alerts the driver by alarm, but also puts the vehicle in semiautomatic parking mode by controlling fuel supply if drowsiness is detected. At the same time, it reports nearby police station by SMS which contains necessary information to take essential steps locating the vehicle. Stored EEG signals, obtained with wireless wearable headsets from numerous subjects in different conditions by different research groups, were used in this work. Power spectrum analyses were carried out in MATLAB to determine the dominant frequency components in the brain signals. The slow wave to fast wave ratios of EEG activities were assessed for a number of epochs to determine driver's drowsiness.

They are often assessed independently with three imaging modalities: SC using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), FC using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG). DWI provides information about white matter organization, allowing the reconstruction of fiber bundles. fMRI uses blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast to indirectly map neuronal activation. MEG and EEG are direct measures of neuronal activity, as they are sensitive to the synchronous inputs in pyramidal neurons. Seminal studies have targeted either the electrophysiological substrate of BOLD or the anatomical basis of FC. However, multimodal comparisons have been scarcely performed, and the relation between SC, fMRI-FC, and MEG-FC is still unclear. Here we present a systematic comparison of SC, resting state fMRI-FC, and MEG-FC between cortical regions, by evaluating their similarities at three different scales: global network, node, and hub distribution. We obtained strong similarities between the three modalities, especially for the following pairwise combinations: SC and fMRI-FC; SC and MEG-FC at theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands; and fMRI-FC and MEG-FC in alpha and beta. Furthermore, highest node similarity was found for regions of the default mode network and primary motor cortex, which also presented the highest hubness score. Distance was partially responsible for these similarities since it biased all three connectivity estimates, but not the unique contributor, since similarities remained after controlling for distance.

This is partially due to the scale of neural involvements in team activities, spanning the millisecond oscillations in individual brains to the minutes/hours performance behaviors of the team. We have used intermediate neurodynamic representations to show that healthcare teams enter persistent (50-100 s) neurodynamic states when they encounter and resolve uncertainty while managing simulated patients. Each of the second symbols was developed situating the electroencephalogram (EEG) power of each team member in the contexts of those of other team members and the task. These representations were acquired from EEG headsets with 19 recording electrodes for each of the 1-40 Hz frequencies. Estimates of the information in each symbol stream were calculated from a 60 s moving window of Shannon entropy that was updated each second, providing a quantitative neurodynamic history of the team's performance. Neurodynamic organizations fluctuated with the task demands with increased organization (i.e., lower entropy) occurring when the team needed to resolve uncertainty. These results show that intermediate neurodynamic representations can provide a quantitative bridge between the micro and macro scales of teamwork.

Modeling the neurodynamic organizations and interactions of teams	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Entropy; Team neurodynamics; Mutual information teamwork; EEG; Synchrony	OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; REDUNDANCY; COGNITION; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; GAMMA	Across-brain neurodynamic organizations arise when teams perform coordinated tasks. We describe a symbolic electroencephalographic (EEG) approach that identifies when team neurodynamic organizations occur and demonstrate its utility with scientific problem solving and submarine navigation tasks. Each second, neurodynamic symbols (NS) were created showing the 1-40Hz EEG power spectral densities for each team member. These data streams contained a performance history of the team's across-brain neurodynamic organizations. The degree of neurodynamic organization was calculated each second from a moving window average of the Shannon entropy over the task. Decreased NS entropy (i.e., greater neurodynamic organization) was prominent in the ~16Hz EEG bins during problem solving, while during submarine navigation, the maximum NS entropy decreases were ~10Hz and were associated with establishing the ship's location. Decreased NS entropy also occurred in the 20-40Hz bins of both teams and was associated with uncertainty or stress. The highest mutual information levels, calculated from the EEG values of team dyads, were associated with decreased NS entropy, suggesting a link between these two measures. These studies show entropy and mutual information mapping of symbolic EEG data streams from teams can be useful for identifying organized across-brain team activation patterns.

Freezing behavior can emerge when attentional capacity is reduced, i.e. under dual task interference. In this study, we characterized the cortical network signatures underlying the susceptibility to freezing during continuous finger tapping. Methods: Fourteen PD patients with STN-DBS and thirteen age-and gender-matched healthy controls performed continuous tapping with the index finger as single motor task and during dual tasking. Synchronized EEG and mechanogram of the finger tapping were recorded. Subsequently, we analyzed cortical activity and cortico-cortical phase synchronization. We correlated these spectral measures with the biomechanically confirmed numbers of freezing episodes during finger tapping. Results: During dual tasking compared to the single motor task, PD patients showed an increase of cortico-cortical phase synchronization over the left prefrontal area from 13 to 30 Hz. This correlated with increased occurrence of freezing episodes. Interestingly, PD patients lacked the increase of prefrontal cortico-cortical synchronization from 4 to 7 Hz during dual tasking as observed in healthy controls. Conclusion: Dual task interference led to an increase of left prefrontal beta band synchronization (1330 Hz) in PD and this increment predicted the number of freezing episodes. This increment may underscore the relevance of prefrontal executive dysfunction in freezing susceptibility. Significance: These findings enhance our understanding of the pathological network mechanisms behind increased susceptibility to freezing behavior.

Permutation entropy, an average of frequencies of order patterns, was suggested by Bandt and Pompe in 2002 and used by many authors as a complexity measure in physics, medicine, engineering, and economy. Here a modified version is introduced, the " distance to white noise." For datasets with tens of thousands or even millions of values, which are becoming standard in many fields, it is possible to study order patterns separately, determine certain differences of their frequencies, and define corresponding autocorrelation type functions. In contrast to classical autocorrelation, these functions are invariant with respect to nonlinear monotonic transformations of the data. For order three patterns, a variance-analytic " Pythagoras formula" combines the different autocorrelation functions with our new version of permutation entropy. We demonstrate the use of such correlation type functions in sliding window analysis of biomedical and environmental data.

Our focus is on multivariate measures of dependence based on the Granger causality (G-causality) principle, their applications and performance in respect of robustness to noise, volume conduction, common driving, and presence of a "weak node." Application of G-causality measures to EEG, intracranial signals and fMRI time series is addressed G-causality based measures defined in the frequency domain allow the synchronization between neural populations and the directed propagation of their electrical activity to be determined. The time-varying G-causality based measure Short-time Directed Transfer Function (SDTF) supplies information on the dynamics of synchronization and the organization of neural networks. Inspection of effective connectivity patterns indicates a modular structure of neural networks, with a stronger coupling within modules than between them. The hypothetical plausible mechanism of information processing, suggested by the identified synchronization patterns, is communication between tightly coupled modules intermitted by sparser interactions providing synchronization of distant structures.

Brain connectivity in autism spectrum disorder	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						autism spectrum disorder; brain connectivity; graph theory	DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG COHERENCE; HERITABILITY; MECHANISM; PATTERNS; NETWORK; GENES	Purpose of reviewMany studies have reported that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have different brain connectivity patterns compared with typically developing individuals. However, the results of more recent studies do not unanimously support the traditional view in which individuals with ASD have lower connectivity between distant brain regions and increased connectivity within local brain regions. In this review, we discuss different methods for measuring brain connectivity and how the use of different metrics may contribute to the lack of convergence of investigations of connectivity in ASD.Recent findingsThe discrepancy in brain connectivity results across studies may be due to important methodological factors, such as the connectivity measure applied, the age of patients studied, the brain region(s) examined, and the time interval and frequency band(s) in which connectivity was analyzed.SummaryWe conclude that more sophisticated electroencephalography analytic approaches should be utilized to more accurately infer causation and directionality of information transfer between brain regions, which may show dynamic changes of functional connectivity in the brain. Moreover, further investigations of connectivity with respect to behavior and clinical phenotype are needed to probe underlying brain networks implicated in core deficits of ASD.

Nevertheless, the cost/effectiveness of BCI-based rehabilitative interventions remains to be addressed when considering the heterogeneity in the post-stroke functional motor impairment (clinical status) and the central nervous system reorganization (neuroplasticity). In this paper, we will provide preliminary findings on how multimodal neurophysiological methods to asses potential recovery after stroke can be use to foster an effective applicability of BCI technology in neuro-rehabilitation care.

LMD, a new self-adaptive time-frequency analysis method, is applied to decompose the vibration signal into a set of product functions (PFs). Then, PE values of the first five PFs (PF-PE) are calculated to characterize the complexity of the vibration signal. Finally, for the purpose of less time-consuming and higher accuracy, ELM is used to identify and classify of gearbox in different fault types. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in diagnosing and classifying different states of gearbox in short time.

J	van der Meij, R; van Ede, F; Maris, E				van der Meij, Roemer; van Ede, Freek; Maris, Eric			Rhythmic Components in Extracranial Brain Signals Reveal Multifaceted Task Modulation of Overlapping Neuronal Activity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PARALLEL FACTOR-ANALYSIS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; ANTICIPATORY ALPHA; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG-DATA; CORTICAL NETWORKS; BLIND SEPARATION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION	Oscillatory neuronal activity is implicated in many cognitive functions, and its phase coupling between sensors may reflect networks of communicating neuronal populations. Oscillatory activity is often studied using extracranial recordings and compared between experimental conditions. This is challenging, because there is overlap between sensor-level activity generated by different sources, and this can obscure differential experimental modulations of these sources. Additionally, in extracranial data, sensor-level phase coupling not only reflects communicating populations, but can also be generated by a current dipole, whose sensor-level phase coupling does not reflect source-level interactions. We present a novel method, which is capable of separating and characterizing sources on the basis of their phase coupling patterns as a function of space, frequency and time (trials). Importantly, this method depends on a plausible model of a neurobiological rhythm. We present this model and an accompanying analysis pipeline. Next, we demonstrate our approach, using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings during a cued tactile detection task as a case study. We show that the extracted components have overlapping spatial maps and frequency content, which are difficult to resolve using conventional pairwise measures. Because our decomposition also provides trial loadings, components can be readily contrasted between experimental conditions. Strikingly, we observed heterogeneity in alpha and beta sources with respect to whether their activity was suppressed or enhanced as a function of attention and performance, and this happened both in task relevant and irrelevant regions. This heterogeneity contrasts with the common view that alpha and beta amplitude over sensory areas are always negatively related to attention and performance.

Spatial Coherence Profiles of Ictal High-Frequency Oscillations Correspond to Those of Interictal Low-Frequency Oscillations in the ECoG of Epileptic Patients	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Epilepsy; high-frequency oscillations (HFOs); low-frequency oscillations (LFOs); phase coherence	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SEIZURE ONSET; EEG; HZ; DYNAMICS	Goal: We have previously demonstrated that the coherence of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80-300 Hz) increased during extratemporal lobe seizures in a consistent and spatially focused electrode cluster. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between cohered HFO intracranial EEG (iEEG) activity with that of slower low-frequency oscillations (LFOs; <80 Hz). Methods: We applied wavelet phase coherence analysis to the iEEGs of patients with intractable extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE). Results: It was observed that areas on the implanted patient subdural grids, which exhibited strong ictal HFO coherence were similar to tissue regions displaying strong interictal LFO coherence in the 5-12 Hz frequency range, relative to all other electrodes. A positive surgical outcome was correlated with having the clinically marked seizure onset zone(s) in close proximity to HFO/LFO coherence highlighted regions of interest (ROIs). Conclusion: Recent studies have suggested that LFOs (in the 8-12 Hz frequency range) play an important role in controlling cortical excitability, by exerting an inhibitory effect on cortical processing, and that the presence of strong theta activity (4-8 Hz) in awake adults is suggestive of abnormal and/or pathological activity. We speculate that the overlapping spatial regions exhibiting increased coherence in both ictal HFOs and interictal LFOs identified local abnormalities that underlie epileptogenic networks. Significance: Whereas it is worthwhile to note that the small patient group (n = 7) studied here, somewhat limits the clinical significance of our study, the results presented here suggest targeting HFO activity in the 80-300 Hz frequency range and/or interictal LFO activity in the 5-12 Hz frequency range, when defining seizure-related ROIs in the iEEGs of patients with ETLE.

In WM cognitive task paradigms employing electroencephalography (EEG), brain rhythms such as theta and alpha have been linked to specific functional roles over given brain areas, but their functional coupling has not been extensively studied. Here we analyzed an arithmetic task with five cognitive workload levels (CWLs) and demonstrated functional/effective coupling between the two WM subsystems: the central executive located over frontal (F) brain areas that oscillates on the dominant theta rhythm (Frontal(theta)/F-theta) and the storage buffer located over parieto-occipital (PO) brain areas that operates on the alpha(2) dominant brain rhythm (Parieto-Occipital(alpha 2)/PO alpha 2). We focused on important differences between and within WM subsystems in relation to behavioral performance. A repertoire of brain connectivity estimators was employed to elucidate the distinct roles of amplitude, phase within and between frequencies, and the hierarchical role of functionally specialized brain areas related to the task. Specifically, for each CWL, we conducted a) a conventional signal power analysis within both frequency bands at F-theta and PO alpha 2, b) the intra- and inter-frequency phase interactions between F-theta and PO alpha 2, and c) their causal phase and amplitude relationship. We found no significant statistical difference of signal power or phase interactions between correct and wrong answers. Interestingly, the study of causal interactions between F-theta and PO alpha 2 revealed frontal brain region(s) as the leader, while the strength differentiated between correct and wrong responses in every CWL with absolute accuracy. Additionally, zero time-lag between bilateral F-theta and right PO alpha 2 could serve as an indicator of mental calculation failure. Overall, our study highlights the significant role of coordinated activity between F-theta and PO alpha 2 via their causal interactions and the timing for arithmetic performance.

Different candidate biomarkers are currently studied for the risk of dementia in PD. Several studies have shown that quantitative EEG (QEEG) is a promising predictor of PD-related cognitive decline. In this paper we briefly outline the basics of QEEG analysis and analyze the recent publications addressing the predictive value of QEEG in the context of cognitive decline in PD. The MEDLINE database was searched for relevant publications from January 01, 2005, to March 02, 2015. Twenty-four studies reported QEEG findings in various cognitive states in PD. Spectral and connectivity markers of QEEG could help to discriminate between PD patients with different level of cognitive decline. QEEG variables correlate with tools for cognitive assessment over time and are associated with significant hazard ratios to predict PD-related dementia. QEEG analysis shows high test-retest reliability and avoids learning effects associated with some neuropsychological testing; it is noninvasive and relatively easy to repeat.

These regions are commonly observed to be coactivated in BOLD measurements during perception of visual objects. In this study, we aimed to disentangle node-level and network-level activities in millisecond timescale of perception and decision-making in attempts to answer questions about timing and frequency of brain oscillatory activities. We used clear and noisy face-house image categorization tasks and human scalp electroencephalography recordings combined with source reconstruction techniques to study when and how oscillatory activity organizes within the FFA, PPA, and DLPFC. We uncovered the dynamics of two oscillatory networks-beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-100 Hz). In beta band, the node and network activities were enhanced in time frame of 125-250 msec after stimulus onset, the FFA and PPA acted as main outflow hubs and the DLPFC as a main inflow hub, and network activities negatively correlated with behavior measures of noise levels (response times). In gamma band, node and network activities were elevated in time frame of 0-125 msec after stimulus onset, the DLPFC acted as a main outflow hub, and finally network activities were positively correlated with the noise level. These findings broaden our understanding of temporal evolution of node and network features associated with visual perceptual decision-making.

Oscillations in the gamma band (30-45Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been involved in these cognitive functions. In previous studies, we analysed the extent of functional connectivity between cortical areas employing the mean squared coherence' analysis of the EEG gamma band. We demonstrated that gamma coherence is maximal during alert wakefulness and is almost absent during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The nucleus pontis oralis (NPO) is critical for REM sleep generation. The NPO is considered to exert executive control over the initiation and maintenance of REM sleep. In the cat, depending on the previous state of the animal, a single microinjection of carbachol (a cholinergic agonist) into the NPO can produce either REM sleep [REM sleep induced by carbachol (REMc)] or a waking state with muscle atonia, i.e. cataplexy [cataplexy induced by carbachol (CA)]. In the present study, in cats that were implanted with electrodes in different cortical areas to record polysomnographic activity, we compared the degree of gamma (30-45Hz) coherence during REMc, CA and naturally-occurring behavioural states. Gamma coherence was maximal during CA and alert wakefulness. In contrast, gamma coherence was almost absent during REMc as in naturally-occurring REM sleep. We conclude that, in spite of the presence of somatic muscle paralysis, there are remarkable differences in cortical activity between REMc and CA, which confirm that EEG gamma (approximate to 40Hz) coherence is a trait that differentiates wakefulness from REM sleep.

These are the MR scanning artifact and the blood-pulsation artifact - strategies to remove them are a topic of ongoing research. Additionally large, unsystematic artifacts are produced across the full frequency spectrum by the magnet's helium pump (and ventilator) systems which are notoriously hard to remove. As a consequence, experimenters routinely deactivate the helium pump during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions which potentially risks damaging the MRI system and necessitates more frequent and expensive helium refills. We present a novel correction method addressing both helium pump and ballisto-cardiac (BCG) artifacts, consisting of carbon-wire loops (CWL) as additional sensors to accurately track unpredictable artifacts related to subtle movements in the scanner, and an EEGLAB plugin to perform artifact correction. We compare signal-to-noise metrics of EEG data, corrected with CWL and three conventional correction methods, for helium pump off and on measurements. Because the CWL setup records signals in real-time, it fits requirements of applications where immediate correction is necessary, such as neuro-feedback applications or stimulation time-locked to specific sleep oscillations. The comparison metrics in this paper relate to: (1) the EEG signal itself, (2) the "eyes open vs. eyes closed" effect, and (3) an assessment of how the artifact corrections impacts the ability to perform meaningful correlations between EEG alpha power and the BOLD signal. Results show that the CWL correction corrects for He pump artifact and also produces EEG data more comparable to EEG obtained outside the magnet than conventional post-processing methods.

Nonlinear Coupling between Cortical Oscillations and Muscle Activity during Isotonic Wrist Flexion	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						corticomuscular coupling; nonlinear coherence; sensorimotor system; EEG; EMG	CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MOTOR CORTEX; SOMATOSENSORY AREAS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE; EEG; RECTIFICATION	Coupling between cortical oscillations and muscle activity facilitates neuronal communication during motor control. The linear part of this coupling, known as corticomuscular coherence, has received substantial attention, even though neuronal communication underlying motor control has been demonstrated to be highly nonlinear. A full assessment of corticomuscular coupling, including the nonlinear part, is essential to understand the neuronal communication within the sensorimotor system. In this study, we applied the recently developed n:m coherence method to assess nonlinear corticomuscular coupling during isotonic wrist flexion. The n:m coherence is a generalized metric for quantifying nonlinear cross-frequency coupling as well as linear iso-frequency coupling. By using independent component analysis (ICA) and equivalent current dipole source localization, we identify four sensorimotor related brain areas based on the locations of the dipoles, i.e., the contralateral primary sensorimotor areas, supplementary motor area (SMA), prefrontal area (PFA) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). For all these areas, linear coupling between electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) is present with peaks in the beta band (15-35 Hz), while nonlinear coupling is detected with both integer (1:2, 1:3, 1:4) and non-integer (2:3) harmonics. Significant differences between brain areas is shown in linear coupling with stronger coherence for the primary sensorimotor areas and motor association cortices (SMA, PFA) compared to the sensory association area (PPC); but not for the nonlinear coupling. Moreover, the detected nonlinear coupling is similar to previously reported nonlinear coupling of cortical activity to somatosensory stimuli. We suggest that the descending motor pathways mainly contribute to linear corticomuscular coupling, while nonlinear coupling likely originates from sensory feedback.

J	Bono, V; Das, S; Jamal, W; Maharatna, K				Bono, Valentina; Das, Saptarshi; Jamal, Wasifa; Maharatna, Koushik			Hybrid wavelet and EMD/ICA approach for artifact suppression in pervasive EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Artifact suppression; EMD; ICA; WPT; Motion artifact; Wireless pervasive EEG	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; AUTOMATIC REMOVAL; SOURCE SEPARATION; ICA; OSCILLATIONS; CANCELLATION; RECORDINGS; ALGORITHMS; SIGNALS	Background: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often corrupted with unintended artifacts which need to be removed for extracting meaningful clinical information from them. Typically a priori knowledge of the nature of the artifacts is needed for such purpose. Artifact contamination of EEG is even more prominent for pervasive EEG systems where the subjects are free to move and thereby introducing a wide variety of motion-related artifacts. This makes hard to get a priori knowledge about their characteristics rendering conventional artifact removal techniques often ineffective. New method: In this paper, we explore the performance of two hybrid artifact removal algorithms: Wavelet Packet Transform followed by Independent Component Analysis (WPTICA) and Wavelet Packet Transform followed by Empirical Mode Decomposition (WPTEMD) in pervasive EEG recording scenario, assuming existence of no a priori knowledge about the artifacts and compare their performance with two existing artifact removal algorithms. Results: Artifact cleaning performance has been measured using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Artifact to Signal Ratio (ASR)-an index similar to traditional Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and also by observing normalized power distribution topography over the scalp. Comparison with existing method(s): Comparison has been made first using semi-simulated signals and then with real experimentally acquired EEG data with commercially available 19-channel pervasive EEG system Enobio corrupted by eight types of artifact. Conclusions: Our explorations show that WPTEMD consistently gives best artifact cleaning performance not only in semi-simulated scenario but also in the case of real EEG data containing artifacts.

A novel method for deriving causal interactions between brain waves of different frequencies is essential for a better understanding of the neural dynamics of such complex cognitive process. Here, we proposed a novel method to estimate transfer entropy (TE) through a symbolization scheme, which is based on neural-gas algorithm (NG) and encodes a bivariate time series in the form of two symbolic sequences. Given the symbolic sequences, the delay symbolic transfer entropy (dSTE(NG)) is defined. Our approach is akin to standard symbolic transfer entropy (STE) that incorporates the ordinal pattern (OP) symbolization technique. We assessed the proposed method in a WM-invoked paradigm that included a mental arithmetic task at various levels of difficulty. Effective interactions between Frontal(theta) (F-theta) and Parieto-Occipital(alpha 2) (PO alpha 2) brain waves were detected in multichannel EEG recordings from 16 subjects. Compared with conventional methods, our technique was less sensitive to noise and demonstrated improved computational efficiency in quantifying the dominating direction of effective connectivity between brain waves of different spectral content. Moreover, we discovered an efferent F-theta connectivity pattern and an afferent PO alpha 2 one, in all the levels of the task. Further statistical analysis revealed an increasing dSTE(NG) strength following the task's difficulty.

However, it remains unclear how behavior is governed in the context of temporal variability: What role do temporal expectations play, and how do they interact with the strength of neural oscillatory activity? Here, human participants detected near-threshold targets in temporally variable acoustic sequences. Temporal expectation strength was estimated using an oscillator model and pre-target neural amplitudes in auditory cortex were extracted from magnetoencephalography signals. Temporal expectations modulated target-detection performance, however, only when neural delta-band amplitudes were large. Thus, slow neural oscillations act to gate influences of temporal expectation on perception. Furthermore, slow amplitude fluctuations governed linear and quadratic influences of auditory alpha-band activity on performance. By fusing a model of temporal expectation with neural oscillatory dynamics, the current findings show that human perception in temporally variable contexts relies on complex interactions between multiple neural frequency bands.

These disorders are prevalent, bearing significant societal and financial costs which require the consideration of new treatment strategies and a better understanding of the physiological and cognitive processes surrounding the time of preparing for sleep or falling asleep. Here, we search for neuro-cognitive associations in the resting state and examine their relevance for predicting sleep-onset latency using multi-level mixed models. Multiple EEG recordings were obtained from healthy male participants (N = 13) during a series of 5 min eyes-closed resting-state trials (in total, n = 223) followed by a periodvarying in length up to 30 minthat either allowed subjects to transition into sleep (sleep trials, n(sleep) = 144) or was ended while they were still awake (wake trials, n(wake) = 79). After both eyes-closed rest, sleep and wake trials, subjective experience was assessed using the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ). Our data revealed multiple associations between eyes-closed rest alpha and theta oscillations and ARSQ-dimensions Discontinuity of Mind, Self, Theory of Mind, Planning, and Sleepiness. The sleep trials showed that the transition toward the first sleep stage exclusively affected subjective experiences related to Theory of Mind, Planning, and Sleepiness. Importantly, sleep-onset latency was negatively associated both with eyes-closed rest ratings on the ARSQ dimension of Sleepiness and with the long-range temporal correlations of parietal theta oscillations derived by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). These results could be relevant to the development of personalized tools that help evaluate the success of falling asleep based on measures of resting-state cognition and EEG biomarkers.	[Diaz, B.

A complex system is a multi-component system with a large number of units characterized by cooperative behavior and, consequently, emergence of well-defined self-organized structures, such as communities in a complex network. The self-organizing behavior of the brain neural network is probably the most important prototype of complexity and is studied by means of physiological signals such as the ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG). Physiological signals are typically intermittent, i.e., display non-smooth rapid variations or crucial events (e.g., cusps or abrupt jumps) that occur randomly in time, or whose frequency changes randomly. In this work, we introduce a complexity-based approach to the analysis and modeling of physiological data that is focused on the characterization of intermittent events. Recent findings about self-similar or fractal intermittency in human EEG are reviewed. The definition of brain event is a crucial aspect of this approach that is discussed in the last part of the paper, where we also propose and discuss a first version of a general-purpose event detection algorithm for EEG signals.

Recent neuroscientific hypotheses have proposed that neural oscillations contribute to speech parsing, but whether they do so on the basis of acoustic cues (bottom-up acoustic parsing) or as a function of available linguistic representations (top-down linguistic parsing) is unknown. In this magnetoencephalography study, we contrasted acoustic and linguistic parsing using bistable speech sequences. While listening to the speech sequences, participants were asked to maintain one of the two possible speech percepts through volitional control. We predicted that the tracking of speech dynamics by neural oscillations would not only follow the acoustic properties but also shift in time according to the participant's conscious speech percept. Our results show that the latency of high-frequency activity (specifically, beta and gamma bands) varied as a function of the perceptual report. In contrast, the phase of low-frequency oscillations was not strongly affected by top-down control. Whereas changes in low-frequency neural oscillations were compatible with the encoding of prelexical segmentation cues, high-frequency activity specifically informed on an individual's conscious speech percept.

Gamma and Beta Oscillations Define a Sequence of Neurocognitive Modes Present in Odor Processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						coherence; neural oscillation; olfactory bulb; piriform cortex	OLFACTORY-BULB; GO/NO-GO; DISCRIMINATION; SYSTEM; MODULATION; ACCURACY; NETWORK; RABBIT; SPEED; EEG	Olfactory system beta (15-35 Hz) and gamma (40 - 110 Hz) oscillations of the local field potential in mammals have both been linked to odor learning and discrimination. Gamma oscillations represent the activity of a local network within the olfactory bulb, and beta oscillations represent engagement of a systemwide network. Here, we test whether beta and gamma oscillations represent different cognitive modes using the different demands of go/no-go and two-alternative choice tasks that previously were suggested to favor beta or gammaoscillations, respectively. Were concile previous studies and show that both beta and gamma oscillations occur in both tasks, with gamma dominating the early odor sampling period (2-4 sniffs) and beta dominating later. The relative power and coherence of both oscillations depend separately on multiple factors within both tasks without categorical differences across tasks. While the early/gammaassociated period occurs in all trials, rats can perform above chance without the later/beta-associated period. Longer sampling, which includes beta oscillations, is associated with better performance. Gamma followed by beta oscillations therefore represents a sequence of cognitive and neural states during odor discrimination, which can be separately modified depending on the demands of a task and odor discrimination. Additionally, fast (85 Hz) and slow (70 Hz) olfactory bulb gamma oscillation sub-bands have been hypothesized to represent tufted and mitral cell networks, respectively (Manabe and Mori, 2013). We find that fast gamma favors the early and slow gamma the later (beta-dominated) odor-sampling period and that the relative contributions of these oscillations are consistent across tasks.

J. & Chauvel, P. (2002) Epileptic fast activity can be explained by a model of impaired GABAergic dendritic inhibition. Eur. J. Neurosci., 15, 1499.] to explain several different types of electroencephalographic activities. We could find three principal types of steady states when the system parameters change slowly: (i) the model produce a constant output when it is under a state of stable equilibrium point with a constant input. If a small perturbation is introduced (e.g., noisy input), the output changes into noise without oscillatory components, which is related to the normal background activity or low-voltage rapid activity, (ii) Hopf bifurcations lead to stable limit cycles, which we call Hopf cycles. The model generates a rhythmic oscillating output when it is under a state of Hopf cycles, which is related to slow rhythmic activity or slow quasi-sinusoidal activity, (iii) global bifurcations lead to homoclinic limit cycles that appear suddenly at high amplitude, which we call spike cycles. In general, the spike cycles are not harmonic but they have a spike-like appearance (anharmonic oscillation). The model produces a spike-like output when it is under a state of spike cycles, which is related to the sustained discharge of spikes. Finally, the bifurcation analysis demonstrates the influence of the interaction between the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic gains on the dynamics.

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Eight patients with focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical surface and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3 T with a whole-brain PC-SIRS imaging sequence with alternating SL-on and SLoff and two-dimensional echo-planar readout. The power of the SL radiofrequency pulse was set to 120 Hz to sensitize the sequence to high gamma oscillations present in epileptogenic tissue. Phase cycling was applied to capture distributed current orientations. Voxel-wise subtraction of SL-off from SL-on images enabled the separation of T2* effects from rotary saturation effects. The topography of PCSIRS effects was compared with the seizure onset zone at intracranial EEG and with surface IED-related potentials. Bayesian statistics were used to test whether prior PC-SIRS information could improve IED source reconstruction. Results: Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone were detected in six of eight patients (concordance rate, 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.40, 0.94) by means of the PC-SIRS technique. They were concordant with IED surface negativity in seven of eight patients (0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.51, 1.00). Including PC-SIRS as prior information improved the evidence of the standard EEG source models compared with the use of uninformed reconstructions (exceedance probability, 0.77 vs 0.12; Wilcoxon test of model evidence, P < .05). Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects resolved in patients with favorable postsurgical outcomes, but persisted in patients with postsurgical seizure recurrence. Conclusion: Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects are detectable during interictal periods with the PC-SIRS approach in patients with epilepsy. The method may be useful for MR imagingbased detection of neuronal currents in a clinical environment.

Social stress is a prevalent stress in man, and the repeated social defeat stress model in rats has been proposed as being the rodent equivalent to loss of control, which in subordinate animals produces alterations that resemble several of the cardinal symptoms found in depressed patients. Here, rats followed a resident-intruder protocol for 4 consecutive days during which behavioural, physiological, and electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters were simultaneously monitored in subordinate rats. On day 5, prefrontal dopamine (DA) and hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) as well as corticosterone were measured in submissive rats that had visual, acoustic, and olfactory (but no physical) contact with a dominant, resident conspecific rat. Socially defeated rats demonstrated increases in ultrasonic vocalizations (20-25 KHz), freezing, submissive defensive behaviour, inactivity, and haemodynamic response, while decreases were found in repetitive grooming behaviour and body weight. Additionally, alterations in the sleep-wake architecture were associated with reduced active waking, enhanced light sleep, and increased frequency of transitions from light sleep to quiet wakefulness, indicating sleep instability. Moreover, the attenuation of EEG power over the frequency range of 4.2-30 Hz, associated with a sharp transient increase in delta oscillations, appeared to reflect increased brain activity and metabolism in subordinate animals. These EEG changes were synchronous with a marked increase in body temperature and a decrease in locomotor activity. Furthermore, psychosocial stress consistently increased 5-HT, DA, and corticosterone levels. The increased levels of cortical DA and hippocampal 5-HT during social threat may reflect a coping mechanism to promote alertness and psychological adaptation to provocative and threatening stimuli. These neurophysiological changes are hypothesized to be the consequence of dynamics in mono amine systems, which could be useful markers for disease progression in the aetiology of depression.

Indices of Coherence of EEG Rhythms in the Course of Cognitive Activity as Markers of Creative Thinking: Gender Specificity	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							SEX-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ASSOCIATION; ADULTS; TASK	According to the results of psychological testing, persons aged 18 to 21 years were divided into four groups, women and men with low and high productivity of divergent (creative, nonroutine) thinking (n = = 18 to 23). Results of EEG recording (19 leads) were used for calculation of the coherence coefficients for oscillations of the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, beta, and gamma frequencies in lead pairs and estimation of integral indices of coherence within the anterior and posterior cortical regions and between these zones (interaction coefficients, IC1-IC3, respectively). EEG was recorded in the resting state and in the course of resolving convergent- and divergent-type cognitive test tasks. It was found that, during the performance of tests of both types, men with a higher productivity of divergent thinking demonstrated significantly higher values of IC1 (that characterizes the coherence in associative linkages within the anterior cortex) for oscillations of all EEG frequency ranges compared with the respective estimates for "low-creative" men. Similar increments were typical of the IC2 values for low- and midfrequency EEG rhythms (delta, theta, and alpha). At the same time, values of the "interregional" IC3 for theta, beta, and gamma activity in "high-creativity" men were significantly lower. In women of both groups (low and high creativity), such specificity of the IC1-IC3 patterns was practically not observed, i.e., the respective aspect demonstrated clear gender specificity. The sex of the subjects and type of the performed cognitive tests could not be considered factors significantly affecting the calculated absolute IC values. The observed specificities of integral coherence indices are probably associated with different strategies of the performance of cognitive tasks in men and women. Our findings allow us to believe that the above interrelations between integrated coherence indices can be used as EEG markers of high productivity of divergent thinking in men. The more flexible strategies of thinking in women are probably related to more variable neurophysiological cortical mechanisms (compared with those in men), and this type of organization is not clearly reflected in the pattern of intracortical interactions estimated by coherence indices.

In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined qualitative and quantitative changes of resting-state networks (RSNs), total brain connectivity, and mean oscillation frequencies of the regional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, associated with propofol-induced mild sedation and loss of responsiveness in healthy subjects. We found that detectability of RSNs diminished significantly with loss of responsiveness, and total brain connectivity decreased strongly in the frontal cortex, which was associated with increased mean oscillation frequencies of the BOLD signal. Our results suggest a pivotal role of the frontal cortex in propofol-induced loss of responsiveness.

Individuals vary considerably in how they integrate multisensory information, yet the neurochemical foundations underlying this variability are not well understood. Neural oscillations, especially in the gamma band (>30 Hz) play an important role in multisensory processing. Furthermore, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission contributes to the generation of gamma band oscillations (GBO), which can be sustained by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Hence, differences in the GABA and glutamate systems might contribute to individual differences in multisensory processing. In this combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electroencephalography study, we examined the relationships between GABA and glutamate concentrations in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), source localized GBO, and illusion rate in the sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI). In 39 human volunteers we found robust relationships between GABA concentration, GBO power, and the SIFI perception rate (r-values = 0.44 to 0.53). The correlation between GBO power and SIFI perception rate was about twofold higher when the modulating influence of the GABA level was included in the analysis as compared to when it was excluded. No significant effects were obtained for glutamate concentration. Our study suggests that the GABA level shapes individual differences in audiovisual perception through its modulating influence on GBO. GABA neurotransmission could be a promising target for treatment interventions of multisensory processing deficits in clinical populations, such as schizophrenia or autism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

EEG data were recorded with an array of 128-channel sensors. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent amplitude changes) were analysed. VEP results showed a significant improvement in full-term infants' latencies with age for forwards and reversed optic flow but not random visual motion. Full-term infants at 12 months significantly differentiated between the motion conditions, with the shortest latency observed for forwards optic flow and the longest latency for random visual motion, while preterm infants did not improve their latencies with age, nor were they able to differentiate between the motion conditions at 12 months. Differences in induced activities were also observed where comparisons between TSEs of the motion conditions and a static non-flow pattern showed desynchronised theta-band activity in both full-term and preterm infants, with synchronised alpha-beta band activity observed only in the full-term infants at 12 months. Full-term infants at 12 months with a substantial amount of self-produced locomotor experience and neural maturation coupled with faster oscillating cell assemblies, rely on the perception of structured optic flow to move around efficiently in the environment. The poorer responses in the preterm infants could be related to impairment of the dorsal visual stream specialized in the processing of visual motion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Correlation of EEG with neuropsychological status in children with epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Quantitative EEG; Neuropsychological status; IQ; Alpha rhythm; Theta/beta ratio; Spike count	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; BENIGN CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; ALPHA-BAND; ATTENTION-DEFICIT; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; INTELLIGENCE; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Objective: To determine correlations of the EEG frequency spectrum with neuropsychological status in children with idiopathic epilepsy. Methods: Forty-six children ages 8-18 years old with idiopathic epilepsy were retrospectively identified and analyzed for correlations between EEG spectra and neuropsychological status using multivariate linear regression. In addition, the theta/beta ratio, which has been suggested as a clinically useful EEG marker of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and an EEG spike count were calculated for each subject. Results: Neuropsychological status was highly correlated with posterior alpha (8-15 Hz) EEG activity in a complex way, with both positive and negative correlations at lower and higher alpha frequency sub-bands for each cognitive task in a pattern that depends on the specific cognitive task. In addition, the theta/beta ratio was a specific but insensitive indicator of ADHD status in children with epilepsy; most children both with and without epilepsy have normal theta/beta ratios. The spike count showed no correlations with neuropsychological status. Conclusions: (1) The alpha rhythm may have at least two sub-bands which serve different purposes. (2) The theta/beta ratio is not a sensitive indicator of ADHD status in children with epilepsy. (3) The EEG frequency spectrum correlates more robustly with neuropsychological status than spike count analysis in children with idiopathic epilepsy. Significance: (1) The role of posterior alpha rhythms in cognition is complex and can be overlooked if EEG spectral resolution is too coarse or if neuropsychological status is assessed too narrowly. (2) ADHD in children with idiopathic epilepsy may involve different mechanisms from those in children without epilepsy. (3) Reliable correlations with neuropsychological status require longer EEG samples when using spike count analysis than when using frequency spectra (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Activity of probable cortical origin associated with ESs was detected by observing ictal gamma oscillations. Brain MRI revealed no structural abnormality before surgery. This case suggests that ESs with a hemispheric origin may appear generalized because of synchronizing effects in the corpus callosum in some patients.

Models propose that sequence encoding is supported by interactions between high-and low-frequency oscillations, such that elements within an experience are represented by neural cell assemblies firing at higher frequencies (gamma) and sequential order is encoded by the specific timing of firing with respect to a lower frequency oscillation (theta). During episodic sequence memory formation in humans, we provide evidence that items in different sequence positions exhibit greater gamma power along distinct phases of a theta oscillation. Furthermore, this segregation is related to successful temporal order memory. Our results provide compelling evidence that memory for order, a core component of an episodic memory, capitalizes on the ubiquitous physiological mechanism of theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling.

This paper proposes a fully automatic algorithm that uses Bayesian optimization to tune the hyper-parameters of a synchronous BCI. The algorithm finds a large number of possible sets of values for the hyper-parameters. Each set is then used to train the classifier and the results over the possible sets of hyper-parameter values are aggregated. In this paper we consider a simple motor imagery based BCI with two parameters: the EEG frequency bands and the time intervals from which the features are extracted. We use the linear discriminant analysis classifier and aggregate all results using multi-response linear regression. Experiments using the BCI competition 111 dataset 3b show that our proposed method results in considerable improvement in the accuracy of a BCI. The average accuracy of our method was 2.6% better than the best results obtained by existing methods.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal based BCI facing a serious challenge in online applications which are slower reaction and consume more time at computational analysis and extraction. Prosperous advance techniques based on EEG raw-data to extract feature with distributed computing system which are offered a promises result that overcomes these gaps. Therefore, have been developed a BCI prototype that realized by reliable capability which take decision in real time or predicted an inclination in real life application.

Participants were required to generate original uses of conventional objects (alternative uses task) during EEG recording. A reflection task (mentally evaluating the generated ideas) or a distraction task (object characteristics task) was inserted into the course of idea generation. Behavioral results revealed that participants generated ideas with higher originality after evaluating the generated ideas than after performing the distraction task. The EEG results revealed that idea evaluation was accompanied with upper alpha (10-13 Hz) synchronization, most prominent at frontal cortical sites. Moreover, upper alpha activity in frontal cortices during idea generation was enhanced after idea evaluation. These findings indicate that idea evaluation may elicit a state of heightened internal attention or top-down activity that facilitates efficient retrieval and integration of internal memory representations.

Phase-locked loop for precisely timed acoustic stimulation during sleep	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Slow-wave sleep; Brain-computer interface; Phase-locked loop; Memory and learning	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; SYNAPTIC HOMEOSTASIS; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; GROWTH-HORMONE; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Background: A brain-computer interface could potentially enhance the various benefits of sleep. New method: We describe a strategy for enhancing slow-wave sleep (SWS) by stimulating the sleeping brain with periodic acoustic stimuli that produce resonance in the form of enhanced slow-wave activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The system delivers each acoustic stimulus at a particular phase of an electrophysiological rhythm using a phase-locked loop (PLL). Results: The PLL is computationally economical and well suited to follow and predict the temporal behavior of the EEG during slow-wave sleep. Comparison with existing methods: Acoustic stimulation methods may be able to enhance SWS without the risks inherent in electrical stimulation or pharmacological methods. The PLL method differs from other acoustic stimulation methods that are based on detecting a single slow wave rather than modeling slow-wave activity over an extended period of time. Conclusions: By providing real-time estimates of the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations, the PLL can rapidly adjust to physiological changes, thus opening up new possibilities to study brain dynamics during sleep. Future application of these methods hold promise for enhancing sleep quality and associated daytime behavior and improving physiologic function. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Toth, M; Kondakor, I; Faludi, B				Toth, Marton; Kondakor, Istvan; Faludi, Bela			Differences of brain electrical activity between moderate and severe obstructive sleep apneic patients: a LORETA study	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						continuous positive airway pressure therapy; electrophysiology; low-resolution electromagnetic tomograph; obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; quantitative electroencephalographic	POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEFAULT-MODE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; CPAP-THERAPY; CHRONIC PAIN; EEG; DYSFUNCTION; TOMOGRAPHY; CORTEX	The effects of initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on electroencephalographic (EEG) background activity were investigated in patients exhibiting both moderate (n = 13) and severe (n = 12) obstructive sleep apnea syndromes in the testing of the potential differences of alterations of brain electrical activity caused by chronic hypoxia between these two groups. A normal control group (n = 14) was also examined. Two EEG examinations were achieved in each group: before and after first-time CPAP therapy. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was implemented towards localizing the generators of EEG activity in separate frequency bands. Prior to CPAP treatment, as a common direction of change, analysis with LORETA demonstrated increased activity in comparison with the patient and control groups. In the moderate group, significant changes were detected in the alpha2 band in the posterior cingulate cortex as well as in the beta1 band in the right posterior parietal cortex and the left supramarginal gyrus. In the severe group, significant changes were found in theta and alpha1 bands in the posterior cingulate cortex. Following CPAP treatment, these significant differences vanished in the severe group. In the moderate group, significantly decreased activity was seen in the beta3 band in the right fusiform gyrus. These findings potentially suggest a normalizing effect of CPAP therapy on EEG background activity in both groups of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients. Compensatory alterations of brain electrical activity in regions associated with influencing successful memory retrieval, emotional perception, default mode network, anorexia and fear network caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia could possibly be reversed with the use of CPAP therapy.

Practicing Novel, Praxis-Like Movements: Physiological Effects of Repetition	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor learning; attention; praxis; gesture production; EEG; event-related desynchronization; repetition suppression	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; IMITATION; EEG; ACTIVATION; APRAXIA; BAND; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION; EXECUTION	Our primary goal was to develop and validate a task that could provide evidence about how humans learn praxis gestures, such as those involving the use of tools. To that end, we created a video-based task in which subjects view a model performing novel, meaningless one-handed actions with kinematics similar to praxis gestures. Subjects then imitated the movements with their right hand. Trials were repeated six times to examine practice effects. EEG was recorded during the task. As a control, subjects watched videos of a model performing a well-established (over learned) tool-use gesture. These gestures were also imitated six times. Demonstrating convergent validity, EEG measures of task-related cortical activation were similar in topography and frequency between the novel gesture task and the overlearned, praxis gesture task. As in studies assessing motor skill learning with simpler tasks, cortical activation during novel gesture learning decreased as the same gestures were repeated. In the control condition, repetition of overlearned tool-use gestures were also associated with reductions in activation, though to a lesser degree. Given that even overlearned, praxis gestures show constriction of EEG activity with repetition, it is possible that that attentional effects drive some of the repetition effects seen in EEG measures of activation during novel gesture repetition.

A Quantitative Electrophysiological Biomarker of Duplication 15q11.2-q13.1 Syndrome	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANGELMAN-SYNDROME; EEG; DYNAMICS; AUTISM; ABNORMALITIES; OSCILLATIONS; MIDAZOLAM; SYNAPSE	Background Duplications of 15q11.2-q13.1 (Dup15q syndrome) are highly penetrant for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A distinct electrophysiological (EEG) pattern characterized by excessive activity in the beta band has been noted in clinical reports. We asked whether EEG power in the beta band, as well as in other frequency bands, distinguished children with Dup15q syndrome from those with non-syndromic ASD and then examined the clinical correlates of this electrophysiological biomarker in Dup15q syndrome. Methods In the first study, we recorded spontaneous EEG from children with Dup15q syndrome (n = 11), age-and-IQ-matched children with ASD (n = 10) and age-matched typically developing (TD) children (n = 9) and computed relative power in 6 frequency bands for 9 regions of interest (ROIs). Group comparisons were made using a repeated measures analysis of variance. In the second study, we recorded spontaneous EEG from a larger cohort of individuals with Dup15q syndrome (n = 27) across two sites and examined age, epilepsy, and duplication type as predictors of beta power using simple linear regressions. Results In the first study, spontaneous beta1 (12-20 Hz) and beta2 (20-30 Hz) power were significantly higher in Dup15q syndrome compared with both comparison groups, while delta (1-4 Hz) was significantly lower than both comparison groups. Effect sizes in all three frequency bands were large (vertical bar d vertical bar > 1). In the second study, we found that beta2 power was significantly related to epilepsy diagnosis in Dup15q syndrome. Conclusions Here, we have identified an electrophysiological biomarker of Dup15q syndrome that may facilitate clinical stratification, treatment monitoring, and measurement of target engagement for future clinical trials. Future work will investigate the genetic and neural underpinnings of this electrophysiological signature as well as the functional consequences of excessive beta oscillations in Dup15q syndrome.

J	Warnain, Y; Gabrielli, F; Coello, Y				Warnain, Yannic; Gabrielli, Francois; Coello, Yann			EEG mu rhythm in virtual reality reveals that motor coding of visual objects in peripersonal space is task dependent	CORTEX			English	Article						Vision; EEG; Reachability; Peripersonal space; mu rhythm	TOOL-USE; FMRI REVEALS; PERCEPTION; DISTANCE; MODULATION; MOVEMENT; DESYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATIONS; REACHABILITY; POTENTIALS	Previous fMRI studies have shown that the visual perception of manipulable objects spontaneously involves the sensorimotor system, especially when the objects are located in peripersonal space. However, it has also been suggested that the motor coding of manipulable objects perceived in peripersonal space depends on an anticipation to interact with them. The present study aims at clarifying this issue by analyzing healthy adults' EEG activity on the centro-parietal region while perceptually judging intrinsic (prototypical or distorted shape) or extrinsic (reachable or not reachable location) properties of visual objects. In both the object identification and reachability judgment tasks, time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals was performed across the first 1000 ms following object presentation for trials on which no post-stimulus response was required (90% of the trials). Event-Related-(De)Synchronization (ERD/S) of mu rhythm was computed using the 150 ms pre-stimulus period as baseline. In the Teachability judgment task, EEG analysis showed a desynchronization of mu rhythm starting 300 ms after object presentation, but only when the objects were presented with a prototypical shape in peripersonal space. For those objects, desynchronization of mu rhythm diminished progressively from peripersonal to extrapersonal space. By contrast, no such gradient was observed in the object identification task. On the whole, these data indicate that motor coding of visual objects expressed in the mu rhythm depends on an object's shape and location in space, but also on the goal of the perceptual task.

It is reasonable to assume that such processes, among other sources of fluctuation, are reflected in ongoing brain activity, which in turn influences perceptual processing. To identify specific prestimulus EEG activity, and connectivity patterns related to subsequent pain perception in humans, we contrasted painful with nonpainful sensations delivered at the individual threshold level determined by the psychophysical QUEST estimation method (Watson and Pelli, 1983). The 64-channel EEG was recorded using active electrodes during a constant stimulation procedure. The power contrast between trials sorted by rating revealed a signal decrease of 8% before stimulus onset in theta-band (4 - 7 Hz) at T7/FT7 as well as increased theta-power by 6% at T8/FT8. Gamma-band power was increased (12%, 28 - 32 Hz) at frontocentral sites (all p < 0.05). Changes in theta-band power are covarying with subsequent pain perception, as well as lowered frontolateral theta-band connectivity for painful percepts. A decrease in frontoparietal connectivity for painful sensations was also identified in the gamma-band (28 - 32 Hz). A single-trial logistic regression revealed significant information content in the EEG signal at temporal electrode T7 in theta-band (p < 0.01) and frontal electrode F1 in gamma-band (all p < 0.02). The observed patterns suggest top-down modulation of the theta-band effects by a frontocentral network node. These findings contribute to the understanding of ongoing subjective pain sensitivity, potentially relevant to both clinical diagnostics and pain management.

Clinical features, MRI, EEG, and CSF markers were studied in 91 patients (28 D178N, 20 E200K, 17 inserts, 13 V210I, 8 P102L, 5 E196K). Dementia (35 %) and ataxia (29 %) were the most common initial symptoms and signs. A wide variety and high frequency of neurological/psychiatric symptoms and signs was found during disease course in all patients independently of the type of the mutation. Psychiatric manifestations were frequent (87 %). Neuropsychological abnormalities were observed in 67 %, and aphasia was the most common disturbance (45 %). In E200K, V210I and D178N patients, visual/oculomotor deficits were followed by ataxia early in the disease. Dementia followed by ataxia at onset was common in patients with insert and E196K mutation. P102L patients had isolated ataxia over a longer time period followed by pyramidal signs. Dementia was present only late in the disease course. All clinical routine tests such as MRI, EEG and CSF tests were less sensitive than in sporadic CJD. We provide the first detailed analysis of clinical signs and symptoms in a large group of patients with gPD. Frequency of clinical symptoms and signs was similar in different mutations in a later disease course, but the sequence of occurrence may be of great diagnostic importance. CSF markers were shown to be more sensitive than MRI and EEG.

However, how the parameters might be affected by the electrical features of brain tissue and the electrical activity of the rhythm source is not yet clearly known. To address this issue, the electrical significance of power and narrow-band phase stability (NBPS) was investigated by simulated rhythms. The rhythms were derived from the oscillatory field potentials (FPs) on a homogeneous sphere model of the solution to the electroencephalogram (EEG) forward problem. The sphere's electrical feature was set as isotropic or anisotropic conductivity. The source was set as a quasi-static dipole current, whose activity was representative of a low-frequency sine oscillation with a nonlinear phase course, and the source location was changeable. After the instantaneous power and phase of simulated rhythms were estimated by the Hilbert transformation, the NBPS was calculated and the statistical properties of power and NBPS were analyzed. It was found that only nonlinear phase dynamics could lower the NBPS. However, power depended on many factors, such as conducting anisotropy, amplitude and positon of dipole current, and meshes on the sphere model. Wehypothesized that NBPS would map the influence of nonlinear phase dynamics on the brain rhythms, but be independent of power. This research might highlight the nonlinear phase dynamics of intrinsic low-frequency oscillations in the brain. The results might be beneficial for the measurement and analysis of spontaneous EEG rhythms.

The relationship between oscillatory EEG activity and the laminar-specific BOLD signal	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						cortical layers; oscillations; high-resolution fMRI; EEG	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; GAMMA; FREQUENCY; FMRI; ATTENTION; BRAIN; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION	Electrophysiological recordings in animals have indicated that visual cortex gamma-band oscillatory activity is predominantly observed in superficial cortical layers, whereas alpha- and beta-band activity is stronger in deep layers. These rhythms, as well as the different cortical layers, have also been closely related to feedforward and feedback streams of information. Recently, it has become possible to measure laminar activity in humans with high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI). In this study, we investigated whether these different frequency bands show a differential relation with the laminar-resolved blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal by combining data from simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI from the early visual cortex. Our visual attention paradigm allowed us to investigate how variations in strength over trials and variations in the attention effect over subjects relate to each other in both modalities. We demonstrate that gamma-band EEG power correlates positively with the superficial layers' BOLD signal and that beta-power is negatively correlated to deep layer BOLD and alpha-power to both deep and superficial layer BOLD. These results provide a neurophysiological basis for human laminar fMRI and link human EEG and high-resolution fMRI to systems-level neuroscience in animals.

Noise power (NP) can measure the background EEG activity during task performance, and Shannon entropy (SE) is useful for quantifying the global modulation of EEG activity with a high temporal resolution. In this study, we have assessed the possible relationship between increased NP in theta and gamma bands and decreased SE modulation in 24 patients with schizophrenia and 26 controls over the parietal and central regions during a P300 task. SE modulation was calculated as the change from baseline to the active epoch (i.e., 150-550 ms following the target stimulus onset). Patients with schizophrenia displayed statistically significant higher NP values and lower SE modulation than healthy controls. We found a significant association between gamma NP and SE in all of the participants. Specifically, a NP increase in the gamma band was followed by a decrease in SE change. These results support the notion that an excess of gamma activity, unlocked to the task being performed, is accompanied by a decreased modulation of EEG activity in schizophrenia.

Many studies have examined sleep spindle oscillations in sleep-disordered adults; however reviews of this literature are scarce. As such, our overarching aim was to critically review experimental studies examining sleep spindle activity between adults with and without different sleep disorders. Articles were obtained using a systematic methodology with a priori criteria. Thirty-seven studies meeting final inclusion criteria were reviewed, with studies grouped across three categories: insomnia, hypersomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders (including parasomnias). Studies of patients with insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing were more abundant relative to other diagnoses. All studies were cross-sectional. Studies were largely inconsistent regarding spindle activity differences between clinical and nonclinical groups, with some reporting greater or less activity, while many others reported no group differences. Stark inconsistencies in sample characteristics (e.g., age range and diagnostic criteria) and methods of analysis (e.g., spindle bandwidth selection, visual detection versus digital filtering, absolute versus relative spectral power, and NREM2 versus NREM3) suggest a need for greater use of event-based detection methods and increased research standardization. Hypotheses regarding the clinical and empirical implications of these findings, and suggestions for potential future studies, are also discussed.

Many studies have shown that efficient motor actions are associated with mu rhythm (8-13 Hz) and beta band (13-35 Hz) local field desynchronizations in sensorimotor and parietal cortex, whereas a number of cognitive task studies have reported higher behavioral accuracy to be associated with increases in beta band power in prefrontal and sensory cortex. How these two distinct patterns of beta band oscillations interplay during gait adaptation, however, has not been established. Here we recorded 108 channel EEG activity from 18 participants (10 males, 22-35 years old) attempting to walk on a treadmill in synchrony with a series of pacing cue tones, and quickly adapting their step rate and length to sudden shifts in pacing cue tempo. Independent component analysis parsed each participant's EEG data into maximally independent component (IC) source processes, which were then grouped across participants into distinct spatial/spectral clusters. Following cue tempo shifts, mean beta band power was suppressed for IC sources in central midline and parietal regions, whereas mean beta band power increased in IC sources in or near medial prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex IC cluster, the beta band power increase was stronger during (more effortful) step shortening than during step lengthening. These results thus show that two distinct patterns of beta band activity modulation accompany gait adaptations: one likely serving movement initiation and execution; and the other, motor control and inhibition.

However, several studies have provided evidence for the involvement of the same circuits in motor imagery tasks, in the absence of overt responses. The present study aimed to test whether imagined performance of a stop-signal task produces a similar pattern of motor-related EEG activity than that observed during real performance. To this end, mu and beta event related desynchronization (ERD) and the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) were analyzed. The study also aimed to clarify the functional significance of the Stop-N2 and Stop-P3 event-related potential (ERPs) components, which were also obtained during both real and imagined performance. The results showed a common pattern of brain electrical activity, and with a similar time course, during covert performance and overt execution of the stop-signal task: presence of LRP and Stop-P3 in the imagined condition and identical LRP onset, and similar mu and beta ERD temporal windows for both conditions. These findings suggest that a similar inhibitory network may be activated during both overt and covert execution of the task. Therefore, motor imagery may be useful to improve inhibitory skills and to develop new communicating systems for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices based on inhibitory signals.

It is unclear whether change over time represents another control function or a neural instantiation of vigilance decrements over time, the time-on-task effect. We investigated how frontal beta oscillations are modulated by cognitive control and time. We used frontal chronic electrocorticography in monkeys performing a trial-and-error task, comprising search and repetition phases. Specific beta oscillations in the delay period of each trial were modulated by task phase and adaptation to feedback. Beta oscillations in this same period showed a significant within-session change. These separate modulations of beta oscillations did not interact. Crucially, and in contrast to previous investigations, we examined modulations of beta around spontaneous pauses in work. After pauses, the beta power modulation was reset and the cognitive control effect was maintained. Cognitive performance was also maintained whereas behavioral signs of fatigue continued to increase. We propose that these beta oscillations reflect multiple factors contributing to the regulation of cognitive control. Due to the effect of pauses, the time-sensitive factor cannot be a neural correlate of time-on-task but may reflect attentional effort.	[Stoll, Frederic M.; Wilson, Charles R. E.; Faraut, Mailys C.

The way information is packaged within utterances, that is, their Information Structure, guides language comprehension. Sentences are typically organized into Topic and Focus units, commonly conveying Given (already active in working memory) and New (not active) information, respectively. Nonetheless, for precise purposes, novel information can be presented in Topic, and known information in Focus. The paper accounts for the efficiency of brain processing in response to such "violations" of Information Structure, through both EEG spectral analysis and whole-brain functional connectivity patterns. The main contribution of the present work is the analysis of brain responses in natural contexts, i.e. when processing whole texts of more sentences, instead of isolated (couples of) utterances as is the case of a number of experimental paradigms pursued in the psycholinguistic domain. EEG signals recorded from a population of 54 subjects highlight the presence of rhythmic changes in different frequency bands, depending on aligned and misaligned Information Structures.

Electro-EncephaloGraphic (EEG) activity were recorded from 25 lowland soldiers during eyes -closed resting conditions under the following conditions: 7 days at lowland before ascending to altitude (Test 1), during the first 7 days (Test 2) and 30 days (Test 3) at 3800 m altitude, and 7 days after return to lowland (Test 4). The EEG was Fourier transformed to provide absolute and relative power estimates for the alpha, beta, delta, and theta bands. HA immigrants showed changes of EEG power confined in the posterior parietal cortex, right posterior temporal cortex, and occipital cortex. Compared with baseline Test 1, acute acclimatization (Test 2) only decreased theta power; chronic acclimatization (Test 3) discriminately increased alpha and beta powers but decreased delta power; after descending to lowland (Test 4), alpha power decreased, beta power remained increase, but delta and theta power recovered to the baseline level. Our findings demonstrated different EEG patterns during hypoxia exposure at HA as time goes on and after following reoxygenation at lowland, showing hypoxia decreased lower EEG frequencies while hypoxia/reoxygenation increased higher EEG frequencies. Our findings supports for the hypothesis that certain behavioral and physiological changes induced by sojourn at altitude could be caused by alterations in central nervous system function.

However, the prior evidence regarding the relationship between creativity and brain wave patterns reveals inconsistent conclusions. One possible reason might be that the means of selecting creative individuals in the past has varied in each study. By distinguishing creative potential as open-ended versus closed-ended based on theoretical views, this study examined different brain wave patterns and cortical control abilities in relation to different creative potentials by using electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback equipment. The results demonstrated that participants' performance on the open-ended creative problem was positively related to EEG alpha frequencies, whereas performance on the closed-ended creative problem was related to larger variability in EEG dynamics between alpha and beta waves when performing either open-ended or closed-ended creativity tasks. Further, better control in changing states of brain wave activities according to the EEG biofeedback signals could predict closed-ended creativity performance. Open-ended creativity was related only to the enhancement of alpha signals. These results help clarify previous inconsistent findings, reveal different natures of distinct creativities, and further suggest ways to improve different aspects of creativity with modified biofeedback procedures.

Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations and Modulates Cognitive Function	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amygdala; hippocampus; local field potential; piriform cortex; respiration; respiratory oscillations	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; OLFACTORY CORTEX; RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN AMYGDALA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS	The need to breathe links the mammalian olfactory system inextricably to the respiratory rhythms that draw air through the nose. In rodents and other small animals, slow oscillations of local field potential activity are driven at the rate of breathing (similar to 2-12 Hz) in olfactory bulb and cortex, and faster oscillatory bursts are coupled to specific phases of the respiratory cycle. These dynamic rhythms are thought to regulate cortical excitability and coordinate network interactions, helping to shape olfactory coding, memory, and behavior. However, while respiratory oscillations are a ubiquitous hallmark of olfactory system function in animals, direct evidence for such patterns is lacking in humans. In this study, we acquired intracranial EEG data from rare patients (Ps) with medically refractory epilepsy, enabling us to test the hypothesis that cortical oscillatory activity would be entrained to the human respiratory cycle, albeit at the much slower rhythm of similar to 0.16-0.33 Hz. Our results reveal that natural breathing synchronizes electrical activity in human piriform (olfactory) cortex, as well as in limbic-related brain areas, including amygdala and hippocampus. Notably, oscillatory power peaked during inspiration and dissipated when breathing was diverted from nose to mouth. Parallel behavioral experiments showed that breathing phase enhances fear discrimination and memory retrieval. Our findings provide a unique framework for understanding the pivotal role of nasal breathing in coordinating neuronal oscillations to support stimulus processing and behavior.

Method: Various methods for automated off and on-line analyses of ECoG in rodent models are reviewed, as well as data on how to interfere with the spike-wave discharges by different types of invasive and non-invasive electrical, magnetic, and optical brain.stimulation. Also a new method for seizure prediction is proposed. Results: Many selective and specific methods for off- and on-line spike-wave discharge detection seem excellent, with possibilities to overcome the issue of individual differences. Moreover, electrical deep brain stimulation is rather effective in interrupting ongoing spike-wave discharges with low stimulation intensity. A network based method is proposed for absence seizures prediction with a high sensitivity but a low selectivity. Solutions that prevent false alarms, integrated in a closed loop brain stimulation system open the ways for experimental seizure control. Conclusions: The presence of preictal cursor activity detected with state of the art time frequency and network analyses shows that spike-wave discharges are not caused by sudden and abrupt transitions but that there are detectable dynamic events. Their changes in time-space-frequency characteristics might yield new options for seizure prediction and seizure control. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, classic microdialysis methods lack high temporal resolution. In this study, a new alternative is proposed to improve the time resolution and thus obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of Glu and its relationship with epileptiform activity. A new setup was designed to measure Glu online in microdialysates using enzymatic reactors and fluorescence detection. In this study, we performed EEG recordings and Glu measurements simultaneously in the hippocampus to establish their relationship with the epileptiform events that are induced by pentylenetetrazole in intact and epileptic rats. Basal Glu levels in intact and animals with spontaneous seizures were not significantly different. However, a significant increase in Glu levels was detected during the first pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in both groups. EEG analysis showed that the amplitude of epileptiform activity was higher in rats with spontaneous seizures and that the frequency of this activity did not change. The results showed that this method can be used to determine Glu changes at high temporal resolution and that these changes can be related to seizure activity. In addition, this method can also be used to measure other neurotransmitters that generate fluorescent derivatives. Moreover, this new technique has the following advantages compared with classical neurochemical methods: easy setup, low training requirements, no need for separation, rapidity, and the experimental data can be obtained and analysis performed in a single session.

In thalamic neurons, low-threshold T-type Ca2+ channels play a pivotal role in almost every type of neuronal oscillations, including slow (<1 Hz) waves, sleep spindles and delta waves. The transient opening of T channels gives rise to the low threshold spikes (LTSs), and associated high frequency bursts of action potentials, that are characteristically present during sleep spindles and delta waves, whereas the persistent opening of a small fraction of T channels, (i.e., I-Twindow) is responsible for the membrane potential bistability underlying sleep slow oscillations. Surprisingly thalamocortical (TC) neurons express a very high density of T channels that largely exceed the amount required to generate LTSs and therefore, to support certain, if not all, sleep oscillations. Here, to clarify the relationship between T current density and sleep oscillations, we systematically investigated the impact of the T conductance level on the intrinsic rhythmic activities generated in TC neurons, combining in vitro experiments and TC neuron simulation. Using bifurcation analysis, we provide insights into the dynamical processes taking place at the transition between slow and delta oscillations. Our results show that although stable delta oscillations can be evoked with minimal T conductance, the full range of slow oscillation patterns, including groups of delta oscillations separated by Up states ("grouped-delta slow waves") requires a high density of T channels. Moreover, high levels of T conductance ensure the robustness of different types of slow oscillations.

Failures in predicting events might contribute to hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia (SZ). When a stimulus violates prediction, neural activity that reflects prediction error (PE) processing is found. While PE processing deficits have been reported in unisensory paradigms, it is unknown whether SZ patients (SZP) show altered crossmodal PE processing. We measured high-density electroencephalography and applied source estimation approaches to investigate crossmodal PE processing generated by audiovisual speech. In SZP and healthy control participants (HC), we used an established paradigm in which high- and low-predictive visual syllables were paired with congruent or incongruent auditory syllables. We examined crossmodal PE processing in SZP and HC by comparing differences in event-related potentials and neural oscillations between incongruent and congruent high-and low-predictive audiovisual syllables. In both groups event-related potentials between 206 and 250 ms were larger in high-compared with low-predictive syllables, suggesting intact audiovisual incongruence detection in the auditory cortex of SZP. The analysis of oscillatory responses revealed theta-band (4-7 Hz) power enhancement in high-compared with low-predictive syllables between 230 and 370 ms in the frontal cortex of HC but not SZP. Thus aberrant frontal theta-band oscillations reflect crossmodal PE processing deficits in SZ. The present study suggests a top-down multisensory processing deficit and highlights the role of dysfunctional frontal oscillations for the SZ psychopathology.

Electroencephalogram data were recorded when participants decided whether the metaphor using an animal word for the vehicle rendered by a picture was appropriate or not. There were two conditions: appropriateness (e.g., sport utility vehicles + tiger) vs. inappropriateness (e.g., sport utility vehicles + cat). The ERP results showed that inappropriate metaphor elicited larger N300 (280-360 ms) and N400 (380-460 ms) amplitude than appropriate one, which were different from previous exclusively verbal metaphor studies that rarely observed the N300 effect. A P600 (550-750 ms) was also observed and larger in appropriate metaphor condition. Besides, the time-frequency principal component analysis revealed that two independent theta activities indexed the separable processes (retrieval of semantic features and semantic integration) underlying the N300 and N400. Delta band was also induced within a later time window and best characterized the integration process underlying P600. These results indicate the specific cognitive mechanism of multimodal metaphor comprehension that is different from verbal metaphor processing, mirrored by several separable processes indexed by ERP components and time-frequency components. The present study extends the metaphor research by uncovering the functional roles of delta and theta as well as their unique contributions to the ERP components during multimodal metaphor comprehension.

For instance the rhythmic patterns of activity orchestrated by the theta oscillation during running and REM sleep are markedly different from the large irregular activity (LIA) observed during awake resting and slow wave sleep. We found that under different levels of isoflurane anesthesia activity in the hippocampus of rats displays two distinct states, which have several qualities that mirror the theta and LIA states. These data provide further evidence that the two states are intrinsic modes of the hippocampus; while also characterizing a preparation that could be useful for studying the natural activity states in hippocampus.

Principle component analysis and independent component analysis have been widely used for removing CAs, but they typically require a complex procedure for the identification of CA-related components. We propose a simple and efficient method, resampled moving average subtraction (RMAS), to remove CAs from MEG data. Based on an electrocardiogram (ECG) channel, a template for each cardiac cycle was estimated by a weighted average of epochs of MEG data over consecutive cardiac cycles, combined with a resampling technique for accurate alignment of the time waveforms. The template was subtracted from the corresponding epoch of the MEG data. The resampling reduced distortions due to asynchrony between the cardiac cycle and the MEG sampling times. The RMAS method successfully suppressed CAs while preserving both event-related responses and high-frequency (> 45 Hz) components in the MEG data.

The present study investigated the different event-related synchronization (ERS) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) of typical brain oscillations in processing Facial Expressions under nonattentional condition. The results show that the lower-frequency bands are mainly used to update Facial Expressions and distinguish the deviant stimuli from the standard ones, whereas the higher-frequency bands are relevant to automatically processing different Facial Expressions. Accordingly, we set up the relations between each brain oscillation and processing unattended Facial Expressions by the measures of ERD and ERS. This research first reveals the contributions of each frequency band for comprehension of Facial Expressions in preattentive stage. It also evidences that participants have emotional experience under nonattentional condition. Therefore, the user's emotional state under nonattentional condition can be recognized in real time by the ERD/ERS computation indexes of different frequency bands of brain oscillations, which can be used in affective BCI to provide the user with more natural and friendly ways.

Cerebellar subregions are part of these networks, but how the cerebellum is involved in this wide range of brain functions remains poorly understood. It is postulated that the cerebellum contributes a basic role in brain functions, helping to shape the complexity of brain temporal dynamics. We therefore hypothesized that stimulating cerebellar nodes integrated in different networks should have the same impact on the temporal complexity of cortical signals. In healthy humans, we applied intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) to the vermis lobule VII or right lateral cerebellar Crus I/II, subregions that prominently couple to the dorsal-attention/fronto-parietal and default-mode networks, respectively. Cerebellar iTBS increased the complexity of brain signals across multiple time scales in a network-specific manner identified through electroencephalography (EEG). We also demonstrated a region-specific shift in power of cortical oscillations towards higher frequencies consistent with the natural frequencies of targeted cortical areas. Our findings provide a novel mechanism and evidence by which the cerebellum contributes to multiple brain functions: specific cerebellar subregions control the temporal dynamics of the networks they are engaged in.

Furthermore, the coupling between neural and respiratory dynamics is usually estimated through linear correlation measures, thus totally disregarding possible underlying nonlinear interactions. To overcome these limitations, in this preliminary study we propose a nonlinear coupling analysis of simultaneous recordings of electroencephalographic (EEG) and respiratory signals at rest and after variation of carbon dioxide (CO2) level. Specifically, a CO2 increase was induced by a voluntary breath hold task. EEG global field power (GFP) in different frequency bands and end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) were estimated in both conditions. The maximum information coefficient (MIC) and MIC-rho(2) (where. represents the Pearson's correlation coefficient) between the two signals were calculated to identify generic associations (i.e. linear and nonlinear correlations) and nonlinear correlations, respectively. With respect to a free breathing state, our results suggest that a breath hold state is characterized by an increased coupling between respiration activity and specific EEG oscillations, mainly involving linear and nonlinear interactions in the delta band (1-4 Hz), and prevalent nonlinear interactions in the alpha band (8-13 Hz).

Decreased Modulation of EEG Oscillations in High-Functioning Autism during a Motor Control Task	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dyspraxia; motor planning; event-related desynchronization; autism; praxis	PRAXIS HAND MOVEMENTS; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; PREMOTOR AREAS; ALPHA-BAND; CHILDREN; DYSPRAXIA; CONNECTIVITY; SUPPRESSION; ACTIVATION; SYNCHRONY	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are thought to result in part from altered cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance; this pathophysiology may impact the generation of oscillations on electroencephalogram (EEG). We investigated premotor-parietal cortical physiology associated with praxis, which has strong theoretical and empirical associations with ASD symptomatology. Twenty five children with high-functioning ASD (HFA) and 33 controls performed a praxis task involving the pantomiming of tool use, while EEG was recorded. We assessed task-related modulation of signal power in alpha and beta frequency bands. Compared with controls, subjects with HFA showed 27% less left central (motor/premotor) beta (18-22 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD; p = 0.030), as well as 24% less left parietal alpha (7-13 Hz) ERD (p = 0.046). Within the HFA group, blunting of central ERD attenuation was associated with impairments in clinical measures of praxis imitation (r = 0.4; p = 0.04) and increased autism severity (r = 0.48; p = 0.016). The modulation of central beta activity is associated, among other things, with motor imagery, which may be necessary for imitation. Impaired imitation has been associated with core features of ASD. Altered modulation of oscillatory activity may be mechanistically involved in those aspects of motor network function that relate to the core symptoms of ASD.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) are readily applicable in clinical settings and can detect real-time functional connectivity between motor cortex and muscles with EEG-EMG (corticomuscular) coherence. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether EEG-EMG coherence can detect changes in corticomuscular control induced by peripheral ES. Methods: Fifteen healthy young adults and 15 stroke survivors received 40-min electrical stimulation session on median nerve. The stimulation (1-ms rectangular pulse, 100 Hz) was delivered with a 20-s on-20-s off cycle, and the intensity was set at the subjects' highest tolerable level without muscle contraction or pain. Both before and after the stimulation session, subjects performed a 20-s steady-hold thumb flexion at 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) while EEG and EMG were collected. Results: Our results demonstrated that after ES, EEG-EMG coherence in gamma band increased significantly for 22.1 and 48.6% in healthy adults and stroke survivors, respectively. In addition, after ES, force steadiness was also improved in both groups, as indicated by the decrease in force fluctuation during steady-hold contraction (-1.7% MVC and -3.9% MVC for healthy and stroke individuals, respectively). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that EEG-EMG coherence can detect ES-induced changes in the neuromuscular system. Also, because gamma coherence is linked to afferent inputs encoding, improvement in motor performance is likely related to ES-elicited strong sensory input and enhanced sensorimotor integration.

This study examined the influence of different types of breaks on cognitive performance and related cortical activity in office-based employees. Breaks were filled with exercise, resting or a usual break and a control condition where employees continued working without any break. Cognitive performance was assessed using the d2-R test and two commercially available cognitive tasks. Brain cortical activity was recorded using electroencephalography before and after breaks. Individual's mood was analysed using a profile of mood state. Results indicate a positive effect of a 3-min boxing intervention on cognitive performance, mirrored by a decrease in prefrontal cortex activity. Although perceived psychological state was increased after the usual break, this is reflected in neither cortical activity nor cognitive performance. With respect to the fact that also bike activity resulted an increase in prefrontal alpha-2 activity, a positive effect of exercise on neuro-cognitive performance can be stated. Health and economic benefits may result from brief physical activity breaks and help to maintain workplace performance and job satisfaction. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

EEG Activity in Dextrals and Sinistrals during Visual Monocular/Binocular Perception of Verbal Emotionally Colored Information	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Stroop test; visual presentation; dominant eye; dextrals and sinistrals; emotionally colored verbal information	STROOP; MEMORY	We compared the characteristics of EEG during mono- and binocular performance of the Stroop test. Either emotionally colored words or "pseudowords" were presented as stimuli; among 60 examined subjects, there were 30 sinistrals with dominant left eye and 30 dextrals with dominant right eye. In right-handed subjects, the coherence of theta oscillations in central and parietal pairs of the leads increased during binocular perception of verbal emotionally colored information, while a rise in the level of coherence of high-frequency beta oscillations in intrahemispheric lead pairs was observed in left-handers under the same conditions. In the course of binocular performance of both types of tests, interhemispheric coherence was altered, while changes of coherence were found only within one hemisphere during monocular perception. In dextrals, the level of synchronization of the activity in local networks demonstrated a significantly higher rise in the left hemisphere in the case where pseudoword signals were used. In sinistrals, such an increase was observed in both hemispheres together with a decrease in the interhemispheric interaction. In tests of both types during monocular perception of both emotionally colored words and pseudowords via a dominant eye, EEG activity was rather similar in both dextrals and sinistrals.

Although it has been shown that knowing in advance, when the probe would be presented, reduces the attentional blink and increases the amplitude of event-related potential (ERP) elicited by the probe, the neural mechanism by which attention mitigates the AB remains unclear. Here, we used time-frequency analysis to further explore the mechanism of the auditory attentional blink. Participants were presented a series of rapid auditory stimuli and asked to indicate whether a target and a probe were present in the sequence. In half of the trials, participants were cued to the probe position relative to the target ('Early' or 'Late'). Probe detection and ERP amplitude elicited by the probe decreased when the probe was presented shortly after the target compared to when it was presented later after the target. Importantly, the behavioral and ERP correlates of probe discrimination significantly improved when the 'Early' cue was presented. The improvement in processing the probe in the cued condition was accompanied by the decrease in alpha activity (8-13 Hz) after the time when the probe was expected; suggesting that successfully directing attention to time window where the probe would likely occur reduces the processing resources needed to suppress distractors. This in turn freed up available processing resources for the target and probe at the short-term consolidation stage, which ultimately reduced the auditory attentional blink.

The proposed analysis of ERP signal is to predict the performance of working memory retention for various frequency bands such as gamma, beta, alpha, theta and delta. This study is intended to process the EEG data into ERP data and analyze the ERP signal based on power spectrum density. This method is applied to data of normal children with age between 7 to 12 years old. Result showed that alpha power band increases during working memory retention towards visual stimuli compared to the other frequency band. 9 years old has the highest amplitude alpha power compared to the other group of age. Therefore, the alpha power band at the prefrontal cortex will be used for the next analysis of the working memory retention.

We have recently proposed that oscillatory dynamics in the beta and gamma frequency ranges measured during sentence-level comprehension might be best explained from a predictive coding perspective. Under our proposal we related beta oscillations to both the maintenance/change of the neural network configuration responsible for the construction and representation of sentence-level meaning, and to top down predictions about upcoming linguistic input based on that sentence-level meaning. Here we zoom in on these particular aspects of our proposal, and discuss both old and new supporting evidence. Finally, we present some preliminary magnetoencephalography data from an experiment comparing Dutch subject- and object-relative clauses that was specifically designed to test our predictive coding framework. Initial results support the first of the two suggested roles for beta oscillations in sentence-level language comprehension.

To address them, we have studied anaesthesia induced by the widely used (intravenous) propofol and (inhalational) sevoflurane anaesthetics, computing cross-frequency coupling functions between neuronal, cardiac and respiratory oscillations in order to determine their mutual interactions. The phase domain coupling function reveals the form of the function defining the mechanism of an interaction, as well as its coupling strength. Using a method based on dynamical Bayesian inference, we have thus identified and analysed the coupling functions for six relationships. By quantitative assessment of the forms and strengths of the couplings, we have revealed how these relationships are altered by anaesthesia, also showing that some of them are differently affected by propofol and sevoflurane. These findings, together with the novel coupling function analysis, offer a new direction in the assessment of general anaesthesia and neurophysiological interactions, in general.

Two groups of subjects were evaluated for this purpose: 32 participants were required to either tell the truth or to lie when facing certain stimuli, and their electroencephalogram signals on 12 electrodes were recorded. The experimental results revealed that deceptive responses elicited greater connectivity strength than truthful responses, particularly in the. band on specific electrode pairs primarily involving connections between the prefrontal/frontal and central regions and between the prefrontal/ frontal and left parietal regions. These results indicate that these brain regions play an important role in executing lying responses. Additionally, three time-and frequency-dependent functional connectivity networks were proposed to thoroughly reflect the functional coupling of brain regions that occurs during lying. Furthermore, the wavelet coherence values for the connections shown in the networks were extracted as features for support vector machine training. High classification accuracy suggested that the proposed network effectively characterized differences in functional connectivity between the two groups of subjects over a specific time-frequency area and hence could be a sensitive measurement for identifying deception.

However, it is largely unclear how dysfunctions on these various levels of cortical processing contribute to alterations of stimulus-specific information representation. To test this, we used a well-established sequential frequency comparison paradigm, in which sensory encoding of vibrotactile stimuli can be assessed via frequency-specific steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) over primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Further, we investigated the maintenance of frequency information in working memory (WM) in terms of parametric power modulations of induced beta-band EEG oscillations. In the present study schizophrenic patients showed significantly less pronounced SSEPs during vibrotactile stimulation than healthy controls. In particular, inter-trial phase coherence was reduced. While maintaining vibrotactile frequencies in WM, patients showed a significantly weaker prefrontal beta-power modulation compared to healthy controls. Crucially, patients exhibited no general disturbances in attention, as inferred from a behavioral test and from alpha-band event-related synchronization. Together, our results provide novel evidence that patients with schizophrenia show altered neural correlates of stimulus-specific sensory encoding and WM maintenance, suggesting an early somatosensory impairment as well as alterations in the formation of abstract representations of task-relevant stimulus information.

To provide insights into brain dynamics associated with MS, this study recruited 19 subjects to participate in an electroencephalogram (EEG) experiment in a virtual-reality driving environment. When riding on consecutive winding roads, subjects experienced postural instability and sensory conflict between visual and vestibular stimuli. Meanwhile, subjects rated their level of MS on a six-point scale. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate the filtered EEG signals into maximally temporally independent components (ICs). Then, reduced logarithmic spectra of ICs of interest, using principal component analysis, were decomposed by ICA again to find spectrally fixed and temporally independent modulators (IMs). Results demonstrated that a higher degree of MS accompanied increased activation of alpha (r = 0.421) and gamma (r = 0.478) IMs across remote-independent brain processes, covering motor, parietal and occipital areas. This co-modulatory spectral change in alpha and gamma bands revealed the neurophysiological demand to regulate conflicts among multi-modal sensory systems during MS.

Tasks that have intrinsic value for individuals are hypothesized to produce post-task resting state dynamics that promote learning. We measured simultaneous fMRI/EEG and DTI in Division-1 collegiate baseball players and compared to a group of controls, examining differences in both functional and structural connectivity. Participants performed a surrogate baseball pitch Go/No-Go task before a resting state scan, and we compared post-task resting state connectivity using a seed-based analysis from the supplementary motor area (SMA), an area whose activity discriminated players and controls in our previous results using this task. Although both groups were equally trained on the task, the experts showed differential activity in their post-task resting state consistent with motor learning. Specifically, we found (1) differences in bilateral SMA-L Insula functional connectivity between experts and controls that may reflect group differences in motor learning, (2) differences in BOLD-alpha oscillation correlations between groups suggests variability in modulatory attention in the post-task state, and (3) group differences between BOLD-beta oscillations that may indicate cognitive processing of motor inhibition. Structural connectivity analysis identified group differences in portions of the functionally derived network, suggesting that functional differences may also partially arise from variability in the underlying white matter pathways. Generally, we find that brain dynamics in the post-task resting state differ as a function of subject expertise and potentially result from differences in both functional and structural connectivity.

Combined Single Neuron Unit Activity and Local Field Potential Oscillations in a Human Visual Recognition Memory Task	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cognition; cognitive processing; gamma oscillations; high-frequency oscillations; hybrid electrodes; intracranial recordings; large-scale electrophysiology; neuronal assemblies; ripple oscillations	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EEG; MANIFESTATION; RECORDINGS; SURFACE; ORIGIN; SPARSE	Goal: Activities of neuronal networks range from action potential firing of individual neurons, coordinated oscillations of local neuronal assemblies, and distributed neural populations. Here, we describe recordings using hybrid electrodes, containing both micro-and clinical macroelectrodes, to simultaneously sample both large-scale network oscillations and single neuron spiking activity in the medial temporal lobe structures of human subjects during a visual recognitionmemory task. We quantify and compare single neuron unit activity (SUA) with high-frequency macrofield oscillations (HFOs) for decoding visual images. Results: SUA and HFOs were recorded using hybrid electrodes containing both micro and macroelectrode contacts, implanted in patients with focal epilepsy. Decoding of image properties in different task trials was performed, analyzing SUA and HFO as point processes to capture the dynamics of neurons and their assemblies at different spatiotemporal scales, ranging from submillisecond discharges of single units to fast oscillations across large neuronal populations. Results highlight the limitations and potential complementary use of SUA and HFOs for decoding of general image properties. Conclusion: The dynamics of SUA and HFOs can be used to explore a wide range of neuronal assembly activities engaged in humanmemory processing. Significance: Hybrid electrodes provide a technological bridge for exploring multiscale activity, spanning individual neurons, their assemblies, and large-scale population activity reflected in local field potentials. Analysis of SUA and HFO dynamics as point processes provides a potentially useful signal processing method for exploring the neuronal correlates operating at different spatial scales.

Feature Domain-Specific Movement Intention Detection for Stroke Rehabilitation with Brain-Computer Interfaces	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			COMPLEXITY	Brain-computer interface (BCI) driven electrical stimulation has been proposed for neuromodulation for stroke rehabilitation by pairing intentions to move with somatosensory feedback from electrical stimulation. Movement intentions have been detected in several studies using different techniques, with temporal and spectral features being the most common. A few studies have compared temporal and spectral features, but conflicting results have been reported. In this study, the aim was to investigate if complexity measures can be used for movement intention detection and to compare the detection performance based on features extracted from three different domains (time, frequency and complexity) from single-trial EEG. Two data sets were used where four different isometric palmar grasps or dorsiflexions were performed while continuous EEG was recorded. 39 healthy subjects performed or imagined these movements and 11 stroke patients attempted to perform the movements. The EEG was pre-processed and divided into two epoch classes: Background EEG (2 s) and movement intention (2 s). To obtain an estimated detection performance, temporal, spectral and complexity features were extracted and classified (linear discriminant analysis) after the feature vector was reduced using sequential forward selection. The results show that accuracies between 82-87% and 74-80% are obtained for foot and hand movements, respectively. The temporal feature domain was the most dominant for foot movement intention detection, while the spectral features contributed more to the hand movement detection. The complexity features could be used to detect movement intentions, but the performance was much lower compared to temporal and spectral features.	[Hadsund, J. T.; Sorensen, M. B.; Royo, A.

They enable coordinated activity and communication of local assemblies, while abnormalities in gamma oscillations exist in different neurological and psychiatric diseases. Thus, a specific rectification of gamma synchronization could potentially compensate the deficits in pathological conditions. Previous experiments have shown that animals can voluntarily modulate their gamma power through operant conditioning. Using a closed-loop experimental setup, we show in six intracerebrally recorded epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluation that intracerebral power spectrum can be increased in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) at different fronto-temporal cortical sites in human subjects. Successful gamma training was accompanied by increased gamma power at other cortical locations and progressively enhanced cross-frequency coupling between gamma and slow oscillations (3-12 Hz). Finally, using microelectrode targets in two subjects, we report that upregulation of gamma activities is possible also in spatial micro-domains, without the spread to macroelectrodes. Overall, our findings indicate that intracerebral gamma modulation can be achieved rapidly, beyond the motor system and with high spatial specificity, when using micro targets. These results are especially significant because they pave the way for use of high-resolution therapeutic approaches for future clinical applications.

Controversy persists about the contribution of tubers and perituberal cortex to seizures in tuberous sclerosis. Kannan et al. report detailed qualitative and quantitative intracranial EEG analysis which confirms that seizures arise in tubers, specifically the centre of tubers, which exhibit electrophysiological and imaging features similar to focal cortical dysplasia.Multiple seizure foci, seizure propagation and epileptic spasms complicate presurgical seizure localization in tuberous sclerosis. Furthermore, controversy exists about the contribution of tubers, perituberal cortex and the underlying genetic abnormality to epileptogenesis. We aimed to determine the epileptogenic substrate in tuberous sclerosis by studying spatio-temporal patterns of seizure onset and propagation on intracranial EEG recordings in which multiple depth and surface electrodes sampled multiple tubers and perituberal cortex. Ten intracranial EEG recordings (seven extraoperative, three intraoperative) from 10 children with tuberous sclerosis were analysed. Notable thickening and signal abnormality in the centre of many tubers on magnetic resonance imaging led to tuber centres being recorded with depth electrodes. Spatially-meaningful bipolar montages were reformatted incorporating channels recording only from the tuber centre, tuber rim and perituberal cortex. Interictal epileptiform discharges and ictal rhythms were analysed visually for location, field, morphology, frequency, latency and temporal dispersion. Fifteen electroclinically distinct seizures were recorded in the 10 patients. Seizure onset was recorded in tubers in all 15 electroclinically distinct seizures; in 9/10 electroclinically distinct seizures recorded with optimal spatial sampling, seizure onset was recorded in the tuber centre, with or without involvement of the tuber rim but not perituberal cortex. Quantitative electroencephalography analysis by pairwise cross-correlation confirmed that the tuber centre led the tuber rim and perituberal cortex during interictal, preictal and ictal spike trains. Seizure propagation was observed in 10/15 electroclinically distinct seizures, being tuber-to-tuber in all. Seven of the 17 tubers showing seizure propagation activated an independent ictal rhythm, morphologically distinct from that seen in seizure onset region (intra-ictal activation). Of the total 48 tubers sampled, 16 exhibited seizure onset, 17 were involved in seizure propagation and 40 exhibited interictal epileptiform discharges, 33 independent and seven propagated. Seizure onsets were recorded in 16/33 tubers with independent interictal epileptiform discharges, but 0/7 tubers with only propagated epileptiform discharges or 0/8 tubers with no epileptiform discharges (P = 0.003). Seizure onsets were recorded from 4/7 tubers with and 0/10 tubers without intra-ictal activation (P = 0.015). Thus, focal seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges in tuberous sclerosis arise in the centre of epileptogenic tubers and propagate to the tuber rim, perituberal cortex and other epileptogenic tubers. Rhythmic interictal epileptiform discharges and intra-ictal activation of propagated ictal rhythms are potential biomarkers of epileptogenic tubers. Interictal and ictal EEG features of epileptogenic tubers have similarities to focal cortical dysplasia type II, consistent with the reported imaging, histological and molecular similarities.

Evaluation of induced and evoked changes in EEG during selective attention to verbal stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); Assistive technology; Mental imagery; Selective attention; Disorders of consciousness (DOC)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; DISORDERS; ARTIFACTS; AWARENESS; STATE; COMA	Background: Two challenges need to be addressed before bringing non-motor mental tasks for brain computer interface (BCI) control to persons in a minimally conscious state (MCS), who can be behaviorally unresponsive even when proven to be consciously aware: first, keeping the cognitive demands as low as possible so that they could be fulfilled by persons with MCS. Second, increasing the control of experimental protocol (i.e. type and timing of the task performance). New method: The goal of this study is twofold: first goal is to develop an experimental paradigm that can facilitate the performance of brain-teasers (e.g. mental subtraction and word generation) on the one hand, and can increase the control of experimental protocol on the other hand. The second goal of this study is to exploit the similar findings for mentally attending to someone else's verbal performance of brain-teaser tasks and self-performing the same tasks to setup an online BCI, and to compare it in healthy participants to the current "state-of-the-art" motor imagery (MI, sports). Results: The response accuracies for the best performing healthy participants indicate that selective attention to verbal performance of mental subtraction (SUB) is a viable alternative to the MI. Time-frequency analysis of the SUB task in one participant with MCS did not reveal any significant (p <0.05) EEG changes, whereas imagined performance of one sport of participants' choice (SPORT) revealed task-related EEG changes over neurophysiological plausible cortical areas. Comparison with existing methods: We found that mentally attending to someone else's verbal performance of brain-teaser tasks leads to similar results as in self-performing the same tasks. Conclusions: In this work we demonstrated that a single auditory selective attention task (i.e. mentally attending to someone else's verbal performance of mental subtraction) can modulate both induced and evoked changes in EEG, and be used for yes/no communication in an auditory scanning paradigm.

The objective of the study was to investigate whether this over-activity is reversible following the neurofeedback treatment of CNP. Methods: Five paraplegic patients with pain in their legs underwent from twenty to forty neurofeedback sessions that significantly reduced their pain. In order to assess their dynamic cortical activity they were asked to imagine movements of all limbs a week before the first and a week after the last neurofeedback session. Using time-frequency analysis we compared EEG activity during imagination of movement before and after the therapy and further compared it with EEG signals of ten paraplegic patients with no pain and a control group of ten able-bodied people. Results: Neurofeedback treatment resulted in reduced CNP and a wide spread reduction of cortical activity during imagination of movement. The reduction was significant in the alpha and beta band but was largest in the theta band. As a result cortical activity became similar to the activity of other two groups with no pain. Conclusions: Reduction of CNP is accompanied by reduced cortical over-activity during movement imagination. Significance: Understanding causes and consequences mechanism through which CNP affects cortical activity. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This is reflected in the oscillatory theta response and can be investigated by visual illusions. Ambiguous stimuli elicit illusory perceptual switches while the stimulus remains unchanged. Methods: Theta responses elicited by an ambiguous and unambiguous control stimulus were measured using the EEG during time periods of perceptual switching and perceptual stability (non-switching). Results: For the ambiguous task, theta activity increased during perceptual switching in healthy controls only. For the unambiguous task, the switching-related increase of theta activity was larger in controls than in patients. This reduced modulation of the theta response seems not to be related to a general decrease of theta activity in patients. Conclusions: These findings may be related to disturbances in the spatio-temporal integration of neural activity in patients. Reporting ambiguous and unambiguous perceptual switches seems to be more demanding for patients with schizophrenia than healthy controls. Significance: This is one of the first studies on the neurophysiologic correlates of illusory perception in schizophrenia. Focussing on the relation between different brain states (such as switching and non-switching) might integrate different findings about altered theta oscillations in schizophrenia.

Methods: We included 11 edrug-naive patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and 11 age matched controls (CTRL). We analyzed interictal EEG using partial directed coherence (PDC), a connectivity estimator in frequency domain based on autoregressive multivariate (MVAR) modeling giving the advantage of indicating the direction and strength of the interactions between multiple variables. Results: Our results revealed the presence of an abnormal cortico-cortical network occurring in the interictal condition in CAE and involving a large span of frequencies, with prominence in the alpha band; the most evident finding was a highly significant increase of out-going connectivity involving frontal and central cortical areas in CAE patients compared to CTRL subjects. Conclusions: Our observation indicates that, in interictal conditions, a distorted network characterizes CAE, and a hyperconnected network is already detectable under resting conditions in the delta, theta and alpha bands. Significance: The increased interictal EEG connectivity demonstrated here provides support for a persistent abnormal relationship between the thalamus and a hyperexcitable cortex outside the ictal phase.

In this study an APPswePS1dE9 AD mouse model has been analyzed using implantable video-EEG radiotelemetry to perform long-term EEG recordings from the primary motor cortex M1 and the hippocampal CA1 region in both genders. Besides motor activity, EEG recordings were analyzed for electroencephalographic seizure activity and frequency characteristics using a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) based approach. Automatic seizure detection revealed severe electroencephalographic seizure activity in both M1 and CA1 deflection in APPswePS1dE9 mice with gender-specific characteristics. Frequency analysis of both surface and deep EEG recordings elicited complex age, gender, and activity dependent alterations in the theta and gamma range. Females displayed an antithetic decrease in theta (theta) and increase in gamma (theta) power at 18-19 weeks of age whereas related changes in males occurred earlier at 14 weeks of age. In females, theta (theta) and gamma (theta) power alterations predominated in the inactive state suggesting a reduction in atropine-sensitive type II theta in APPswePS1dE9 animals. Gender-specific central dysrhythmia and network alterations in APPswePS1dE9 point to a functional role in behavioral and cognitive deficits and might serve as early biomarkers for AD in the future.

For late second language (L2) learners on the other hand, the extent to which the neural architecture supporting syntactic processing is similar to or different from that of native speakers is still unclear. In a series of four experiments, we used electroencephalography to investigate the link between beta oscillatory activity and the processing of grammatical gender agreement in Dutch determiner-noun pairs, for Dutch native speakers, and for German L2 learners of Dutch. In Experiment 1 we show that for native speakers, grammatical gender agreement violations are yet another among many syntactic factors that modulate beta oscillatory activity during sentence comprehension. Beta power is higher for grammatically acceptable target words than for those that mismatch in grammatical gender with their preceding determiner. In Experiment 2 we observed no such beta modulations for L2 learners, irrespective of whether trials were sorted according to objective or subjective syntactic correctness. Experiment 3 ruled out that the absence of a beta effect for the L2 learners in Experiment 2 was due to repetition of the target nouns in objectively correct and incorrect determiner-noun pairs. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that when L2 learners are required to explicitly focus on grammatical information, they show modulations of beta oscillatory activity, comparable to those of native speakers, but only when trials are sorted according to participants' idiosyncratic lexical representations of the grammatical gender of target nouns. Together, these findings suggest that beta power in L2 learners is sensitive to violations of grammatical gender agreement, but only when the importance of grammatical information is highlighted, and only when participants' subjective lexical representations are taken into account.

Resection of ictal high frequency oscillations is associated with favorable surgical outcome in pediatric drug resistant epilepsy secondary to tuberous sclerosis complex	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC); High frequency oscillations (HFOs); Intracranial EEG (ICEEG); Surgical outcome	SURGERY; CHILDREN; SEIZURES; BRAIN; EEG; HZ	Resective epilepsy surgery can improve seizures when the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is limited to a well-defined region. High frequency oscillations (HFO) have been recognized as having a high association with the seizure onset zone. Therefore, we retrospectively identified ictal HFOs and determined their relationship to specific intracranial features of cortical tubers in children with TSC who underwent resective surgery. We identified 14 patients with drug resistant epilepsy secondary to TSC who underwent subdural grid and strip implantation for presurgical evaluation and subsequent resection with adequate post-surgical follow-up. We aimed to determine the relationship between ictal HFOs, post-resection outcome and neuroimaging features in this population. The largest tuber was identified in all 14 patients (100%). Four patients (29%) had unusual tubers. HFOs were observed at ictal onset in all 14 patients. Seven of 10 patients with complete resection of HFOs were seizure free. The better seizure outcome (ILAE =1-3) was achieved with complete HFO resection regardless of the unique TSC structural features (p = 0.0140). Our study demonstrates the presence of ripple and fast ripple range HFOs at ictal onset in children with TSC. Our study showed that complete HFO resection led to the better surgical outcome, independent of MR imaging findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While such signals often carry early signs of neurological deterioration, detecting these signs in real time with conventional data processing methods mainly designed for retrospective analysis has been extremely challenging. Such methods are not designed to handle the large volumes of waveform data produced by bedside monitors. In this pilot study, we address this challenge by building a prototype system using the IBM InfoSphere Streams platform, a scalable stream computing platform, to detect unstable ICP dynamics in real time. The system continuously receives electrocardiographic and ICP signals and analyzes ICP pulse morphology looking for deviations from a steady state. We also designed a Web interface to display in real time the result of this analysis in a Web browser.

There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of this syndrome. As these patients have, by definition, no recognizable clinical features of brain dysfunction, the primary prerequisite for the diagnosis is careful exclusion of clinical symptoms and signs. A large number of psychometric tests/test systems have been evaluated in this patient group. Of these the best known and validated is the Portal Systemic Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) derived from a test battery of five paper and pencil tests; normative reference data are available in several countries. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used to diagnose hepatic encephalopathy since the 1950s but, once popular, the technology is not as accessible now as it once was. The performance characteristics of the EEG are critically dependent on the type of analysis undertaken; spectral analysis has better performance characteristics than visual analysis; evolving analytical techniques may provide better diagnostic information while the advent of portable wireless headsets may facilitate more widespread use. A large number of other diagnostic tools have been validated for the diagnosis of minimal hepatic encephalopathy including Critical Flicker Frequency, the Inhibitory Control Test, the Stroop test, the Scan package and the Continuous Reaction Time; each has its pros and cons; strengths and weaknesses; protagonists and detractors. Recent AASLD/EASL Practice Guidelines suggest that the diagnosis of minimal hepatic encephalopathy should be based on the PHES test together with one of the validated alternative techniques or the EEG. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy has a detrimental effect on the well-being of patients and their care-givers. It responds well to treatment with resolution of test abnormalities and the associated detrimental effects on quality of life, liver-related mortality and morbidity. Patients will only benefit in this way if they can be effectively diagnosed. Corporate efforts and consensus agreements are needed to develop effective diagnostic algorithms.

Recent years have also seen the first reports of neural correlates of this accumulation process. However, these studies have mostly focused on perceptual decision making tasks, ignoring the role of additional cognitive processes like memory retrieval that are crucial in real-world decisions. In this study, we tried to find a neural signature of evidence accumulation during a recognition memory task. To do this, we applied a method we have successfully used to localize evidence accumulation in scalp EEG during a perceptual decision making task. This time, however, we applied it to intracranial EEG recordings, which provide a much higher spatial resolution. We identified several brain areas where activity ramps up over time, but these neural patterns do not appear to be modulated by behavioral variables such as the amount of available evidence or response time. This casts doubt on the idea of evidence accumulation as a general decision-making mechanism underlying different types of decisions.

CLASSIFICATION OF EEG-BASED HAND GRASPING IMAGINATION USING AUTOREGRESSIVE AND NEURAL NETWORKS	JURNAL TEKNOLOGI			English	Article						Grasping Imagination; brain computer interface; autoregressive; adaptive backpropagation	EMOTION RECOGNITION	In the development of Brain Computer Interface (BCI), one important issue is the classification of hand grasping imagination. It is helpful for realtime control of the robotic or a game of the mind. BCI uses EEG signal to get information on the human. This research proposed methods to classify EEG signal against hand grasping imagination using Neural Networks. EEG signal was recorded in ten seconds of four subjects each four times that were asked to imagine three classes of grasping (grasp, loose, and relax). Four subjects used as training data and four subjects as testing data. First, EEG signal was modeled in order 20 Autoregressive (AR) so that got AR coefficients being passed Neural Networks. The order of the AR model chosen based optimization gave a small error that is 1.96%. Then, it has developed a classification system using multilayer architecture and Adaptive Backpropagation as training algorithm. Using AR made training of the system more stable and reduced oscillation. Besides, the use of the AR model as a representation of the EEG signal improved the classification system accuracy of 68% to 82%. To verify the performance improvement of the proposed classification scheme, a comparison of the Adaptive Backpropagation and the conventional Backpropagation in training of the system. It resulted in an increase accuracy of 76% to 82%. The system was validated against all training data that produced an accuracy of 91%. The classification system that has been implemented in the software so that can be used as the brain computer interface.

Towards the bio-personalization of music recommendation systems: A single-sensor EEG biomarker of subjective music preference	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Cross-frequency coupling; Human-computer interaction; Brain-computer interface	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; AESTHETIC APPRECIATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RESPONSES; EMOTION; DYNAMICS; NETWORK; EXPERIENCE; SCIENCE	Recent advances in biosensors technology and mobile electroencephalographic (EEG)-interfaces have opened new application fields for cognitive monitoring. A computable biomarker for the assessment of spontaneous aesthetic brain responses during music listening is introduced here. It derives from well-established measures of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and quantifies the music-induced alterations in the dynamic relationships between brain rhythms. During a stage of exploratory analysis, and using the signals from a suitably designed experiment, we established the biomarker, which acts on brain activations recorded over the left prefrontal cortex and focuses on the functional coupling between high-beta and low-gamma oscillations. Based on data from an additional experimental paradigm, we validated the introduced biomarker and showed its relevance for expressing the subjective aesthetic appreciation of a piece of music. Our approach resulted in an affordable tool that can promote human machine interaction and, by serving as, a personalized music annotation strategy, can be potentially integrated into modern flexible music recommendation systems.

The aim of this study is to assess methods for characterizing brain connectivity changes in different sleep stages as compared to wakefulness, and hence identify possible biomarkers of the level of consciousness based on the topography of connectivity networks. Polysomnographic recordings were collected during a sleep experiment from five healthy young subjects. Functional coupling between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals was estimated in different EEG bands with Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) and Directed Coherence (DC), which provide a frequency domain description of directed causal dependencies among time series. Results indicate that in the theta (theta) and alpha (alpha) bands the number of significant connections increases in the transition from sleep to wakefulness. Moreover connectivity patterns elicited in sleep are dominated by shortrange connections, in contrast to long range links connecting distant areas, which are elicited in wakefulness in the a and. bands. An inversion in the direction of information flow from anterior-posterior to posterior-anterior is noticeable in the transition from sleep to wakefulness in the. and a bands. The drop of the number of long-range posterior-frontal links in the a band may be a promising indicator for the descent into sleep and perhaps anesthesia.	[Lioi, G.; Bell, S. L.; Simpson, D.

Induction of hypothermia has been found to improve the functional recovery of CA patients after resuscitation. However, there is no clear guideline for the clinicians yet to determine the prognosis of the CA when patients are treated with hypothermia. The present work aimed at the development of a prognostic marker for the CA patients undergoing hypothermia. A quantitative measure of the complexity of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, called wavelet sub-band entropy, was employed to predict the patients' outcomes. We hypothesized that the EEG signals of the patients who survived would demonstrate more complexity and consequently higher values of wavelet sub-band entropies. A dataset of 16-channel EEG signals collected from CA patients undergoing hypothermia at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center was used to test the hypothesis. Following preprocessing of the signals and implementation of the wavelet transform, the wavelet sub-band entropies were calculated for different frequency bands and EEG channels. Then the values of wavelet sub-band entropies were compared among two groups of patients: survived vs. non-survived. Our results revealed that the brain high frequency oscillations (between 64100 Hz) captured from the inferior frontal lobes are significantly more complex in the CA patients who survived (p-value <= 0.02). Given that the non-invasive measurement of EEG is part of the standard clinical assessment for CA patients, the results of this study can enhance the management of the CA patients treated with hypothermia.

Elucidating their neural underpinnings may assist in improving diagnosis and developing targeted interventions. Neural oscillations are fundamental for brain functioning. Specifically, oscillations in the alpha frequency range (alpha rhythms) are prevalent in the awake, conscious brain and play an important role in supporting perceptual, cognitive, and social processes. We review studies utilizing various alpha power measurements to assess abnormalities in brain functioning in affective and anxiety disorders as well as obsessive compulsive and post-traumatic stress disorders. Despite some inconsistencies, studies demonstrate associations between aberrant alpha patterns and these disorders both in response to specific cognitive and emotional tasks and during a resting state. We conclude by discussing methodological considerations and future directions, and underscore the need for much further research on the role of alpha functionality in social contexts. As social dysfunction accompanies most psychiatric conditions, research on alpha's involvement in social processes may provide a unique window into the neural mechanisms underlying these disorders.

Sleep spindles represent a prominent example of a poorly understood transient brain oscillation that is impaired in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, the causal role of these bouts of thalamo-cortical oscillations remains unknown. Demonstrating a functional role of sleep spindles in cognitive processes has, so far, been hindered by the lack of a tool to target transient brain oscillations in real time. Here, we show, for the first time, selective enhancement of sleep spindles with non-invasive brain stimulation in humans. We developed a system that detects sleep spindles in real time and applies oscillatory stimulation. Our stimulation selectively enhanced spindle activity as determined by increased sigma activity after trans cranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) application. This targeted modulation caused significant enhancement of motor memory consolidation that correlated with the stimulation-induced change in fast spindle activity. Strikingly, we found a similar correlation between motor memory and spindle characteristics during the sham night for the same spindle frequencies and electrode locations. Therefore, our results directly demonstrate a functional relationship between oscillatory spindle activity and cognition.

Previous fMRI findings have shown that chronic pain patients display an altered activation and functional connectivity of the pain network. The aim of the present study was to analyze EEG dynamics in fibromyalgia patients (n = 20) and painfree controls (n = 18) at rest. Methods. Spectral power density, source current density, and intra- and inter-hemispheric coherence were analyzed from 64 EEG channels during 5-minutes eyes-closed rest. Results. Results indicated that fibromyalgia patients displayed reduced power density of the delta EEG band (2-4 Hz) over right insula, right superior and middle temporal gyri as compared with pain-free controls. Fibromyalgia patients also exhibited greater power density than pain-free controls in two segments of the beta band (16-23 Hz and 23-30 Hz) over right middle frontal lobe and midcingulate gyrus. Pain duration in fibromyalgia patients was negatively correlated with delta power from right insula. Greater centro-parietal intra-hemispheric coherence was observed at the left hemisphere on theta (4-8 Hz), and beta-3 (23-30 Hz) frequency bands in fibromyalgia patients than in pain-free controls. Individual differences in depression, anxiety or negative affect did not account for these findings. Conclusions. Fibromyalgia leads to an altered dynamic of the brain network involved in the processing of pain even at rest. Furthermore, our results provide further support for the feasibility of resting-state EEG analyses as a clinical biomarker for the characterization of chronic pain states.

Translational neurophysiological markers for activity of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2) modulator JNJ-40411813: Sleep EEG correlates in rodents and healthy men	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Circadian; Glutamate; Men; mGluR2 (-/-) mice; Metabotropic receptor mGluR2; Network oscillations and connectivity; Polysomnography; Positron Emission Tomography (PET); Psychiatric disorders; Rat; Sleep-wake cycle; Tolerance; Translational	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; REM-SLEEP; POWER SPECTRA; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; ANTAGONIST RITANSERIN; CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; THETA OSCILLATIONS	Alterations in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) have been suggested as valid translational efficacy markers: activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) was shown to increase REM latency and to decrease REM duration. The present paper addresses the effects on vigilance states of the mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) JNJ-40411813 at different circadian times in rats and after afternoon dosing in humans. Due to its dual mGluR2 PAM/serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonism in rodents, mGlu2R specificity of effects was studied in wild-type (WT) and mGluR2 (-/-) mice. 5-HT2A receptor occupancy was determined in humans using positron emission tomography (PET). Tolerance development was examined in rats after chronic dosing. EEG oscillations and network connectivity were assessed using multi-channel EEG. In rats, JNJ-40411813 increased deep sleep time and latency of REM onset but reduced REM time when administered 2 h after 'lights on' (CT2): this was sustained after chronic dosing. At CT5 similar effects were elicited, at CT10 only deep sleep was enhanced. Withdrawal resulted in baseline values, while re administration reinstated drug effects. Parieto-occipital cortical slow theta and gamma oscillations were correlated with low locomotion. The specificity of functional response was confirmed in WT but not mGluR2 (-/-) mice. A double-blind, placebo-controlled polysomnographic study in healthy, elderly subjects showed that 500 mg of JNJ-40411813 consistently increased deep sleep time, but had no effect on REM parameters. This deep sleep effect was not explained by 5-HT2A receptor binding, as in the PET study even 700 mg only marginally displaced the tracer. JNJ-40411813 elicited comparable functional responses in rodents and men if circadian time of dosing was taken into account. These findings underscore the translational potential of sleep mechanisms in evaluating mGluR2 therapeutics when administered at the appropriate circadian time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Spectral Entropy Based Neuronal Network Synchronization Analysis Based on Microelectrode Array Measurements	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						synchronization; spectral entropy; correlation; mouse cortical cells; rat cortical cells; developing neuronal networks; MEA; microelectrode array	BURST; EEG	Synchrony and asynchrony are essential aspects of the functioning of interconnected neuronal cells and networks. New information on neuronal synchronization can be expected to aid in understanding these systems. Synchronization provides insight in the functional connectivity and the spatial distribution of the information processing in the networks. Synchronization is generally studied with time domain analysis of neuronal events, or using direct frequency spectrum analysis, e.g., in specific frequency bands. However, these methods have their pitfalls. Thus, we have previously proposed a method to analyze temporal changes in the complexity of the frequency of signals originating from different network regions. The method is based on the correlation of time varying spectral entropies (SEs). SE assesses the regularity, or complexity, of a time series by quantifying the uniformity of the frequency spectrum distribution. It has been previously employed, e.g., in electroencephalogram analysis. Here, we revisit our correlated spectral entropy method (CorSE), providing evidence of its justification, usability, and benefits. Here, CorSE is assessed with simulations and in vitro microelectrode array (MEA) data. CorSE is first demonstrated with a specifically tailored toy simulation to illustrate how it can identify synchronized populations. To provide a form of validation, the method was tested with simulated data from integrate-and-fire model based computational neuronal networks. To demonstrate the analysis of real data, CorSE was applied on in vitro MEA data measured from rat cortical cell cultures, and the results were compared with three known event based synchronization measures. Finally, we show the usability by tracking the development of networks in dissociated mouse cortical cell cultures. The results show that temporal correlations in frequency spectrum distributions reflect the network relations of neuronal populations. In the simulated data, CorSE unraveled the synchronizations. With the real in vitro MEA data, CorSE produced biologically plausible results. Since CorSE analyses continuous data, it is not affected by possibly poor spike or other event detection quality. We conclude that CorSE can reveal neuronal network synchronization based on in vitro MEA field potential measurements. CorSE is expected to be equally applicable also in the analysis of corresponding in vivo and ex vivo data analysis.

Oscillations and connectivity in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and bipolar disorder	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Oscillations; Connectivity; Schizophrenia; Alzheimer's disease; Bipolar disorder	EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; WORKING-MEMORY; RESTING STATE; ESTABLISHED SCHIZOPHRENIA; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EUTHYMIC PATIENTS; HIGH-RISK; EEG; RESPONSES	The application of the concept and methods of brain oscillations has been an important research area in neurosciences. In the last decades, besides the application in cognitive processes, the study of changes in brain oscillations in diseases has also become an important focal point of research. In the present paper, some remarkable examples in three different diseases are taken into consideration: 1) schizophrenia (SZ), 2) Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3) bipolar disorders (BD). In the current literature, decreased oscillations in cortical recordings are observed in most of the pathologies. For example, decrease of gamma activity in SZ, decrease of delta activity in almost all diseases, as well as frequency shifts in alpha and the lower frequencies were recorded. However, there are also paradoxical cases in which an increase of oscillatory activities is observed. In BD, whereas alpha activity is greatly decreased, a huge increase of beta activity is observed. Or, in SZ, a paradoxical increase of gamma activity can be observed during cognitive loading. We also observed paradoxical changes in the analysis of connectivity. In AD, we find that alpha, delta, and theta coherences between distant parts of the cortex are greatly decreased, whereas in the gamma band, event-related coherences attain very high values. The comparison of the results and paradoxical changes in diseases may lead to important conclusions related to the web of oscillations and neurotransmitters. In turn, we could gain new insights to approach "brain function", in general. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The main goal of the present study was to explore theta and alpha event related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) activity during shooting performance. We adopted the idiosyncratic framework of the multi-action plan (MAP) model to investigate different processing modes underpinning four types of performance. In particular, we were interested in examining the neural activity associated with optimal automated (Type 1) and optimal-controlled (Type 2) performances. Methods. Ten elite shooters (6 male and 4 female) with extensive international experience participated in the study. ERD/ERS analysis was used to investigate cortical dynamics during performance. A 4 x 3 (performance types x time) repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to test the differences among the four types of performance during the three seconds preceding the shots for theta, low alpha, and high alpha frequency bands. The dependent variables were the ERD/ERS percentages in each frequency band (i.e., theta, low alpha, high alpha) for each electrode site across the scalp. This analysis was conducted on 120 shots for each participant in three different frequency bands and the individual data were then averaged. Results. We found ERS to be mainly associated with optimal-automatic performance, in agreement with the "neural efficiency hypothesis." We also observed more ERD as related to optimal-controlled performance in conditions of "neural adaptability" and proficient use of cortical resources. Discussion. These findings are congruent with the MAP conceptualization of four performance states, in which unique psychophysiological states underlie distinct performance-related experiences. From an applied point of view, our findings suggest that the MAP model can be used as a framework to develop performance enhancement strategies based on cognitive and neurofeedback techniques.

Autonomic nervous system functioning associated with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: Analysis of heart rate variability	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures; Conversion disorder; Heart rate variability; Vagal tone; Autonomic nervous system	POWER SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; POINCARE PLOT; BEAT; DYNAMICS; DISORDER; STRESS; TRAUMA	Objective: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) resemble epileptic seizures but originate from psychogenic rather than organic causes. Patients with PNESs are often unable or unwilling to reflect on underlying emotions. To gain more insight into the internal states of patients during PNES episodes, this study explored the time course of heart rate variability (HRV) measures, which provide information about autonomic nervous system functioning and arousal. Methods: Heart rate variability measures were extracted from double-lead electrocardiography data collected during 1-7 days of video-electroencephalography monitoring of 20 patients with PNESs, in whom a total number of 118 PNESs was recorded. Heart rate (HR) and HRV measures in time and frequency domains (standard deviation of average beat-to-beat intervals (SDANN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high-frequency (HF) power, low-frequency (LF) power, and very low-frequency (VLF) power) were averaged over consecutive five-minute intervals. Additionally, quantitative analyses of Poincare plot parameters (SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2 ratio) were performed. Results: In the five-minute interval before PNES, HR significantly (p=0.05) increased (d=2.5), whereas SDANN (d=-0.03) and VLF power (d=-0.05) significantly decreased. During PNES, significant increases inHF power (d=0.0006), SD1 (d=0.031), and SD2 (d=0.016) were observed. In the five-minute interval immediately following PNES, SDANN (d=0.046) and VLF power (d=0.073) significantly increased, and HR (d=-5.1) and SD1/SD2 ratio (d=-0.14) decreased, compared to the interval preceding PNES. Conclusion: The results suggest that PNES episodes are preceded by increased sympathetic functioning, which is followed by an increase in parasympathetic functioning during and after PNES. Future research needs to identify the exact nature of the increased arousal that precedes PNES. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[van der Kruijs, Sylvie J. M.; Bodde, Nynke M.

A functional classification of medial frontal negativity ERPs: Theta oscillations and single subject effects	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Medial frontal cortex; Theta; Performance monitoring; Independent component analysis; Robust estimation	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MIDLINE THETA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; RESPONSE CONFLICT; BRAIN DYNAMICS; EEG DYNAMICS	Theta oscillations in the EEG have been linked to several ERPs that are elicited during performance-monitoring tasks, including the error-related negativity (ERN), no-go N2, and the feedback-related negativity (FRN). We used a novel paradigm to isolate independent components (ICs) in single subjects' (n=27) EEG accounting for a medial frontal negativity (MFN) to response cue stimuli that signal a potential change in future response demands. Medial frontal projecting ICs that were sensitive to these response cues also described the ERNs, no-go N2s, and, to a lesser extent, the FRNs, that were elicited in letter flanker, go/no-go, and time-estimation tasks, respectively. In addition, percentile bootstrap tests using trimmed means indicated that the medial frontal ICs show an increase in theta activity during the ERN, no-go N2, and FRN across tasks and within individuals. Our results provide an important validation of previous studies by showing that increases in medial frontal theta to cognitively challenging events in multiple paradigms is a reliable effect within individuals and can be elicited by basic stimulus cues that signal the potential need to adjust response control. Thus, medial frontal theta reflects a neural response common to all MFN paradigms and characterizes the general process of controlling attention without the need to induce error commission, inhibited responses, or to present negative feedback.

While recognition of social information and emotion processing are impaired in schizophrenia, no previous study analyzed induced and evoked beta oscillations in patients with schizophrenia during emotion processing. Twenty-eight subjects with schizophrenia and twenty-seven healthy controls subjects were enrolled in the study. The two study groups did not differ in age, gender and education. Participants viewed positive, neutral and negative scenes selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while 128-channel EEG was recorded. A significantly weaker low beta ERD was detected in patients relative to controls for the negative stimulus condition in the right parieto-occipital and temporal regions. Patients with decreased beta ERD showed more prominent negative symptoms and more severe deficits in psychosocial functioning. Only in the control group stronger beta ERD was detected for the negative stimuli relative to positive and neutral stimuli in the same regions. Our major finding is that impaired emotion processing in schizophrenia is reflected in decreased low beta ERD and in the diminished differences between low beta ERD to negative and non-negative emotional stimuli. Furthermore, it was found that patients with decreased beta ERD show more prominent negative symptoms and more severe deficits in psychosocial functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

The activation of either the PPN or Cl/Pf nuclei in vivo has been described to induce the arousal of the animal and an increment in gamma band activity in the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG). The cellular mechanisms for the generation of gamma band oscillations in Reticular Activating System (RAS) neurons are the same as those found to generate gamma band oscillations in other brains nuclei. During current-clamp recordings of PPN neurons (from parasagittal slices from 9-25 day-old rats), the use of depolarizing square steps rapidly activated voltage-dependent potassium channels that prevented PPN neurons from being depolarized beyond -25 mV. Injecting 1 -2 sec long depolarizing current ramps gradually depolarized PPN membrane potential resting values towards 0 mV. However, injecting depolarizing square pulses generated gamma-band oscillations of membrane potential that showed to be smaller in amplitude compared to the oscillations generated by ramps. All experiments were performed in the presence of voltage-gated sodium channels and fast synaptic receptors blockers. It has been shown that the activation of high-threshold voltage-dependent calcium channels underlie gamma-band oscillatory activity in PPN neurons. Specific methodological and pharmacological interventions are described here, providing the necessary tools to induce and sustain PPN subthreshold gamma band oscillation in vitro.

However, it is unclear whether this is true for different identifiable levels within a single category. In the present study, we used ERP recording to examine the neural response to different identification levels and orientations (upright vs. inverted) of Chinese characters. The results showed that P1, N170, and P250 were modulated by different identification levels of Chinese characters. Moreover, time frequency analysis showed similar results, indicating that identification levels were associated with object recognition, particularly during processing of a single categorical stimulus.

Recent work showed that the testing effect can be dramatically reversed when feedback is provided to participants during final recall testing (Storm, Friedman, Murayama, & Bjork, 2014). Following this prior work, in this study, we examined the reversal of the testing effect by investigating oscillatory brain activity during final recall testing. Twenty-six healthy participants learned cue-target word pairs and underwent a practice phase in which half of the items were retrieval practiced and half were restudy practiced. Two days later, two cued recall tests were administered, and immediate feedback was provided to participants in Test 1. Behavioral results replicated the prior work by showing a testing effect in Test 1, but a reversed testing effect in Test 2. Extending the prior work, EEG results revealed a feedback-related effect in alpha/lower-beta and retrieval-related effects in slow and fast theta power, with practice condition modulating the fast theta power effect for items that were not recalled in Test 1. The results indicate that the reversed testing effect can arise without differential strengthening of restudied and retrieval-practiced items via feedback learning. Theoretical implications of the findings, in particular with respect to the distribution-based bifurcation model of testing effects (Kornell, Bjork, & Garcia, 2011), are discussed.

However, direct evidence for such a system, and the physiological basis of its computations, is lacking. Using an auditory stimulus whose pitch value changed according to specific rules, we controlled and separated the three key computational variables underlying perception, and discovered, using direct recordings from human auditory cortex, that surprise due to prediction violations is encoded by local field potential oscillations in the gamma band (>30 Hz), changes to predictions in the beta band (12-30 Hz), and that the precision of predictions appears to quantitatively relate to alpha band oscillations (8-12 Hz). These results confirm oscillatory codes for critical aspects of generative models of perception.

While REM sleep is characterized by brain activity similar to wakefulness, the EEG activity changes drastically with the emergence of K-complexes, sleep spindles and slow oscillations during NREM sleep. These changes are regulated by circadian and ultradian rhythms, which emerge from an intricate interplay between multiple neuronal populations in the brainstem, forebrain and hypothalamus and the resulting varying levels of neuromodulators. Recently, there has been progress in the understanding of those rhythms both from a physiological as well as theoretical perspective. However, how these neuromodulators affect the generation of the different EEG patterns and their temporal dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we build upon previous work on a neural mass model of the sleeping cortex and investigate the effect of those neuromodulators on the dynamics of the cortex and the corresponding transition between wakefulness and the different sleep stages. We show that our simplified model is sufficient to generate the essential features of human EEG over a full day. This approach builds a bridge between sleep regulatory networks and EEG generating neural mass models and provides a valuable tool for model validation.

We investigate whether individual differences in BMI control based on motor imagery (MI) are related to differences in MI ability. We assessed whether differences in kinesthetic and visual MI, in the behavioral accuracy of MI, and in electroencephalographic variables, were able to differentiate between high-versus low-aptitude BMI users. High-aptitude BMI users showed higher MI accuracy as captured by subjective and behavioral measurements, pointing to a prominent role of kinesthetic rather than visual imagery. Additionally, for the first time, we applied mental chronometry, a measure quantifying the degree to which imagined and executed movements share a similar temporal profile. We also identified enhanced lateralized mu-band oscillations over sensorimotor cortices during MI in high-versus low-aptitude BMI users. These findings reveal that subjective, behavioral, and EEG measurements of MI are intimately linked to BMI control. We propose that poor BMI control cannot be ascribed only to intrinsic limitations of EEG recordings and that specific questionnaires and mental chronometry can be used as predictors of BMI performance (without the need to record EEG activity).

Human gait is a complex process in the central nervous system that results from the integration of various mechanisms which remain unclear. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to investigate the cortical activity patterns during gait movement in SCI. In this study, brain activity was recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG) during two kinds of gait-like movements. Phase synchronization between motor cortices was investigated through source analysis and phase locking. Results revealed that diverse neural networks with different resonance-like frequencies exist in the brain. Further, we found that the premotor cortex played an important role in the control of passive gait-like movement. In attempted/active movement, spatial function and multimodal integration with somatosensory information are crucial aspects of posterior parietal cortex function which need to be considered separately in different EEG bands. Our results further confirmed that neural system control patterns in passive gait-like movement differ from those in attempted or active gait-like movement. Novel insights into human gait will provide a basis for improvements in future neurorehabilitation applications.

The anatomical changes caused by these therapeutic techniques are well known, but it is unclear whether these changes alter the cerebral processing of swallow-related sensorimotor activity. We sought to investigate the effect of increased fluid viscosity and chin down posture during swallowing on brain networks. 55 healthy adults performed water, nectar-thick, and honey thick liquid swallows in the neutral and chin-tuck positions while EEG signals were recorded. After preprocessing of the EEG timeseries, the time-frequency based synchrony measure was used for forming the brain networks to investigate whether there were differences among the brain networks between the swallowing of different fluid viscosities and swallowing in different head positions. We also investigated whether swallowing under various conditions exhibit small-world properties. Results showed that fluid viscosity affects the brain network in the Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma frequency bands and that swallowing in the chin-tuck head position affects brain networks in the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma frequency bands. In addition, we showed that swallowing in all tested conditions exhibited small-world properties. Therefore, fluid viscosity and head positions should be considered in future swallowing EEG investigations.

EEGs of 73 patients and 24 controls were recorded and coma recovery scale- revised (CRS-R) scores were assessed. CRS-R of UWS patients was collected after 12 months and divided into two groups (improved/unimproved). Frontal, parietal, fronto-parietal, fronto-temporal, and fronto-occipital coherence was computed, as well as EEG power over frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal areas. Minimally conscious patients (MCS) and UWS patients could not be differentiated based on their coherence patterns or on EEG power. Fronto-parietal and parietal coherence could positively predict improvement of UWS patients, i.e. recovery from UWS to MCS. Parietal coherence was significantly higher in delta and theta frequencies in the improved group, as well as the coherence between frontal and parietal regions in delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequencies. High parietal delta and theta, and high fronto-parietal theta and alpha coherence appear to provide strong early evidence for recovery from UWS with high predictive sensitivity and specificity. Short and long-range coherence can have a diagnostic value in the prognosis of recovery from UWS.

J	Wu, YY; Li, M; Wang, J				Wu, Yingying; Li, Man; Wang, Jing			Toward a hybrid brain-computer interface based on repetitive visual stimuli with missing events	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Brain Computer Interface (BCI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP); Omitted stimulus potential (OSP)	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; SSVEP; P300; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION; ODDBALL	Background: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) can be elicited by repetitive stimuli and extracted in the frequency domain with satisfied performance. However, the temporal information of such stimulus is often ignored. In this study, we utilized repetitive visual stimuli with missing events to present a novel hybrid BCI paradigm based on SSVEP and omitted stimulus potential (OSP). Methods: Four discs flickering from black to white with missing flickers served as visual stimulators to simultaneously elicit subject's SSVEPs and OSPs. Key parameters in the new paradigm, including flicker frequency, optimal electrodes, missing flicker duration and intervals of missing events were qualitatively discussed with offline data. Two omitted flicker patterns including missing black/white disc were proposed and compared. Averaging times were optimized with Information Transfer Rate (ITR) in online experiments, where SSVEPs and OSPs were identified using Canonical Correlation Analysis in the frequency domain and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-Bayes fusion in the time domain, respectively. Results and conclusions: The online accuracy and ITR (mean +/- standard deviation) over nine healthy subjects were 79.29 +/- 18.14 % and 19.45 +/- 11.99 bits/min with missing black disc pattern, and 86.82 +/- 12.91 % and 24.06 +/- 10.95 bits/min with missing white disc pattern, respectively. The proposed BCI paradigm, for the first time, demonstrated that SSVEPs and OSPs can be simultaneously elicited in single visual stimulus pattern and recognized in real-time with satisfied performance. Besides the frequency features such as SSVEP elicited by repetitive stimuli, we found a new feature (OSP) in the time domain to design a novel hybrid BCI paradigm by adding missing events in repetitive stimuli.

J	Jalili, M				Jalili, Mahdi			Functional Brain Networks: Does the Choice of Dependency Estimator and Binarization Method Matter?	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; MINIMUM SPANNING TREE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; WHITE-MATTER; CONNECTIVITY; COHERENCE; FREQUENCY; STATE	The human brain can be modelled as a complex networked structure with brain regions as individual nodes and their anatomical/functional links as edges. Functional brain networks are constructed by first extracting weighted connectivity matrices, and then binarizing them to minimize the noise level. Different methods have been used to estimate the dependency values between the nodes and to obtain a binary network from a weighted connectivity matrix. In this work we study topological properties of EEG-based functional networks in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). To estimate the connectivity strength between two time series, we use Pearson correlation, coherence, phase order parameter and synchronization likelihood. In order to binarize the weighted connectivity matrices, we use Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Minimum Connected Component (MCC), uniform threshold and density-preserving methods. We find that the detected AD-related abnormalities highly depend on the methods used for dependency estimation and binarization. Topological properties of networks constructed using coherence method and MCC binarization show more significant differences between AD and healthy subjects than the other methods. These results might explain contradictory results reported in the literature for network properties specific to AD symptoms. The analysis method should be seriously taken into account in the interpretation of network-based analysis of brain signals.

J	Cheng, N; Li, Q; Xu, XX; Zhang, T				Cheng, Ning; Li, Qun; Xu, Xiaxia; Zhang, Tao			A Precise Annotation of Phase-Amplitude Coupling Intensity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTIITEM WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PERMUTATION ENTROPY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA RHYTHM; FREQUENCY; INFORMATION; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; HIPPOCAMPUS	Neuronal information can be coded in different temporal and spatial scales. Cross-frequency coupling of neuronal oscillations, especially phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), plays a critical functional role in neuronal communication and large scale neuronal encoding. Several approaches have been developed to assess PAC intensity. It is generally agreed that the PAC intensity relates to the uneven distribution of the fast oscillation amplitude conditioned on the slow oscillation phase. However, it is still not clear what the PAC intensity exactly means. In the present study, it was found that there were three types of interferential signals taking part in PAC phenomenon. Based on the classification of interferential signals, the conception of PAC intensity is theoretically annotated as the proportion of slow or fast oscillation that is involved in a related PAC phenomenon. In order to make sure that the annotation is proper to some content, simulation data are constructed and then analyzed by three PAC approaches. These approaches are the mean vector length (MVL), the modulation index (MI), and a new permutation mutual information (PMI) method in which the permutation entropy and the information theory are applied. Results show positive correlations between PAC values derived from all three methods and the suggested intensity. Finally, the amplitude distributions, i.e. the phase-amplitude plots, obtained from different PAC intensities show that the annotation proposed in the study is in line with the previous understandings.

For human memory formation, the role of oscillatory brain activity within different frequency ranges has been discussed but a more functional relation could not be established. In the present Experiment I, an increase of pre-stimulus theta- (3-7 Hz) and beta- (13-17 Hz) band oscillations during encoding for later remembered stimuli was observed. To establish a more direct functional relation, we adopted a novel brain-computer-interface (BCI) method to selectively detect oscillatory activity in real-time combined with an adaptive stimulus presentation at different levels of activity. Therefore, in the second experiment the BCI was used to present the visual stimuli with a high temporal resolution directly within defined brain states of beta-or theta-band activity. The quality of the subsequent processing of the stimuli was assessed at the behavioral level with a surprise recognition task. Results revealed a variation of memory performance in direct relation to the amount of pre-stimulus beta-but not theta-band oscillations, suggesting a functional relevance of beta-band oscillations for memory encoding. Thus, the BCI method enabled a more functional differentiation of the effective role of ongoing oscillatory activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, YJ; Feng, ZQ; Xu, YY; Bian, C; Li, M				Xie, Yuanjun; Feng, Zhengquan; Xu, Yuanyuan; Bian, Chen; Li, Min			The different oscillation patterns of alpha band in the early and later stages of working memory maintenance	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Alpha band; Working memory; Maintenance; Neural oscillation; Time course	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG; TASK; LOAD; SYNCHRONIZATION; RETENTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; INFORMATION	A putative functional role for alpha oscillations in working memory remains controversial. However, recent evidence suggests that such oscillation may reflect distinct phases of working memory processing. The present study investigated alpha band (8-13 Hz) activity during the maintenance stage of working memory using a modified Sternberg working memory task. Our results reveal that alpha power was concentrated primarily in the occipital cortex and was decreased during the early stage of maintenance (0-600 ms), and subsequently increased during the later stage of maintenance (1000-1600 ms). We suggest that reduced alpha power may be involved in focused attention during the working memory maintenance, whereas increased alpha power may reflect suppression of visual stimuli to facilitate internal processing related to the task. This interpretation is generally consistent with recent reports suggesting that variations in alpha power are associated with the representation and processing of information in the discrete time intervals during the working memory maintenance.

The data were obtained on a Neuromag/Elekta system with 204 planar gradiometers and 102 magnetometer sensors and also 60 EEG channels. To remove artifacts, all MEG files were temporal signal space separation filtered. The data were then analyzed with the BESA Research software.Results:Infraslow activity was present in all files for MEG and EEG. Good concordance between EEG and MEG ISA was seen with delta for laterality and with clinical features. Delta frequencies were always less than 2 Hz. During sleep, an inverse relationship between delta and ISA occurred. With increasing depth of sleep, delta activity increased while ISA decreased and vice versa. Intermittent higher amplitude transients, arising from background, were also seen but their nature is at present unknown. Clinically relevant ictal onset baseline shifts were likewise observed.Conclusion:Infraslow activity is a normal segment of the cerebral electromagnetic frequency spectrum. It follows physiologic rules and can be related to areas of pathology. This is in accord with previously published EEG observations and further studies of this segment of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum for its origin and changes in health and disease are indicated.

Methods: We simultaneously recorded several hours of continuous ECoG and SG signals from 3 human pediatric subjects, and compared power spectra of signals between a differential SG montage and several differential ECoG montages to determine the nature of the transfer function between them. Results: We demonstrate the presence of CE signals in the SG montage in the high-gamma range (HG, 70-110 Hz), and the transfer function between 70 and 110 Hz is best characterized as a linear function of frequency. We also test an alternative transfer function, i.e. a single pole filter, to test the hypothesis of frequency dependent attenuation in that range, but find this model to be inferior to the linear model. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that SG electrodes are capable of recording HG signals without frequency distortion compared with ECoG electrodes. Significance: HG signals could be recorded minimally invasively from outside the skull, which could be important for clinical care or brain-computer interface applications.

Both patterns also occur in models of MTLE in vivo and in vitro, and these studies have highlighted the predominant involvement of distinct neuronal network/neurotransmitter receptor signaling in each of them. First, LVF-onset seizures in epileptic rodents can originate from several limbic structures, frequently spread, and are associated with high-frequency oscillations in the ripple band (80-200 Hz), whereas HYP onset seizures initiate in the hippocampus and tend to remain focal with predominant fast ripples (250-500 Hz). Second, in vitro intracellular recordings from principal cells in limbic areas indicate that pharmacologically induced seizure-like discharges with LVF onset are initiated by a synchronous inhibitory event or by a hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potential barrage; in contrast, HYP onset is associated with a progressive impairment of inhibition and concomitant unrestrained enhancement of excitation. Finally, in vitro optogenetic experiments show that, under comparable experimental conditions (i.e., 4-aminopyridine application), the initiation of LVF-or HYP-onset seizures depends on the preponderant involvement of interneuronal or principal cell networks, respectively. Overall, these data may provide insight to delineate better therapeutic targets in the treatment of patients presenting with MTLE and, perhaps, with other epileptic disorders as well.

Evaluating the single seizure clinic model: Findings from a Canadian Center	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Epilepsy; Single seizure; Health-care process improvement; Quality of life; Diagnosis; Wait-times	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM; SELF-REPORTED EPILEPSY; HEALTH-CARE; GLOBAL CAMPAIGN; ADULTS; PEOPLE; RISK; PREVALENCE; FREQUENCY	Introduction: The effect of the single seizure clinic (SSC) model on patient diagnose, work-up, wait-times, and clinical care is poorly characterized and its efficacy unclear. The present study assesses patient characteristics and evaluates the impact of a single seizure clinic (SSC) model on wait-times and access to care. Material and methods: A prospective study of all patients (n = 200) referred to our SSC for first seizure evaluation. Demographic, clinical, and paraclinicial variables were systematically collected and analyzed against a historical cohort. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to predict impact of dichotomized variables on diagnosis of epilepsy. Diagnostic concordance between SSC nurses and epileptologists was also assessed. Results: Predominant referral sources were emergency department physicians and general practitioners. Mean wait-time for first assessment was significantly reduced by 70.5% employing the SSC model versus historical usual care. A diagnosis was established at first-contact in 80.5% of cases while 16.0% of patients required a second Visit. Eighty-two patients (41.0%) were diagnosed with epilepsy. An abnormal EEG was found in 93.9% of patients diagnosed with epilepsy. Sixty-three patients were started on anti-epileptic drugs (63.5% lamotrigine, 7.0% levetiracetam, 5.0% phenytoin, and 5.0% topiramate). In 18% of cases driving restrictions were initiated by the SSC. The most common non-seizure diagnosis was syncope (24.0%). Discussion: The SSC reduced wait-times for assessment and investigations, clarified diagnoses, affected management decisions with respect to further workup, pharmacotherapy, and driving. There was moderate correlation between SSC nurses and physicians (kappa = 0.54; p<0.001) as physicians were significantly more likely to diagnose epilepsy. Key factors identified as predictors of epilepsy were: presence of abnormalities on electroencephalography and imaging studies, patients stratified as high or medium-risk for seizure recurrence, semiological characteristics such as amnesia and limb stiffening, and presence of tongue trauma, or incontinence. Conclusions: The SSC model reduces wait-times, streamlines assessments, and impacts clinical care decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TDFE relies on the employment of category information for the maximization of the between-class scatter and the minimization of the within-class scatter to extract optimal hidden discriminative feature subspaces that are simultaneously spanned by every modality for supervised tensor modeling. In this context, the proposed tensor-decomposition method provides the following benefits: i) reduces dimensionality while robustly mining the underlying discriminative features, ii) results in effective interpretable features that lead to an improved classification and visualization, and iii) reduces the processing time during the training stage and the filtering of the projection by solving the generalized eigenvalue issue at each alternation step. Two real third-order tensor-structures of time series datasets (an epilepsy electroencephalogram (EEG) that is modeled as channel x frequency bin x time frame and a microarray data that is modeled as gene x sample x time) were used for the evaluation of the TDFE. The experiment results corroborate the advantages of the proposed method with averages of 98.26% and 89.63% for the classification accuracies of the epilepsy dataset and the microarray dataset, respectively. These performance averages represent an improvement on those of the matrix based algorithms and recent tensor-based, discriminant-decomposition approaches; this is especially the case considering the small number of samples that are used in practice.

The experimental design used a cross-modal priming paradigm in which the normal adult participants were presented a visual prime followed by an auditory target. Primes were facial expressions that systematically varied in emotional content (happy or angry) and mouth shape (corresponding to /a/ or /i/ vowels). Targets were spoken words that varied by emotional prosody (happy or angry) and vowel (/a/ or /i/). In both the phonetic and prosodic conditions, participants were asked to judge congruency status of the visual prime and the auditory target. Behavioral results showed a congruency effect for both percent correct and reaction time. Two ERP responses, the N400 and late positive response (LPR), were identified in both conditions. Source localization and inter-trial phase coherence of the N400 and LPR components further revealed different cortical contributions and neural oscillation patterns for selective processing of phonetic and emotional information in speech. The results provide corroborating evidence for the necessity of differentiating brain mechanisms underlying the representation and processing of co-existing linguistic and paralinguistic information in spoken language, which has important implications for theoretical models of speech recognition as well as clinical studies on the neural bases of language and social communication deficits.

However, most TNT studies have been limited to the visual domain. To assess whether and to what extent direct memory suppression extends across sensory modalities, we examined behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of auditory TNT in healthy young adults by adapting the TNT paradigm to the auditory modality. Behaviorally, suppression of memory strength was indexed by prolonged response time (RTs) during the retrieval of subsequently remembered No-Think words. We examined task-related EEG activity of both attempted memory retrieval and inhibition of a previously learned target word during the presentation of its paired associate. Event-related EEG responses revealed two main findings: (1) a centralized Think > No-Think positivity during auditory word presentation (from approximately 0-500 ms); and (2) a sustained Think positivity over parietal electrodes beginning at approximately 600 ms reflecting the memory retrieval effect which was significantly reduced for No-Think words. In addition, word-locked theta (4-8 Hz) power was initially greater for No-Think compared to Think during auditory word presentation over fronto-central electrodes. This was followed by a posterior theta increase indexing successful memory retrieval in the Think condition. The observed event-related potential pattern and theta power analysis are similar to that reported in visual TNT studies and support a modality non-specific mechanism for memory inhibition. The EEG data also provide evidence supporting differing roles and time courses of frontal and parietal regions in the flexible control of auditory memory.

J	Basar, E; Duzgun, A				Basar, Erol; Duzgun, Aysel			The CLAIR model: Extension of Brodmann areas based on brain oscillations and connectivity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Brodmann areas; Connectivity; Brain oscillations; Delta; Gamma; Alpha; Theta	RECORDED EEG-EPOGRAMS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RETICULAR-FORMATION; AUDITORY PATHWAY; GAMMA-RESPONSES; MOTOR IMAGERY; ELECTRICAL SIGNALS; COMBINED DYNAMICS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; VISUAL-CORTEX	Since the beginning of the last century, the localization of brain function has been represented by Brodmann areas, maps of the anatomic organization of the brain. They are used to broadly represent cortical structures with their given sensory-cognitive functions. In recent decades, the analysis of brain oscillations has become important in the correlation of brain functions. Moreover, spectral connectivity can provide further information on the dynamic connectivity between various structures. In addition, brain responses are dynamic in nature and structural localization is almost impossible, according to Luria (1966). Therefore, brain functions are very difficult to localize; hence, a combined analysis of oscillation and event-related coherences is required. In this study, a model termed as "CLAIR" is described to enrich and possibly replace the concept of the Brodmann areas. A CLAIR model with optimum function may take several years to develop, but this study sets out to lay its foundation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods: EEG neuroimaging (eLORETA) was utilized to compare current density distribution for 4 s epochs immediately preceding sleepwalking episode (from -4.0 s to 0 s) to the distribution during earlier 4 s epochs (from -8.0 s to -4.0 s) in 20 EEG segments from 15 patients. Results: Comparisons between eLORETA images revealed significant (t > 4.52; p < 0.05) brain activations before onset of sleepwalking, with greater current density within beta 3 frequency range (24-30 Hz) in Brodmann areas 33 and 24. Conclusions: Sleepwalking motor events are associated with arousal-related activation of cingulate motor area. Significance: These results support the notion of blurred boundaries between wakefulness and NREM sleep in sleepwalking. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: Twenty-one healthy, right-handed subjects performed kinesthetic motor imagery of opening their left hand, while threshold-based classification of beta-band desynchronization resulted in proprioceptive robotic feedback. The experiment consisted of two blocks in a cross-over design. The participants rated their perceived mental effort nine times per block. In the adaptive block, the threshold was adjusted on the basis of these ratings whereas adjustments were carried out at random in the other block. Electroencephalography was used to examine the cortical activation patterns during the training sessions. Results: The perceived mental effort was correlated with the difficulty threshold of neurofeedback training. Adaptive threshold-setting reduced mental effort and increased the classification accuracy and positive predictive value. This was paralleled by an inter-hemispheric cortical activation pattern in low frequency bands connecting the right frontal and left parietal areas. Optimal balance of mental effort was achieved at thresholds significantly higher than maximum classification accuracy. Conclusion: Rating of mental effort is a feasible approach for effective threshold-adaptation during neurofeedback training. Significance: Closed-loop adaptation of the neurofeedback difficulty level facilitates reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Alpha desynchronization and fronto-parietal connectivity during spatial working memory encoding deficits in ADHD: A simultaneous EEG-fMRI study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Alpha; Functional connectivity; Spatial working memory; Encoding; ADHD; EEG-fMRI	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SIMULTANEOUS EEG/FMRI; NEURONAL MECHANISMS	The underlying mechanisms of alpha band (8-12 Hz) neural oscillations are of importance to the functioning of attention control systems as well as to neuropsychiatric conditions that are characterized by deficits of that system, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objectives of the present study were to test if visual encoding-related alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) correlates with fronto-parieto-occipital connectivity, and whether this is disrupted in ADHD during spatial working memory (SWM) performance. We acquired EEG concurrently with fMRI in thirty boys (12-16 yrs. old, 15 with ADHD), during SWM encoding. Psychophysiological connectivity analyses indicated that alpha ERD during SWM encoding was associated with both occipital activation and fronto-parieto-occipital functional connectivity, a finding that expands on prior associations between alpha ERD and occipital activation. This finding provides novel support for the interpretation of alpha ERD (and the associated changes in occipital activation) as a phenomenon that involves, and perhaps arises as a result of, top-down network interactions. Alpha ERD was associated less strongly with occipital activity, but associated more strongly with fronto-parieto-occipital connectivity in ADHD, consistent with a compensatory attentional response. Additionally, we illustrate that degradation of EEG data quality by MRI-amplified motion artifacts is robust to existing cleaning algorithms and is significantly correlated with hyperactivity symptoms and the ADHD Combined Type diagnosis. We conclude that persistent motion-related MR artifacts in EEG data can increase variance and introduce bias in interpretation of group differences in populations characterized by hypermobility - a clear limitation of current-state EEG-fMRI methodology.

Based on this method, we have made some improvements to calculate the image complexity of images with different memory targets. The improved algorithm SIFT&AIM&K-means was validated by the results from memory experiments and an EEG study. The image complexity value of this algorithm is not only consistent with human's visual sense but also can be applied to compare images with different size and memory contents. Besides the measurement method, the results also prove the hypothesis about the relationship between the image complexity, visual attention and visual working memory capacity again. This hypothesis indicates that the increased image complexity reduces the ability to focus on important visual information due to limited visual working memory capacity.

Simultaneous recordings of detrusor pressure, external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyogram (EMG), cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), and single-unit activity in the PAG were made during repeated voiding induced by continuous infusion of saline into the bladder. The EEG cycled between synchronized, high-amplitude slow wave activity (SWA) and desynchronized low-amplitude fast activity similar to slow wave and 'activated' sleep-like brain states. During (SWA, 0.5-1.5 Hz synchronized oscillation of the EEG waveform) voiding became more irregular than in the 'activated' brain state (2-5 Hz low-amplitude desynchronized EEG waveform) and detrusor void pressure threshold, void volume threshold and the duration of bursting activity in the external urethral sphincter EMG were raised. The spontaneous firing rate of 23/52 neurons recorded within the caudal PAG and adjacent tegmentum was linked to the EEG state, with the majority of responsive cells (92%) firing more slowly during SWA. Almost a quarter of the cells recorded (12/52) showed phasic changes in firing rate that were linked to the occurrence of voids. Inhibition (n = 6), excitation (n = 4) or excitation/inhibition (n = 2) was seen. The spontaneous firing rate of 83% of the micturition-responsive cells was sensitive to changes in EEG state. In nine of the 12 responsive cells (75%) the responses were reduced during SWA. We propose that during different sleep-like brain states changes in urodynamic properties occur which may be linked to changing excitability of the micturition circuitry in the periaqueductal gray.

We have developed a new approach for non-invasive magnetic and electric source imaging of the SOZ (MSI-SOZ and ESI-SOZ) from ictal magnetoencephalography (MEG) and EEG recordings, using wavelet-based Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM) method. We compared the performance of MSI-SOZ and ESI-SOZ with interictal spike source localization (MSI-spikes and ESI-spikes) and clinical localization of the SOZ (i.e., based on iEEG or lesion topography, denoted as clinical-SOZ). Methods: A total of 46 MEG or EEG seizures from 13 patients were analyzed. wMEM was applied around seizure onset, centered on the frequency band showing the strongest power change. Principal component analysis applied to spatiotemporal reconstructed wMEM sources (0.4-1 s around seizure onset) identified the main spatial pattern of ictal oscillations. Qualitative sublobar concordance and quantitative measures of distance and spatial overlaps were estimated to compare MSI/ESI-SOZ with MSI/ESI-Spikes and clinical-SOZ. Results: MSI/ESI-SOZ were concordant with clinical-SOZ in 81% of seizures (MSI 90%, ESI 64%). MSI-SOZ was more accurate and identified sources closer to the clinical-SOZ (P = 0.012) and to MSI-Spikes (P = 0.040) as compared with ESI-SOZ. MSI/ESI-SOZ and MSI/ESI-Spikes did not differ in terms of concordance and distance from the clinical-SOZ. Conclusions: wMEM allows non-invasive localization of the SOZ from ictal MEG and EEG. MSI-SOZ performs better than ESI-SOZ. MSI/ESI-SOZ can provide important additional information to MSI/ESI-Spikes during presurgical evaluation. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Their significance, however, is hampered by the occasional presence of slow waves in healthy subjects, as well as the abundance of artefactual signals at low measurement frequencies. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of slow-wave oscillations in healthy subjects and to sharpen the management of possible measurement artifacts, in order to create a normative database for neurological patients.Methods:The authors analyzed magnetoencephalography recordings of spontaneous brain oscillations in 139 awake healthy adults. Sources of artifacts were first identified and suppressed by temporal extension of signal space separation method, and the remaining artifact components were projected out using signal space projection. Individual amplitude spectra were compared with the channel-level average spectra over all subjects.Results:Slow-wave oscillations deviating 2 standard deviations from the average spectrum were detected in 12 subjects (approximate to 9%). In 10 subjects, the oscillations were considered as normal physiological phenomena. Only two subjects showed activity that could have been interpreted as pathological: one subject with widespread parietal bilateral polyrhythmic slow-wave activity and one with focal rolandic 2.7-Hz slow-wave activity.Conclusions:The prevalence of slow-wave oscillations in a healthy adult population is low. Knowledge about their occurrence, however, is essential for interpreting their significance in brain diseases. Artifacts and benign oscillatory variants at slow frequencies have to be recognized.

Recently, increased pre-stimulus power in ongoing theta (5-8 Hz) and low beta (13-17 Hz) bands during encoding has been associated with enhanced memory performance. When a cue is presented before stimulus onset, encoding-related brain activations may be regarded as a sign of preparation for the upcoming stimulus. Here, we investigated whether the intention to encode the following stimulus into long-term memory affects these preparatory pre-stimulus activations during encoding. Two groups of 18 participants took part in a subsequent memory paradigm. Electroencephalogram(EEG) was recorded while participants were presented with a series of pictures, each one preceded by a cue, which were supposed to be classified according to animacy. One group was informed about the upcoming recognition task and therefore was enabled to develop the intention to encode the stimuli (intentional encoding), whereas the other group did not receive this information (incidental encoding). Afterwards, recognition of the pictures was tested. During intentional encoding only, power in theta and low beta bands was found to be significantly increased before the onset of pictures that were later remembered compared to later forgotten ones. Group comparisons confirmed greater memory-related power increases in the low beta band for intentional than incidental encoding. These findings indicate that oscillatory states that are associated with successful encoding can be initiated voluntarily if the intention to encode the stimuli is given. We therefore suggest low beta band activation before stimulus onset to be an indicator of memory-specific preparation for an upcoming stimulus. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Yet, only few neural markers of sensitive period plasticity in humans are known. Here we employed electroencephalographic recordings in a unique sample of twelve humans who had been blind from birth and regained sight through cataract surgery between four months and 16 years of age. Two additional control groups were tested: a group of visually impaired individuals without a history of total congenital blindness and a group of typically sighted individuals. The EEG was recorded while participants performed a visual discrimination task involving intact and scrambled biological motion stimuli. Posterior alpha and theta oscillations were evaluated. The three groups showed indistinguishable behavioral performance and in all groups evoked theta activity varied with biological motion processing. By contrast, alpha oscillatory activity was significantly reduced only in individuals with a history of congenital cataracts. These data document on the one hand brain mechanisms of functional recovery (related to theta oscillations) and on the other hand, for the first time, a sensitive period for the development of alpha oscillatory activity in humans.

Bioelectrical activity of the brain during performance of manipulative movements in women with different modal alpha-frequencies	VISNYK OF DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY-BIOLOGY MEDICINE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; individual mode of the alpha-rhythm; female testees; finger movements	POTASSIUM CHANNELS; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; CALCIUM	An important component of the general biological problem of coordinated activity of the brain's motor systems and of the executive apparatus during the implementation of motor functions is the question of the interconnection of electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm characteristics, above all alpha-rhythm, with control peculiarities of manipulative movements (MM). A test group consisting of 113 healthy right-handed women from the ages of 19 to 21 was divided into two groups according to the average magnitude of their individual modal alpha-frequency - groups with high and low values of individual modal alpha-frequency (I alpha F). The ideal time of a simple sensorimotor reaction and choice-point behavior as well as speed capabilities of nervous processes during the finger tapping test, and measures of the power spectrum of..G spectral components individually determined for each testee in quiescent intervals and while performing alternating movements by the fingers of the right hand were evaluated. Alternate female finger movements were accompanied by a decrease in the EEG alpha 2 -and alpha 3-activities in the posterior cortical areas, and beta 1-and gamma-activities in the frontal, temporal and central areas of the cortex compared with the same in the immobile state; they were also characterized by the generalized growth of theta-oscillations and local (in the frontal leads) - alpha 1- and beta 2-activities. Thus, in both groups of women surveyed the increase in activity of those cortical structures that ensure its implementation - sensory perception, motor start and motor programming commands and sense-motor coordination, was found. When MM are performed by women with a higher output alpha-frequency, they were characterized by more local changes in the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex. People with a lower modal alpha-frequency were characterized by somewhat less specific and differentiated features of the cortex activation. Alternating movements of fingers performed by women with low I alpha F were associated with higher EEG theta-, alpha 1-, alpha 2-activities, generally in the cortex, and alpha 3-, beta-and gamma-oscillations - in the posterior areas than in those with high I alpha F. Instead of this, a relatively lower power spectral EEG was recorded in the frontal leads of the range consisting of alpha 3-, beta- and gamma-oscillations. Intergroup differences found by us may indicate a higher status regarding a specific cortical tone, its readiness for activity and control of information processes in people with high I alpha F in comparison with those who had low I alpha F. It is natural that different levels of features of such activation systems achieve specific outcomes in testees with a different starting I alpha F. Women with a higher I alpha F had better speed characteristics of nervous processes.	[Morenko, A.

One of the several factors that may explain individual differences in delay-discounting is reward-processing. To study individual-differences in reward-processing, however, one needs to consider the heterogeneity of neural-activity at each reward-processing stage. Here using EEG, we separated reward-related neural activity into distinct reward-anticipation and reward-outcome stages using time-frequency characteristics. Thirty-seven individuals first completed a behavioral delay discounting task. Then reward-processing EEG activity was assessed using a separate reward-learning task, called a reward time-estimation task. During this EEG task, participants were instructed to estimate time duration and were provided performance feedback on a trial-by-trial basis. Participants received monetary-reward for accurate-performance on Reward trials, but not on No-Reward trials. Reward trials, relative to No-Reward trials, enhanced EEG activity during both reward-anticipation (including, cued locked delta power during cue-evaluation and pre-feedback alpha suppression during feedback-anticipation) and reward-outcome (including, feedback-locked delta, theta and beta power) stages. Moreover, all of these EEG indices correlated with behavioral performance in the time-estimation task, suggesting their essential roles in learning and adjusting performance to maximize winnings in a reward-learning situation. Importantly, enhanced EEG power during Reward trials, as reflected by stronger 1) pre-feedback alpha suppression, 2) feedback-locked theta and 3) feedback-locked beta, was associated with a greater preference for larger-but-delayed rewards in a separate, behavioral delay-discounting task. Results highlight the association between a stronger preference toward larger-but-delayed rewards and enhanced reward-processing. Moreover, our reward-processing EEG indices detail the specific stages of reward-processing where these associations occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the extent to which physiological connections between primary motor cortices are modulated during increasing levels of bimanual force generation in intact humans remains poorly understood. Here we studied coherence between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and the ipsilateral cortical silent period (iSP), two well-known measures of interhemispheric connectivity between motor cortices, during unilateral and bilateral 10%, 40%, and 70% of maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) into index finger abduction. We found that EEG-EEG coherence in the alpha frequency band decreased while the iSP area increased during bilateral compared with unilateral 40% and 70% but not 10% of MVC. Decreases in coherence in the alpha frequency band correlated with increases in the iSP area, and subjects who showed this inverse relation were able to maintain more steady bilateral muscle contractions. To further examine the relationship between the iSP and coherence we electrically stimulated the ulnar nerve at the wrist at the alpha frequency. Electrical stimulation increased coherence in the alpha frequency band and decreased the iSP area during bilateral 70% of MVC. Altogether, our findings demonstrate an inverse relation between alpha oscillations and the iSP during strong levels of bimanual force generation. We suggest that interactions between neural pathways mediating alpha oscillatory activity and transcallosal inhibition between motor cortices might contribute to the steadiness of strong bilateral isometric muscle contractions in intact humans.

A printed drawing of a maze including eight figures of common objects in specific placements, solved by connecting its entrance and exit points, allowed the subject's performance efficiency to be measured based on the number, position accuracy and/or identity of incidentally or intentionally learned and remembered objects. Meanwhile, EEG recordings from frontal, parietal and temporal derivations were obtained to determine the power values of the theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (3045 Hz) bands for each behavioural condition and derivation. Relative to the young adults, the mature adults generally showed lower absolute theta power values, mainly due to their low theta powers under the basal and incidental learning conditions, and higher absolute gamma power values in the frontal and temporal regions. Furthermore, higher theta band power in the frontal regions was related to higher performance efficiency in both incidental and intentional learning, regardless of the subjects' age. A significant negative correlation between the parameters of individual incidental or intentional learning performance and age was also found. Indeed, a differential accuracy of remembered information seems to be associated with age and incidental or intentional learning/memory testing conditions. These data support an increasing vulnerability of visuospatial learning abilities at mature ages and as ageing progresses.

For this purpose, a measure of the non-stationarity of a given time-frequency representation (TFR) was applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. EEG activity was acquired from 20 schizophrenic (SCH) patients and 20 healthy controls while they underwent a three-stimulus auditory oddball task. The Degree of Stationarity (DS), a measure of the non-stationarity of the TFR, was computed using the continuous wavelet transform. DS was calculated for both the baseline [-300 0] ms and active task [150 550] ms windows of a P300 auditory oddball task. Results showed a statistically significant increase (p<0.05) in non-stationarity for controls during the cognitive task in the central region, while less widespread statistically significant differences were obtained for SCH patients, especially in the beta-2 and gamma bands. Our findings support the relevance of DS as a means to study cerebral processing in SCH. Furthermore, the lack of statistically significant changes in DS for SCH patients suggests an abnormal reorganization of neural dynamics during an oddball task.

THE HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY DURING EXTENDED WAKEFULNESS IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPTH OF THE ENSUING SLEEP IN C57BL6 MICE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						theta power; autonomic nervous system; heart rate variability; sleep propensity; parasympathetic; vagal	SLOW-WAVE MAGNITUDE; CARDIOVASCULAR NEURAL REGULATION; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; ARTERIAL BAROREFLEX; BLOOD-PRESSURE; EEG; DEPRIVATION; HOMEOSTASIS; MARKERS; WAKING	This study aimed to test the hypothesis that, during extended wakefulness, parasympathetic activity is associated with the depth of the subsequent recovery sleep in mice. Fourteen male C57BL/6 mice were implanted with electrodes for sleep recording. Continuous spectral analysis was performed on the electroencephalogram (EEG) to obtain theta power (6-9 Hz) and delta power (0-4 Hz), as well as the R-R interval signals in order to quantify the high-frequency power (HF) and normalized low-frequency power (LF%) that are used to assess parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, respectively. All animals underwent a sleep deprivation experiment and a control experiment (6-h intervention and 1-h recovery period) on two separate days. During sleep deprivation, HF and theta power during wakefulness were significantly higher than during the control wakefulness after the second hour and first hour, respectively. During recovery non-rapid eye movement sleep, there was a rebound in sleep time and delta power as well as an elevation in HF relative to control post-intervention sleep. Both the rise in HF and theta power during extended wakefulness were found to be positively correlated with the delta power rebound. Furthermore, the HF change during extended wakefulness was also correlated with the amount of sleep loss and the enhancement of waking theta power. Our finding suggests that waking parasympathetic activity intimately reflects the cumulative sleep pressure, suggesting a potential role to be an autonomic marker for sleep propensity. (C) 2016 IBRO.

J	Lin, WL; Shih, YL				Lin, Wei-Lun; Shih, Yi-Ling			Designing EEG Neurofeedback Procedures to Enhance Open-ended versus Closed-ended Creative Potentials	CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article							PROCESS THEORY ACCOUNT; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; MEMORY	Recent empirical evidence demonstrated that open-ended creativity (which refers to creativity measures that require various and numerous responses, such as divergent thinking) correlated with alpha brain wave activation, whereas closed-ended creativity (which refers to creativity measures that ask for one final correct answer, such as insight problem solving) was related to larger variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) differences between alpha and beta waves. This study designed two EEG neurofeedback procedures to examine their training effects on open- versus closed-ended creative potentials. In the alpha-enhancement condition, participants were reinforced to elevate only their alpha frequencies by auditory feedback for 10 sessions. In the alpha-transformation condition, enhancement and suppression of the signal tone (and hence, the appearance and disappearance of alpha waves) were both practiced. Pre- and posttest comparisons indicated that, compared to the active contrast condition, the alpha-enhancement practice improved only open-ended creativity performance. The alpha-transformation training enhanced closed-ended creativity performance, which was first demonstrated in the literature, and simultaneously facilitated open-ended creativity performances. In addition, changes in brain wave patterns by training positively correlated with change in predicted creativity performances. All of these results were of medium to large effect sizes. The effectiveness of these EEG neurofeedback procedures for creativity training was implied and discussed.

We previously reported that the region of epileptic brain generating focal seizures, i.e., the seizure onset zone (SOZ), is functionally isolated from surrounding brain regions in focal neocortical epilepsy. The modulatory effect of behavioral state on the spatial and spectral scales over which the reduced functional connectivity occurs, however, is unclear. Here we use simultaneous sleep staging from scalp EEG with intracranial EEG recordings from medial temporal lobe to investigate how behavioral state modulates the spatial and spectral scales of local field potential synchrony in focal epileptic hippocampus. The local field spectral power and linear correlation between adjacent electrodes provide measures of neuronal population synchrony at different spatial scales, similar to 1 and 10 mm, respectively. Our results show increased connectivity inside the SOZ and low connectivity between electrodes in SOZ and outside the SOZ. During slow-wave sleep, we observed decreased connectivity for ripple and fast ripple frequency bands within the SOZ at the 10 mm spatial scale, while the local synchrony remained high at the 1 mm spatial scale. Further study of these phenomena may prove useful for SOZ localization and help understand seizure generation, and the functional deficits seen in epileptic eloquent cortex.

Theta EEG neurofeedback benefits early consolidation of motor sequence learning	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Procedural; Motor learning; Neurofeedback; EEG; Consolidation	FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; EPISODIC MEMORY; SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RETRIEVAL; ATTENTION; SPINDLES; NETWORK	Procedural learning is subject to consolidation processes believed to depend on the modulation of functional connections involved in representing the acquired skill. While sleep provides the most commonly studied framework for such consolidation processes, posttraining modulation of oscillatory brain activity may also impact on plasticity processes. Under the hypothesis that consolidation of motor learning is associated with theta band activity, we used EEG neurofeedback (NFB) to enable participants to selectively increase either theta or beta power in their EEG spectra following the acquisition phase of motor sequence learning. We tested performance on a motor task before and after training, right after the NFB session to assess immediate NFB effects, 1 day after NFB to assess interaction between NFB effects and overnight sleep-dependent stabilization, and 1 week after the initial session, to assess the effects of NFB on long-term stabilization of motor training. We also explored the extent of the influence of single-electrode NFB on EEG recorded across the scalp. Results revealed a significantly greater improvement in performance immediately after NFB in the theta group than in the beta group. This effect continued for testing up to 1 week following training. Across participants, post-NFB improvement correlated positively with theta/beta ratio change achieved during NFB. Additionally, NFB was found to cause widespread band-power modulation beyond the electrode used for feedback. Thus, upregulating postlearning theta power may yield contributions to the immediate performance and subsequent consolidation of an acquired motor skill.

During PIOs, aggressive over-controlling on the part of the pilot in order to overcome a perceived lack of control can lead to complete loss of aircraft control. This study shows data recorded from a Cognionics dry electrode system during actual flight exercises can be used on a second-to-second basis to classify whether a pilot was undergoing a PIO event or if a PIO was imminent. If such PIO predictions could be made with adequate accuracy and robustness in real-time, they could form the basis of systems aimed at detecting and/or mitigating PIOs.

It contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A and sigma-1 agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) plus beta-carboline alkaloids with monoamine-oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting properties. Although the psychoactive effects of ayahuasca have commonly been attributed solely to agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor, the molecular target of classical psychedelics, this has not been tested experimentally. Here we wished to study the contribution of the 5-HT2A receptor to the neurophysiological and psychological effects of ayahuasca in humans. We measured drug-induced changes in spontaneous brain oscillations and subjective effects in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study involving the oral administration of ayahuasca (0.75 mg DMT/kg body weight) and the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (40 mg). Twelve healthy, experienced psychedelic users (5 females) participated in four experimental sessions in which they received the following drug combinations: placebo + placebo, placebo +ayahuasca, ketanserin +placebo and ketanserin +ayahuasca. Ayahuasca induced EEG power decreases in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. Current density in alpha-band oscillations in parietal and occipital cortex was inversely correlated with the intensity of visual imagery induced by ayahuasca. Pretreatment with ketanserin inhibited neurophysiological modifications, reduced the correlation between alpha and visual effects, and attenuated the intensity of the subjective experience. These findings suggest that despite the chemical complexity of ayahuasca, 5-HT2A activation plays a key role in the neurophysiological and visual effects of ayahuasca in humans.

While the impact of BF on cortical EEG or LFP signals has been extensively documented, surprisingly little is known about LFP activity within BF. Based on bilateral recordings from rats in their home cage, we describe endogenous LFP oscillations in the BF during quiet wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep (SWS) states. Using coherence and Granger causality methods, we characterize directional influences between BF and visual cortex (VC) during each of these states. We observed pronounced BF gamma activity particularly during wakefulness, as well as to a lesser extent during SWS and REM. During wakefulness, this BF gamma activity exerted a directional influence on VC that was associated with cortical excitation. During SWS but not REM, there was also a robust directional gamma band influence of BF on VC. In all three states, directional influence in the gamma band was only present in BF to VC direction and tended to be regulated specifically within each brain hemisphere. Locality of gamma band LFPs to the BF was confirmed by demonstration of phase locking of local spiking activity to the gamma cycle. We report novel aspects of endogenous BF LFP oscillations and their relationship to cortical LFP signals during sleep and wakefulness. We link our findings to known aspects of GABAergic BF networks that likely underlie gamma band LFP activations, and show that the Granger causality analyses can faithfully recapitulate many known attributes of these networks.

However, the neural response to alerting cues is less explored, as is how this response is affected by healthy aging. Using scalp EEG, we examined how visual cortical alpha activity relates to working memory performance. Younger (20-30 years) and older (60-70 years) participants were presented with a visual alerting cue uninformative of the position or size of a lateralized working memory array. Older adults showed longer response times overall and reduced accuracy when memory load was high. Older adults had less consistent cue-evoked alpha phase resetting than younger adults, which predicted worse performance. Alpha phase prior to memory array presentation predicted response time, but the relationship between phase and response time was weaker in older adults. These results suggest that changes in alpha phase dynamics, especially prior to presentation of task-relevant stimuli, potentially contribute to age-related cognitive decline. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Notably, administration of the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, to healthy human subjects has psychotogenic action, producing both positive and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. NMDARs have multiple subtypes, but the subtypes through which ketamine produces its psychotogenic effects are not known. Here we address this question using quantitative data that characterize ketamine's ability to block different NMDAR subtypes. Our calculations indicate that, at a concentration that has psychotogenic action in humans, ketamine blocks a substantial fraction of GluN2C subunit-containing receptors but has less effect on GluN2A-, GluN2B-, and GluN2D-containing receptors. Thus, GluN2C-containing receptors may have preferential involvement in psychotic states produced by ketamine. A separate line of experiments also points to a special role for GluN2C. That work demonstrates the ability of NMDAR antagonists to mimic the elevation in the awake-state delta frequency EEG power that occurs in schizophrenia. Physiological experiments in rodents show that NMDAR antagonists generate delta oscillations by their action on the GluN2C-containing NMDARs that are prevalent in the thalamus. Optogenetic experiments suggest that such oscillations could contribute to symptoms of schizophrenia.

J	Begus, K; Gliga, T; Southgate, V				Begus, Katarina; Gliga, Teodora; Southgate, Victoria			Infants' preferences for native speakers are associated with an expectation of information	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						social selectivity; infants; information seeking; theta oscillations; native speakers	THETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; DIRECTED SPEECH; LANGUAGE; MEMORY; EEG; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; RELIABILITY; RECEIVE; HUMANS	Humans' preference for others who share our group membership is well documented, and this heightened valuation of in-group members seems to be rooted in early development. Before 12 mo of age, infants already show behavioral preferences for others who evidence cues to same-group membership such as race or native language, yet the function of this selectivity remains unclear. We examine one of these social biases, the preference for native speakers, and propose that this preference may result from infants' motivation to obtain information and the expectation that interactions with native speakers will provide better opportunities for learning. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured EEG theta activity, a neural rhythm shown to index active and selective preparation for encoding information in adults. In study 1, we established that 11-mo-old infants exhibit an increase in theta activation in situations when they can expect to receive information. We then used this neural measure of anticipatory theta activity to explore the expectations of 11-mo-olds when facing social partners who either speak the infants' native language or a foreign tongue (study 2). A larger increase in theta oscillations was observed when infants could expect to receive information from the native speaker, indicating that infants were preparing to learn information from the native speaker to a greater extent than from the foreign speaker. While previous research has demonstrated that infants prefer to interact with knowledgeable others, the current experiments provide evidence that such an information-seeking motive may also underpin infants' demonstrated preference for native speakers.

This study identified and categorized kindling stages based on their electrophysiological features through processing extracellular field potentials of Amygdala rapid kindling. Methods: Thirteen Wistar rats (200 +/- 10 g) were divided into 2 groups including kindle (n=7) and sham (n=6) and respectively underwent an amygdala rapid kindling and placebo stimulation. EEG signals in each stage were classified into 7 bands: delta (0-4Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), low beta (12-16 Hz), mid beta (16-20 Hz), high beta (20-28 Hz) and gamma (28-40 Hz). Spectral power and power of sub bands of stage 3 (localized seizure stage (SS)) and stages 4 and 5 (generalized SSs) were compared between kindling and sham groups. Result: Spectral analyses showed larger spikes in delta and theta subbands in the stages of 3,4, and 5 of kindling, compared with sham animals. Generalized SSs contained more spikes than the localized SS in the kindling. Kindling process was accompanied by reduction in high beta and gamma oscillations and increase in delta sub band power which were significant in the generalized SSs. The theta/alpha ratio in the localized SS was higher than the generalized SSs and sham group, but the difference with the sham group was statistically significant. Conclusion: Our results showed that reduced high beta and gamma and increased delta oscillations power are associated with behavioral seizure progression. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However this increase was less expressed in the cannabinoid group than in the control group. In abstinent cannabinoid users the spectral peak frequency of alpha activity was decreased in the frontal electrodes during the cognitive task perfoiniance as compared to control subjects.

Methods: We generated animation movies showing electrocorticography (ECoG) amplitudes at eight spectral frequency bands across 1.0-116 Hz, every 0.1 s, on three-dimensional surface images of 10 children who underwent epilepsy surgery. We measured the onset, intensity, and variance of each band amplitude change at given nonepileptic regions separately from those at affected regions. We also determined the presence of differential ECoG changes depending on the brain anatomy. Results: Within 20 s following injection of midazolam, beta (16-31.5 Hz) and sigma (12-15.5 Hz) activities began to be multifocally augmented with increased variance in amplitude at each site. Beta-sigma augmentation was most prominent within the association neocortex. Augmentation of low-delta activity (1.0-1.5 Hz) was relatively modest and confined to the somatosensory-motor region. Conversely, injection of midazolam induced attenuation of theta (4.0-7.5 Hz) and high-gamma (64-116 Hz) activities. Conclusions: Our observations support the notion that augmentation beta-sigma and delta activities reflects cortical deactivation or inactivation, whereas theta and high-gamma activities contribute to maintenance of consciousness. The effects of midazolam on the dynamics of cortical oscillations differed across regions.

Time evolution of interhemispheric coupling in a model of focal neocortical epilepsy in mice	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; LEFT-RIGHT ASYMMETRY; TETANUS TOXIN; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; EEG; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; INHIBITION; NEUROTOXIN; RAT	Epilepsy is characterized by substantial network rearrangements leading to spontaneous seizures and little is known on how an epileptogenic focus impacts on neural activity in the contralateral hemisphere. Here, we used a model of unilateral epilepsy induced by injection of the synaptic blocker tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Local field potential (LFP) signals were simultaneously recorded from both hemispheres of each mouse in acute phase (peak of toxin action) and chronic condition (completion of TeNT effects). To characterize the neural electrical activities the corresponding LFP signals were analyzed with several methods of time series analysis. For the epileptic mice, the spectral analysis showed that TeNT determines a power redistribution among the different neurophysiological bands in both acute and chronic phases. Using linear and nonlinear interdependence measures in both time and frequency domains, it was found in the acute phase that TeNT injection promotes a reduction of the interhemispheric coupling for high frequencies (12-30 Hz) and small time lag (<20 ms), whereas an increase of the coupling is present for lowfrequencies (0.5-4 Hz) and long time lag (>40 ms). Onthe other hand, the chronic period is characterized by a partial or complete recovery of the interhemispheric interdependence level. Granger causality test and symbolic transfer entropy indicate a greater driving influence of the TeNT-injected side on activity in the contralateral hemisphere in the chronic phase. Lastly, based on experimental observations, we built a computational model of LFPs to investigate the role of the ipsilateral inhibition and exicitatory interhemispheric connections in the dampening of the interhemispheric coupling. The time evolution of the interhemispheric coupling in such a relevant model of epilepsy has been addressed here.

Differential Functionality of Right and Left Parietal Activity in Controlling a Motor Vehicle	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						driving; attention; heading error; parietal lobe; alpha rhythm; lane deviation; steering wheel	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL CONTROL; DRIVING PERFORMANCE; STEERING CONTROL; NEURAL SYSTEMS; TASK; EEG; MODULATION	Driving a motor vehicle is an inherently complex task that requires robust control to avoid catastrophic accidents. Drivers must maintain their vehicle in the middle of the travel lane to avoid high speed collisions with other traffic. Interestingly, while a vehicles lane deviation (LD) is critical, studies have demonstrated that heading error (HE) is one of the primary variables drivers use to determine a steering response, which directly controls the position of the vehicle in the lane. In this study, we examined how the brain represents the dichotomy between control/response parameters (heading, reaction time (RT), and steering wheel corrections) and task-critical parameters (LD). Specifically, we examined electroencephalography (EEG) alpha band power (8-13 Hz) from estimated sources in right and left parietal regions, and related this activity to four metrics of driving performance. Our results demonstrate differential task involvement between the two hemispheres: right parietal activity was most closely related to LD, whereas left parietal activity was most closely related to HE, RT and steering responses. Furthermore, HE, RT and steering wheel corrections increased over the duration of the experiment while LD did not. Collectively, our results suggest that the brain uses differential monitoring and control strategies in the right and left parietal regions to control a motor vehicle. Our results suggest that the regulation of this control changes over time while maintaining critical task performance. These results are interpreted in two complementary theoretical frameworks: the uncontrolled manifold and compensatory control theories. The central tenet of these frameworks permits performance variability in parameters (i.e., HE, RT and steering) so far as it does not interfere with critical task execution (i.e., LD). Our results extend the existing research by demonstrating potential neural substrates for this phenomenon which may serve as potential targets for brain-computer interfaces that predict poor driving performance.

Proposed amplifier design may be used at preamplifier stage of EEG, Radio/TV receivers and other audible frequency range communication systems. Combination of Q1-Q2 transistors in the proposed design constitutes PNP Sziklai pair whereas Q2-Q3 together acts as NPN Sziklai pair. Circuit successfully amplifies audio range signals swinging in 1 mu V-10mV range. It produces high voltage gain (190.95), current gain greater than unity (7.208), 250.83 KHz bandwidth, low harmonic distortion (0.817%) and can be tuned in 41Hz-250KHz frequency range. Resistance RA in the design is essential to maintain its voltage/current amplification property whereas R-EX can be optionally used. Proposed circuit is free from the poor response problem of small-signal Darlington pair amplifiers at higher frequencies and narrow bandwidth restrictions of recently announced PNP and NPN driven small-signal Sziklai pair amplifiers. Tuning performance, variation of voltage gain with frequency and different biasing resistances, small-signal AC analysis, harmonic distortion, temperature dependency of performance parameters and input/output noises of the circuit are widely discussed.

Different coupling modes mediate cortical cross-frequency interactions	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cross-frequency coupling; Phase-amplitude coupling; Oscillatory alpha-gamma interplay; Intrinsic coupling modes; Transcranial alternating current stimulation; Entrainment	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; THETA; ENTRAINMENT; EEG; COHERENCE; CORTEX	Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been suggested to constitute a highly flexible mechanism for cortical information gating and processing, giving rise to conscious perception and various higher cognitive functions in humans. In particular, it might provide an elegant tool for information integration across several spatiotemporal scales within nested or coupled neuronal networks. However, it is currently unknown whether low-frequency (theta/alpha) or high-frequency gamma oscillations orchestrate cross-frequency interactions, raising the question of who is master and who is slave. While correlative evidence suggested that at least two distinct CFC modes exist, namely, phase-amplitude-coupling (PAC) and amplitude-envelope correlations (AEC), it is currently unknown whether they subserve distinct cortical functions. Novel non-invasive brain stimulation tools, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), now provide the unique opportunity to selectively entrain the low-or high-frequency component and study subsequent effects on CFC. Here, we demonstrate the differential modulation of CFC during selective entrainment of alpha or gamma oscillations. Our results reveal that entrainment of the low-frequency component increased PAC, where gamma power became preferentially locked to the trough of the alpha oscillation, while gamma-band entrainment enhanced AECs and reduced alpha power. These results provide causal evidence for the functional role of coupled alpha and gamma oscillations for visual processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Unilateral single freeze lesions to the S1 region (SFLS1R) were made in postnatal day 0-1 pups to induce a neocortical microgyrus in the right cortical hemisphere. Continuous 24-h recordings with intracranial EEG electrodes and behavioral tests were performed in adult SFLS1R and sham-control mice to assess neurologic status. Results: A high percentage of adult SFLS1R animals (89%, 40/45) exhibited at least one or more spontaneous nonconvulsive seizure events over the course of 24 h. Of these animals, 60% (27/45) presented with a chronic seizure state that was persistent throughout the recording session, consisting of bursts of rhythmic high-amplitude spike-wave activities and primarily occurring during periods of slow-wave sleep. In comparison, none of the control, age-matched, mice (0/12) developed seizures. The epileptic discharge pattern closely resembled a pattern of continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) of the human syndrome described as an electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES). Key findings in the SFLS1R model indicated that the observed CSWS (1) were more prevalent in female (18/23) versus male (9/22, p < 0.05), (2) were strongest in the right S1 region although generalized to other brain regions, (3) were associated with significant cognitive and behavioral deficits, (4) were temporarily alleviated by ethosuximide treatment or optogenetic activation of cortical c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic neurons, and (5) theta and alpha band rhythms may play a key role in the generalization of spike-wave activities. Significance: This is the first report of an in vivo animal FCD model that induces chronic spontaneous electrographic brain seizures. Further characterization of the abnormal oscillations in this mouse model may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of CSWS/ESES.

Prestimulus alpha power influences response criterion in a detection task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Sensation/perception; EEG; Young adults; Psychophysics; Visual processes	EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS PREDICT; SPATIAL ATTENTION; PHASE; BAND; SUPPRESSION; DISCRIMINATION; PERFORMANCE; INCREASES; PERCEPTION	Recent studies have linked variability in near-threshold stimulus detection to fluctuations in the prestimulus EEG alpha power (alpha, similar to 8-12 Hz). Typically, these studies rely on hit rate as a measure of detection performance and show that detection is enhanced when a power is low compared to when it is high. However, hit rates are determined by both sensitivity to the stimulus and the placement of the response criterion. Here, we investigated the relationships between prestimulus alpha power and variability in these two measures on a single-trial basis. We confirm earlier reports that detection is inversely related to power in the individual alpha-frequency band. However, our results show a stronger relationship between alpha power and response criterion than with sensitivity. Higher alpha power was related to a more conservative response criterion (i.e., more "no" responses). A response criterion that varies depending on alpha power might help to optimize performance in an excited state and protect against false positives in a relatively disengaged state.

Several studies have shown behavioral effects of tES, but stimulation artifacts complicate the simultaneous investigation of neural activity with EEG or MEG. Here, we first show for EEG and MEG, that contrary to previous assumptions, artifacts do not simply reflect stimulation currents, but that heartbeat and respiration non-linearly modulate stimulation artifacts. These modulations occur irrespective of the stimulation frequency, i.e. during both transcranial alternating and direct current stimulations (tACS and tDCS). Second, we show that, although at first sight previously employed artifact rejection methods may seem to remove artifacts, data are still contaminated by non-linear stimulation artifacts. Because of their complex nature and dependence on the subjects' physiological state, these artifacts are prone to be mistaken as neural entrainment. In sum, our results uncover non-linear tES artifacts, show that current techniques fail to fully remove them, and pave the way for new artifact rejection methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Voluntary tongue movements are finely controlled by communications between the cortex and tongue muscles. A large number of previous studies have reported that functional connections between the cortex and muscles are reflected by cortico-muscular coherence (CMC), which is measured between electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) and surface electromyography (EMG), during isometric finger movements in humans. Recent studies indicate that CMC reflects a bi-directional flow of information between the cortex and fingers, along the descending corticospinal pathway and with ascending sensory feedback. However, CMC for the tongue has not been well-studied, despite the fact that increased knowledge would be helpful in understanding cortical entrainment of voluntary tongue movements. Highlight: CMC was recently demonstrated using whole-head MEG signals and EMG signals from both sides of the tongue. CMC was reflected over both hemispheres, for each side of the tongue, and at two frequency bands during isometric tongue protrusions: the beta band at 15-35 Hz and a low-frequency band at 2-10 Hz. Conclusion: This review provides a detailed description of the functional connection between the bilateral cortex and each side of the tongue during sustained tongue movements in humans, using CMC analyses.

A novel electroencephalography-based tool for objective assessment of network dynamics activated by nociceptive stimuli	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							SUBJECTIVE PAIN PERCEPTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; EEG RESPONSES; HEAT; COMPONENTS; CORTEX; NEUROPHYSIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS	BackgroundPain perception is typically assessed using subjective measures; an objective measure of the response to pain would be valuable. In this study, Brain Network Activation (BNA), a novel multivariate pattern analysis and scoring algorithm, was applied to event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by cortical responses to brief heat stimuli. Objectives of this study were to evaluate the utility of BNA as a quantitative and qualitative measure of cortical response to pain. MethodsContact Heat Evoked Potentials (CHEPs) data were collected from 17 healthy, right-handed volunteers (10M, 7F) using 5 different temperatures (35, 41, 46, 49 and 52 degrees C). A set of spatio-temporal activity patterns common to all the subjects in the group (Reference Brain Network Model; RBNM) was generated using the BNA algorithm, based on evoked responses at 52 degrees C. ResultsFrame by frame unfolding' of the brain network across timeshowed qualitative differences between responses to painful and non-painful stimuli. Brain network activation scores were shown to be a better indicator of the individual's sensitivity to pain when compared to subjective pain ratings. Additionally, BNA scores correlated significantly with temperature, demonstrated good test-retest reliability, as well as a high degree of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in correctly categorizing subjects who reported stimuli as painful. ConclusionsThese results may provide evidence that the multivariate analysis performed with BNA may be useful as a quantitative, temporally sensitive tool for assessment of pain perception.

J	Simon, S; Mukamel, R				Simon, Shiri; Mukamel, Roy			Power modulation of electroencephalogram mu and beta frequency depends on perceived level of observed actions	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Action observation; conscious perception; electroencephalogram; mirror neuron system	MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; ACTION RECOGNITION; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; MANIPULATABLE OBJECTS; INFERIOR PARIETAL; PREMOTOR CORTEX; ALPHA-BAND; EEG; PERCEPTION	IntroductionThe ability to understand actions and intentions of others is of great importance to social relationships and is associated with the mirror neuron system of the human brain. Whether conscious perception of specific actions is necessary to trigger activity in this system, or alternatively whether this response is independent of conscious perception is not known. MethodsWe addressed this issue by rendering videos of right hand movements invisible to conscious perception, and measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) power suppression in the mu (8-13Hz) and beta (15-25Hz) range as index corresponding to the magnitude of mirror neuron activity. ResultsIn the beta range over bilateral sensorimotor sites, we find that suppression indices follow the reported perceptual level of subjects with stronger suppression for consciously perceived trials. Furthermore, in the nonperceived trials, oscillation power is significantly suppressed relative to baseline. In the low mu range (8-10Hz), oscillation power over the left sensorimotor site is significantly more suppressed in the consciously perceived versus nonperceived trials. ConclusionsOur data suggest that the intensity of mirror system responses during action observation decreases with the observers' perception level yet remains significant during observation of invisible actions. Such subliminal activity could help explain phenomena such as covert imitation.

Modulation of mGlu2 Receptors, but Not PDE10A Inhibition Normalizes Pharmacologically-Induced Deviance in Auditory Evoked Potentials and Oscillations in Conscious Rats	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A INHIBITORS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; ACOUSTIC STARTLE; GATING DEFICITS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; P50; GLUTAMATE; DOPAMINE; AGONIST	Improvement of cognitive impairments represents a high medical need in the development of new antipsychotics. Aberrant EEG gamma oscillations and reductions in the P1/N1 complex peak amplitude of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) are neurophysiological biomarkers for schizophrenia that indicate disruption in sensory information processing. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase (i.e. PDE10A) and activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2) signaling are believed to provide antipsychotic efficacy in schizophrenia, but it is unclear whether this occurs with cognition-enhancing potential. The present study used the auditory paired click paradigm in passive awake Sprague Dawley rats to 1) model disruption of AEP waveforms and oscillations as observed in schizophrenia by peripheral administration of amphetamine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist phencyclidine (PCP); 2) confirm the potential of the antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine to attenuate these disruptions; 3) evaluate the potential of mGluR2 agonist LY404039 and PDE10 inhibitor PQ-10 to improve AEP deficits in both the amphetamine and PCP models. PCP and amphetamine disrupted auditory information processing to the first click, associated with suppression of the P1/N1 complex peak amplitude, and increased cortical gamma oscillations. Risperidone and olanzapine normalized PCP and amphetamine-induced abnormalities in AEP waveforms and aberrant gamma/alpha oscillations, respectively. LY404039 increased P1/N1 complex peak amplitudes and potently attenuated the disruptive effects of both PCP and amphetamine on AEPs amplitudes and oscillations. However, PQ-10 failed to show such effect in either models. These outcomes indicate that modulation of the mGluR2 results in effective restoration of abnormalities in AEP components in two widely used animal models of psychosis, whereas PDE10A inhibition does not.

However, ongoing brain dynamics could influence the subsequent perceptual organization of the speech, to an as yet unknown extent. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed EEG oscillatory activity before and immediately after the repetitive auditory presentation of words inducing the so-called verbal transformation effect (VTE), or spontaneous alternation of meanings due to its rapid repetition. Subjects indicated whether the meaning of the bistable word changed or not. For the Reversal more than for the Stable condition, results show a pre-stimulus local alpha desynchronization (300-50 ms), followed by an early post-stimulus increase of local beta synchrony (0-80 ms), and then a late increase and decrease of local alpha (200-340 ms) and beta (360-440 ms) synchrony respectively. Additionally, the ERPs showed that reversal positivity (RP) and reversal negativity components (RN), along with a late positivity complex (LPC) correlate with switching between verbal forms. Our results show how the ongoing dynamics brain is actively involved in the perceptual organization of the speech, destabilizing verbal perceptual states, and facilitating the perceptual regrouping of the elements composing the linguistic auditory stimulus.

Removing entorhinal cortex input to the dentate gyrus does not impede low frequency oscillations, an EEG-biomarker of hippocampal epileptogenesis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; RETROGRADE-AMNESIA; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; KNIFE CUTS; BRAIN; SEIZURE; MEMORY; STIMULATION; HZ; REORGANIZATION	Following prolonged perforant pathway stimulation (PPS) in rats, a seizure-free "latent period" is observed that lasts around 3 weeks. During this time, aberrant neuronal activity occurs, which has been hypothesized to contribute to the generation of an "epileptic" network. This study was designed to 1) examine the pathological network activity that occurs in the dentate gyrus during the latent period, and 2) determine whether suppressing this activity by removing the main input to the dentate gyrus could stop or prolong epileptogenesis. Immediately following PPS, continuous video-EEG monitoring was used to record spontaneous neuronal activity and detect seizures. During the latent period, low frequency oscillations (LFOs), occurring at a rate of approximately 1 Hz, were detected in the dentate gyrus of all rats that developed epilepsy. LFO incidence was apparently random, but often decreased in the hour preceding a spontaneous seizure. Bilateral transection of the perforant pathway did not impact the incidence of hippocampal LFOs, the latency to epilepsy, or hippocampal neuropathology. Our main findings are: 1) LFOs are a reliable biomarker of hippocampal epileptogenesis, and 2) removing entorhinal cortex input to the hippocampus neither reduces the occurrence of LFOs nor has a demonstrable antiepileptogenic effect.

Short Meditation Trainings Enhance Non-REM Sleep Low-Frequency Oscillations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; PSYCHOMETRIC EVALUATION; EEG; BRAIN; VALIDATION; ATTENTION; SCALE; NIGHT; PRACTITIONERS; CONSCIOUSNESS	Study Objectives We have recently shown higher parietal-occipital EEG gamma activity during sleep in long-term meditators compared to meditation-naive individuals. This gamma increase was specific for NREM sleep, was present throughout the entire night and correlated with meditation expertise, thus suggesting underlying long-lasting neuroplastic changes induced through prolonged training. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroplastic changes acutely induced by 2 intensive days of different meditation practices in the same group of practitioners. We also repeated baseline recordings in a meditation-naive cohort to account for time effects on sleep EEG activity. Design High-density EEG recordings of human brain activity were acquired over the course of whole sleep nights following intervention. Setting Sound-attenuated sleep research room. Patients or Participants Twenty-four long-term meditators and twenty-four meditation-naive controls. Interventions Two 8-h sessions of either a mindfulness-based meditation or a form of meditation designed to cultivate compassion and loving kindness, hereafter referred to as compassion meditation. Measurements and Results We found an increase in EEG low-frequency oscillatory activities (1-12 Hz, centered around 7-8 Hz) over prefrontal and left parietal electrodes across whole night NREM cycles. This power increase peaked early in the night and extended during the third cycle to high-frequencies up to the gamma range (25-40 Hz). There was no difference in sleep EEG activity between meditation styles in long-term meditators nor in the meditation naive group across different time points. Furthermore, the prefrontal-parietal changes were dependent on meditation life experience. Conclusions This low-frequency prefrontal-parietal activation likely reflects acute, meditation-related plastic changes occurring during wakefulness, and may underlie a top-down regulation from frontal and anterior parietal areas to the posterior parietal and occipital regions showing chronic, long-lasting plastic changes in long-term meditators.

Previously, no evidence or method was apparent to validate the two competing models, the evoked model and the oscillation model. One argument is whether the pre-stimulus brain oscillation could influence the following ERP. This study carried out an innovative visual oddball task experiment to investigate the dynamic process of visual evoked potentials. A period of stable oscillations of specified dominant frequencies and initial phases, i.e. the steady-state baseline, would be induced before responses to transient stimuli of different contrasts, which could overcome the artifact problem caused by the 'sorting' method. The result first revealed a 'three-period-transition' for the generation of visual evoked potentials by an objective decomposition. The ERP almost retained the preceding oscillation during the first period, provided an unstable negative potential in the second period, and generated the N1 component in the third period. The cross term analysis showed that the evoked model couldn't be the whole explanation for the ERP generation. Furthermore, the component analysis revealed that the N1 latency was sensitive to the initial phase under the low stimulus contrast (supporting the oscillation model) but not under the high stimulus contrast (supporting the evoked model). It demonstrated that the external stimulus contrast is a significant factor deciding the explicit model for ERPs. Our method and preliminary results may help reconcile the previous, seemly contradictory findings on the ERP mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Wavelet packet decomposition EEG on the basic frequency rhythms	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-UPRAVLENIE VYCHISLITELNAJA TEHNIKA I INFORMATIKA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CONTROL AND COMPUTER SCIENCE			Russian	Article						wavelet analysis; wavelet packet analysis; electroencephalogram; rhythms of EEG; high-frequency components EEG		This work is devoted to the study of signal electroencephalogram (EEG) by wavelet analysis methods. Traditionally for study of EEG, statistical methods and methods of the analysis Fourier are used. It is considered that the upper boundary frequency of normal EEG, noticeably influencing on its form does not exceed 30 Hz. The fact that higher frequencies are not visible, and in the Fourier spectrum of all EEG signal, the power spectrum of low-frequency part of EEG signal far exceeds and overrides the power spectrum of high frequency oscillations therefore the high frequency ranges are also practically closed for study. Wavelet analysis allows decomposing the entire EEG signal into separate components, which include both traditional rhythms: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma and series of new frequency localized rhythms. This allows to consider them independently of each other and makes it possible to study separately the frequency and other properties of each component, including high frequency which poorly known at present. In this paper, we propose a new approach for obtaining numerical characteristics of the EEG based on the multilevel wavelet package decomposition and applying the Hilbert transformation, which allows to clearly allocate new frequency bands, to obtain visualization, and new numerical characteristics of the EEG. It is shown that by the wavelet decomposition up to the 6th level with the Meyer wavelet, the EEG signal is decomposed into wavelet components EEG = RecD(1) + RecD(2) + RecD(3) + RecD(4) + RecD(5) + RecD(6) + RecA(6), where RecD(4), RecD(5), RecD(6), and RecA(6) are classic ranges of Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta, respectively, and the other RecD(1), RecD(2), and RecD(3) represent the part of the signal, which is usually called Gamma range. In this case, the range RecD(1) has a relative l(2)-energy of about 10(-7), and its frequency spectrum is allocated from 75 to 250 Hz, therefore RecD(1) not considered in this work as a separate range of EEG signal. Frequency spectra of the components RecD(2) and RecD(3) are localized: RecD(3) -from 28 Hz to 50 Hz and RecD(2) -from 57 Hz to 75 Hz. In the work these ranges are named Gamma-2 and Gamma-1, respectively. In addition to the common numeric characteristics of all the bands, in this work three characteristics are defined: the relative energy of component, the average instantaneous frequency and the average statistical frequency of component. The calculation of these parameters for 256 fragments of EEG signal are conducted (in 4 fragments with a duration of 8 seconds, for each of the 64 channels of EEG) for the patient as open as with eyes closed. Calculations show that these numerical characteristics differ significantly for different EEG channels, this suggests that these parameters record the electrical activity of different brain regions. It is also shown that they depend on the recording conditions of EEG (with open or closed eyes). It turned out that the average instantaneous and average statistical frequency for the high-frequency components RecD(2) and RecD(3) behave unstably in case of small shifts of the fragment of the signal. The reason is that a significant part of their frequency spectra of power although is localized, but is distributed widely: from 28 Hz to 50 Hz or from 57 Hz to 75 Hz, respectively. These EEG components need further decomposition into narrower frequency ranges. For better frequency localization, these components are decomposed into several parts using the wavelet packet decomposition. In each case, the packet nodes of the tree decomposition are found, which allow to decompose RecD(2) and RecD(3) on new bands with good frequency localization: RecD(3) = RecD3,(6, 10) + RecD3,(6, 12) + RecD(3),(6, 13) + RecD(3),(6, 14) + RecD(3),(6, 15), RecD(2) = RecD2,(5, 13) + RecD2,(7, 48) + RecD(2),(7, 49) + RecD(2),(7, 50) + RecD(2),(7, 51). The relative energy and average frequencies are calculated for obtained ranges. Thus, in this work, additionally to four classical EEG rhythms 10 bands with good frequency localization are found, which allow to determine their frequency characteristics.

Electroencephalographic correlates of states of concentrative meditation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Spectral analysis; Independent component analysis; Principal component analysis; Buddhist meditation; Focused attention; Absorptions	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; ATTENTION; SYSTEM; CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATIONS; NEUROSCIENCE; RELAXATION; ACTIVATION	Meditative techniques aim for and meditators report states of mental alertness and focus, concurrent with physical and emotional calm. We aimed to determine the electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of five states of Buddhist concentrative meditation, particularly addressing a correlation with meditative level. We studied 12 meditators and 12 pair-matched meditation-naive participants using high-resolution scalp-recorded EEG. To maximise reduction of EMG, data were pre-processed using independent component analysis and surface Laplacian transformed data. Two non-meditative and five meditative states were used: resting baseline, mind wandering, absorptions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (corresponding to four levels of absorption and an absorption with a different object of focus, otherwise equivalent to level 4; these five meditative states produce repeatable, distinctly different experiences for experienced meditators). The experimental protocol required participants to experience the states in the order listed above, followed immediately by the reverse. We then calculated EEG power in standard frequency bands from 1 to 80 Hz. We observed decreases of central scalp beta (13-25 Hz), and central low gamma (25-48 Hz) power in meditators during deeper absorptions. In contrast, we identified increases in frontal midline and temporo-parietal theta power in meditators, again, during deeper absorptions. Alpha activity was increased over all meditative states, not depth-related. This study demonstrates that the subjective experiences of deepening meditation partially correspond to measures of EEG. Our results are in accord with prior studies on non-graded meditative states. These results are also consistent with increased theta correlating with tightness of focus, and reduced beta/gamma with the desynchronization associated with enhanced alertness.

"Cerebellar contribution to visuo-attentional alpha rhythm: insights from weightlessness"	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; FIELD POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTEX; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; LOCALIZATION	Human brain adaptation in weightlessness follows the necessity to reshape the dynamic integration of the neural information acquired in the new environment. This basic aspect was here studied by the electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics where oscillatory modulations were measured during a visuo-attentional state preceding a visuo-motor docking task. Astronauts in microgravity conducted the experiment in free-floating aboard the International Space Station, before the space flight and afterwards. We observed stronger power decrease (similar to ERD: event related desynchronization) of the similar to 10 Hz oscillation from the occipital-parietal (alpha ERD) to the central areas (mu ERD). Inverse source modelling of the stronger alpha ERD revealed a shift from the posterior cingulate cortex (BA31, from the default mode network) on Earth to the precentral cortex (BA4, primary motor cortex) in weightlessness. We also observed significant contribution of the vestibular network (BA40, BA32, and BA39) and cerebellum (lobule V, VI). We suggest that due to the high demands for the continuous readjustment of an appropriate body posture in free-floating, this visuo-attentional state required more contribution from the motor cortex. The cerebellum and the vestibular network involvement in weightlessness might support the correction signals processing necessary for postural stabilization, and the increased demand to integrate incongruent vestibular information.

Functional connectivity within DMN and its subnets (measured by operational synchrony) has been measured in ten novice meditators using an electroencephalogram (EEG) recording in a pre-/post-meditation intervention design. We have found that while the whole DMN was clearly suppressed, different subnets of DMN responded differently after 4 months of meditation training: The strength of EEG operational synchrony in the right and left posterior modules of the DMN decreased in resting post-meditation condition compared to a pre-meditation condition, whereas the frontal DMN module on the contrary exhibited an increase in the strength of EEG operational synchrony. These findings combined with published data on functional-anatomic heterogeneity within the DMN and on trait subjective experiences commonly found following meditation allow us to propose that the first-person perspective and the sense of agency (the witnessing observer) are presented by the frontal DMN module, while the posterior modules of the DMN are generally responsible for the experience of the continuity of 'I' as embodied and localized within bodily space. Significance of these findings is discussed.

They have been linked to the population firing rate of neurons, with individual neurons firing in a close-to-irregular fashion at low rates. Using a combination of mean-field and linear response theory we predict the spectra generated in a layered microcircuit model of V1, composed of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and based on connectivity compiled from anatomical and electrophysiological studies. The model exhibits low-and high-. oscillations visible in all populations. Since locally generated frequencies are imposed onto other populations, the origin of the oscillations cannot be deduced from the spectra. We develop an universally applicable systematic approach that identifies the anatomical circuits underlying the generation of oscillations in a given network. Based on a theoretical reduction of the dynamics, we derive a sensitivity measure resulting in a frequency-dependent connectivity map that reveals connections crucial for the peak amplitude and frequency of the observed oscillations and identifies the minimal circuit generating a given frequency. The low-. peak turns out to be generated in a sub-circuit located in layer 2/ 3 and 4, while the high-. peak emerges from the inter-neurons in layer 4. Connections within and onto layer 5 are found to regulate slow rate fluctuations. We further demonstrate how small perturbations of the crucial connections have significant impact on the population spectra, while the impairment of other connections leaves the dynamics on the population level unaltered. The study uncovers connections where mechanisms controlling the spectra of the cortical microcircuit are most effective.

These multiple functions may depend on specific spatiotemporal emergence and interactions with other spindles and other forms of brain activity. Therefore, we measured sleep spindle cortical distribution, regional heterogeneity, synchronization, and phase relationships with other electroencephalographic components in freely moving primates. Methods: Transcortical field potentials were recorded from Japanese monkeys via telemetry and were analyzed using the Hilbert-Huang transform. Results: Spindle (12-20 Hz) current sources were identified over a wide region of the frontoparietal cortex. Most spindles occurred independently in their own frequency, but some appeared concordant between cortical areas with frequency interdependence, particularly in nearby regions and bilaterally symmetrical regions. Spindles in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex appeared around the surface-positive and depth-negative phase of transcortically recorded slow oscillations (< 1 Hz), whereas centroparietal spindles emerged around the opposite phase. The slow-oscillation phase reversed between the prefrontal and central regions. Gamma activities increased before spindle onset. Several regional heterogeneities in properties of human spindles were replicated in the monkeys, including frequency, density, and inter-cortical time lags, although their topographic patterns were different from those of humans. The phase-amplitude coupling between spindle and gamma activity was also replicated. Conclusions: Spindles in widespread cortical regions are possibly driven by independent rhythm generators, but are temporally associated to spindles in other regions and to slow and gamma oscillations by corticocortical and thalamocortical pathways.

J	Whitmore, NW; Lin, SC				Whitmore, Nathan W.; Lin, Shih-Chieh			Unmasking local activity within local field potentials (LFPs) by removing distal electrical signals using independent component analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Movement artifact; Gamma oscillation; Basal forebrain; Event-related potential; 1/f power spectrum; Functional connectivity	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BLIND SEPARATION; EEG; STATISTICS; INTERFACE; ARTIFACTS; ELECTRODE; DYNAMICS; MUSCLES; ORIGIN	Local field potentials (LFPs) are commonly thought to reflect the aggregate dynamics in local neural circuits around recording electrodes. However, we show that when LFPs are recorded in awake behaving animals against a distal reference on the skull as commonly practiced, LFPs are significantly contaminated by non-local and non-neural sources arising from the reference electrode and from movement-related noise. In a data set with simultaneously recorded LFPs and electroencephalograms (EEGs) across multiple brain regions while rats perform an auditory oddball task, we used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify signals arising from electrical reference and from volume-conducted noise based on their distributed spatial pattern across multiple electrodes and distinct power spectral features. These sources of distal electrical signals collectively accounted for 23-77% of total variance in unprocessed LFPs, as well as most of the gamma oscillation responses to the target stimulus in EEGs. Gamma oscillation power was concentrated in volume-conducted noise and was tightly coupled with the onset of licking behavior, suggesting a likely origin of muscle activity associated with body movement or orofacial movement. The removal of distal signal contamination also selectively reduced correlations of LFP/EEG signals between distant brain regions but not within the same region. Finally, the removal of contamination from distal electrical signals preserved an event-related potential (ERP) response to auditory stimuli in the frontal cortex and also increased the coupling between the frontal ERP amplitude and neuronal activity in the basal forebrain, supporting the conclusion that removing distal electrical signals unmasked local activity within LFPs. Together, these results highlight the significant contamination of LFPs by distal electrical signals and caution against the straightforward interpretation of unprocessed LFPs. Our results provide a principled approach to identify and remove such contamination to unmask local LFPs. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Combining electroencephalographic activity and instantaneous heart rate for assessing brain-heart dynamics during visual emotional elicitation in healthy subjects	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						electroencephalographic; heart rate variability; maximal information coefficient; brain-heart dynamics; emotions; International Affective Picture System	RATE-VARIABILITY BIOFEEDBACK; VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEPRESSIVE STATES; AUTONOMIC AROUSAL; BIPOLAR PATIENTS; EEG; SYSTEM; RESPONSES; STRESS	Emotion perception, occurring in brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, involves autonomic responses affecting cardiovascular dynamics. However, how such brain-heart dynamics is further modulated by emotional valence (pleasantness/unpleasantness), also considering different arousing levels (the intensity of the emotional stimuli), is still unknown. To this extent, we combined electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics and instantaneous heart rate estimates to study emotional processing in healthy subjects. Twenty-two healthy volunteers were elicited through affective pictures gathered from the International Affective Picture System. The experimental protocol foresaw 110 pictures, each of which lasted 10 s, associated to 25 different combinations of arousal and valence levels, including neutral elicitations. EEG data were processed using short-time Fourier transforms to obtain time-varying maps of cortical activation, whereas the associated instantaneous cardiovascular dynamics was estimated in the time and frequency domains through inhomogeneous point-process models. Brain-heart linear and nonlinear coupling was estimated through the maximal information coefficient (MIC). Considering EEG oscillations in the. band (4-8 Hz), MIC highlighted significant arousal-dependent changes between positive and negative stimuli, especially occurring at intermediate arousing levels through the prefrontal cortex interplay. Moreover, high arousing elicitations seem to mitigate changes in brain-heart dynamics in response to pleasant/unpleasant visual elicitation.

The purpose of this electroencephalographic (EEG) study is to understand the mechanisms underlying the deficits in attentional control in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by comparing the power spectra and TGC at rest and during a mental arithmetic task. Methods Nineteen-channel EEGs were recorded from 97 volunteers (including 53 subjects with ADHD) from a camp for hyperactive children under two conditions (rest and task performance). The EEG power spectra and the TGC data were analyzed. Correlation analyses between the Intermediate Visual and Auditory (IVA) continuous performance test (CPT) scores and EEG parameters were performed. Results No significant difference in the power spectra was detected between the groups at rest and during task performance. However, TGC was reduced during the arithmetic task in the ADHD group compared with the normal group (F = 16.70, p < 0.001). The TGC values positively correlated with the IVA CPT scores but negatively correlated with theta power. Conclusions Our findings suggest that desynchronization of TGC occurred during the arithmetic task in ADHD children. TGC in ADHD children is expected to serve as a promising neurophysiological marker of network deactivation during attention-demanding tasks.

Experimental paradigms using near-threshold stimuli suggest that spontaneous brain network dynamics are involved in separating relevant from irrelevant information. Recent findings in human visual perception provide evidence that the immediate spontaneous brain state, i.e. the phase of alpha oscillations, predicts whether a coinciding stimulus is further processed or not. Objectives: Here, we investigated whether this concept of a "pulsed inhibition" involved in sensory gating represents a general mechanism of conscious human perception and can be modulated with noninvasive brain stimulation. Methods: Hence, we used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at the individualized mualpha frequency to entrain somatosensory mu-alpha oscillations, and investigated the effect on somatosensory detection in healthy humans. tACS (or sham, respectively) was applied over primary somatosensory cortices (mu-tACS) while participants performed a detection task of somatosensory near-threshold stimuli. Results: We found that mean perception thresholds during mu-tACS did not change as compared to sham stimulation. However, during mu-tACS, somatosensory detection thresholds varied as a function of the applied tACS phase. This effect was not found when tACS was applied over occipital areas at participant's individual visual alpha frequency. Conclusion: Our data indicate that tACS applied at an endogenous frequency is capable of modulating human somatosensory perception by inducing phase-dependent periods of excitation and inhibition, i.e. entraining ongoing mu-alpha oscillations. These findings support the idea that the "pulsed inhibition" framework for sensory gating applies to somatosensory mu-alpha oscillations and might therefore represent a general, but sensory-specific mechanism of conscious human perception.

The proportion of physiological and pathological HFOs is unclear, as frequency analysis is insufficient for separating the two types of events. For instance, ripples (80-250 Hz) also occur physiologically during memory consolidation processes in medial temporal lobe structures. We investigated the correlation between HFO rates and memory performance. Methods: Patients investigated with bilateral medial temporal electrodes and an intellectual capacity allowing for memory testing were included. High-frequency oscillations were visually marked, and rates of HFOs were calculated for each channel during slow-wave sleep. Patients underwent three verbal and three nonverbal memory tests. They were grouped into severe impairment, some impairment, mostly intact, or intact for verbal and nonverbal memory. We calculated a Pearson correlation between HFO rates in the hippocampi and the memory category and compared HFO rates in each hippocampus with the corresponding (verbal - left, nonverbal - right) memory result using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: Twenty patients were included; ten had bilateral, five had unilateral, and five had no memory impairment. Unilateral memory impairment was verbal in one patient and nonverbal in four. There was no correlation between HFO rates and memory performance in seizure onset areas. There was, however, a significant negative correlation between the overall memory performance and ripple rates (r = -0.50, p = 0.03) outside the seizure onset zone. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the majority of spontaneous hippocampal ripples, as defined in the present study, may reflect pathological activity, taking into account the association with memory impairment. The absence of negative correlation between memory performance and HFO rates in seizure onset areas could be explained by HFO rates in the SOZ being generally so high that differences between areas with remaining and impaired memory function cannot be seen.

Differential Training Facilitates Early Consolidation in Motor Learning	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor learning; variable practice; differential learning; repetitive learning; EEG; badminton	FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; POWER; BAND; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE	Current research demonstrates increased learning rates in differential learning (DL) compared to repetitive training. To date, little is known on the underlying neurophysiological processes in DL that contribute to superior performance over repetitive practice. In the present study, we measured electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activation patterns after DL and repetitive badminton serve training. Twenty-four semi-professional badminton players performed badminton serves in a DL and repetitive training schedule in a within-subjects design. EEG activity was recorded from 19 electrodes according to the 10-20 system before and immediately after each 20-min exercise. Increased theta activity was obtained in contralateral parieto-occipital regions after DL. Further, increased posterior alpha activity was obtained in DL compared to repetitive training. Results indicate different underlying neuronal processes in DL and repetitive training with a higher involvement of parieto-occipital areas in DL. We argue that DL facilitates early consolidation in motor learning indicated by post-training increases in theta and alpha activity. Further, brain activation patterns indicate somatosensory working memory processes where attentional resources are allocated in processing of somatosensory information in DL. Reinforcing a somatosensory memory trace might explain increased motor learning rates in DL. Finally, this memory trace is more stable against interference from internal and external disturbances that afford executively controlled processing such as attentional processes.

Although this verbal memory impairment in SZ is a well-known finding, our understanding about its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms is rather scarce. Here we address this issue by recording brain oscillations during a memory task in a sample of healthy controls and patients with SZ. Brain oscillations represent spectral fingerprints of specific neurocognitive operations and are therefore a promising tool to identify neurocognitive mechanisms that are affected by SZ. Healthy controls showed a prominent suppression of left prefrontal beta oscillatory activity during successful memory formation, which replicates several previous oscillatory memory studies. In contrast, patients failed to exhibit such a left prefrontal beta power suppression. Utilizing a new topographical pattern similarity approach, we further demonstrate that the degree of similarity between a patient's beta power decrease to that of the controls reliably predicted memory performance. This relationship between beta power decreases and memory was such that the patients' memory performance improved as they showed a more similar topographical beta desynchronization pattern compared to that of healthy controls. Together, these findings support left prefrontal beta desynchronization as the spectral fingerprint of verbal episodic memory formation, likely indicating deep semantic processing of verbal material. These findings also demonstrate that left prefrontal beta power suppression (or lack thereof) during memory encoding are a reliable biomarker for the observed encoding impairments in SZ in verbal memory.

This impairment might be accelerated during multistable perception. Multistable perception is a phenomenon, where a visual pattern gives rise to at least two different perceptual representations. We addressed this issue by assessing event-related alpha oscillations during continuous viewing of an ambiguous and unambiguous control stimulus. Perceptual reversals were indicated by a manual response, allowing differentiation between phases of reversion and non-reversion (that is perceptual stability) in both tasks. During the ambiguous task, patients and controls showed a comparable number of perceptual reversals. Alpha amplitudes in patients were larger in non-reversion phases, accompanied by a stronger decrease of alpha activity preceding the perceptual reversal. This group difference was pronounced for lower alpha activity and not apparent during the unambiguous task. This indicates that ambiguous perception taps into the specific deficits that patients experience in maintaining coherent perception. Given that top-down influences in generating a meaningful percept seems to be low in patients, they appear more dependent on sensory information. Similar, bottom-up mechanisms might be more important in triggering perceptual reversals in patients than in controls. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little is known regarding how changes in conscious states, via induction of and recovery from anesthesia, affect the processing of sensorimotor information in the thalamocortical network. To address this, we investigated the dynamics of causal interactions among sensorimotor rhythms (SMR; frequency range of 3-12 Hz) across the thalamocortical network during transitions into and out of ketamine-induced unconsciousness. Two local field potentials from the ventral lateral and ventrobasal thalamic nuclei, as well as two intracranial electroencephalography signals from the primary sensory and primary motor regions, were recorded in 10 mice. Spectral Granger causality analysis revealed two distinct frequency-specific patterns in sensorimotor rhythms. For the low frequency (3-6.5 Hz) SMR, loss of consciousness evoked causal influences directed from the cortex to the thalamus. For the high-frequency (6.5-12 Hz) SMR, causal influences from the primary sensory cortex to other regions during the conscious period were abruptly altered by loss of consciousness and gradually regenerated following recovery of consciousness. The results of the present study indicate that anesthesia alters the flow of sensorimotor information in the thalamocortical network and may provide evidence of the neural basis of loss and recovery of sensorimotor function associated with anesthesia.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were acquired from 12 schizophrenia patients and 10 healthy controls during a visual word processing task. Two spectral power ratio (SPR) feature sets: the band power ratio (BPR) and the window power ratio (WPR) were extracted from MEG data in five frequency bands, four time windows of word processing, and at locations covering whole head. Cluster-based nonparametric permutation tests were employed to identify SPRs that show significant between-group difference. Machine learning based feature selection and classification techniques were then employed to select optimal combinations of the significant SPR features, and distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. We identified three BPR clusters and three WPR clusters that show significant oscillation power difference between groups. These include the theta/delta, alpha/delta and beta/delta BPRs during base-to-encode and encode time windows, and the beta band WPR from base to encode and from encode to post-encode windows. Based on two WPR and one BPR features combined, over 95% cross-validation classification accuracy was achieved using three different linear classifiers separately. These features may have potential as quantitative markers that discriminate schizophrenia patients and healthy controls; however, this needs further validation on larger samples.

Here we used whole-scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG) to monitor modulation of sensorimotor brain rhythms related to the speaker vs. listener roles during natural conversation. Nine dyads of healthy adults were recruited. The partners of a dyad were engaged in live conversations via an audio link while their brain activity was measured simultaneously in two separate MEG laboratories. The levels of similar to 10-Hz and similar to 20-Hz rolandic oscillations depended on the speaker vs. listener role. In the left rolandic cortex, these oscillations were consistently (by similar to 20%) weaker during speaking than listening. At the turn changes in conversation, the level of the similar to 10 Hz oscillations enhanced transiently around 1.0 or 2.3 s before the end of the partner's turn. Our findings indicate left-hemisphere-dominant involvement of the sensorimotor cortex during own speech in natural conversation. The similar to 10-Hz modulations could be related to preparation for starting one's own turn, already before the partner's turn has finished. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study analyzes multi-day data collected from a Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) workload study using a new feature generation methodology which examines not just the average power, but also the variability of the power distribution in the clinical frequency bands over a 10 second sliding temporal window. High versus low workload levels were predicted for day five of the study based on training three traditional classifiers-Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), random forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-on the first four days' results. Frequency-domain power distribution variance was statistically significant between conditions, suggesting it as a salient feature. Including variance as a feature enabled a cross-day workload classification accuracy improvement of 5.8% above models only using mean power. Furthermore, the individual classifiers were combined into a time-smoothed composite classifier which capitalized on the differences in features selected in the models to improve overall classification accuracy to greater than 80%.

A prevalent neural substrate of WM coding is persistent neural activity, the property of neurons to remain active after having been activated by a transient sensory stimulus. This persistent activity allows for online maintenance of memory as well as its active manipulation necessary for task performance. WM is tightly capacity limited. Therefore, selective gating of sensory and internally generated information is crucial for WM function. While the exact neural substrate of selective gating remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that it might be controlled by modulating ongoing oscillatory brain activity. Here, we review experiments and models that linked selective gating, persistent activity, and brain oscillations, putting them in the more general mechanistic context of WM. We do so by defining several operations necessary for successful WM function and then discussing how such operations may be carried out by mechanisms suggested by computational models. We specifically show how oscillatory mechanisms may provide a rapid and flexible active gating mechanism for WM operations.

Here, we examined whether -ASSR deficits are also present in a mouse model of schizophrenia, whose behavioural changes have shown schizophrenia-like endophenotypes. Methods: Electroencephalogram in frontal cortex and local field potential in primary auditory cortex were recorded in phospholipase C 1 (PLC-1) null mice during auditory binaural click trains at different rates (20-50Hz), and compared with wild-type littermates. Results: In mutant mice, the ASSR power was reduced at all tested rates. The phase locking in frontal cortex was reduced in the band (20Hz) but not in the band, whereas the phase locking in auditory cortex was reduced in the band. The cortico-cortical connectivity between frontal and auditory cortex was significantly reduced in mutant mice. Conclusions: The tested mouse model of schizophrenia showed impaired electrophysiological responses to auditory steady state stimulation, suggesting that it could be useful for preclinical studies of schizophrenia.

To investigate the oscillatory gamma activity in chronic pain, in the present study, we recorded spontaneous electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals during chronic pain development in rats with chronic inflammatory pain induced by monoarthritis. Power spectrum analysis of ECoG data showed that gamma power increased significantly at the late stage of chronic inflammatory pain. The increased gamma activity occurred mainly at electrodes over primary somatosensory cortices. In rats with chronic pain, the gamma power was positively correlated with the hyperalgesia measured by laser energy that elicited hindpaw withdrawal response. Furthermore, an increased coupling between the amplitude of gamma power and the phase of theta oscillations was observed in chronic inflammatory pain condition. These results indicate an enhanced spontaneous gamma activity in chronic pain and suggest a potential biomarker for the severity of chronic pain.

J	Guo, JL; Zhong, N; Ma, XM; Zhang, MH; Zhou, HY				Guo Jia-Liang; Zhong Ning; Ma Xiao-Meng; Zhang Ming-Hui; Zhou Hai-Yan			Sample entropy analysis of electroencephalogram based on the two-dimensional feature of amplitude and period	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						sample entropy; two-dimension; electroencephalogram; major depressive disorder	EEG; COMPLEXITY; DEPRESSION	Sample entropy, a complexity measure that quantifies the new pattern generation rate of time series, has been widely applied to physiological signal analysis. It can effectively reflect the pattern complexity of one-dimensional sequences, such as the information contained in amplitude or period features. However, the traditional method usually ignores the interaction between amplitude and period in time series, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To address this issue, in this study, we propose a new method to describe the pattern complexity of waveform in a two-dimensional space. In this method, the local peaks of the signals are first extracted, and the variation range and the duration time between the adjacent peaks are calculated as the instantaneous amplitude and period. Then the amplitude and period sequences are combined into a two-dimensional sequence to calculate the sample entropy based on the amplitude and period information. In addition, in order to avoid the influence of the different units in the two dimensions, we use the Jaccard distance to measure the similarity of the amplitude-period bi-vectors in the waveforms, which is different from the one-dimensional method. The Jaccard distance is defined as the ratio of the different area to the combined area of two rectangles containing the amplitude-period bi-vectors in the Cartesian coordinate system. To verify the effectiveness of the method, we construct five sets of simulative waveforms in which the numbers of patterns are completely equal in one-dimensional space of amplitude or period but the numbers in two-dimensional space are significantly different (P<0.00001). Simulation results show that the two-dimensional sample entropy could effectively reflect the different complexities of the five signals (P<0.00001), while the sample entropy in one-dimensional space of amplitude or period cannot do. The results indicate that compared with the one-dimensional sample entropy, the two-dimensional sample entropy is very effective to describe and distinguish the complexity of interactive patterns based on amplitude and period features in waveforms. The entropy is also used to analyze the resting state EEG signals between well-matched depression patient and healthy control groups. Signals in three separated frequency bands (Theta, Alpha, Beta) and ten brain regions (bilateral: frontal, central, parietal, temporal, occipital) are analyzed. Experimental results show that in the Alpha band and in the left parietal and occipital regions, the two-dimensional sample entropy in depression is significantly lower than that in the healthy group (P<0.01), indicating the disability of depression patients in generation of various EEG patterns. These features might become potential biomarkers of depressions.

Importantly, APP knockout (APP-KO) mice exhibit cognitive deficits, suggesting that APP plays a role at the neuronal network level. To investigate this possibility, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the posterior parietal cortex, dorsal hippocampus and lateral prefrontal cortex of freely moving APP-KO mice. Spectral analyses showed that network oscillations within the theta-and gamma-frequency bands were not different between APP-KO and wild-type mice. Surprisingly, however, while gamma amplitude coupled to theta phase in all recorded regions of wild-type animals, in APP-KO mice theta-gamma coupling was strongly diminished in recordings from the parietal cortex and hippocampus, but not in LFPs recorded from the prefrontal cortex. Thus, lack of APP reduces oscillatory coupling in LFP recordings from specific brain regions, despite not affecting the amplitude of the oscillations. Together, our findings reveal reduced cross-frequency coupling as a functional marker of APP deficiency at the network level.

Cortical processes of speech illusions in the general population	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Speech illusion; White noise; Cortical oscillations; Reduced alpha activity	AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS; ALPHA RHYTHMS; WHEEL ILLUSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERCEPTION; POWER; EXCITABILITY; AREAS; NOISE	Background: There is evidence that experimentally elicited auditory illusions in the general population index risk for psychotic symptoms. As little is known about underlying cortical mechanisms of auditory illusions, an experiment was conducted to analyze processing of auditory illusions in a general population sample. In a follow-up design with two measurement moments (baseline and 6 months), participants (n = 83) underwent the White Noise task under simultaneous recording with a 14-lead EEG. An auditory illusion was defined as hearing any speech in a sound fragment containing white noise. Results: A total number of 256 speech illusions (SI) were observed over the two measurements, with a high degree of stability of SI over time. There were 7 main effects of speech illusion on the EEG alpha band-the most significant indicating a decrease in activity at T3 (t = -4.05). Other EEG frequency bands (slow beta, fast beta, gamma, delta, theta) showed no significant associations with SI. Conclusion: SIs are characterized by reduced alpha activity in non-clinical populations. Given the association of SIs with psychosis, follow-up research is required to examine the possibility of reduced alpha activity mediating SIs in high risk and symptomatic populations.

Spectral fingerprints of large-scale cortical dynamics during ambiguous motion perception	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						large-scale neuronal networks; EEG source analysis; intrinsic coupling modes; phase synchronization; amplitude envelope correlations; bistable perception; ambiguous perception; motion quartett; stroboscopic alternative motion; gamma oscillations	INTRINSIC COUPLING MODES; EEG-DATA; BRAIN; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; ALPHA; COMMUNICATION; FREQUENCY	Ambiguous stimuli have been widely used to study the neuronal correlates of consciousness. Recently, it has been suggested that conscious perception might arise from the dynamic interplay of functionally specialized but widely distributed cortical areas. While previous research mainly focused on phase coupling as a correlate of cortical communication, more recent findings indicated that additional coupling modes might coexist and possibly subserve distinct cortical functions. Here, we studied two coupling modes, namely phase and envelope coupling, which might differ in their origins, putative functions and dynamics. Therefore, we recorded 128-channel EEG while participants performed a bistable motion task and utilized state-of-the-art source-space connectivity analysis techniques to study the functional relevance of different coupling modes for cortical communication. Our results indicate that gamma-band phase coupling in extrastriate visual cortex might mediate the integration of visual tokens into a moving stimulus during ambiguous visual stimulation. Furthermore, our results suggest that long-range fronto-occipital gamma-band envelope coupling sustains the horizontal percept during ambiguous motion perception. Additionally, our results support the idea that local parieto-occipital alpha-band phase coupling controls the inter-hemispheric information transfer. These findings provide correlative evidence for the notion that synchronized oscillatory brain activity reflects the processing of sensory input as well as the information integration across several spatiotemporal scales. The results indicate that distinct coupling modes are involved in different cortical computations and that the rich spatiotemporal correlation structure of the brain might constitute the functional architecture for cortical processing and specific multi-site communication.

Male veterans with PTSD exhibit aberrant neural dynamics during working memory processing: an MEG study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; NEUTRAL INFORMATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; DSM-IV; MAINTENANCE; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; EEG	Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with executive functioning deficits, including disruptions in working memory. In this study, we examined the neural dynamics of working memory processing in veterans with PTSD and a matched healthy control sample using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Methods: Our sample of recent combat veterans with PTSD and demographically matched participants without PTSD completed a working memory task during a 306-sensor MEG recording. The MEG data were preprocessed and transformed into the time-frequency domain. Significant oscillatory brain responses were imaged using a beamforming approach to identify spatiotemporal dynamics. Results: Fifty-one men were included in our analyses: 27 combat veterans with PTSD and 24 controls. Across all participants, a dynamic wave of neural activity spread from posterior visual cortices to left frontotemporal regions during encoding, consistent with a verbal working memory task, and was sustained throughout maintenance. Differences related to PTSD emerged during early encoding, with patients exhibiting stronger a oscillatory responses than controls in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Differences spread to the right supramarginal and temporal cortices during later encoding where, along with the right IFG, they persisted throughout the maintenance period. Limitations: This study focused on men with combat-related PTSD using a verbal working memory task. Future studies should evaluate women and the impact of various traumatic experiences using diverse tasks. Conclusion: Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with neurophysiological abnormalities during working memory encoding and maintenance. Veterans with PTSD engaged a bilateral network, including the inferior prefrontal cortices and supramarginal gyri. Right hemispheric neural activity likely reflects compensatory processing, as veterans with PTSD work to maintain accurate performance despite known cognitive deficits associated with the disorder.

The Repeated Measures Anova (RMANOVA) test is used to determine within group and between group variability of SE values in (61 channels) various specified regions of the brain during a visual single object recognition task. In order to discriminate visual ERPs produced in alcoholics and controls within the beta band, SE features are applied to a k-NN classifier. RMANOVA tests show that there is little statistical significance (p>0.05) as far as the marginal mean between groups is considered. However, the marginal mean variability within group indicates that there are some selected channels in which the statistical significance is observed (p<0.05). The classification results show that k-NN classification achieves 90.41% accuracy with k=8. It is also observed that the mean of spectral entropy values increase mainly in the left frontal region of the brain in alcoholics as compared to controls.

Methods: We studied 28 adult epilepsy patients who underwent icEEG monitoring for a median of 12 nights. We used a metric calculated from relative delta power (RDP) to evaluate the emergence of sleep cycles for every night of monitoring. We further evaluated the effect of seizures and AEDs on trends in the RDP metric. Results: We observed oscillations corresponding to sleep cycles in the RDP time-series. There was a significant increasing trend in our RDP sleep metric over the course of monitoring. Seizures and AEDs did not significantly affect this trend. Conclusions: The RDP metric increased during icEEG monitoring, independent of seizures and AEDs. This increase may be due to a number of factors and these factors appear to outweigh the effects of seizures and AEDs. Significance: Our results indicate that sleep is not uniform during icEEG monitoring, rather there is a considerable increasing, multi-night change in sleep structure.

A Wireless EEG Recording Method for Rat Use inside the Water Maze	PLOS ONE			English	Article							THETA-RHYTHMS; SMALL ANIMALS; PLACE FIELDS; MEMORY TASK; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; ACQUISITION; MULTICHANNEL; COORDINATION; SYSTEM	With the continued miniaturisation of portable embedded systems, wireless EEG recording techniques are becoming increasingly prevalent in animal behavioural research. However, in spite of their versatility and portability, they have seldom been used inside water-maze tasks designed for rats. As such, a novel 3D printed implant and waterproof connector is presented, which can facilitate wireless water-maze EEG recordings in freely-moving rats, using a commercial wireless recording system (W32; Multichannel Systems). As well as waterproofing the wireless system, battery, and electrode connector, the implant serves to reduce movement-related artefacts by redistributing movement-related forces away from the electrode connector. This implant/connector was able to successfully record high-quality LFP in the hippocampo-striatal brain regions of rats as they undertook a procedurallearning variant of the double-H water-maze task. Notably, there were no significant performance deficits through its use when compared with a control group across a number of metrics including number of errors and speed of task completion. Taken together, this method can expand the range of measurements that are currently possible in this diverse area of behavioural neuroscience, whilst paving the way for integration with more complex behaviours.

The framework exploits multivariate linear models to decompose the predictability of any given target process into measures of self-, causal and interaction predictability reflecting respectively the information retained in the process and related to its physiological complexity, the information transferred from the other source processes, and the information modified during the transfer according to redundant or synergistic interaction between the sources. The framework is here applied to the eta, delta, theta, alpha, sigma, beta time series measured from the sleep recordings of eight severe sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS) patients studied before and after long-term treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, and 14 healthy controls. Results show that the full and self-predictability of eta, delta and theta decreased significantly in SAHS compared with controls, and were restored with CPAP for delta and theta but not for eta. The causal predictability of eta and delta occurred through significantly redundant source interaction during healthy sleep, which was lost in SAHS and recovered after CPAP. These results indicate that predictability analysis is a viable tool to assess the modifications of complexity and causality of the cerebral and cardiac processes induced by sleep disorders, and to monitor the restoration of the neuroautonomic control of these processes during long-term treatment.

Phase-lag synchronization analysis in complex systems with directed inter-relations	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS			English	Article							NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TIME-SERIES; TRANSFORM; DYNAMICS; EEG	In this work, we proposed a novel way to estimate phase-lag synchronization in coupled systems. This approach was applied into two systems: a directed-coupled Rossler-Lorenz system and a network of Izhikevich neurons. For the former case, the phase-lag synchronization revealed an increase in complexity for the Lorenz subsystem components, when the coupling is activated. The opposite behavior was observed when the Izhikevich network were organized in a hierarchical way. Our results point out to emergent synchronism related to causal interactions in coupled complex systems.	[Martins, V. S. G.; Rodrigues, A. C.; Machado, B.

Among the plausible mechanisms of learning, reduction of perceptual bias has been studied the least. Perceptual bias may compensate for lack of stimulus information, but excessive reliance on bias diminishes visual discriminability. We investigated the time course of bias in a perceptual grouping task and studied the associated cortical dynamics in spontaneous and evoked EEG. Participants reported the perceived orientation of dot groupings in ambiguous dot lattices. Performance improved over a 1-hr period as indicated by the proportion of trials in which participants preferred dot groupings favored by dot proximity. The proximity-based responses were compromised by perceptual bias: Vertical groupings were sometimes preferred to horizontal ones, independent of dot proximity. In the evoked EEG activity, greater amplitude of the N1 component for horizontal than vertical responses indicated that the bias was most prominent in conditions of reduced visual discriminability. The prominence of bias decreased in the course of the experiment. Although the bias was still prominent, prestimulus activity was characterized by an intermittent regime of alternating modes of low and high alpha power. Responses were more biased in the former mode, indicating that perceptual bias was deployed actively to compensate for stimulus uncertainty. Thus, early stages of perceptual learning were characterized by episodes of greater reliance on prior visual preferences, alternating with episodes of receptivity to stimulus information. In the course of learning, the former episodes disappeared, and biases reappeared only infrequently.

Involvement of mirror neuron system in prodromal Alzheimer's disease	BBA CLINICAL			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EEG MARKERS; VASCULAR DAMAGE; IMITATION; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK; CORTEX; ALPHA; MIND; MCI	Background: Mirror neurons have been localized in several locations, including the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Increase of EEG alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio has been detected in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will convert in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the association of alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio with cortical thickness in IPL in MCI subjects. Methods: 74 adult subjects with MCI underwent EEG recording and high resolution MRI. Alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio was ell as cortical thickness were computed for each subject. Three MCI groups were obtained according to increasing tertile values of alpha3/alpha2 ratio. Difference of cortical thickness among the groups was estimated. Results: Higher alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio group had wider cortical thinning than other groups, mapped on the IPL, supramarginal gyrus and precuneus bilaterally. Conclusions: High EEG alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio was associated with atrophy of IPL areas in MCI subjects. General significance: The scientific hypothesis is divided into the following main points: 1) the theoretical background considering two recent theories, an evolutionary perspective theory and the theory of mind (ToM), which both track a possible relationship between prodromal AD and mirror system; 2) the relationship has been focused on the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease, that is a peculiar and very debated phase of the disease itself; and 3) not a generical relationship, but a focused anatomo-functional association has been proposed.

In the past decade, the idea that focal seizures instead arise from coordinated activity across large-scale epileptic networks has become widely accepted. Understanding the network model's applicability is critical, due to its increasing influence on clinical research and surgical treatment paradigms. In this review, we examine the origins of the concept of epileptic networks as the nidus for recurring seizures. We summarize analytical and methodological elements of epileptic network studies and discuss findings from recent detailed electrophysiological investigations. Our review highlights the strengths and limitations of the epileptic network theory as a metaphor for the complex interactions that occur during seizures. We present lines of investigation that may usefully probe these interactions and thus serve to advance our understanding of the long-range effects of epileptiform activity.

Applying dynamic data collection to improve dry electrode system performance for a P300-based brain-computer interface	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electroencephalography; dry electrodes; artefact; dynamic; data collection; P300 speller	EPILEPTIC SPIKES; ARTIFACTS; SIGNALS	Objective. Dry electrodes have an advantage over gel-based 'wet' electrodes by providing quicker set-up time for electroencephalography recording; however, the potentially poorer contact can result in noisier recordings. We examine the impact that this may have on brain-computer interface communication and potential approaches for mitigation. Approach. We present a performance comparison of wet and dry electrodes for use with the P300 speller system in both healthy participants and participants with communication disabilities (ALS and PLS), and investigate the potential for a data-driven dynamic data collection algorithm to compensate for the lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in dry systems. Main results. Performance results from sixteen healthy participants obtained in the standard static data collection environment demonstrate a substantial loss in accuracy with the dry system. Using a dynamic stopping algorithm, performance may have been improved by collecting more data in the dry system for ten healthy participants and eight participants with communication disabilities; however, the algorithm did not fully compensate for the lower SNR of the dry system. An analysis of the wet and dry system recordings revealed that delta and theta frequency band power (0.1-4 Hz and 4-8 Hz, respectively) are consistently higher in dry system recordings across participants, indicating that transient and drift artifacts may be an issue for dry systems. Significance. Using dry electrodes is desirable for reduced set-up time; however, this study demonstrates that online performance is significantly poorer than for wet electrodes for users with and without disabilities. We test a new application of dynamic stopping algorithms to compensate for poorer SNR. Dynamic stopping improved dry system performance; however, further signal processing efforts are likely necessary for full mitigation.	[Clements, J. M.; Caves, K.; Collins, L. M.; Throckmorton, C.

In this article, we investigate changes in electroencephalogram signals in short-term memory with respect to the baseline activity. The electroencephalogram signals have been analyzed using 9 linear and nonlinear/dynamic measures. We applied statistical Wilcoxon examination and Davis-Bouldian criterion to select optimal discriminative features. The results show that among the features, the permutation entropy significantly increased in frontal lobe and the occipital second lower alpha band activity decreased during memory task. These 2 features reflect the same mental task; however, their correlation with memory task varies in different intervals. In conclusion, it is suggested that the combination of the 2 features would improve the performance of memory based neurofeedback systems.

Putative EEG measures of social anxiety: Comparing frontal alpha asymmetry and delta-beta cross-frequency correlation	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Social anxiety; Biomarker; Alpha asymmetry; Delta-beta correlation; Social-performance task	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE; PUBLIC SPEAKING; PHOBIA; DISORDER; EMOTION; DEPRESSION; INVENTORY; CHILDREN	The goal of the present study was to examine whether frontal alpha asymmetry and delta-beta cross-frequency correlation during resting state, anticipation, and recovery are electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of social anxiety. For the first time, we jointly examined frontal alpha asymmetry and delta-beta correlation during resting state and during a social performance task in high (HSA) versus low (LSA) socially anxious females. Participants performed a social performance task in which they first watched and evaluated a video of a peer, and then prepared their own speech. They believed that their speech would be videotaped and evaluated by a peer. We found that HSA participants showed significant negative delta-beta correlation as compared to LSA participants during both anticipation of and recovery from the stressful social situation. This negative delta-beta correlation might reflect increased activity in subcortical brain regions and decreased activity in cortical brain regions. As we hypothesized, no group differences in delta-beta correlation were found during the resting state. This could indicate that a certain level of stress is needed to find EEG measures of social anxiety. As for frontal alpha asymmetry, we did not find any group differences. The present frontal alpha asymmetry results are discussed in relation to the evident inconsistencies in the frontal alpha asymmetry literature. Together, our results suggest that delta-beta correlation is a putative EEG measure of social anxiety.	[Harrewijn, A.; Van der Molen, M. J. W.; Westenberg, P.

Jennifer			A single dose of hypnotic corrects sleep and EEG abnormalities in symptomatic Huntington's disease mice	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Transgenic mice; Hypnotic drugs; Antidepressants; REM sleep; Quantitative EEG; Gamma oscillation	R6/2 MOUSE MODEL; BASAL FOREBRAIN NEURONS; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; REM-SLEEP; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; VIGILANCE STATES; DOUBLE-BLIND; BRAIN; AMITRIPTYLINE	Sleep and electroencephalogram abnormalities are prominent early features of Huntington's disease (HD) that typically appear before the onset of characteristic motor symptoms. The changes in sleep and electroencephalogram seen in HD patients are largely recapitulated in mouse models of HD such as transgenic R6/2 lines. To test whether or not drugs with hypnotic properties can correct the sleep and electroencephalogram abnormalities seen in HD mice, we treated male wild-type (WT; N = 7) and R6/2 mice (N = 9) acutely with intraperitoneal injections of vehicle, zolpidem (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg) or amitriptyline (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg), and then monitored their sleep wake behavior. In R6/2 mice, both zolpidem and amitriptyline suppressed the abnormally high REM sleep amount and electroencephalographic gamma (30-46 Hz) oscillations in a dose-dependent manner. Amitriptyline's effect on sleep was similar in both genotypes, whereas zolpidem showed significant genotype differences. Zolpidem exerted a strong hypnotic effect in WT mice by increasing electroencephalographic delta power, doubling the mean bout duration and the total amount of non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, no such effect was seen in R6/2 mice. Our study demonstrates that the pathophysiological changes seen in sleep and electroencephalogram are not 'hard-wired' in HD brain and can be reversed even at late stages of the disease. The diminished hypnotic effect of zolpidem suggests that the GABAergic control of sleep wake states is impaired in HD mice. A better understanding of the neurochemical basis underlying these abnormalities should lead to more effective and rational therapies for HD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective To analyze the relationship between EEG absolute power (AP) with performance on tasks of executive functioning in children. Method Correlational cross-sectional study of 30 children (8.6 1 year). EEG was performed with eyes closed and bipolar leads. With the Fourier transform AP was calculated in the spectrum of 1.6, 30 Hz. NEUROPSI Attention and Memory was applied and the Index of Attention and Executive functions (IAFE) was calculated. Based on this, the AP was compared with Kruskal-Wallis and the Z value, Spearman coefficient for correlation with the subtests. Results Children with severe impairment ((x) over bar = 63 +/- 8 CI 95% [57.2, 68.5]) had higher delta AP (alpha <= .05) in Fl F7, P301 and P402, and Z values near 2 SD in F7T3, F3C3 and F8T4 at slow frequencies. Correlations were significant between the IAFE and delta AP P301 (-.57), P402 (-.43) and T5O1 (-.37); with AP alpha mainly on left fronto-temporo-parietal-occipital areas. The score in Visual Detection and Semantic Fluency inversely related to AP alpha frequency. Discussion and conclusion Performance on tasks of executive functioning is different in relation to the frontal and parietal AP delta. There is an inverse relationship between AP delta and alpha at rest with attention and verbal fluency.

J	Lei, M; Meng, G; Zhang, WM; Sarkar, N				Lei Min; Meng Guang; Zhang Wen-Ming; Sarkar, Nilanjan			Sample entropy of electroencephalogram for children with autism based on virtual driving game	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						autism spectrum disorder; virtual driving game; sample entropy; electroencephalogram	SPECTRUM DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG COMPLEXITY; POWER; ABNORMALITIES; OSCILLATIONS; FRACTALITY; COHERENCE; DIAGNOSIS	Autism spectrum disorder is a kind of mental disease which involves the disorders of the perception, emotion, memory, language, intelligence, thinking, action, etc. The aim of this paper is to investigate the brain activity characteristics of the children with autism during complex environments by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the neuroergonomics perspective. The virtual driving environment as a complex multi-task source is used to organically connect brain systems with human motion control. The 14-channel EEG signals are obtained including the EEG baseline signals on a resting state (about 3 min) and the EEG activity signals during driving (about 5 min). The method of the shift average sample entropy is proposed to deal with EEG signals in the resting and the virtual driving environments. Considering the highly complex hyper-dimensional characteristics of EEG signals, the different embedding dimensions (such as 2 and 6 dimensions) are analyzed in the sample entropy estimation. The results show that the average sample entropy values of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects are lower than those of healthy subjects during resting and driving, respectively, especially in the prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe during resting and in temporal lobe and occipital lobe during driving. It indicates that ASD children lack the ability to adapt easily their behaviors. Meanwhile, like healthy subjects, the average sample entropy values of ASD subjects during driving are higher than those during resting as a whole. Moreover, the EEG activity signals of ASD are obviously higher than the EEG baseline signals in prefrontal lobe, frontal lobe, frontal central lobe and temporal lobe regions in 95% significant level. And for healthy subjects, the activity signals are significantly higher than the baseline signals only in parietal lobe region. Furthermore, the brain activities of ASD subjects during driving come closer to those of healthy subjects during resting. It suggests that the virtual driving environment may be helpful for the treatment of ASD individuals. In addition, the ASD and healthy subjects have a certain right hemisphere dominance in the whole region except in the parietal lobe region. In the parietal lobe region, they have some left hemisphere dominance, especially during driving. And for ASD subjects, there is the significant right hemisphere dominance in the temporal lobe in 95% confidence level no matter whether in the resting state or in the driving state. The results show that it is suitable for the shift average sample entropy analysis to study the brain activities of ASD individuals. This study will provide a new research method for the further research on the mechanism of autism and its diagnosis, evaluation and intervention.

Brain response (alpha band oscillations, EEG; hemodynamic activity, O2Hb), as well as self perception of social ranking, cognitive performance, and personality trait (Behavioral Activation System, BAS) were considered during a competitive joint-action. Subjects were required to develop a strategy to obtain a better outcome than a competitor (C) (in term of error rate, and response time, RT). A pre-feedback (without a specific feedback on the performance) and a post feedback condition (which reinforced the improved performance) were provided. It was found that higher-BAS participants responded in greater measure to perceived higher cognitive performance (post-feedback condition), with increased left prefrontal activity, higher ranking perception, and a better real performance (reduced RTs). These results were explained in term of increased sense of self-efficacy and social position, probably based on higher-BAS sensitivity to reinforcing conditions. In addition, the hemispheric effect in favor of the left side characterized the competitive behavior, showing an imbalance for high-BAS in comparison to low BAS in the case of a rewarding (post-feedback) context. Therefore, the present results confirmed the significance of BAS in modulating brain responsiveness, self-perceived social position, and real performance during an interpersonal competitive action which is considered highly relevant for social status.

However, parameters for detection and analysis have not been widely explored and validated. New method: We present a new, open-source, Matlab based, toolbox for the automatic detection and analysis of slow waves; with adjustable parameter settings, as well as manual correction and exploration of the results using a multi-faceted visualization tool. Results: We explore a large search space of parameter settings for slow wave detection and measure their effects on a selection of outcome parameters. Every choice of parameter setting had some effect on at least one outcome parameter. In general, the largest effect sizes were found when choosing the EEG reference, type of canonical waveform, and amplitude thresholding. Comparison with existing method: Previously published methods accurately detect large, global waves but are conservative and miss the detection of smaller amplitude, local slow waves. The toolbox has additional benefits in terms of speed, user-interface, and visualization options to compare and contrast slow waves. Conclusions: The exploration of parameter settings in the toolbox highlights the importance of careful selection of detection Methods: The sensitivity and specificity of the automated detection can be improved by manually adding or deleting entire waves and or specific channels using the toolbox visualization functions. The toolbox standardizes the detection procedure, sets the stage for reliable results and comparisons and is easy to use without previous programming experience. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, there is evidence that it takes them more time to overcome a distracting event. Here, the distracting effect of irregular switches in speaker location was studied in 22 younger and 22 older adults in a speech perception task. The participants responded to target words that were presented either from a frequent location (standard trials) or a rare location (deviant trials). Behavioral performance measures, event-related brain potentials (ERPs), and EEG synchronization (intertrial coherence [ITC]) were analyzed. Behavioral performance was not only decreased in deviant trials, but also in subsequent standard trials, indicating an effect of so-called postdeviance distraction. The negative impact of the distracting event (i.e., the switch in speaker location) on the processing of subsequent (standard) trials was more pronounced in the older versus younger group. The EEG analyses revealed a decreased N2 amplitude and increased latencies in P2 and P3a in the older group, suggesting a reduced and delayed attentional control. Moreover, there were age-related changes in late (200-450 ms) theta ITCs: While the ITC of the young remained constant in trials following a deviant, the ITC of the old decreased, suggesting a decline in processing of stimuli following (task-irrelevant) switches in speaker location. This could contribute to age-related deficits in speech comprehension in spatially variable listening situations.

Single Trial Predictors for Gating Motor-Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces Based on Sensorimotor Rhythm and Visual Evoked Potentials	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electroencephalography; motor-imagery; visual evoked potential	EEG; COMMUNICATION; EXCITABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; SELECTION; SYSTEM	For brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that utilize visual cues to direct the user, the neural signals extracted by the computer are representative of ongoing processes, visual evoked responses, and voluntary modulation. We proposed to use three brain signatures for predicting success on a single trial of a BCI task. The first two features, the amplitude and phase of the pre-trial mu amplitude, were chosen as a correlate for cortical excitability. The remaining feature, related to the visually evoked response to the cue, served as a possible measure of fixation and attention to the task. Of these three features, mu rhythm amplitude over the central electrodes at the time of cue presentation and to a lesser extent the single trial visual evoked response were correlated with the success on the subsequent imagery task. Despite the potential for gating trials using these features, an offline gating simulation was limited in its ability to produce an increase in device throughput. This discrepancy highlights a distinction between the identification of predictive features, and the use of this knowledge in an online BCI. Using such a system, we cannot assume that the user will respond similarly when faced with a scenario where feedback is altered by trials that are gated on a regular basis. The results of this study suggest the possibility of using individualized, pre-task neural signatures for personalized, and asynchronous (self-paced) BCI applications, although these effects need to be quantified in a real-time adaptive scenario in a future study.

Similar Spectral Power Densities Within the Schumann Resonance and a Large Population of Quantitative Electroencephalographic Profiles: Supportive Evidence for Koenig and Pobachenko	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EARTH-IONOSPHERE CAVITY; GEOMAGNETIC-ACTIVITY; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; BRAIN; EEG; STATES; OSCILLATIONS	In 1954 and 1960 Koenig and his colleagues described the remarkable similarities of spectral power density profiles and patterns between the earth-ionosphere resonance and human brain activity which also share magnitudes for both electric field (mV/m) and magnetic field (pT) components. In 2006 Pobachenko and colleagues reported real time coherence between variations in the Schumann and brain activity spectra within the 6-16 Hz band for a small sample. We examined the ratios of the average potential differences (similar to 3 mu V) obtained by whole brain quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) between rostral- caudal and left-right (hemispheric) comparisons of 238 measurements from 184 individuals over a 3.5 year period. Spectral densities for the rostral-caudal axis revealed a powerful peak at 10.25 Hz while the left-right peak was 1.95 Hz with beat-differences of similar to 7.5 to 8 Hz. When global cerebral measures were employed, the first (7-8 Hz), second (13-14 Hz) and third (19-20 Hz) harmonics of the Schumann resonances were discernable in averaged QEEG profiles in some but not all participants. The intensity of the endogenous Schumann resonance was related to the 'best-of-fitness' of the traditional 4-class microstate model. Additional measurements demonstrated real-time coherence for durations approximating microstates in spectral power density variations between Schumann frequencies measured in Sudbury, Canada and Cumiana, Italy with the QEEGs of local subjects. Our results confirm the measurements reported by earlier researchers that demonstrated unexpected similarities in the spectral patterns and strengths of electromagnetic fields generated by the human brain and the earth-ionospheric cavity.

These microstates may also cause the loss in sleep quality experienced by individuals suffering from insomnia. To distinguish such pathological awakenings from physiological ones, differences in alpha-wave characteristics between transient awakening and wakefulness observed before the onset of sleep were studied. In polysomnographic datasets of sleep-healthy participants (n = 18) and patients with insomnia (n = 10), alpha waves were extracted from the relaxed, wake state before sleep onset, wake after sleep-onset periods and arousals of sleep. In these, alpha frequency and variability were determined as the median and standard deviation of inverse peak-to-peak intervals. Before sleep onset, patients with insomnia showed a decreased alpha variability compared with healthy participants (P < 0.05). After sleep onset, both groups showed patterns of decreased alpha frequency that was lower for wake after sleep-onset periods of shorter duration. For patients with insomnia, alpha variability increased for short wake after sleep-onset periods. Major differences between the two groups were encountered during arousal. In particular, the alpha frequency in patients with insomnia rebounded to wake levels, while the frequency in healthy participants remained at the reduced level of short wake after sleep-onset periods. Reductions in alpha frequency during wake after sleep-onset periods may be related to the microstate between sleep and wakefulness that was described for such brief awakenings. Reduced alpha variability before sleep may indicate a dysfunction of the alpha generation mechanism in insomnia. Alpha characteristics may also prove valuable in the study of other sleep and attention disorders.	[Schwabedal, Justus T.

When Synchronizing to Rhythms Is Not a Good Thing: Modulations of Preparatory and Post-Target Neural Activity When Shifting Attention Away from On-Beat Times of a Distracting Rhythm	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; EEG; oscillations; rhythms; temporal predictions	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL EXPECTATION; MECHANISM; DESYNCHRONIZATION; PROBABILITY; ENTRAINMENT; COMPONENTS; AUDITION	Environmental rhythms potently drive predictive resource allocation in time, typically leading to perceptual and motor benefits for on-beat, relative to off-beat, times, even if the rhythmic stream is not intentionally used. In two human EEG experiments, we investigated the behavioral and electrophysiological expressions of using rhythms to direct resources away from on-beat times. This allowed us to distinguish goal-directed attention from the automatic capture of attention by rhythms. The following three conditions were compared: (1) a rhythmic stream with targets appearing frequently at a fixed off-beat position; (2) a rhythmic stream with targets appearing frequently at on-beat times; and (3) a nonrhythmic stream with matched target intervals. Shifting resources away from on-beat times was expressed in the slowing of responses to on-beat targets, but not in the facilitation of off-beat targets. The shifting of resources was accompanied by anticipatory adjustment of the contingent negative variation (CNV) buildup toward the expected off-beat time. In the second experiment, off-beat times were jittered, resulting in a similar CNV adjustment and also in preparatory amplitude reduction of beta-band activity. Thus, the CNV and beta activity track the relevance of time points and not the rhythm, given sufficient incentive. Furthermore, the effects of task relevance (appearing in a task-relevant vs irrelevant time) and rhythm (appearing on beat vs off beat) had additive behavioral effects and also dissociable neural manifestations in target-evoked activity: rhythm affected the target response as early as the P1 component, while relevance affected only the later N2 and P3. Thus, these two factors operate by distinct mechanisms.

It has been argued that this tracking reflects a process of phase-locking to the fluctuations of stimulus energy, ensuring that this energy arrives during periods of high neuronal excitability. Because all acoustic stimuli are decomposed into spectral channels at the cochlea, and this spectral decomposition is maintained along the ascending auditory pathway and into auditory cortex, we hypothesized that the overall stimulus envelope is not as relevant to cortical processing as the individual frequency channels; attention may be mediating envelope tracking differentially across these spectral channels. To test this we reanalyzed data reported by Horton et al. (2013), where high-density EEG was recorded while adults attended to one of two competing naturalistic speech streams. In order to simulate cochlear filtering, the stimuli were passed through a gammatone filterbank, and temporal envelopes were extracted at each filter output. Following Horton et al. (2013), the attended and unattended envelopes were cross-correlated with the EEG, and local maxima were extracted at three different latency ranges corresponding to distinct peaks in the cross-correlation function (N1, P2, and N2). We found that the ratio between the attended and unattended cross-correlation functions varied across frequency channels in the N1 latency range, consistent with the hypothesis that attention differentially modulates envelope-tracking activity across spectral channels.

EEG and MEG have excellent temporal resolution at millisecond scale but their spatial resolution is limited due to the volume conduction effect. We have exploited sparse signal processing techniques in this study to impose sparsity on the underlying source and its transformation in other domains (mathematical domains, like spatial gradient). Using an iterative reweighting strategy to penalize locations that are less likely to contain any source, it is shown that the proposed iteratively reweighted edge sparsity minimization (IRES) strategy can provide reasonable information regarding the location and extent of the underlying sources. This approach is unique in the sense that it estimates extended sources without the need of subjectively thresholding the solution. The performance of IRES was evaluated in a series of computer simulations. Different parameters such as source location and signal-to-noise ratio were varied and the estimated results were compared to the targets using metrics such as localization error (LE), area under curve (AUC) and overlap between the estimated and simulated sources. It is shown that IRES provides extended solutions which not only localize the source but also provide estimation for the source extent. The performance of IRES was further tested in epileptic patients undergoing intracranial EEG (iEEG) recording for pre-surgical evaluation. IRES was applied to scalp EEGs during interictal spikes, and results were compared with iEEG and surgical resection outcome in the patients. The pilot clinical study results are promising and demonstrate a good concordance between noninvasive IRES source estimation with iEEG and surgical resection outcomes in the same patients. The proposed algorithm, i.e. IRES, estimates extended source solutions from scalp electromagnetic signals which provide relatively accurate information about the location and extent of the underlying source.

Influential approaches to joint action have conceptualized these capacities in relation to the separate constructs of co-representation (knowledge) and self-other entrainment (coordination). Here we investigated how brain mechanisms involved in co-representation and entrainment interact to support joint action. To do so, we used a musical joint action paradigm to show that the neural mechanisms underlying co-representation and self-other entrainment are linked via a process indexed by EEG alpha oscillations regulating the balance between self-other integration and segregation in real time. Pairs of pianists performed short musical items while action familiarity and interpersonal (behavioral) synchronization accuracy were manipulated in a factorial design. Action familiarity referred to whether or not pianists had rehearsed the musical material performed by the other beforehand. Interpersonal synchronization was manipulated via congruent or incongruent tempo change instructions that biased performance timing towards the impending, new tempo. It was observed that, when pianists were familiar with each other's parts, millisecond variations in interpersonal synchronized behavior were associated with a modulation of alpha power over right centro-parietal scalp regions. Specifically, high behavioral entrainment was associated with self-other integration, as indexed by alpha suppression. Conversely, low behavioral entrainment encouraged reliance on internal knowledge and thus led to self other segregation, indexed by alpha enhancement. These findings suggest that alpha oscillations index the processing of information about self and other depending on the compatibility of internal knowledge and external (environmental) events at finely resolved timescales.

Scale-Free Neural and Physiological Dynamics in Naturalistic Stimuli Processing	ENEURO			English	Article						alpha oscillations; arrhythmic brain activity; heart rate variability; natural stimuli; scale-free dynamics; slow cortical potentials	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; FREE BRAIN ACTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; 1/F NOISE; NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR; PREDICT; ALPHA; EEG	Neural activity recorded at multiple spatiotemporal scales is dominated by arrhythmic fluctuations without a characteristic temporal periodicity. Such activity often exhibits a 1/f-type power spectrum, in which power falls off with increasing frequency following a power-law function: P(f) proportional to 1/f(beta), which is indicative of scale-free dynamics. Two extensively studied forms of scale-free neural dynamics in the human brain are slow cortical potentials (SCPs)-the low-frequency (<5 Hz) component of brain field potentials-and the amplitude fluctuations of alpha-oscillations, both of which have been shown to carry important functional roles. In addition, scale-free dynamics characterize normal human physiology such as heartbeat dynamics. However, the exact relationships among these scale-free neural and physiological dynamics remain unclear. We recorded simultaneous magnetoencephalography and electrocardiography in healthy subjects in the resting state and while performing a discrimination task on scale-free dynamical auditory stimuli that followed different scale-free statistics. We observed that long-range temporal correlation (captured by the power-law exponent beta) in SCPs positively correlated with that of heartbeat dynamics across time within an individual and negatively correlated with that of alpha-amplitude fluctuations across individuals. In addition, across individuals, long-range temporal correlation of both SCP and alpha-oscillation amplitude predicted subjects' discrimination performance in the auditory task, albeit through antagonistic relationships. These findings reveal interrelations among different scale-free neural and physiological dynamics and initial evidence for the involvement of scale-free neural dynamics in the processing of natural stimuli, which often exhibit scale-free dynamics.

Different Stimulation Frequencies Alter Synchronous Fluctuations in Motor Evoked Potential Amplitude of Intrinsic Hand Muscles-a TMS Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial magnetic stimulation; cortical oscillations; motor-evoked potential; motor cortex; first dorsal interosseous; abductor pollicis brevis; abductor digiti minimi	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; BLOOD-OXYGENATION; CROSS-TALK; CORTEX; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES	The amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) varies from trial-to-trial. Synchronous oscillations in cortical neuronal excitability contribute to this variability, however it is not known how different frequencies of stimulation influence MEP variability, and whether these oscillations are rhythmic or aperiodic. We stimulated the motor cortex with TMS at different regular (i.e., rhythmic) rates, and compared this with pseudo-random (aperiodic) timing. In 18 subjects, TMS was applied at three regular frequencies (0.05 Hz, 0.2 Hz, 1 Hz) and one aperiodic frequency (mean 0.2 Hz). MEPs (n = 50) were recorded from three intrinsic hand muscles of the left hand with different functional and anatomical relations. MEP amplitude correlation was highest for the functionally related muscle pair, less for the anatomically related muscle pair and least for the functionally- and anatomically unrelated muscle pair. MEP correlations were greatest with 1 Hz, and least for stimulation at 0.05 Hz. Corticospinal neuron synchrony is higher with shorter TMS intervals. Further, corticospinal neuron synchrony is similar irrespective of whether the stimulation is periodic or aperiodic. These findings suggest TMS frequency is a crucial consideration for studies using TMS to probe correlated activity between muscle pairs.

However, knowledge about brain function in children with disorders of consciousness (DOC) is very limited. We suggest that EEG recordings during sleep are a promising approach. In healthy adults as well as in children, it has been shown that the activity of sleep slow waves (EEG spectral power 1-4.5 Hz), the primary characteristic of deep sleep, is dependent on use during previous wakefulness. Thus the regulation of slow wave activity (SWA) provides indirect insights into brain function during wakefulness. Methods: In the present study, we investigated high-density EEG recordings during sleep in ten healthy children and in ten children with acquired brain injury, including five children with DOC and five children with acquired brain injury without DOC. We used the build-up of SWA to quantify SWA regulation. Results: Children with DOC showed a global reduction in the SWA build-up when compared to both, healthy children and children with acquired brain injury without DOC. This reduction was most pronounced over parietal brain areas. Comparisons within the group of children with DOC revealed that the parietal SWA build-up was the lowest in patients showing poor outcome. Longitudinal measurements during the recovery period showed an increase in parietal SWA build-up from the first to the second sleep recording. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the reduced parietal SWA regulation may represent a characteristic topographical marker for brain network dysfunction in children with DOC. In the future, the regulation of SWA might be used as a complementary assessment in adult and paediatric patients with DOC. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Increased Sleep Depth in Developing Neural Networks: New Insights from Sleep Restriction in Children	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain development; myelin; sleep deprivation; sleep EEG; high density EEG; slow wave activity; brain maturation; mcDESPOT	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; WHITE-MATTER; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; ADOLESCENT BRAIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; TOPOGRAPHY	Brain networks respond to sleep deprivation or restriction with increased sleep depth, which is quantified as slow-wave activity (SWA) in the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). When adults are sleep deprived, this homeostatic response is most pronounced over prefrontal brain regions. However, it is unknown how children's developing brain networks respond to acute sleep restriction, and whether this response is linked to myelination, an ongoing process in childhood that is critical for brain development and cortical integration. We implemented a bedtime delay protocol in 5- to 12-year old children to obtain partial sleep restriction (1-night; 50% of their habitual sleep). High-density sleep EEG was assessed during habitual and restricted sleep and brain myelin content was obtained using mcDESPOT magnetic resonance imaging. The effect of sleep restriction was analyzed using statistical non-parametric mapping with supra-threshold cluster analysis. We observed a localized homeostatic SWA response following sleep restriction in a specific parieto-occipital region. The restricted/habitual SWA ratio was negatively associated with myelin water fraction in the optic radiation, a developing fiber bundle. This relationship occurred bilaterally over parieto-temporal areas and was adjacent to, but did not overlap with the parieto-occipital region showing the most pronounced homeostatic SWA response. These results provide evidence for increased sleep need in posterior neural networks in children. Sleep need in parieto-temporal areas is related to myelin content, yet it remains speculative whether age-related myelin growth drives the fading of the posterior homeostatic SWA response during the transition to adulthood. Whether chronic insufficient sleep in the sensitive period of early life alters the anatomical generators of deep sleep slow-waves is an important unanswered question.

Behavioural, brain and cardiac responses to hypobaric hypoxia in broiler chickens	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Hypobaric hypoxia; Low atmosphere pressure stunning; Behaviour; Electroencephalogram; Electrocardiogram; Animal welfare	PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; MEAT QUALITY; HEART-RATE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SLAUGHTER; INSENSIBILITY; VOCALIZATION; STIMULATION; ANIMALS; POULTRY	A novel approach to pre-slaughter stunning of chickens has been developed in which birds are rendered unconscious by progressive hypobaric hypoxia. Termed Low Atmospheric Pressure Stunning (LAPS), this approach involves application of gradual decompression lasting 280 s according to a prescribed curve. We examined responses to LAPS by recording behaviour, electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) in individual male chickens, and interpreted these with regard to the welfare impact of the process. We also examined the effect of two temperature adjusted pressure curves on these responses. Broiler chickens were exposed to LAPS in 30 triplets (16 and 14 triplets assigned to each pressure curve). In each triplet, one bird was instrumented for recording of EEG and ECG while the behaviour of all three birds was observed. Birds showed a consistent sequence of behaviours during LAPS (ataxia, loss of posture, clonic convulsions and motionless) which were observed in all birds. Leg paddling, tonic convulsions, slow wing flapping, mandibulation, head shaking, open bill breathing, deep inhalation, jumping and vocalisation were observed in a proportion of birds. Spectral analysis of EEG responses at 2 s intervals throughout LAPS revealed progressive decreases in median frequency at the same time as corresponding progressive increases in total power, followed later by decreases in total power as all birds exhibited isoelectric EEG and died. There was a very pronounced increase in total power at 50-60 s into the LAPS cycle, which corresponded to dominance of the signal by high amplitude slow waves, indicating loss of consciousness. Slow wave EEG was seen early in the LAPS process, before behavioural evidence of loss of consciousness such as ataxia and loss of posture, almost certainly due to the fact that it was completely dark in the LAPS chamber. ECG recordings showed a pronounced bradycardia (starting on average 49.6 s into LAPS), often associated with arrhythmia, until around 60 s into LAPS when heart rate levelled off. There was a good correlation between behavioural, EEG and cardiac measures in relation to loss of consciousness which collectively provide a loss of consciousness estimate of around 60 s. There were some effects of temperature adjusted pressure curves on behavioural latencies and ECG responses, but in general responses were consistent and very similar to those reported in previous research on controlled atmosphere stunning with inert gases. The results suggest that the process is humane (slaughter without avoidable fear, anxiety, pain, suffering and distress). In particular, the maintenance of slow wave EEG patterns in the early part of LAPS (while birds are still conscious) is strongly suggestive that LAPS is non-aversive, since we would expect this to be interrupted by pain or discomfort.

Computational Modeling of High Frequency Oscillations recorded with clinical intracranial macroelectrodes	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			EPILEPSY; EEG	High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) are a potential biomarker of epileptogenic regions. They have been extensively investigated in terms of automatic detection, classification and feature extraction. However, the mechanisms governing the generation of HFOs as well as the observability conditions on clinical intracranial macroelectrodes remain elusive. In this paper, we propose a novel physiologicallyrelevant macroscopic model for accurate simulation of HFOs as invasively recorded in epileptic patients. This model accounts for both the temporal and spatial properties of the cortical patch at the origin of epileptiform activity. Indeed, neuronal populations are combined with a 3D geometrical representation to simulate an extended epileptic source. Then, by solving the forward problem, the contributions of neuronal population signals are projected onto intracerebral electrode contacts. The obtained signals are qualitatively and quantitatively compared to real HFOs, and a relationship is drawn between macroscopic model parameters such as synchronization and spatial extent on the one hand, and HFO features such as the wave and fast ripple (200-600 Hz) components, on the other hand.

In this study, using biophysically realistic models of the thalamocortical network, we identified the critical intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms, associated with the putative action of acetylcholine (ACh), GABA and monoamines, which lead to transitions between primary brain vigilance states (waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep [NREM] and REM sleep) within an ultradian cycle. Using ECoG recordings from humans and LFP recordings from cats and mice, we found that during NREM sleep the power of spindle and delta oscillations is negatively correlated in humans and positively correlated in animal recordings. We explained this discrepancy by the differences in the relative level of ACh. Overall, our study revealed the critical intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms through which different neuromodulators acting in combination result in characteristic brain EEG rhythms and transitions between sleep stages.

Modern views suggest that neuronal oscillations do not only reflect coordinated activity in spatially distributed networks, but also that there is interaction between the oscillations at different frequencies. For example, invasive recordings in animals and humans have found that the amplitude of fast oscillations (>40 Hz) occur non-uniformly within the phase of slower oscillations, forming the so-called cross-frequency coupling (CFC). However, the CFC patterns might be influenced by features in the signal that do not relate to underlying physiological interactions. For example, CFC estimates may be sensitive to spectral correlations due to non-sinusoidal properties of the alpha band wave morphology. To investigate this issue, we performed CFC analysis using experimental and synthetic data. The former consisted in a double-blind magnetoencephalography pharmacological study in which participants received either placebo, 0.5 or 1.5 mg of lorazepam (LZP; (GABAergic enhancer) in different experimental sessions. By recording oscillatory brain activity with during rest and working memory (WM), we were able to demonstrate that posterior alpha (8-12 Hz) phase was coupled to beta-low gamma band (20-45 Hz) amplitude envelope during all sessions. Importantly, bicoherence values around the harmonics of the alpha frequency were similar both in magnitude and topographic distribution to the cross-frequency coherence (CFCoh) values observed in the alpha-phase to beta-low gamma coupling. In addition, despite the large CFCoh we found no significant cross-frequency directionality (CFO). Critically, simulations demonstrated that a sizable part of our empirical CFCoh between alpha and beta-low gamma coupling and the lack of CFD could be explained by two-three harmonics aligned in zero phase-lag produced by the physiologically characteristic alpha asymmetry in the amplitude of the peaks relative to the troughs. Furthermore, we showed that periodic signals whose waveform deviate from pure sine waves produce non-zero CFCoh with predictable CFD. Our results reveal the important role of the non-sinusoidal wave morphology on state of the art CFC metrics and we recommend caution with strong physiological interpretations of CFC and suggest basic data quality checks to enhance the mechanistic understanding of CFC.

The goal of this paper was to investigate whether determiner selection follows serially after lexical selection, or whether there is cascading. If there is cascading, the additional goal was to determine whether the selection of the correct determiner involves a competitive process. A go-nogo picture-word interference task was therefore performed in which gender congruency and categorical relation between distractor and target was manipulated and EEG was recorded. The ERP analysis showed that categorical relatedness helped determiner selection on gender congruent trials, but hindered on incongruent trials. This indicates that lexical selection and determiner selection overlap in time, and suggest that determiner selection is a competitive process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The recording of the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) makes it possible to estimate specific features of the nervous system, and in particular the activity of the human brain. Purpose: This study is aimed at investigating the brain in women with a high or a low individual alpha-frequency (l alpha F), determined in a quiescent state during low-frequency acoustic stimulation. Methods: The study group consisted of 113 right-handed healthy women in the age group 19-21 years. The study group was divided into 2 categories in terms of the average magnitude of l alpha F - groups with high (n = 59, l alpha F >= 10.25 Hz) and low (n = 54, I alpha F <= 10.25 Hz) values of l alpha F. The power and coherence of electrical activity of the cerebral cortex as well as the differences between the groups were evaluated in a quiescent state during low-frequency acoustic stimulation. Results: In case of low-frequency acoustic stimulation, a high rate of EEG theta-, beta 2-power, gamma-waves in the . cortex, alpha 1-oscillations - in frontal areas were registered in women with a high alpha-frequency, while the power alpha 2-, alpha 3- and beta 1-activity became lower in the cortex. Women with a low alpha-frequency had a decrease of the cerebral cortex alpha-theta-, alpha- and beta-activity. This was recorded as more generalized, and the expression of gamma-waves was more localized. All the participants had increased values of coherence of the EEG frequency components in the cortex. Some overexertion on the right side was detected in the right hemisphere posterior structures. Some local reduction of the coherence of theta-, alpha 1-, alpha 3-oscillations was found in women with a high alpha-frequency and alpha 1-activity among the study group members with a low alpha-frequency in the frontal and anterior temporal areas. Conclusion: The establishment of common factors in the study group is an important step towards defining clear prognostic criteria for the physiological capabilities of people based on the congenital features of brain function.

SE is a serious emergency condition that requires immediate intervention; therefore, identifying SE electrophysiological markers may translate in prompt care to stop it. Here, we analyzed the EEG signals recorded from the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex in rats that responded to systemic administration of 4-aminopyridine (4AP) by generating either isolated seizures or seizures progressing to SE. We found that high frequency oscillations (HFOs) - which can be categorized as ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) - had different patterns of occurrence in the two groups (n = 5 for each group). Specifically, fast ripples in CA3 and entorhinal cortex of the SE group occurred at higher rates than ripples, both during the ictal and post-ictal periods when compared to the HFOs recorded from the isolated seizure group. Our data reveal that different patterns of HFO occurrence can pinpoint seizures progressing to SE, thus suggesting the involvement of different neuronal networks at the termination of seizure discharges.

However, the quantitative differences in ERD values and affected frequency bands associated with the lower limb have not been discussed. The goal of this paper was to quantitatively compare the ERD patterns during active movement, passive movement and FES-induced movement of the lower limb. 64-channel EEG signals were recorded to investigate the brain oscillatory patterns during active movement, passive movement and FES-induced movement of the lower limb in twelve healthy subjects. And passive movement and FES-induced movement were also performed in a hemiplegic stroke patient. For healthy subjects, FES-induced movement presented significantly higher characteristic frequency of central beta ERD while there was no significant difference in ERD values compared with active or passive movement. Meanwhile, beta ERD values of FES-induced movement were significantly correlated with those of active movement, and spatial distribution of beta ERD pattern for FES-induced movement was more correlated with that for active movement. In addition, the stroke patient presented central ERD patterns during FES-induced movement, while no ERD with similar frequencies could be found during passive movement. This work implies that the EEG oscillatory pattern under FES-induced movement tends more towards active movement instead of passive movement. The quantification of ERD patterns could be expected as a potential technique to evaluate the brain response during FES-induced movement.

Oscillatory correlates of moral decision-making: Effect of personality	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Source localization; Personality; EEG; Moral dilemmas; Connectivity	BIG-5 FACTOR MARKERS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; 5-FACTOR MODEL; SUBSTANCE USE; CRYSTALLIZED INTELLIGENCE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BETA OSCILLATIONS; MODERATING ROLE	The role of emotion in moral decision-making is still a matter of debate. Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, and Cohen (2001) argue that 'personal' moral judgments are driven by emotional responses, while 'impersonal' judgments are largely driven by cognitive processes. In this study, oscillatory correlates of decision-making were compared in moral personal, moral impersonal, and nonmoral conditions, as well as in trials associated with utilitarian (i.e., favoring the 'greater good' over individual rights) and non-utilitarian choices. Event-related synchronization in delta and theta bands was greater in the right temporal lobe in personal than in both nonmoral and impersonal moral condition. Graph-theoretical analysis of connectivity patterns showed the prominent role of the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices in personal moral decision-making, implying greater emotional and self-processing. Higher conscientiousness and intellect and lower behavioral activation were associated with greater difference in oscillatory responses between utilitarian and non-utilitarian choices in personal than in impersonal condition, indicating that sensitivity to moral issues and the ability to grasp the nuances of moral situation are essential for understanding the implications of utilitarian choices in personal and impersonal conditions.

However, knowledge on the neurophysiology and functional neuroanatomy on response inhibition is biased because studies usually employ experimental paradigms (e.g., sustained attention to response task, SART) in which behavior is susceptible to impulsive errors. Here, we investigate whether there are differences in neurophysiological mechanisms and networks depending on the response mode that predominates behavior in a response inhibition task. We do so comparing a SART with a traditionally formatted task paradigm. We use EEG-beamforming in two tasks inducing opposite response modes during action selection. We focus on theta frequency modulations, since these are implicated in cognitive control processes. The results show that a response mode that is susceptible to impulsive errors (response mode used in the SART) is associated with stronger theta band activity in the left temporo-parietal junction. The results suggest that the response modes applied during response inhibition differ in the encoding of surprise signals, or related processes of attentional sampling. Response modes during response inhibition seem to differ in processes necessary to update task representations relevant to behavioral control.

T-type calcium channel blocker Z944 restores cortical synchrony and thalamocortical connectivity in a rat model of neuropathic pain	PAIN			English	Article						Oscillation; T-type calcium; Power; Synchrony; Coherence; Phase-amplitude coupling	THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; NEURONS; EEG; POTENTIALS; STIMULATION; MEDIODORSAL	Oscillations are fundamental to communication between neuronal ensembles. We previously reported that pain in awake rats enhances synchrony in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and attenuates coherence between S1 and ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamus. Here, we asked whether similar changes occur in anesthetized rats and whether pain modulates phase-amplitude coupling between VPL and S1. We also hypothesized that the suppression of burst firing in VPL using Z944, a novel T-type calcium channel blocker, restores S1 synchrony and thalamocortical connectivity. Local field potentials were recorded from S1 and VPL in anesthetized rats 7 days after sciatic chronic constriction injury (CCI). In rats with CCI, low-frequency (4-12 Hz) synchrony in S1 was enhanced, whereas VPL-S1 coherence and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were attenuated. Moreover, Granger causality showed decreased informational flow from VPL to S1. Systemic or intrathalamic delivery of Z944 to rats with CCI normalized these changes. Systemic Z944 also reversed thermal hyperalgesia and conditioned place preference. These data suggest that pain-induced cortical synchrony and thalamocortical disconnectivity are directly related to burst firing in VPL.

A General Approach for Quantifying Nonlinear Connectivity in the Nervous System Based on Phase Coupling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Phase coupling; nonlinear interaction; motor control; time delay; EEG; EMG	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ORDER SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; EEG; COHERENCE; OSCILLATIONS	Interaction between distant neuronal populations is essential for communication within the nervous system and can occur as a highly nonlinear process. To better understand the functional role of neural interactions, it is important to quantify the nonlinear connectivity in the nervous system. We introduce a general approach to measure nonlinear connectivity through phase coupling: the multi-spectral phase coherence (MSPC). Using simulated data, we compare MSPC with existing phase coupling measures, namely n : m synchronization index and bi-phase locking value. MSPC provides a system description, including (i) the order of the nonlinearity, (ii) the direction of interaction, (iii) the time delay in the system, and both (iv) harmonic and (v) intermodulation coupling beyond the second order; which are only partly revealed by other methods. We apply MSPC to analyze data from a motor control experiment, where subjects performed isotonic wrist flexions while receiving movement perturbations. MSPC between the perturbation, EEG and EMG was calculated. Our results reveal directional nonlinear connectivity in the afferent and efferent pathways, as well as the time delay (43 +/- 8 ms) between the perturbation and the brain response. In conclusion, MSPC is a novel approach capable to assess high-order nonlinear interaction and timing in the nervous system.

The aim of this study was to investigate task-related changes in brain activity and functional connectivity by applying different methods namely event-related desynchronization (ERD), coherence, and graph-theoretical analysis to electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, for comparing their respective descriptive power and complementarity. As it is well known, ERD provides an estimate of differences in power spectral densities between active (or task) and rest conditions, functional connectivity allows assessing the level of synchronization between the signals recorded at different scalp locations and graph analysis enables the estimation of the functional network features and topology. EEG activity was recorded on 10 subjects during left/right arm movements. The theta, alpha, and beta bands were considered. Conventional analysis showed a significant ERD in both alpha and beta bands over the sensorimotor cortex during the left arm movement and in beta band during the right arm movement, besides identifying the regions involved in the task, as it was expected. On the other hand, connectivity assessment highlighted that stronger connections are those that involved the motor regions for which graph analysis revealed reduced accessibility and an increased centrality during the movement. Jointly, the last two methods allow identifying the cortical areas that are functionally related in the active condition as well as the topological organization of the functional network. Results support the hypothesis that network analysis brings complementary knowledge with respect to established approaches for modeling motor-induced functional connectivity and could be profitably exploited in clinical contexts.

The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP) examines the outcomes for children originally placed in institutions who were assessed comprehensively and then randomized to foster care (FCG) or care as usual (CAUG) and followed longitudinally. Here we report on the brain electrical activity (electroencephalogram: EEG) of 12-year-old children enrolled in the BEIP. Previous reports suggested improvement in resting EEG activity for the group of children placed in the foster care intervention, particularly those placed before 24 months of age compared to children who were randomized to CAUG or those placed into families after this age. At 12 years, differences between those in the FCG and those in the CAUG persist in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), but not in higher frequency bands (i.e. in the beta band; 15-30 Hz), except in those children placed into the FCG who remained in high quality care environments over the course of the study. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining a stable high quality caregiving environment, particularly for children exposed to early psychosocial deprivation, for promoting healthy brain development.

Motor-cortical single neurons are more closely related to hand movement velocity than speed, that is, the magnitude of the (directional) velocity vector. Recently, there is also increasing interest in the representation of movement parameters in neuronal population activity, such as reflected in the intracranial EEG (iEEG). We show that in iEEG, contrasting to what has been previously found on the single neuron level, speed predominates over velocity. The predominant speed representation was present in nearly all iEEG signal features, up to the 600-1000 Hz range. Using a model of motor-cortical signals arising from neuronal populations with realistic single neuron tuning properties, we show how this reversal can be understood as a consequence of increasing population size. Our findings demonstrate that the information profile in large population signals may systematically differ from the single neuron level, a principle that may be helpful in the interpretation of neuronal population signals in general, including, for example, EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Taking advantage of the robust speed population signal may help in developing brain-machine interfaces exploiting population signals.

Alpha oscillation neurofeedback modulates amygdala complex connectivity and arousal in posttraumatic stress disorder	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Electroencephalogram; Functional MRI; Functional connectivity; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Amygdala	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE METAANALYSIS; CINGULATE CORTEX; FEAR; STATE; FMRI; ACTIVATION; NETWORKS; PTSD; MEMORY	Objective: Electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback aimed at reducing the amplitude of the alpha-rhythm has been shown to alter neural networks associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), leading to symptom alleviation. Critically, the amygdala is thought to be one of the central brain regions mediating PTSD symptoms. In the current study, we compare directly patterns of amygdala complex connectivity using fMRI, before and after EEG neurofeedback, in order to observe subcortical mechanisms associated with behavioural and alpha oscillatory changes among patients. Method: We examined basolateral (BLA), centromedial (CMA), and superficial (SFA) amygdala complex resting-state functional connectivity using a seed-based approach via SPM Anatomy Toolbox. Amygdala complex connectivity was measured in twenty-one individuals with PTSD, before and after a 30-minute session of EEG neurofeedback targeting alpha desynchronization. Results: EEG neurofeedback was associated with a shift in amygdala complex connectivity from areas implicated in defensive, emotional, and fear processing/memory retrieval (left BLA and left SFA to the periaqueductal gray, and left SFA to the left hippocampus) to prefrontal areas implicated in emotion regulation/modulation (right CMA to the medial prefrontal cortex). This shift in amygdala complex connectivity was associated with reduced arousal, greater resting alpha synchronization, and was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity. Conclusion: These findings have significant implications for developing targeted non-invasive treatment interventions for PTSD patients that utilize alpha oscillatory neurofeedback, showing evidence of neuronal reconfiguration between areas highly implicated in the disorder, in addition to acute symptom alleviation.

Frontal-midline theta and alpha power were examined to assess monitoring processes and cortical inhibition, respectively. Thirteen experienced biathletes (mean age: 17 years; 5 males, 8 females) fired sets of five consecutive shots from the standing position at a 50-meter-distant target, under two fixed-order conditions: (i) at rest and (ii) immediately after 3-minute exercise on a bicycle ergometer at 90% of maximum heart rate (HR). HR and rate of physical exertion (RPE) were measured as manipulation checks. Shooting accuracy was assessed in target rings for each shot. Frontal-midline theta and alpha power were computed in the last second preceding each shot from average-reference 61-channel EEG and inter-individual differences were minimized through a median-scaled log transformation (Appendix). HR and RPE increased under cardiovascular load, however, shooting accuracy did not change. Pre-shooting frontal-midline theta power decreased, whereas alpha power increased over temporal and occipital - but not central - regions. These changes were larger for greater HR values. Additionally, higher frontal-midline theta, lower left-central alpha, and higher left-temporal alpha power were associated with more accurate shooting. These findings suggest that monitoring processes are beneficial to shooting performance but can be impaired by sub-maximal cardiovascular load. Greater inhibition of movement-irrelevant regions (temporal, occipital) and concomitant activation of movement-related regions (central) indicate that greater neural efficiency is beneficial to shooting performance and can allow trained biathletes to shoot accurately despite physically demanding conditions.

J	Spironelli, C; Busenello, J; Angrilli, A				Spironelli, Chiara; Busenello, Jessica; Angrilli, Alessandro			Supine posture inhibits cortical activity: Evidence from Delta and Alpha EEG bands	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Resting state; Body posture; Cortical inhibition; FFT analysis; Microgravity	SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; POSITION; WAKEFULNESS; ACTIVATION; CHILDREN	Past studies have shown consistent evidence that body position significantly affects brain activity, revealing that both head-down and horizontal bed-rest are associated with cortical inhibition and altered perceptual and cognitive processing. The present study investigates the effects of body position on spontaneous, open-eyes, resting-state EEG cortical activity in 32 young women randomly assigned to one of two conditions, seated position (SP) or horizontal bed rest (BR). A between-group repeated-measure experimental design was used, EEG recordings were made from 38 scalp locations, and low-frequency (delta and alpha) amplitudes of the two groups were compared in four different conditions: when both groups (a) were seated (TO), (b) assumed two different body positions (seated vs. supine conditions, immediate [T1] and 120 min later [T2]), and (c) were seated again (T3). Overall, the results showed no a priori between-group differences (TO) before experimental manipulation. As expected, delta amplitude, an index of cortical inhibition in awake resting participants, was significantly increased in group BR, revealing both rapid (T1) and mid-term (T2) inhibitory effects of supine or horizontal positions. Instead, the alpha band was highly sensitive to postural transitions, perhaps due to baroreceptor intervention and, unlike the delta band, underwent habituation and decreased after a 2-h bed rest. These results indicate clear-cut differences at rest between the seated and supine positions, thus supporting the view that the role of body position in the differences found between brain metabolic methods (fMRI and PET) in which participants lie horizontally, and EEG-MEG-TMS techniques with participants in a seated position, has been largely underestimated so far.

We provide a few new results indicating that, in models at least, spatial quasipatterns of quasicycles can occur, and resemble patterns observed in other areas, such as predator-prey systems and chemical reactions.

Spectral entropy feature subset selection using SEPCOR to detect alcoholic impact on gamma sub band visual event related potentials of multichannel electroencephalograms (EEG)	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Visual event related potentials (ERP); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Spectral entropy; Gamma sub band; Separability & Correlation (SEPCOR); Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network; k-Nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers; Independent Component Analysis (ICA)	SIGNALS; OSCILLATIONS; ARTIFACTS	The problem of analyzing and identifying regions of high discrimination between alcoholics and controls in a multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is modeled as a feature subset selection technique that can improve the recognition rate between both groups. Several studies have reported efficient detection of alcoholics by feature extraction and selection in gamma band visual event related potentials (ERP) of a multichannel EEG signal. However, in these studies the correlation between features and their class information is not considered for feature selection. This may lead to redundancy in the feature set and result in over fitting. Therefore in this study, a statistical feature selection technique based on Separability & Correlation analysis (SEPCOR) is proposed to select an optimal feature subset automatically that possesses minimum correlation between selected channels and maximum class separation. The optimal feature selection consists of a ranking method that assigns ranks to channels based on a variability measure (V-measure). From the ranked feature set of highly discriminative features, different subsets are automatically selected by heuristically applying a correlation threshold in steps from 0.02 to 0.1. These subsets are applied as input features to multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers to discriminate alcoholic and control visual ERP. Prior to feature selection, spectral entropy features are computed in gamma sub band (30-55 Hz) interval of a 61-channel multi-trial EEG signal with multiple object recognition tasks. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is performed on raw EEG data to remove eye blink, motion and muscle artifacts. Results indicate that both classifiers exhibit excellent classification accuracy of 99.6%, for a feature subset of 22 optimal channels with correlation threshold of 0.1. In terms of computation time, k-NN classifier outperforms multilayer perceptron-back propagation (MLP-BP) network with 7.93 s whereas MLP network takes 55 s to perform the recognition task with the same accuracy. Compared to feature section methods used in previous studies on the same EEG alcoholic database, there is a significant improvement in classification accuracy based on the proposed SEPCOR method.

Previous studies have mainly focused on using electroencephalograms (EEGs) for feedback evaluation in reinforcement learning tasks by measuring event related potentials. Few studies have investigated the time frequency (TF) profiles of a cue that manifested whether a following feedback is available or not after decision-making. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the TF profiles of the cue interact with different agents to whom the feedback related. In this study we used the TF approach to test EEG oscillations of the cue stimuli in three agents ('Self', 'Other', and 'Computer') conditions separately. The results showed that the increased central posterior delta power was elicited by the feedback unavailable cues more so than with the feedback available cue within 200-350 ms after the onset of the cue, but only in the self-condition. Moreover, a frontal-central theta oscillation had enhanced power when following the feedback unavailable cue as opposed to the feedback available cue across three agencies. These findings demonstrated that the cue for knowing an outcome produced reward prediction error-like signals, which were mirrored by the delta and theta oscillations during decision-making. More importantly, the present study demonstrated that the theta and delta oscillations reflected separable components of the advanced cue processing before the feedback in decision-making.

Bicycling and Walking are Associated with Different Cortical Oscillatory Dynamics	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; bicycling; walking; motor control; oscillations; sensorimotor cortex	MOVEMENT BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; SENSORIMOTOR EEG RHYTHMS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; TREADMILL WALKING; MOTOR CORTEX; SPATIOTEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; GAIT CYCLE	Although bicycling and walking involve similar complex coordinated movements, surprisingly Parkinson's patients with freezing of gait typically remain able to bicycle despite severe difficulties in walking. This observation suggests functional differences in the motor networks subserving bicycling and walking. However, a direct comparison of brain activity related to bicycling and walking has never been performed, neither in healthy participants nor in patients. Such a comparison could potentially help elucidating the cortical involvement in motor control and the mechanisms through which bicycling ability may be preserved in patients with freezing of gait. The aim of this study was to contrast the cortical oscillatory dynamics involved in bicycling and walking in healthy participants. To this end, EEG and EMG data of 14 healthy participants were analyzed, who cycled on a stationary bicycle at a slow cadence of 40 revolutions per minute (rpm) and walked at 40 strides per minute (spm), respectively. Relative to walking, bicycling was associated with a stronger power decrease in the high beta band (23-35 Hz) during movement initiation and execution, followed by a stronger beta power increase after movement termination. Walking, on the other hand, was characterized by a stronger and persisting alpha power (8-12 Hz) decrease. Both bicycling and walking exhibited movement cycle-dependent power modulation in the 24-40 Hz range that was correlated with EMG activity. This modulation was significantly stronger in walking. The present findings reveal differential cortical oscillatory dynamics in motor control for two types of complex coordinated motor behavior, i.e., bicycling and walking. Bicycling was associated with a stronger sustained cortical activation as indicated by the stronger high beta power decrease during movement execution and less cortical motor control within the movement cycle. We speculate this to be due to the more continuous nature of bicycling demanding less phase-dependent sensory processing and motor planning, as opposed to walking.

Comparison of functional connectivity within DMN subnets (measured by electroencephalogram operational synchrony in the three separate DMN modules) between five experienced meditators and 10 naive participants (who were about to start the meditation training) fully support the prediction. Interpretation that links such DMN subnets changes to the three-dimensional components of the experiential selfhood was proposed.

A recent and not yet fully understood example is the collapse of coexisting synchronous and asynchronous oscillations into a globally synchronous motion found in networks of identical oscillators. Here we show that this sudden collapse is promoted by a further decrease of synchronization, rather than by critically high synchronization. This strikingly counterintuitive mechanism can be found also in nature, as we demonstrate on epileptic seizures in humans. Analyzing spatiotemporal correlation profiles derived from intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) of seizures in epilepsy patients, we found a pronounced decrease of correlation at the seizure onsets. Applying our findings in a closed-loop control scheme to models of coupled oscillators in chimera states, we succeed in both provoking and preventing outbreaks of global synchronization. Our findings not only advance the understanding of networks of coupled dynamics but can open new ways to control them, thus offering a vast range of potential new applications.

Elucidating the neural bases of selective attention remains a key challenge for neuroscience and represents an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, knowledge about the cognitive and neural mechanisms of attention is essential for developing and refining brain-machine interfaces, and for advancing methods for training and education. We will discuss how functional imaging methods have helped us to understand fundamental aspects of attention: How attention is controlled, focused on relevant inputs, and reoriented, and how this control results in the selection of relevant information. Work from our groups and from others will be reviewed. We will focus on fMRI methods, but where appropriate will include related discussion of electromagnetic recording methods used in conjunction with fMRI, including simultaneous EEG/fMRI methods.

The selected population will be followed for 2-5 years after enrollment to investigate the epilepsy course and identify early predictors of drug resistance. MethodsIn this observational, multicenter, nationwide study, children (age 1 month-12.9 years) with a new diagnosis of symptomatic or presumed symptomatic focal epilepsy were consecutively enrolled in 15 Italian tertiary childhood epilepsy centers. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosis of symptomatic focal epilepsy due to acquired and developmental etiologies, and presumed symptomatic focal epilepsy; (2) age at diagnosis older than 1 month and <13 years; and (3) written informed consent. Children were subdivided into three groups: 3 years, >3 to 6 years, and >6 years. Clinical, electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging, and neuropsychological variables were identified for statistical analyses. ResultsTwo hundred fifty-nine children were enrolled (116 female and 143 male). Median age: 4.4 years (range 1 month-12.9 years); 46.0% (n = 119) of children were younger than 3 years, 24% (61) from 3 to 6 years of age, and 30% (79) older than 6 years. Neurologic examination findings were normal in 71.8%. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was abnormal in 59.9%. Children age 3 years experienced the highest seizure frequency in the first month after recruitment (p < 0.0001). Monotherapy in the first month was used in 67.2%. Cognitive tests at baseline revealed abnormal scores in 30%; behavioral problems were present in 21%. At multivariate analysis, higher chances to exhibit more than five seizures in the first month after epilepsy onset was confirmed for younger children and those with temporal lobe epilepsy. SignificanceIn this prospective cohort study, an extensive characterization of epilepsy onset in children with symptomatic or presumed symptomatic focal epilepsies is reported in relation to the age group and the localization of the epileptogenic zone.

Spectral Signatures of Saccade Target Selection	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Cortical saccade generation; Action selection; Gamma band activity; Intraparietal sulcus; Frontal eye fields; MEG	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; DECISION-MAKING; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; NEURAL BASIS; EEG	Action generation relies on a widely distributed network of brain areas. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal activity in the network that gives rise to voluntary action in humans. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and source analysis (n = 15, 7 female subjects) to investigate the spectral signatures of human cortical networks engaged in active and intrinsically motivated viewing behavior. We compared neuronal activity of externally cued saccades with saccades to freely chosen targets. For planning and execution of both saccade types, we found an increase in gamma band (similar to 64-128 Hz) activity and a concurrent decrease in beta band (similar to 12-32 Hz) activity in saccadic control areas, including the intraparietal sulcus and the frontal eye fields. Guided compared to voluntary actions were accompanied by stronger transient increases in the gamma and low frequency (< 16 Hz) range immediately following the instructional cue. In contrast, action selection between competing alternatives was reflected by stronger sustained fronto-parietal gamma increases that occurred later in time and persisted until movement execution. This sustained enhancement for free target selection was accompanied by a spatially widespread reduction of lower frequency power (similar to 8-45 Hz) in parietal and extrastriate areas. Our results suggest that neuronal population activity in the gamma frequency band in a distributed network of fronto-parietal areas reflects the intrinsically driven process of selection among competing behavioral alternatives.

Mismatch negativity: Alterations in adults from the general population who report subclinical psychotic symptoms	EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; Source analysis; Psychosis; EEG; General population; Biomarker	HIGH-RISK; FORECASTING PSYCHOSIS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DURATION; DEFICITS; EXPERIENCES; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; P3A	Background: Deficits of mismatch negativity (MMN) in schizophrenia and individuals at risk for psychosis have been replicated many times. Several studies have also demonstrated the occurrence of subclinical psychotic symptoms within the general population. However, none has yet investigated MMN in individuals from the general population who report subclinical psychotic symptoms. Methods: The MMN to duration-, frequency-, and intensity deviants was recorded in 217 nonclinical individuals classified into a control group (n = 72) and three subclinical groups: paranoid (n = 44), psychotic (n = 51), and mixed paranoid-psychotic (n = 50). Amplitudes of MMN at frontocentral electrodes were referenced to average. Based on a three-source model of MMN generation, we conducted an MMN source analysis and compared the amplitudes of surface electrodes and sources among groups. Results: We found no significant differences in MMN amplitudes of surface electrodes. However, significant differences in MMN generation among the four groups were revealed at the frontal source for duration-deviant stimuli (P = 0.01). We also detected a trend-level difference (P = 0.05) in MMN activity among those groups for frequency deviants at the frontal source. Conclusions: Individuals from the general population who report psychotic symptoms are a heterogeneous group. However, alterations exist in their frontal MMN activity. This increased activity might be an indicator of more sensitive perception regarding changes in the environment for individuals with subclinical psychotic symptoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

[MEG]PLS: A pipeline for MEG data analysis and partial least squares statistics	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Partial least squares; Multivariate statistics; Beamformer; Source analysis; Networks	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL INTERACTIONS; SPATIAL FILTERS; BRAIN; EEG; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SOFTWARE; MEMORY	The emphasis of modern neurobiological theories has recently shifted from the independent function of brain areas to their interactions in the context of whole-brain networks. As a result, neuroimaging methods and analyses have also increasingly focused on network discovery. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging modality that captures neural activity with a high degree of temporal specificity, providing detailed, time varying maps of neural activity. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is a multivariate framework that can be used to isolate distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that differentiate groups or cognitive tasks, to relate neural activity to behavior, and to capture large-scale network interactions. Here we introduce [MEG]PLS, a MATLAB-based platform that streamlines MEG data preprocessing, source reconstruction and PLS analysis in a single unified framework. [MEG]PLS facilitates MRI preprocessing, including segmentation and coregistration, MEG preprocessing, including filtering, epoching, and artifact correction, MEG sensor analysis, in both time and frequency domains, MEG source analysis, including multiple head models and beamforming algorithms, and combines these with a suite of PLS analyses. The pipeline is open-source and modular, utilizing functions from FieldTrip (Donders, NL), AFNI (NIMH, USA), SPM8 (UCL, UK) and PLScmd (Baycrest, CAN), which are extensively supported and continually developed by their respective communities. [MEG]PLS is flexible, providing both a graphical user interface and command-line options, depending on the needs of the user. A visualization suite allows multiple types of data and analyses to be displayed and includes 4-D montage functionality.

Brain connectivity is altered by extreme physical exercise during non-REM sleep and wakefulness: indications from EEG and fMRI studies	ARCHIVES ITALIENNES DE BIOLOGIE			English	Article						Physical exercise; Sleep slow oscillations; Global connectivity; Cytokines; Synchronization; Cerebral excitability; Humans	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SLOW OSCILLATION; STRENUOUS EXERCISE; SPECTRAL DENSITY; STRESS; HUMANS; IMMUNE; POWER; INTERLEUKIN-6; DEPRESSION	Brain connectivity is associated to behavioral states (e.g. wake, sleep) and modified by physical activity although, to date, it is not clear which components (e.g. hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis hormones, cytokines) associated to the exercise are involved. In this pilot study, we used extreme exercise (UltraTriathlon) as a model to investigate physical-activity-related changes of brain connectivity. We studied post-race brain synchronization during wakefulness and sleep as well as possible correlations between exercise-related cytokines/hormones and synchronization features. For wakefulness, global synchronization was evaluated by estimating from fMRI data (12 athletes) the brain global connectivity (GC). GC increased in several brain regions, mainly related to sensory-motor activity, emotional modulation and response to stress that may foster rapid exchange of information across regions, and reflect post-race internally-focused mental activity or disengagement from previous motor programs. No significant correlations between cytokines/hormones and GC were found. For sleep (8 athletes), synchronization was evaluated by estimating the local-(cortical) and global-related (thalamocortical) EEG features associated to the phenomenon of Sleep Slow Oscillations (SSO) of NREM sleep. Results showed that: power of fast rhythms in the baseline preceding the SSO increased in midline and parietal regions; amplitude and duration of SSOs increased, mainly in posterior areas; sigma modulation in the SSO up state decreased. In the post race, IL-10 positively correlated with fast rhythms baseline, SSO rate and positive slope; IL-1ra and cortisol inversely correlated with SSO duration; TNF-alpha and C-reactive protein positively correlated with fast rhythm modulation in the SSO up state. Sleep results suggest that: arousal during sleep, estimated by baseline fast rhythms, is increased; SSO may be sustained by cortical excitability, linked to anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10); thalamo-cortical entrainment, (sigma modulation), is impaired in athletes with higher inflammatory markers.

We present evidence of the relative contribution of experience and the individual alpha frequency (IAF) to achieving correct performance during program comprehension tasks, specifically that more experience and higher IAF are both associated with an increased likelihood of correct task performance, with experience playing the greater part.

Yet, the sleeping brain is far from being dormant and recent research unraveled the preservation of complex sensory processing during sleep. In wakefulness, such processes usually lead to the formation of long-term memory traces, being it implicit or explicit. We examined here the consequences upon awakening of the processing of sensory information at a high level of representation during sleep. Participants were instructed to classify auditory stimuli as words or pseudo-words, through left and right hand responses, while transitioning toward sleep. An analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal revealed the preservation of lateralized motor activations in response to sounds, suggesting that stimuli were correctly categorized during sleep. Upon awakening, participants did not explicitly remember words processed during sleep and failed to distinguish them from new words (old/new recognition test). However, both behavioral and EEG data indicate the presence of an implicit memory trace for words presented during sleep. In addition, the underlying neural signature of such implicit memories markedly differed from the explicit memories formed during wakefulness, in line with dual-process accounts arguing for two independent systems for explicit and implicit memory. Thus, our results reveal that implicit learning mechanisms can be triggered during sleep and provide a novel approach to explore the neural implementation of memory without awareness.

However, the neural mechanisms that help to optimize how we integrate auditory and visual speech in such suboptimal conversational environments are not yet fully understood. Using human EEG recordings, we examined how visual speech enhances the cortical representation of auditory speech at a signal-to-noise ratio that maximized the perceptual benefit conferred by multisensory processing relative to unisensory processing. We found that the influence of visual input on the neural tracking of the audio speech signal was significantly greater in noisy than in quiet listening conditions, consistent with the principle of inverse effectiveness. Although envelope tracking during audio-only speech was greatly reduced by background noise at an early processing stage, it was markedly restored by the addition of visual speech input. In background noise, multisensory integration occurred at much lower frequencies and was shown to predict the multisensory gain in behavioral performance at a time lag of similar to 250 ms. Critically, we demonstrated that inverse effectiveness, in the context of natural audiovisual (AV) speech processing, relies on crossmodal integration over long temporal windows. Our findings suggest that disparate integration mechanisms contribute to the efficient processing of AV speech in background noise.

However, the precise neurophysiological basis of rsMRI signal remains elusive. Converging evidence supports the notion that local field potential (LFP) signal in the high-frequency range correlates with fMRI response evoked by a task (e.g., visual stimulation). It remains uncertain whether this relationship extends to rsMRI. In this study, we systematically modulated LFP signal in the whisker barrel cortex (WBC) by unilateral deflection of rat whiskers. Results show that functional connectivity between bilateral WBC was significantly modulated at the 2 Hz, but not at the 4 or 6 Hz, stimulus condition. Electrophysiologically, only in the low-frequency range (< 5 Hz) was the LFP power synchrony in bilateral WBC significantly modulated at 2 Hz, but not at 4- or 6-Hz whisker stimulation, thus distinguishing these 2 experimental conditions, and paralleling the findings in rsMRI. LFP power synchrony in other frequency ranges was modulated in a way that was neither unique to the specific stimulus conditions nor parallel to the fMRI results. Our results support the hypothesis that emphasizes the role of low-frequency LFP signal underlying rsMRI.

On the estimation of phase synchronization, spurious synchronization and filtering	CHAOS			English	Article							INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; CHAOTIC OSCILLATORS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; EEG; SIGNAL; TIME; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; NONLINEARITY; AMPLITUDE; WAVELET	Phase synchronization, viz., the adjustment of instantaneous frequencies of two interacting self-sustained nonlinear oscillators, is frequently used for the detection of a possible interrelationship between empirical data recordings. In this context, the proper estimation of the instantaneous phase from a time series is a crucial aspect. The probability that numerical estimates provide a physically relevant meaning depends sensitively on the shape of its power spectral density. For this purpose, the power spectrum should be narrow banded possessing only one prominent peak [M. Chavez et al., J. Neurosci. Methods 154, 149 (2006)]. If this condition is not fulfilled, band-pass filtering seems to be the adequate technique in order to pre-process data for a posterior synchronization analysis. However, it was reported that band-pass filtering might induce spurious synchronization [L. Xu et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 065201(R), (2006); J. Sun et al., Phys. Rev. E 77, 046213 (2008); and J. Wang and Z. Liu, EPL 102, 10003 (2013)], a statement that without further specification causes uncertainty over all measures that aim to quantify phase synchronization of broadband field data. We show by using signals derived from different test frameworks that appropriate filtering does not induce spurious synchronization. Instead, filtering in the time domain tends to wash out existent phase interrelations between signals. Furthermore, we show that measures derived for the estimation of phase synchronization like the mean phase coherence are also useful for the detection of interrelations between time series, which are not necessarily derived from coupled self-sustained nonlinear oscillators.

Decrement in vigilance in such situations could result in dangerous consequences such as accidents, loss of life and system failure. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to enhance vigilance or sustained attention using "challenge integration," a strategy that integrates a primary task with challenging stimuli. A primary surveillance task (identifying an intruder in a simulated factory environment) and a challenge stimulus (periods of rain obscuring the surveillance scene) were employed to test the changes in vigilance levels. The effect of integrating challenging events (resulting from artificially simulated rain) into the task were compared to the initial monotonous phase. EEG and eye tracking data is collected and analyzed for n = 12 subjects. Frontal midline theta power and frontal theta to parietal alpha power ratio which are used as measures of engagement and attention allocation show an increase due to challenge integration (p < 0.05 in each case). Relative delta band power of EEG also shows statistically significant suppression on the frontoparietal and occipital cortices due to challenge integration (p 0.05). Saccade amplitude, saccade velocity and blink rate obtained from eye tracking data exhibit statistically significant changes during the challenge phase of the experiment (p < 0.05 in each case). From the correlation analysis between the statistically significant measures of eye tracking and EEG, we infer that saccade amplitude and saccade velocity decrease with vigilance decrement along with frontal midline theta and frontal theta to parietal alpha ratio. Conversely, blink rate and relative delta power increase with vigilance decrement. However, these measures exhibit a reverse trend when challenge stimulus appears in the task suggesting vigilance enhancement. Moreover, the mean reaction time is lower for the challenge integrated phase (RTmean = 3.65 +/- 1.4 s) compared to initial monotonous phase without challenge (RTmean = 4.6 +/- 2.7 s). Our work shows that vigilance level, as assessed by response of these vital signs, is enhanced by challenge integration.

One of the candidate genes, prevalently expressed in the brain, is the small nucleolar ribonucleic acid-116 (SNORD116). Here we conducted a translational study into the sleep abnormalities of PWS, testing the hypothesis that SNORD116 is responsible for sleep defects that characterize the syndrome. Methods: We studied sleep in mutant mice that carry a deletion of Snord116 at the orthologous locus (mouse chromosome 7) of the human PWS critical region (PWScr). In particular, we assessed EEG and temperature profiles, across 24-h, in PWScr(m+/p-) heterozygous mutants compared to wild-type littermates. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to explore morphoanatomical differences according to the genotype. Moreover, we complemented the mouse work by presenting two patients with a diagnosis of PWS and characterized by atypical small deletions of SNORD116. We compared the individual EEG parameters of patients with healthy subjects and with a cohort of obese subjects. Results: By studying the mouse mutant line PWScr(m+/p-), we observed specific rapid eye movement (REM) sleep alterations including abnormal electroencephalograph (EEG) theta waves. Remarkably, we observed identical sleep/EEG defects in the two PWS cases. We report brain morphological abnormalities that are associated with the EEG alterations. In particular, mouse mutants have a bilateral reduction of the gray matter volume in the ventral hippocampus and in the septum areas, which are pivotal structures for maintaining theta rhythms throughout the brain. In PWScr(m+/p-) mice we also observed increased body temperature that is coherent with REM sleep alterations in mice and human patients. Conclusions: Our study indicates that paternally expressed Snord116 is involved in the 24-h regulation of sleep physiological measures, suggesting that it is a candidate gene for the sleep disturbances that most individuals with PWS experience.

The perceptual and cognitive functions underlying this component are subject to ongoing debate. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the link between the CNV and behavioral performance is non-linear and changes depending on the cognitive context. We suggest that the CNV reflects a common core preparatory process related to brain system optimization, and other cognitive processes that depend on the specific timing task employed.

J	Jancke, L; Alahmadi, N				Jaencke, Lutz; Alahmadi, Nsreen			Detection of independent functional networks during music listening using electroencephalogram and sLORETA-ICA	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalogram; independent components; music listening; scale listening; sLORETA; sLORETA-IC	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; CLASSICAL-MUSIC; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; EMOTION; OSCILLATIONS; EXPERIENCE; PICTURES; DENSITY	The measurement of brain activation during music listening is a topic that is attracting increased attention from many researchers. Because of their high spatial accuracy, functional MRI measurements are often used for measuring brain activation in the context of music listening. However, this technique faces the issues of contaminating scanner noise and an uncomfortable experimental environment. Electroencephalogram (EEG), however, is a neural registration technique that allows the measurement of neurophysiological activation in silent and more comfortable experimental environments. Thus, it is optimal for recording brain activations during pleasant music stimulation. Using a new mathematical approach to calculate intracortical independent components (sLORETA-IC) on the basis of scalp-recorded EEG, we identified specific intracortical independent components during listening of a musical piece and scales, which differ substantially from intracortical independent components calculated from the resting state EEG. Most intracortical independent components are located bilaterally in perisylvian brain areas known to be involved in auditory processing and specifically in music perception. Some intracortical independent components differ between the music and scale listening conditions. The most prominent difference is found in the anterior part of the perisylvian brain region, with stronger activations seen in the left-sided anterior perisylvian regions during music listening, most likely indicating semantic processing during music listening. A further finding is that the intracortical independent components obtained for the music and scale listening are most prominent in higher frequency bands (e.g. beta-2 and beta-3), whereas the resting state intracortical independent components are active in lower frequency bands (alpha-1 and theta). This new technique for calculating intracortical independent components is able to differentiate independent neural networks associated with music and scale listening. Thus, this tool offers new opportunities for studying neural activations during music listening using the silent and more convenient EEG technology. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In previous studies, the N1 component of the ERP was shown to reflect print tuning but also to be sensitive to lexical effects. It remains unclear, however, whether these two aspects of orthographic processing occur at the same time or in different time windows during the lengthy N1 component. Moreover, it is unclear whether these processes develop late or occur already at early stages of literacy acquisition and whether this is similar for native languages and languages acquired later in life. To address these questions, 27 children were tested longitudinally, i.e. before (mean: 7.6 years) and after one year of classroom-based English instruction. Additionally, 22 adult speakers of English as a foreign language (mean: 25.1 years) were investigated. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while participants performed a one-back task with native German words, English words, pseudowords and false-font strings. The event-related EEG analysis of early and late N1 phases revealed early effects related to print tuning and late effects related to lexical processing in the native, but not in the second language of adult readers. In the absence of lexicality effects in children, print tuning effects were found across both early and late N1 segments. The temporally distinct N1 sensitivities to print and lexicality reflect temporal dynamics of visual word processing, which seem to depend on reading expertise or maturation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Perceptually, a robust finding is that negative stimuli are processed faster and more efficiently than positive stimuli. Behaviorally, a similarly robust finding is that response times are slower for negative than for positive stimuli. We proposed and tested a novel account to explain this still unexplained discrepancy, on the basis of the assumption that negative valence narrows perceptual processes to the benefit of speeded perception, but broadens motor processes at the cost of slowed responding. Participants performed a valence judgment task in which they responded with their left or right hand to negative and positive stimuli that were presented on the left or right, and we measured the activation of relevant/deactivation of irrelevant perceptual and motor processes, as revealed by the lateralization of electroencephalographic brain oscillations. Stimulus-related lateralization of alpha activity (8-12 Hz) over perceptual areas was increased for negative stimuli, indicating more efficient perceptual processing. By contrast, response-related lateralization of beta activity (20-25 Hz) over motor areas was decreased for negative stimuli, indicating less efficient response activation. Consistent with our predictions, more detailed analyses showed that both lateralization effects were caused by dynamics at the level of inhibiting irrelevant processes. For negative as compared to positive stimuli, the inhibition of irrelevant perceptual processes was increased, but the inhibition of irrelevant motor processes was decreased. These findings indicate that the discrepancy between perception and behavior in emotional processing may stem from asymmetrical effects of emotional valence on the breadth of cortical activations in perceptual and motor networks.

Facilitation and inhibition in attention: Functional dissociation of pre-stimulus alpha activity, P1, and N1 components	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; ERP; Alpha; P1; Brain; EEG	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; SENSORY GAIN-CONTROL; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; TARGET DETECTION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS	Attention - the ability to attend to some things while ignoring others - can be best described as an emergent property of many neural mechanisms, facilitatory and inhibitory, working together to resolve competition for processing resources and control of behavior. Previous EEG and MEG studies examining the neural mechanisms underlying facilitation and inhibition of stimulus processing typically used paradigms requiring alternating shifts of attention in the spatial domain, with stimuli occurring at both attended and unattended locations. These studies generally observed greater pre-stimulus alpha oscillations over task-irrelevant vs. relevant posterior regions and bilateral attentional modulations of early sensory processing. In contrast, in the current series of experiments, participants continuously attended to only one hemifield and stimuli were only presented at the attended location, affording us an opportunity to elucidate the inhibitory and facilitatory effects of attention in the brain in a context in which spatial relevance was fixed. We found that continuous attention to one hemifield did not modulate prestimulus alpha activity in ipsilateral regions but did result in a perfectly lateralized P1 attention effect to ipsilateral posterior regions. Moreover, we found a bilateral N1 effect. These findings suggest that pre-stimulus alpha activity, the P1 and the N1 reflect qualitatively different aspects of attention; While pre-stimulus alpha-band activity may reflect a top-down inhibitory mechanism that critically depends on functional competition between task-relevant and irrelevant sensory regions, the ipsilateral P1 effect may reflect stimulus-triggered blocking of sensory processing in irrelevant networks, and the N1 effect facilitation of task-relevant processing.

This article reviews the usefulness, methods, and limitations of invasive evaluations for epilepsy surgery. Invasive evaluations include various types of intracranial electrodes such as stereotactically implanted intracranial depth electrodes (stereo-EEG), chronic subdural electrodes, and intraoperative electrocorticography. Scalp EEG is distorted by the skull, meninges, and skin. On the other hand, intracranial electrodes provide spatial information with higher resolution than scalp electrodes, thereby enabling further delineation of epileptogenic zones and mapping of functional areas with electrical stimulation. In addition, intracranial electrodes record a wide frequency range of electrical activity, which is not possible with scalp electrodes. The very slow potentials in ictal recordings, known as ictal direct current (DC) shifts and ictal/interictal high frequency oscillations, such as ripples (100-200 Hz) and fast ripples (200-500 Hz), have been correlated with the ictal onset zone and are a sensitive and specific marker for epileptogenicity. Furthermore, several studies reported that the electrical stimulation of epileptogenic zones elicited enhanced cortical evoked potentials, abnormal delayed or repetitive responses, and fast ripples. These responses may assist in the delineation of the epileptogenic cortex as a potential new marker. There are definite risks of complications associated with the use of intracranial electrodes. However, when an invasive evaluation is selected based on careful consideration of the risks and benefits, it provides useful information for establishing a strategy for epilepsy surgery.

The phase of pre-stimulus alpha oscillations influences the visual perception of stimulus timing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EEG ALPHA; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL PERCEPTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; REACTION-TIME; RHYTHMS; BRAIN; INHIBITION	This study examined the influence of pre-stimulus alpha phase and attention on whether two visual stimuli occurring closely in time were perceived as simultaneous or asynchronous. The results demonstrated that certain phases of alpha in the period immediately preceding stimulus onset were associated with a higher proportion of stimuli judged to be asynchronous. Furthermore, this effect was shown to occur independently of both visuo-spatial attention and alpha amplitude. The findings are compatible with proposals that alpha phase reflects cyclic shifts in neuronal excitability. Importantly, however, the results further suggest that fluctuations in neuronal excitability can create a periodicity in neuronal transfer that can have functional consequences that are decoupled from changes in alpha amplitude. This study therefore provides evidence that perceptual processes fluctuate periodically although it remains uncertain whether this implies the discrete temporal framing of perception.

In epilepsy, HFOs might reflect a mechanism of epileptic phenomena, serving as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity. Despite the valuable information provided by HFOs, their correct identification is a challenging task. A comprehensive application, RIPPLELAB, was developed to facilitate the analysis of HFOs. RIPPLELAB provides a wide range of tools for HFOs manual and automatic detection and visual validation; all of them are accessible from an intuitive graphical user interface. Four methods for automated detection-as well as several options for visualization and validation of detected events-were implemented and integrated in the application. Analysis of multiple files and channels is possible, and new options can be added by users. All features and capabilities implemented in RIPPLELAB for automatic detection were tested through the analysis of simulated signals and intracranial EEG recordings from epileptic patients (n = 16; 3,471 analyzed hours). Visual validation was also tested, and detected events were classified into different categories. Unlike other available software packages for EEG analysis, RIPPLELAB uniquely provides the appropriate graphical and algorithmic environment for HFOs detection (visual and automatic) and validation, in such a way that the power of elaborated detection methods are available to a wide range of users (experts and non-experts) through the use of this application.

Yet little is known of the speech-motor network in AWS in the brief time window preceding audible speech onset. The purpose of the current study was to characterize neural oscillations in the speech-motor network during preparation for and execution of overt speech production in AWS using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Twelve AWS and 12 age-matched controls were presented with 220 words, each word embedded in a carrier phrase. Controls were presented with the same word list as their matched AWS participant. Neural oscillatory activity was localized using minimum-variance beamforming during two time periods of interest: speech preparation (prior to speech onset) and speech execution (following speech onset). Compared to controls, AWS showed stronger beta (1525 Hz) suppression in the speech preparation stage, followed by stronger beta synchronization in the bilateral mouth motor cortex. AWS also recruited the right mouth motor cortex significantly earlier in the speech preparation stage compared to controls. Exaggerated motor preparation is discussed in the context of reduced coordination in the speech-motor network of AWS. It is further proposed that exaggerated beta synchronization may reflect a more strongly inhibited motor system that requires a stronger beta suppression to disengage prior to speech initiation. These novel findings highlight critical differences in the speech-motor network of AWS that occur prior to speech onset and emphasize the need to investigate further the speech-motor assembly in the stuttering population.

Reinforcement learning of self-regulated sensorimotor beta-oscillations improves motor performance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Operant conditioning; Beta oscillations; Brain-computer interface; Brain-machine interface; Brain-robot interface; Motor learning; Neurofeedback; Hand function; Functional restoration; Stroke	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; CORTICAL STIMULATION; CHRONIC STROKE; ROBOT INTERFACE; IMAGERY; SYSTEM; BCI; MODULATION; ACTIVATION	Self-regulation of sensorimotor oscillations is currently researched in neurorehabilitation, e.g. for priming subsequent physiotherapy in stroke patients, and may be modulated by neurofeedback or transcranial brain stimulation. It has still to be demonstrated, however, whether and under which training conditions such brain self-regulation could also result in motor gains. Thirty-two right-handed, healthy subjects participated in a three-day intervention during which they performed 462 trials of kinesthetic motor-imagery while a brain-robot interface (BRI) turned event-related beta-band desynchronization of the left sensorimotor cortex into the opening of the right hand by a robotic orthosis. Different training conditions were compared in a parallel-group design: (i) adaptive classifier thresholding and contingent feedback, (ii) adaptive classifier thresholding and non-contingent feedback, (iii) non-adaptive classifier thresholding and contingent feedback, and (iv) non-adaptive classifier thresholding and non-contingent feedback. We studied the task-related cortical physiology with electroencephalography and the behavioral performance in a subsequent isometric motor task. Contingent neurofeedback and adaptive classifier thresholding were critical for learning brain self-regulation which, in turn, led to behavioral gains after the intervention. The acquired skill for sustained sensorimotor beta-desynchronization correlated significantly with subsequent motor improvement. Operant learning of brain self-regulation with a BRI may offer a therapeutic perspective for severely affected stroke patients lacking residual hand function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Current measures of phase synchrony are mostly bivariate focusing on the synchrony between pairs of time series. Bivariate measures do not necessarily lead to a complete picture of the global interactions within a complex system. Current multivariate synchrony measures are based on either averaging all possible pairwise synchrony values or eigendecomposition of the pairwise bivariate synchrony matrix. These approaches are sensitive to the accuracy of the bivariate synchrony indices, computationally complex and indirect ways of quantifying the multivariate synchrony. Recently, we had proposed a method to compute the multivariate phase synchrony using a hyperdimensional coordinate system. This method, referred to as Hyperspherical Phase Synchrony (HPS), has been found to be dependent on the ordering of the phase differences. In this paper, we propose a more general hyper-spherical coordinate system along with a new higher-dimensional manifold representation to eliminate the dependency on the ordering of the signals' phases. This new framework, referred to as Hyper-Torus Synchrony (HTS), is shown to be equivalent to the root-mean-square of a sufficient set of squared phase-locking values whose phase differences contain information about all oscillators in the network. The statistical properties of HTS are given analytically and its performance is evaluated thoroughly for both synthetic and real signals.

In this proof of concept study, we explored the conceptual notion of shared and complementary mental models through EEG mapping of two brains performing a real-world interactive motor task of increasing difficulty. We used the recently introduced participative "juggling paradigm," and collected neurophysiological and psycho-social data. We were interested in analyzing the between-brains coupling during a dyadic juggling task, and in exploring the relationship between the motor task execution, the jugglers'skill level and the task difficulty. We also investigated how this relationship could be mirrored in the coupled functional organization of the interacting brains. Methods: To capture the neural schemas underlying the notion of shared and complementary mental models, we examined the functional connectivity patterns and hyperbrain features of a juggling dyad involved in cooperative motor tasks of increasing difficulty. Jugglers' cortical activity was measured using two synchronized 32-channel EEG systems during dyadic juggling performed with 3, 4, 5 and 6 balls. Individual and hyperbrain functional connections were quantified through coherence maps calculated across all electrode pairs in the theta and alpha bands (4-8 and 8-12 Hz). Graph metrics were used to typify the global topology and efficiency of the functional networks for the four difficulty levels in the theta and alpha bands. Results: Results indicated that, as task difficulty increased, the cortical functional organization of the more skilled juggler became progressively more segregated in both frequency bands, with a small-world organization in the theta band during easier tasks, indicative of a flow-like state in line with the neural efficiency hypothesis. Conversely, more integrated functional patterns were observed for the less skilled juggler in both frequency bands, possibly related to cognitive overload due to the difficulty of the task at hand (reinvestment hypothesis). At the hyperbrain level, a segregated functional organization involving areas of the visuo-attentional networks of both jugglers was observed in both frequency bands and for the easier task only. Discussion: These results suggest that cooperative juggling is supported by integrated activity of specialized cortical areas from both brains only during easier tasks, whereas it relies on individual skills, mirrored in uncorrelated individual brain activations, during more difficult tasks. These findings suggest that task difficulty and jugglers' personal skills may influence the features of the hyperbrain network in its shared/integrative and complementary/segregative tendencies.

This study used electroencephalographic activity (EEG) to characterize prefrontal, parietal and temporal functioning in biological mothers (BM), adoptive mothers (AM), and non-mothers (NM), while viewing videos of a baby smiling or crying. The BM presented higher absolute power (AP) in the delta and theta bands (associated with pleasant, positive emotional experiences) in the frontal and parietal areas under all conditions. In response to the smiling video, both types of mothers presented a lower AP in alphal in the three cortices (indicative of increased attention) and, mainly in temporal areas, a higher AP in the fast frequencies (beta and gamma, reflecting increased alertness to sensory stimuli and cognitive processing). This EEG pattern in the BM and AM could reflect the greater attention and, probably, the positive mood caused by the smiling video, showing that both are sensitive to these pleasant stimuli. When viewing the video of a baby crying, the AM had higher AP in the fast frequencies (temporal and parietal areas), indicating that they were more reactive to this unpleasant video, while the NM presented only a lower AP in alphal in all cortices, a finding that could be associated with the general activation induced by these unpleasant stimuli as a consequence of their lack of maternal experience. These findings should help improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in the processing of sensorial stimuli that establish affective-emotional links during motherhood.

However, the responder rate is relatively low. The present study was designed to determine the effect of low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in ANT on chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures and related pathological pattern in intra-hippocampal kainate mouse model. We found that LFS (1 Hz, 100 mu s, 300 mu A), but not HFS (100 Hz, 100 mu s, 30 mu A), in bilateral ANT significantly decreased the frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures, either non-convulsive focal seizures or tonic-clonic generalized seizures. The anti-epileptic effect persisted for one week after LFS cessation, which manifested as a long-term inhibition of the frequency of seizures with short (20-60 s) and intermediate duration (60-120 s). Meanwhile, LFS decreased the frequency of high-frequency oscillations (HF0s) and interictal spikes, two indicators of seizure severity, whereas HFS increased the HFO frequency. Furthermore, LFS decreased the power of the delta band and increased the power of the gamma band of hippocampal background EEG. In addition, LFS, but not HFS, improved the performance of chronic epileptic mice in objection-location task, novel objection recognition and freezing test. These results provide the first evidence that LFS in ANT alleviates kainate-induced chronic epilepsy and cognitive impairment, which may be related to the modulation of the hippocampal EEG rhythm. This may be of great therapeutic significance for clinical treatment of epilepsy with deep brain stimulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Induced and Evoked Human Electrophysiological Correlates of Visual Working Memory Set-Size Effects at Encoding	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREDICTS INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL MEASURES; PARIETAL LOBE; CAPACITY; ATTENTION; PSYCHOPHYSICS; INFORMATION; PHASE	The ability to encode, store, and retrieve visually presented objects is referred to as visual working memory (VWM). Although crucial for many cognitive processes, previous research reveals that VWM strictly capacity limited. This capacity limitation is behaviorally observable in the set size effect: the ability to successfully report items in VWM asymptotes at a small number of items. Research into the neural correlates of set size effects and VWM capacity limits in general largely focus on the maintenance period of VWM. However, we previously reported that neural resources allocated to individual items during VWM encoding correspond to successful VWM performance. Here we expand on those findings by investigating neural correlates of set size during VWM encoding. We hypothesized that neural signatures of encoding-related VWM capacity limitations should be differentiable as a function of set size. We tested our hypothesis using High Density Electroencephalography (HD-EEG) to analyze frequency components evoked by flickering target items in VWM displays of set size 2 or 4. We found that set size modulated the amplitude of the 1st and 2nd harmonic frequencies evoked during successful VWM encoding across frontal and occipital-parietal electrodes. Frontal sites exhibited the most robust effects for the 2nd harmonic (set size 2 > set size 4). Additionally, we found a set-size effect on the induced power of delta-band (1-4 Hz) activity (set size 2 > set size 4). These results are consistent with a capacity limited VWM resource at encoding that is distributed across to-be-remembered items in a VWM display. This resource may work in conjunction with a task-specific selection process that determines which items are to be encoded and which are to be ignored. These neural set size effects support the view that VWM capacity limitations begin with encoding related processes.

Monitoring Alpha Oscillations and Pupil Dilation across a Performance-Intensity Function	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						alpha power; pupil dilation; listening effort; listening in noise; speech perception; perceived effort; mental exertion	HEARING-AID USE; LISTENING EFFORT; LOCUS-COERULEUS; OLDER-ADULTS; SPEECH RECOGNITION; HUMAN BRAIN; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; DEFAULT NETWORK; WORKING-MEMORY; NOISE	Listening to degraded speech can be challenging and requires a continuous investment of cognitive resources, which is more challenging for those with hearing loss. However, while alpha power (8-12 Hz) and pupil dilation have been suggested as objective correlates of listening effort, it is not clear whether they assess the same cognitive processes involved, or other sensory and/or neurophysiological mechanisms that are associated with the task. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare alpha power and pupil dilation during a sentence recognition task in 15 randomized levels of noise (-7 to +7 dB SNR) using highly intelligible (16 channel vocoded) and moderately intelligible (6 channel vocoded) speech. Twenty young normal-hearing adults participated in the study, however, due to extraneous noise, data from only 16 (10 females, 6 males; aged 19-28 years) was used in the Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis and 10 in the pupil analysis. Behavioral testing of perceived effort and speech performance was assessed at 3 fixed SNRs per participant and was comparable to sentence recognition performance assessed in the physiological test session for both 16- and 6-channel vocoded sentences. Results showed a significant interaction between channel vocoding for both the alpha power and the pupil size changes. While both measures significantly decreased with more positive SNRs for the 16-channel vocoding, this was not observed with the 6-channel vocoding. The results of this study suggest that these measures may encode different processes involved in speech perception, which show similar trends for highly intelligible speech, but diverge for more spectrally degraded speech. The results to date suggest that these objective correlates of listening effort, and the cognitive processes involved in listening effort, are not yet sufficiently well understood to be used within a clinical setting.

Methods: To analyze vocal fold oscillatory patterns during dynamic lung MRI, an electroglottography (EGG) system was modified to allow for simultaneous EGG measurements during MR image acquisitions. A low-pass filter was introduced to suppress residual radiofrequency (RF) coupling into the EGG signal. RF heating was tested in a gel phantom to ensure MR safety, and functionality of the EGG device was assessed in a volunteer experiment at singing frequencies from A5 to A3. In the recorded EGG signals, remaining RF interferences were removed by independent component analysis post processing, and standard EGG parameters such as fundamental frequency, contact quotient and jitter were calculated. In a second volunteer experiment, EGG recordings were compared with lung diameter measurements from 2D time-resolved trueFISP acquisitions. Results: RF heating measurements resulted in less than 1.2 degrees C temperature increase in the gel phantom. EGG parameters measured during MR imaging are within the range of ideal values. In the lung measurement, both the lung diameter and the EGG recordings could be successfully performed with only minimal interference. Conclusion: EGG recording is possible during dynamic lung MRI, and glottal activity can be studied safely at 1.5T.

How do parcellation size and short-range connectivity affect dynamics in large-scale brain network models?	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Diffusion; Functional and structural MRI; The virtual brain; Large-scale brain network models; Parcellations; Short-range connectivity; SCRIPTS	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; VIRTUAL BRAIN; NEURAL FIELDS; DIFFUSION MRI; CONNECTOME; TRACTOGRAPHY; INTEGRATION; STABILITY; EQUATIONS; REGIONS	Recent efforts to model human brain activity on the scale of the whole brain rest on connectivity estimates of large-scale networks derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). This type of connectivity describes white matter fiber tracts. The number of short-range cortico-cortical white-matter connections is, however, underrepresented in such large-scale brain models. It is still unclear on the one hand, which scale of representation of white matter fibers is optimal to describe brain activity on a large-scale such as recorded with magneto-or electroencephalography (M/EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and on the other hand, to which extent short-range connections that are typically local should be taken into account. In this article we quantified the effect of connectivity upon large-scale brain network dynamics by (i) systematically varying the number of brain regions before computing the connectivity matrix, and by (ii) adding generic short-range connections. We used dMRI data from the Human Connec-tome Project. We developed a suite of preprocessing modules called SCRIPTS to prepare these imaging data for The Virtual Brain, a neuroinformatics platform for large-scale brain modeling and simulations. We performed simulations under different connectivity conditions and quantified the spatiotemporal dynamics in terms of Shannon Entropy, dwell time and Principal Component Analysis. For the reconstructed connectivity, our results show that the major white matter fiber bundles play an important role in shaping slow dynamics in large-scale brain networks (e.g. in fMRI). Faster dynamics such as gamma oscillations (around 40 Hz) are sensitive to the short-range connectivity if transmission delays are considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hemispheric Coherence in ASD with and without Comorbid ADHD and Anxiety	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; RESTING-STATE; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; AUTISM; PATTERNS; CHILDREN; ALPHA; INDIVIDUALS	There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that altered brain connectivity may be a defining feature of disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, and ADHD. This study investigated whether resting state functional connectivity, measured by 128-channel EEG oscillation coherence, differs between developmental disorders. Analyses were conducted separately on groups with and without comorbid conditions. Analyses revealed increased coherence across central electrodes over the primary motor cortex and decreased coherence in the frontal lobe networks in those with ASD compared to neurotypical controls. There was increased coherence in occipital lobe networks in the ADHD group compared to other groups. Symptoms of generalised anxiety were positively correlated with both frontal-occipital intrahemispheric (alpha only) coherence and occipital interhemispheric coherence (alpha, approaching theta band). The patterns of coherence in the ASD pure group were different when comorbid conditions were included in the analyses, suggesting that aberrant coherence in the frontal and central areas of the brain is specifically associated with ASD. Our findings support the idea that comorbid conditions are additive, rather than being symptoms of the same disorder.	[Saunders, A.; Kirk, I. J.; Waldie, K.

However, marked interindividual variability exists in the degree to which sleep loss compromises learning, the mechanistic reasons for which are unclear. Furthermore, which physiological sleep processes restore learning ability following sleep deprivation are similarly unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the structural morphology of human hippocampal subfields represents one factor determining vulnerability (and conversely, resilience) to the impact of sleep deprivation on memory formation. Moreover, this same measure of brain morphology was further associated with the quality of nonrapid eye movement slow wave oscillations during recovery sleep, and by way of such activity, determined the success of memory restoration. Such findings provide a novel human biomarker of cognitive susceptibility to, and recovery from, sleep deprivation. Moreover, this metric may be of special predictive utility for professions in which memory function is paramount yet insufficient sleep is pervasive (e.g., aviation, military, and medicine).

Here, we investigate to what extent oscillatory EEG changes during memory encoding and/or retrieval enhance the accuracy of medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy in predicting conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to AD. As expected, aMCI individuals that, within a 2-year follow-up period, developed dementia (N = 16) compared to healthy older (HO) (N = 26) and stable aMCI (N = 18) showed poorer associative memory, greater MTL atrophy, and lower capacity to recruit alpha oscillatory cortical networks. Interestingly, encoding-induced abnormal alpha desynchronized activity over the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) at baseline showed significantly higher accuracy in predicting AD than the magnitude of amygdala atrophy. Nevertheless, the best accuracy was obtained when the two markers were fitted into the model (sensitivity = 78%, specificity = 82%). These results support the idea that synaptic integrity/function in the PCC is affected during prodromal AD and has the potential of improving early detection when combined with MRI biomarkers.

Past work has explained this discrepancy by hypothesising that elderly individuals use increased top-down control mechanisms advantageous to Flanker performance. This study investigated this mechanism, focussing on cumulative experienced stress as a factor that may impact on its execution, thereby leading to impaired performance. Thirty elderly and thirty young participants completed a version of the Flanker task paired with electroencephalographic recordings of the alpha frequency, whose increased synchronisation indexes inhibitory processes. Among high stress elderly individuals, findings revealed a general slowing of reaction times for congruent and incongruent stimuli, which correlated with alpha desynchronisation for both stimulus categories. Results found high performing (low stress) elderly revealed neither a behavioural nor electrophysiological difference compared to young participants. Therefore, rather than impacting on top-down compensatory mechanisms, findings indicate that stress may affect elderly participants' inhibitory control in attentional and sensorimotor domains.

Despite a substantial literature on automated seizure detection algorithms, hardware-friendly implementation of such techniques is not sufficiently addressed. In this paper, we propose to employ a gradient-boosted ensemble of decision trees to achieve a reasonable trade-off between detection accuracy and implementation cost. Combined with the proposed feature extraction model, we show that these classifiers quickly become competitive with more complex learning models previously proposed for hardware implementation, with only a small number of low-depth (d < 4) "shallow" trees. The results are verified on more than 3460 hours of intracranial EEG data including 430 seizures from 27 patients with epilepsy.

However, it remains unknown whether this ability extends when viewing conditions become more difficult, and whether differences in early perceptual abilities modulate masking sensitivity. To address these issues, participants enumerated a variable number of target elements among distracters in two electroencephalography experiments. Either one (Experiment 1) or all targets (Experiment 2) were masked through object-substitution. Results showed that an event-related potential measure of selective individuation, the N2pc component, was modulated by target numerosity in both masked and unmasked trials, suggesting that multiple object individuation can operate in conditions of limited visibility. However, this effect was present mainly for participants with low masking effects, who overall showed more pronounced N2pc modulations as a function of target numerosity. Finally, oscillatory activity analyses revealed that early segmentation mechanisms, as reflected by lateralized gamma synchronization, were more active in participants with low sensitivity to masking, suggesting that individual variation in early perceptual functions is associated with susceptibility to masking such that more efficient segmentation and individuation mechanisms reduce the effects of masking. These findings cast doubt on the claim that effectively masked stimuli can be individuated.

An Alpha and Theta Intensive and Short Neurofeedback Protocol for Healthy Aging Working-Memory Training	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; neurofeedback; healthy aging; cognitive training; working memory; alpha; theta	EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; BRAIN; RHYTHMS; AGE	The present study tested the effects of an intensive and short alpha and theta neurofeedback (NF) protocol in working memory (WM) performance in a healthy elder population and explored the effects of a multimodal approach, by supplementing NF with cognitive tasks. Participants were allocated to four groups: NF (N = 9); neurofeedback supplemented with cognitive training (NFCT) (N = 8); cognitive training (CT) (N = 7) and sham neurofeedback (Sham-NF) (N = 6). The intervention consisted in 30-min sessions for 8 days. The NF group presented post intervention increases of alpha and theta relative power as well as performance in the matrix rotation task. In addition, a successful up training of frontal theta showed positive correlation with an improvement of post-training alpha and a better performance in the matrix rotation task. The results presented herein suggest that an intensive and short NF protocol enables elders to learn alpha and theta self-modulation and already presents moderate improvements in cognition and basal EEG. Also, CT group showed moderate performance gains on the cognitive tasks used during the training sessions but no clear improvements on neurophysiology and behavioral measurements were observed. This study represents a first attempt to study the effects of an intensive and short NF protocol in WM performance of elders. The evidence presented here suggests that an intensive and short NF intervention could be a valid alternative for introduction of older populations to NF methodologies.

Differences between control and epileptic groups were determined for both GO and NOGO conditions. The analysis was performed on a set of 19-channel EEG cortical activity signals. We show that for the GO task, the highest brain activity in terms of the density of the CC networks is observed in alpha band for the control group while for the epileptic group the CC network seems disrupted as reflected by the small number of connections. For the NOGO task, the denser CC network was observed in theta band for the control group while widespread differences between the control and the epileptic group were located bilaterally at the left temporal-midline and parietal areas. In order to test the discriminative power of our analysis, we performed a pattern analysis approach based on fuzzy classification techniques. The performance of the classification scheme was evaluated using permutation tests. The analysis demonstrated that, on average, 87.6 % of the subjects were correctly classified in control and epileptic. Thus, our findings may provide a helpful insight on the mechanisms pertaining to the cognitive response of children with well controlled epilepsy and could potentially serve as "functional" biomarkers for early diagnosis.

The instantaneous phase of cortical oscillations at the time of the stimulation has been suggested as a possible source of this variability. To explore this hypothesis, a specific phase needs to be targeted by TMS pulses with high temporal precision. Objective: The aim of this feasibility study was to introduce a methodology capable of exploring the effects of phase-dependent stimulation by the concurrent application of alternating current stimulation (tACS) and TMS. Method: We applied online calibration and closed-loop TMS to target four specific phases (0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees and 270 degrees) of simultaneous 20 Hz tACS over the primary motor cortex (M1) of seven healthy subjects. Result: The integrated stimulation system was capable of hitting the target phase with high precision (SD +/- 2.05 ms, i.e., +/- 14.45 degrees) inducing phase-dependent MEP modulation with a phase lag (CI95% = -40.37 degrees to -99.61 degrees) which was stable across subjects (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The combination of different neuromodulation techniques facilitates highly specific brain state-dependent stimulation, and may constitute a valuable tool for exploring the physiological and therapeutic effect of phase-dependent stimulation, e.g., in the context of neurorehabilitation.

A long-standing hypothesis suggests that a high arousal threshold during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is mediated by sleep spindle oscillations, impairing thalamocortical transmission of incoming sensory stimuli. Here we set out to test this idea directly by examining sensory-evoked neuronal spiking activity during natural sleep. Methods: We compared neuronal (n = 269) and multiunit activity (MUA), as well as local field potentials (LFP) in rat core auditory cortex (A1) during NREM sleep, comparing responses to sounds depending on the presence or absence of sleep spindles. Results: We found that sleep spindles robustly modulated the timing of neuronal discharges in A1. However, responses to sounds were nearly identical for all measured signals including isolated neurons, MUA, and LFPs (all differences < 10%). Furthermore, in 10% of trials, auditory stimulation led to an early termination of the sleep spindle oscillation around 150-250 msec following stimulus onset. Finally, active ON states and inactive OFF periods during slow waves in NREM sleep affected the auditory response in opposite ways, depending on stimulus intensity. Conclusions: Responses in core auditory cortex are well preserved regardless of sleep spindles recorded in that area, suggesting that thalamocortical sensory relay remains functional during sleep spindles, and that sensory disconnection in sleep is mediated by other mechanisms.

Here, we compared the strengths of intracranial functional connectivity between two main hubs of the dorsal stream, namely the left auditory-related cortex (ARC) and Broca's region, in a sample of simultaneous interpreters (Sls) and multilingual control subjects while the participants performed a mixed and unmixed auditory semantic decision task. Under normal listening conditions such kind of tasks are known to initiate a spread of activation along the ventral stream. However, due to extensive and specific training, here we predicted that Sls will more strongly recruit the dorsal pathway in order to pre-activate the speech codes of the corresponding translation. In line with this reasoning, EEG results demonstrate increased left-hemispheric theta phase synchronization in SLI compared to multilingual control participants during early task-related processing stages. In addition, within the SI group functional connectivity strength in the left dorsal pathway was positively related to the cumulative number of training hours across lifespan, and inversely correlated with the age of training commencement. Hence, we propose that the alignment of neuronal oscillations between brain regions involved in "hearing" and "speaking" results from an intertwining of training, sensitive period, and predisposition.

The obtained temporal and spatial patterns of propagation were found to be in line with the neurophysiological hypotheses concerning the synchronization within and between the frontal and parietal brain structures. In particular the role of gamma and theta activity in information processing during a working memory task was elucidated. The modular organization of the brain networks was quantified by means of assortative mixing approach. The similarities and differences in the information transfer during visual and auditory working memory tasks were discussed.	[Kaminski, M.; Blinowska, K.

As the awareness of long-term consequences gradually grows, research has focused on cognitive impairments via questionnaires, but only few have focused on structural or electrophysiological features, such as the peak resting frequency, which is commonly seen as a hallmark of brain function. Methods: We aimed to analyze the long-term progression of the peak resting activity in terms of frequency and power in sepsis survivors. Healthy individuals with no history of ICU stay served as controls. Data were collected three times (shortly, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge) in sepsis survivors and three times in controls. Participants also underwent behavioral neuropsychological assessment. Results: Sepsis survivors exhibited significantly higher spectral power of the dominant peak, which was shifted towards lower frequencies. Within one year, resting frequency increased to the level of controls, but power did not decrease. We observed a close correlation between resting frequency and mental status. Conclusions: Results support the assumption of a causal relationship between brain oscillations and behavioral performance. Significance: We suggest that the postseptic frequency shift is due to abnormal thalamocortical dynamics. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We assessed Jewish-Israeli and Arab-Palestinian adolescents for brain response to the pain of ingroup/outgroup protagonists using magnetoencephalography (MEG), one-on-one positive and conflictual interactions with an outgroup member, attitudes toward the regional conflict, and oxytocin levels. A neural marker of ingroup bias emerged, expressed via alpha modulations in the somatosensory cortex (S1) that characterized an automatic response to the pain of all protagonists followed by rebound/enhancement to ingroup pain only. Adolescents' hostile social interactions with outgroup members and uncompromising attitudes toward the conflict influenced this neural marker. Furthermore, higher oxytocin levels in the Jewish-Israeli majority and tighter brain-to-brain synchrony among group members in the Arab-Palestinian minority enhanced the neural ingroup bias. Findings suggest that in cases of intractable intergroup conflict, top-down control mechanisms may block the brain's evolutionary-ancient resonance to outgroup pain, pinpointing adolescents' interpersonal and sociocognitive processes as potential targets for intervention.

The cerebral cortex is treated as a stochastic, essentially linear, wave medium, the travelling waves generated by, and coordinating, transient foci of bursting, non-linear, gamma oscillation. During the bursts, information stored in synapses on distal dendritic trees of excitatory neurons is input to travelling waves. Interaction of the waves leads to transient steady-states, each approaching global synchrony, and coordinating pulse activity over the cortex. Each approach to global synchrony also determines sequential interactions of the cortex with subcortical systems, thus selecting sequential subsets of cortical state-space. It is further supposed that pre-synaptic competition for scarce resources within each neuron contributes tomaximization of population synchrony. This entanglement of pulse/wave and synaptic dynamics permits a very large set of different transient organizations of pulse activity, and therefore cognitive states. These states can be represented within a closely related embryological model for cortical connectivity. Interaction of cortex and brain-stem also offers means of self-supervision of learning, via linkage to primitive motivational systems that can selectively regulate Hebbian synaptic consolidation.

However, the location of individual brain sources that make such contributions to these evoked responses has not been studied. Thus, an m-sequence pseudorandom stimulus system was developed for use in magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies. Five normal young adults were recorded using an Elekta TRIUX MEG with 306 sensors. Visual stimuli comprised a nine-patch dartboard stimulus, and each patch fluctuated between two luminance levels with separate recordings carried out at low (24 %) and high (96 %) temporal contrast. Sensor-space analysis of MEG evoked fields identified components of the first- and second-order Wiener kernel decomposition that showed qualitative similarity with EEG-based cortical VEP recordings. The first slice of the second-order response (K2.1) was already saturated at 24 % contrast, while the major waveform of the second slice of the second-order response (K2.2) grew strongly with contrast, consistent with properties of the magnocellular and parvocellular neurons. Minimum norm estimates of cortical source localization showed almost simultaneous activation of V1 and MT+ activations with latencies only a little greater that those reported for first neural spikes in primate single cell studies. Time-frequency analysis of the kernel responses from five minimum norm estimate scout sources shows contributions from higher-frequency bands for the first compared with the second slice response, consistent with the proposed neural sources. In support of this magno/parvo break-up, the onset latencies of the K2.2 responses were delayed by approximately 30 ms compared with K2.1 responses.

Therefore, GBeL systems should engage the players in order to support them to maximize their learning outcomes, and provide the players with adequate feedback to maintain their motivation. Innovative engagement monitoring solutions based on players' behaviour are needed to enable engagement monitoring in a non-disturbing way, without interrupting the game-play and game flow. Furthermore, generic metrics and automatic mechanisms for their engagement monitoring and modelling are needed. One important metric that was used for engagement modelling is TimeOnTask, which represents the duration of time required by the player to complete a task. This paper proposes ToTCompute (TimeOnTask Threshold Computation), a novel mechanism that automatically computes - in a task-dependent manner - TimeOnTask threshold values after which student engagement decreases with a given percentage from his initial level of engagement (e.g., after 2 min student engagement will fall with 10 % from his initial level). In this way the mechanism enables engagement modelling at a higher granularity and further enables engagement-based adaptation in GBeL systems. ToTCompute makes use of game-playing information and EEG signals collected through an initial testing session. The results of an experimental case study have shown that ToTCompute can be used to automatically compute threshold values for the TimeOnTask generic engagement metric, which explains up to 76.2 % of the variance in engagement change. Furthermore, the results confirmed the usefulness of the mechanism as the TimeOnTask threshold value is highly task-dependent, and setting its value manually for multiple game tasks would be a laborious process.

Combined administration of ketamine (40 mg/kg) and midazolam (9 mg/kg) induced surgical coma and almost completely suppressed early oscillatory patterns and neuronal firing. These effects persisted over 3 h after injection of the anesthetics. We concluded that general anesthesia induced by combined administration of ketamine and midazolam profoundly suppressed cortical activity in newborn rats, which can trigger neuroapoptosis in the developing brain.

However, the resting theta oscillations during the remission phase are yet unclear. We studied resting theta current source density and functional connectivity in remitted schizophrenia and compared with healthy controls. Significantly increased current source density was found in the dominant anterior cingulate cortex. Increased connectivity between the inferior parietal lobe bilaterally and between the left inferior parietal lobe and right middle frontal gyrus was also found. It may be concluded that schizophrenia patients have aberrant regional theta band current source density and functional connectivity even during remission. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Changes in corticospinal drive to spinal motoneurones following tablet-based practice of manual dexterity	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						Tablet-based practice; corticomuscular; coherence; plasticity; manual dexterity	MOTOR-UNIT COHERENCE; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MOVEMENT REPRESENTATION; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECTIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; MUSCLES; TASK; EMG	The use of touch screens, which require a high level of manual dexterity, has exploded since the development of smartphone and tablet technology. Manual dexterity relies on effective corticospinal control of finger muscles, and we therefore hypothesized that corticospinal drive to finger muscles can be optimized by tablet-based motor practice. To investigate this, sixteen able-bodied females practiced a tablet-based game (3 x 10 min) with their nondominant hand requiring incrementally fast and precise pinching movements involving the thumb and index fingers. The study was designed as a semirandomized crossover study where the participants attended one practice-and one control session. Before and after each session electrophysiological recordings were obtained during three blocks of 50 precision pinch movements in a standardized setup resembling the practiced task. Data recorded during movements included electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from primary motor cortex and electromyographic (EMG) activity from first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles. Changes in the corticospinal drive were evaluated from coupling in the frequency domain (coherence) between EEG-EMG and EMG-EMG activity. Following motor practice performance improved significantly and a significant increase in EEG-EMGAPB and EMGAPB-EMGFDI coherence in the beta band (15-30 Hz) was observed. No changes were observed after the control session. Our results show that tablet-based motor practice is associated with changes in the common corticospinal drive to spinal motoneurons involved in manual dexterity. Tablet-based motor practice may be a motivating training tool for stroke patients who struggle with loss of dexterity.

Hippocampal Non-Theta-Contingent eyeblink Classical Conditioning: A Model System for Neurobiological Dysfunction	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						hippocampus; neurobiological oscillations; theta rhythm; brain-computer interface; cognitive dysfunction; psychiatric disorders	NICTITATING-MEMBRANE RESPONSE; DECREASED EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE PRECESSION; FACILITATES ACQUISITION; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE	Typical information processing is thought to depend on the integrity of neurobiological oscillations that may underlie coordination and timing of cells and assemblies within and between structures. The 3-7 Hz bandwidth of hippocampal theta rhythm is associated with cognitive processes essential to learning and depends on the integrity of cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic forebrain systems. Since several significant psychiatric disorders appear to result from dysfunction of medial temporal lobe (MTL) neurochemical systems, preclinical studies on animal models may be an important step in defining and treating such syndromes. Many studies have shown that the amount of hippocampal theta in the rabbit strongly predicts the acquisition rate of classical eyeblink conditioning and that impairment of this system substantially slows the rate of learning and attainment of asymptotic performance. Our lab has developed a brain-computer interface that makes eyeblink training trials contingent upon the explicit presence or absence of hippocampal theta. The behavioral benefit of theta-contingent training has been demonstrated in both delay and trace forms of the paradigm with a two-to fourfold increase in learning speed over non-theta states. The non-theta behavioral impairment is accompanied by disruption of the amplitude and synchrony of hippocampal local field potentials, multiple-unit excitation, and single-unit response patterns dependent on theta state. Our findings indicate a significant electrophysiological and behavioral impact of the pretrial state of the hippocampus that suggests an important role for this MTL system in associative learning and a significant deleterious impact in the absence of theta. Here, we focus on the impairments in the non-theta state, integrate them into current models of psychiatric disorders, and suggest how improvement in our understanding of neurobiological oscillations is critical for theories and treatment of psychiatric pathology.

We found that beta-band (16-28 Hz) activity shortly before the movement onset is relevant for the decision time to move: the more pronounced the decrease in beta band synchronization, the earlier the subjective experience of the decision to move. The linkage was relevant regarding 'decision', but not regarding 'intention' timing that has been often applied in the study of free will. Our findings suggest that oscillatory neural activity in the beta-band is an important neural signature pertaining to the subjective experience of making a decision to move.

While cognitive control is known to rely on frontoparietal neural architecture to achieve this flexibility, the neural mechanisms that allow such adaptability to context are poorly understood. In the current study, we quantified contextual demands on the cognitive control system via a priori estimation of information across three tasks varying in difficulty (oddball, go/nogo, and switch tasks) and compared neural responses across these different contexts. We report evidence of the involvement of multiple frequency bands during preparation and implementation of cognitive control. Specifically, a common frontoparietal delta and a central alpha process corresponded to rule implementation and motor response respectively. Interestingly, we found evidence of a frontal theta signature that was sensitive to increasing amounts of information and a posterior parietal alpha process only seen during anticipatory rule updating. Importantly, these neural signatures of context processing match proposed frontal hierarchies of control and together provide novel evidence of a complex interplay of multiple frequency bands underpinning flexible, contextually sensitive cognition.

For decades, the suppression of mu (event-related desynchronization) has been used to index movement planning, execution, and imagery. Recent work reports that non-motor processes, such as spatial attention and movement observation, also desynchronize mu, raising the possibility that the mu rhythm is associated with the activity of multiple brain regions and systems. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by recording simultaneous resting-state EEG-fMRI from healthy subjects. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to extract the mu components. The amplitude (power) fluctuations of mu were estimated as a time series using a moving-window approach, which, after convolving with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), was correlated with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from the entire brain. Two main results were found. First, mu power was negatively correlated with BOLD from areas of the sensorimotor network, the attention control network, the putative mirror neuron system, and the network thought to support theory of mind. Second, mu power was positively correlated with BOLD from areas of the salience network, including anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sensorimotor mu rhythm is associated with multiple brain regions and systems. They also suggest that caution should be exercised when attempting to interpret mu modulation in terms of a single brain network.

In everyday situations, response inhibition performance might be altered when irrelevant input is presented simultaneously with the information relevant for response inhibition. More specifically, irrelevant concurrent information may either brace or interfere with response-relevant information, depending on whether these inputs are redundant or conflicting. The aim of this study is to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms and the network underlying such modulations using EEG beamforming as method. The results show that in comparison to a baseline condition without concurrent information, response inhibition performance can be aggravated or facilitated by manipulating the extent of conflict via concurrent input. This depends on whether the requirement for cognitive control is high, as in conflicting trials, or whether it is low, as in redundant trials. In line with this, the total theta frequency power decreases in a right hemispheric orbitofrontal response inhibition network including the SFG, MFG, and SMA, when concurrent redundant information facilitates response inhibition processes. Vice versa, theta activity in a left-hemispheric response inhibition network (i.e., SFG, MFG, and IFG) increases, when conflicting concurrent information compromises response inhibition processes. We conclude that concurrent information bi-directionally shifts response inhibition performance and modulates the network architecture underlying theta oscillations which are signaling different levels of the need for cognitive control.

Several investigations predict severe HE leading to persistent unresponsive wakefulness or death, with high specificity. Only few studies attempted to predict absence of severe HE. Cortical somatosensory evoked high-frequency (600 Hz) oscillation (HFO) bursts indicate the presence of highly synchronized spiking activity in the primary somatosensory cortex. Since global neuronal damage characterizes severe HE preserved cortical HFOs may early exclude severe HE. Methods: We determined amplitudes of early and late HFO bursts in 302 comatose CA patients after median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SSEPs) and clinical outcome upon intensive care unit discharge using the cerebral performance category (CPC) scale. Results: We detected significant early HFO bursts in 146 patients and late HFO bursts in 95 patients. Only one of 27 unresponsive wakefulness patients had a late HFO burst amplitude above 70 nV and all seventeen patients who died despite higher amplitudes died from non-neurological causes. Conclusions: High-frequency SSEP components can reliably be studied in comatose CA patients using standard equipment. Significance: Late HFO burst amplitudes above 70 nV largely exclude severe HE incompatible with regaining consciousness. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Increased alpha band activity indexes inhibitory competition across a border during figure assignment	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Figure-ground; Inhibition; Competition; Electroencephalogram; Alpha	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; TEXTURE SEGREGATION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; GROUND ORGANIZATION; EEG DYNAMICS; BOTTOM-UP; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; SEGMENTATION; EXCITABILITY	Figure-ground assignment is thought to entail inhibitory competition between potential objects on opposite sides of a shared border; the winner is perceived as the figure, and the loser as the shapeless ground. Computational models and response time measures support this understanding but to date no online measure of inhibitory competition during figure-ground assignment has been reported. The current study assays electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha power as a measure of inhibitory competition during figure-ground assignment. Activity in the EEG alpha band has been linked to functional inhibition in the brain, and it has been proposed that increased alpha power reflects increased inhibition. In 2 experiments participants viewed silhouettes designed so that the insides would be perceived as figures. Real world silhouettes depicted namable objects. Novel silhouettes depicted novel objects on the insides of their borders, but varied in the amount of hypothesized cross-border competition for figural status: In "Low-Competition" silhouettes, the borders suggested novel objects on the outside as well as on the inside. In "High-Competition" silhouettes the borders suggested portions of real-world objects on the outside; these compete with the figural properties favoring the inside as figure. Participants accurately categorized both types of novel silhouettes as "novel" objects and were unaware of the real world objects suggested on the outside of the High-Competition silhouettes. In both experiments, we observed more alpha power while participants viewed High-rather than Low-Competition novel silhouettes. These are the first results to show via an online index of neural activity that figure assignment entails inhibitory competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods that are used to investigate brain developments of cognitive function include Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) and the power spectrum of the brain activity. The purposes of this study were to determine the cortico-cortical functional connectivity between brain regions using PDC and to investigate the power spectrum of brain activity while performing cognitive function assessments. Twenty healthy young adults, age between 20 to 30 years old, were asked to perform two tasks/tests; Trail Making Test (TMTA-alphabet, TMTA-number, TMTB-mixed alphabets and numerical) and Stroop Task. An electroencephalogram (EEG) machine was used to record the brain signals, and the data were analyzed using PDC and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our findings showed that not only frontal area but temporal and occipital area also generates information and the information was sent to various scalp location. Theta frequency was significantly increased at frontal area while gamma and high-gamma frequency bands were significantly increased at centro-parieto-occipito-temporal regions. All of these areas are associated with cognitive function doing specific task.

This study tests whether this impairment could be associated with an alteration of the sensorimotor function. To this aim, the cortical activities underlying the sensorimotor function were recorded in twelve volunteers in a reach-to-grasp paradigm, in which the level of ANX and the position of a glass were manipulated. The experimental manipulation of the ANX-related somatosensory state was expected to prompt participants to underestimate their reaching-to-grasp capabilities while the sensorimotor-related oscillatory brain activities around the 6-Hz (theta) frequency over motor-related and parietal regions were expected to be modulated. We also investigated the oscillatory brain dynamics around the 11.5-Hz (fast-a) frequency as a neural hallmark of ANX manipulation induced by the breath-restriction. Results indeed showed that participants underestimated their reaching-to-grasp maximal performance. Concomittantly, theta-EEG synchronization over the motor cortex contralateral to the dominant hand was higher during glass presentation under breath restriction condition (+20.1%; p < 0.05), and when the glass was perceived as non-reachable (+20.0%; p < 0.05). Fast-a-EEG desynchronization was reduced under breath-restriction (-37.7%; p < 0.05). The results confirm that ANX-related impairment of action-perception coupling co-modulates with theta-sensorimotor rhythm. This finding is discussed as an altered "readiness state" in the reaching-related cortical network, while individuals are anxious. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A promising tool for exploring potential biomarkers for mTBI is magnetoencephalography which has the advantage of high spatial and temporal resolution. By adopting proper analytic tools from the field of symbolic dynamics like Lempel-Ziv complexity, we can objectively characterize neural network alterations compared to healthy control by enumerating the different patterns of a symbolic sequence. This procedure oversimplifies the rich information of brain activity captured via MEG. For that reason, we adopted neural-gas algorithm which can transform a time series into more than two symbols by learning brain dynamics with a small reconstructed error. The proposed analysis was applied to recordings of 30 mTBI patients and 50 normal controls in delta frequency band. Our results demonstrated that mTBI patients could be separated from normal controls with more than 97% classification accuracy based on high complexity regions corresponding to right frontal areas. In addition, a reverse relation between complexity and transition rate was demonstrated for both groups. These findings indicate that symbolic complexity could have a significant predictive value in the development of reliable biomarkers to help with the early detection of mTBI.

The aim of this work is to find out if it is possible to obtain quantitative information about the degree of the learning process throughout the training period by analyzing neuro-physiological signals, such as the electroencephalogram, the electrocardiogram and the electrooculogram. In fact, it is well known that such signals correlate with a variety of cognitive processes, e.g. attention, information processing, and working memory. A group of 10 subjects have been asked to train daily with the NASA multi-attribute-task-battery. During such training period the neuro-physiological, behavioral and subjective data have been collected. In particular, the neuro-physiological signals have been recorded on the first (T1), on the third (T3) and on the last training day (T5), while the behavioral and subjective data have been collected every day. Finally, all these data have been compared for a complete overview of the learning process and its relations with the neuro-physiological parameters. It has been shown how the integration of brain activity, in the theta and alpha frequency bands, with the autonomic parameters of heart rate and eyeblink rate could be used as metric for the evaluation of the learning progress, as well as the final training level reached by the subjects, in terms of request of cognitive resources.

Whether changes of high-frequency components of event-related responses are related to plasticity in neural recruitment during stabilization of sensory/cognitive mechanisms accompanying aging or are underlying pathological changes remains unknown. The effect of aging on beta (beta 1: 12.5-20; beta 2: 20.5-30 Hz) and gamma (gamma 1: 30.5-49; gamma 2: 52-69 Hz) band components of ERP was studied in an auditory discrimination task (low-frequency and high-frequency tone) at frontal, central, parietal and occipital cortical locations at short latency (post-stimulus interval 0-250 ms; putative sensory processing) and long latency (250-600 ms; putative cognitive) periods. Beta1 component of the short latency period of ERBRs was less affected by age. The betal activity of the long latency period was reduced by age and more widespread than in the short latency period. The aged difference in betal component spread into fronto-parietal regions and was more expressed after high-frequency than after low tone stimulation. Beta2 and gamma amplitudes were higher with progressive age during sensory processing. Reducing regional-process specificity with progressing age characterized tone-dependent beta2 changes during short latency (sensory), but not during long latency (cognitive) processing. Late latency (cognitive) beta2 and gamma activity diminished with age, except for the frontal high tone responses. With increasing age, gamma2 activity was more expressed over the frontal brain areas in high tone discrimination. We concluded that age influenced more the long latency (cognitive) processes than the short latency (sensory) ones.

Individuals control a BCI system by modulating their brain signals through mental tasks (e.g., motor imagery or mental calculation) or sensory stimulation (e.g., auditory, visual, or tactile). As users modulate their brain signals at different frequencies and at different levels, the appropriate characterization of those signals is necessary. The modulation of brain signals through mental tasks is furthermore a skill that requires training. Unfortunately, not all the users acquire such skill. A practical solution to this problem is to assess the user probability of controlling a BCI system. Another possible solution is to set the bandwidth of the brain oscillations, which is highly sensitive to the users" age, sex and anatomy. With this in mind, Neurolndex, a Python executable script, estimates a neurophysiological prediction index and the individual alpha frequency (IAF) of the user in question. These two parameters are useful to characterize the user EEG signals, and decide how to go through the complex process of adapting the human brain and the computing system on the basis of previously proposed methods. NeurolndeX is not only the implementation of those methods, but it also complements the methods each other and provides an alternative way to obtain the prediction parameter. However, an important limitation of this application is its dependency on the IAF value, and some results should be interpreted with caution. The script along with some electroencephalographic datasets are available on a GitHub repository in order to corroborate the functionality and usability of this application.

In order to investigate how depression and motor impairments differentially and interactively affect specific brain regions in Parkinson's disease, we introduced a new data driven approach, namely Frequency Component Analysis (FCA), to decompose the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 59 subjects with Parkinson's disease into different frequency bands. We then evaluated the main effects of motor severity and depression, and their interactive effects on the BOLD-fMRI signal oscillation energy in these specific frequency components. Our results show that the severity of motor symptoms is more negatively correlated with energy in the frequency band of 0.10-0.25Hz in the bilateral thalamus (THA), but more positively correlated with energy in the frequency band of 0.01-0.027Hz in the bilateral postcentral gyms (PoCG). In contrast, the severity of depressive symptoms is more associated with the higher energy of the high frequency oscillations (>0.1Hz) but lower energy of 0.01-0.027Hz in the bilateral subgenual gyms (SGC). Importantly, the interaction between motor and depressive symptoms is negatively correlated with the energy of high frequency oscillations (>0.1Hz) in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), left hippocampus (HIPP), left inferior orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), but positively correlated with the energy of 0.02-0.05Hz in the left inferior OFC, left TPJ, left inferior temporal gyms (ITG), and bilateral cerebellum. These results demonstrated that FCA was a promising method in interrogating the neurophysiological implications of different brain rhythms. Our findings further revealed the neural bases underlying the interactions as well the dissociations between motor and depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease.

How the regulation of a cortical E/I ratio is affected by sleep and the circadian rhythm however, remains to be established. Here we addressed this issue through the analyses of TMS-evoked responses recorded over a 29 h sleep deprivation protocol conducted in young and healthy volunteers. Spectral analyses of TMS-evoked responses in frontal cortex revealed non-linear changes in gamma band evoked oscillations, compatible with an influence of circadian timing on inhibitory interneuron activity. In silico inferences of cell-to-cell excitatory and inhibitory connectivity and GABA/Glutamate receptor time constant based on neural mass modeling within the Dynamic causal modeling framework, further suggested excitation/inhibition balance was under a strong circadian influence. These results indicate that circadian changes in EEG spectral properties, in measure of excitatory/inhibitory connectivity and in GABA/glutamate receptor function could support the maintenance of cognitive performance during a normal waking day, but also during overnight wakefulness. More generally, these findings demonstrate a slow daily regulation of cortical excitation/inhibition balance, which depends on circadian-timing and prior sleep-wake history.

Simulations show that dense arrays with straightforwardly miniaturized electrodes in terms of size and pitch may not improve the spatial resolution but only strengthen the cross coupling between adjacent channels due to volume conduction. We present a new spatially focused method to improve the electrode spatial selectivity and consequently suppress the neural signal coupling from the sources in the vicinity. Compared with existing spatial filtering methods with fixed coefficients, the proposed method is adaptively optimized for the geometric parameters of the recording electrode arrays, including electrode size, pitch and source depth. The effective spatial bandwidth, characterized as Radius of Half Power, can be reduced by about 70% for ECoG and the case of distant sources scenarios. The proposed method has been applied to the analysis of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in seizures to study the ictal pathway in the epileptogenic region. The results reveal lucid HFO wavefront propagation in both preictal and ictal stages due to a 75% reduction in the coupling effect. The results also show that a specific power threshold of preictal HFOs is needed in order to initiate an epileptic seizure. This demonstrates that our method indeed facilitates the investigation of complex neurobiological signals preprocessing applications.

However, there is hardly any information available regarding the underlying neural correlates of single-and dual-task walking. We had 12 young adults (23.8 +/- 2.8 years) walk while concurrently performing a cognitive interference (CI) or a motor interference (MI) task. Simultaneously, neural activation in frontal, central, and parietal brain areas was registered using a mobile EEG system. Results showed that the MI task but not the CI task affected walking performance in terms of significantly decreased gait velocity and stride length and significantly increased stride time and tempo-spatial variability. Average activity in alpha and beta frequencies was significantly modulated during both CI and MI walking conditions in frontal and central brain regions, indicating an increased cognitive load during dual-task walking. Our results suggest that impaired motor performance during dual-task walking is mirrored in neural activation patterns of the brain. This finding is in line with established cognitive theories arguing that dual-task situations overstrain cognitive capabilities resulting in motor performance decrements.

The Contribution of Thalamocortical Core and Matrix Pathways to Sleep Spindles	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							RAPID EYE-MOVEMENT; CORTICOTHALAMIC FEEDBACK; SLOW WAVES; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; BRAIN RHYTHMS; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; SPIKE	Sleep spindles arise from the interaction of thalamic and cortical neurons. Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) inhibit thalamocortical neurons, which in turn excite the TRN and cortical neurons. A fundamental principle of anatomical organization of the thalamocortical projections is the presence of two pathways: the diffuse matrix pathway and the spatially selective core pathway. Cortical layers are differentially targeted by these two pathways with matrix projections synapsing in superficial layers and core projections impinging on middle layers. Based on this anatomical observation, we propose that spindles can be classified into two classes, those arising from the core pathway and those arising from the matrix pathway, although this does not exclude the fact that some spindles might combine both pathways at the same time. We find evidence for this hypothesis in EEG/MEG studies, intracranial recordings, and computational models that incorporate this difference. This distinction will prove useful in accounting for the multiple functions attributed to spindles, in that spindles of different types might act on local and widespread spatial scales. Because spindle mechanisms are often hijacked in epilepsy and schizophrenia, the classification proposed in this review might provide valuable information in defining which pathways have gone awry in these neurological disorders.

Entrainment to music involves a large network of brain structures, and neural oscillations at beat-related frequencies can help elucidate how this network is connected. Here, we used EEG to investigate steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) during listening and tapping to drum clips with different rhythmic structures that were interrupted by silent breaks of 2-6 sec. This design allowed us to address the question of whether neural entrainment processes persist after the physical presence of musical rhythms and to link neural oscillations and event-related neural responses. During stimulus presentation, SSEPs were elicited in both tasks (listening and tapping). During silent breaks, SSEPs were only present in the tapping task. Notably, the amplitude of the N1 ERP component was more negative after longer silent breaks, and both N1 and SSEP results indicate that neural entrainment was increased when listening to drum rhythms compared with an isochronous metronome. Taken together, this suggests that neural entrainment to music is not solely driven by the physical input but involves endogenous timing processes. Our findings break ground for a tighter linkage between steady-state and transient evoked neural responses in rhythm processing. Beyond music perception, they further support the crucial role of entrained oscillatory activity in shaping sensory, motor, and cognitive processes in general.

DOC patient behavioral assessment is often doubtful since some individuals may retain covert traces of awareness; thus, some Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) patients may be misdiagnosed. The aim of our study was to explore possible differences between the source powers within poly-modal cortices to differentiate Minimally Conscious State (MCS) from UWS. To this end, we recorded an electroencephalogram (EEG) during awake resting state and performed a Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA), which is a 3D source localization method allowing the visualization of the most probable neuroanatomical generators of EEG differences. MCS and UWS patients showed significant variations concerning the frontal source power of delta-band, frontal and parietal of theta, parietal and occipital of alpha, central of beta, and parietal of gamma, in correlation with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score. The alpha-band was the most significant LORETA data correlating with the consciousness level. In addition, we observed a significant correlation between central beta-peaks and the motor abilities and a dissociation between theta and gamma bands within parietal regions. Our findings suggest that LORETA analysis may be useful in DOC differential diagnosis since distinct neurophysiological correlates in some UWS patients could be used to assess deeper the residual cerebral activity of brain areas responsible for covert awareness.

Sleep homeostasis has not been studied in sheep. Here, we establish correlates of sleep homeostasis in sheep through a sleep deprivation experiment. We then use these correlates to elucidate the nature of sleep deficits in a naturally occurring ovine model of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL, Batten disease) caused by a mutation in CLN5. In humans, mutations in this gene lead to cortical atrophy and blindness, as well as sleep abnormalities. We recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs) from unaffected and early stage CLN5(-/-) (homozygous, affected) sheep over 3 consecutive days, the second day being the sleep deprivation day. In unaffected sheep, sleep deprivation led to increased EEG delta (0.5-4 Hz) power during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, increased time spent in the NREM sleep state, and increased NREM sleep bout length. CLN5(-/-) sheep showed comparable increases in time spent in NREM sleep and NREM sleep bout duration, verifying the presence of increased sleep pressure in both groups. Importantly, CLN5(-/-) sheep did not show the increase in NREM sleep delta power seen in unaffected sheep. This divergent delta power response is consistent with the known cortical degeneration in CLN5(-/-) sheep. We conclude that, whereas sleep homeostasis is present in CLN5(-/-) sheep, underlying CLN5(-/-) disease processes prevent its full expression, even at early stages. Such deficits may contribute to early abnormalities seen in sheep and patients and warrant further study.	[Perentos, Nicholas; Martins, Amadeu Q.; Cumming, Robin J. M.; Morton, A.

Methods: We developed a fully automatic algorithm to detect HFOs and classify them based on their morphology, with types defined according to regularity in amplitude and frequency: type 1 with regular amplitude and frequency; type 2 with irregular amplitude, which could result from filtering of sharp spikes; type 3 with irregular frequency; and type 4 with irregular amplitude and frequency. We investigated the association of different HFO types with the seizure onset zone (SOZ), resected area and surgical outcome. Results: HFO rates of all types were significantly higher inside the SOZ than outside. HFO types 1 and 2 were strongly correlated to each other and showed the highest rates among all HFOs. Their occurrence was highly associated with the SOZ, resected area and surgical outcome. The automatic detection emulated visual markings with 93% true positives and 57% false detections. Conclusions: HFO types 1 and 2 similarly reflect epileptogenicity. Significance: For clinical application, it may not be necessary to separate real HFOs from "false oscillations" produced by the filter effect of sharp spikes. Also for automatically detected HFOs, surgical outcome is better when locations with higher HFO rates are included in the resection. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Top-down alpha oscillatory network interactions during visuospatial attention orienting	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha oscillation; Selective attention; Covert visual attention orienting; Transfer entropy; Magnetoencephalography	BAND PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG DYNAMICS; INHIBITION; INCREASES; SUPPRESSION; MODELS; BRAIN	Neuroimaging and lesion studies indicate that visual attention is controlled by a distributed network of brain areas. The covert control of visuospatial attention has also been associated with retinotopic modulation of alpha-band oscillations within early visual cortex, which are thought to underlie inhibition of ignored areas of visual space. The relation between distributed networks mediating attention control and more focal oscillatory mechanisms, however, remains unclear. The present study evaluated the hypothesis that alpha-band, directed, network interactions within the attention control network are systematically modulated by the locus of visuospatial attention. We localized brain areas involved in visuospatial attention orienting using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging and investigated alpha-band Granger-causal interactions among activated regions using narrow-band transfer entropy. The deployment of attention to one side of visual space was indexed by lateralization of alpha power changes between about 400 ms and 700 ms post-cue onset. The changes in alpha power were associated, in the same time period, with lateralization of anterior-to-posterior information flow in the alpha-band from various brain areas involved in attention control, including the anterior cingulate cortex, left middle and inferior frontal gyri, left superior temporal gyrus, and right insula, and inferior parietal lobule, to early visual areas. We interpreted these results to indicate that distributed network interactions mediated by alpha oscillations exert top-down influences on early visual cortex to modulate inhibition of processing for ignored areas of visual space.

J	Ozkurt, TE				Ozkurt, Tolga Esat			Estimation of nonlinear neural source interactions via sliced bicoherence	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Bicoherence; Connectivity; Cross-frequency coupling; Higher-order spectrum; Neural oscillations; Synchronization	BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; BRAIN; EEG; SIGNALS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; STATISTICS; NETWORKS; SPECTRA; DISEASE	Neural oscillations and their spatiotemporal interactions are of interest for the description of brain mechanisms. This study offers a novel third order spectral coupling measure named "sliced bicoherence". It is the diagonal slice of cross-bicoherence allowing an efficient quantification of the nonlinear interactions between neural sources. Our methodology comprises an indirect estimation method, a parametric confidence level formula and a subtracted version for robustness to volume conduction. The methodology provides an efficient estimation of third-order nonlinear cross relations reducing the complexity to the same order of second-order coherence computation. Unlike other bispectral measures, the suggested measure solely holds terms related to cross relations between channel sources and omits the possible strong autobispectral relations. Feasibility and robustness of the methodology are demonstrated both on simulated and publicly available MEG data. The latter were collected for a motor task and an eyes-open resting state. Analytical confidence level marked the non-significant couplings. Simulations confirmed that the subtracted bicoherence enabled robustness to volume conduction by avoiding the spurious nearby channel couplings. Central regions were shown to be coupled with muscular activity by sliced bicoherence. Couplings for spontaneous data occurred particularly at theta and alpha bands. Volume-conduction related bicoherence values originated especially from the low frequencies below 5 Hz. The suggested nonlinear measure is promising to be a part of the rich collection of the multichannel electrophysiological brain connectivity metrics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Twenty-one patients with AN and 24 controls were examined with eyes-closed 16-channel electroencephalogram. Main variables were absolute alpha, theta, and delta amplitudes in frontal, temporal, and posterior regions. Results: There were no significant differences between the AN patients and controls regarding absolute regional band amplitudes in mu V. Borderline significance was found for anterior theta (P=0.051). Significantly increased left and right frontal electrode theta amplitude was found in AN patients (F3, P=0.014; F4, P=0.038) compared to controls. Significant differences were also observed for secondary variables: lower values for relative parietooccipital delta and frontocentral alpha activity among AN patients than among controls. Conclusion: We observed slight excess frontal theta and lower relative alpha and delta amplitudes among AN patients than among controls. This pattern is possibly related to a slight frontal lobe dysfunction in AN, or it may reflect increased attention/vigilance or another state-related change in patients with AN compared to healthy controls.

In contrast, visual gamma-band activity (40-100 Hz) is regarded as representing a bottom-up drive from incoming visual information, with increased synchronisation producing a stronger feedforward impulse for relevant information. However, little is known about the direct relationship between excitability of the visual cortex and these oscillatory mechanisms. In this study we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in an Oz-Cz montage in order to stimulate visual cortex, concurrently recording whole-brain oscillatory activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) whilst participants performed a visual task known to produce strong modulations of alpha-and gamma-band activity. We found that visual stimuli produced expected modulations of alpha and gamma - presenting a moving annulus stimulus led to a strong gamma increase and alpha decrease - and that this pattern was observable both during active (anodal and cathodal) tDCS and sham tDCS. However, tDCS did not seem to produce systematic alterations of these oscillatory responses. The present study thus demonstrates that concurrent tDCS/MEG of the visual system is a feasible tool for investigating visual neuronal oscillations, and we discuss potential reasons for the apparent inability of tDCS to effectively change the amplitude of visual stimulus induced oscillatory responses in the current study.

The current study investigated the beta band range (14-30 Hz) by subdividing the signal into 2 Hz sub -bands. We presented participants with photographs of faces expressing happy, angry, sad or neutral expressions under two primary tasks in which participants judged the emotion the individual was expressing, or how the way the other person feels makes the participant feel. Results revealed a pattern of both suppression and enhancement that appeared to depend on whether the task required first -person emotional experience (self -task) or perspective -taking (other -task). Specifically, the self task was associated with enhancement while the other -task was associated with suppression. While some previous research has reported beta enhancement to emotion -inducing stimuli, other research has reported beta suppression in tasks also associated with mu suppression. To our knowledge, the current data are the first to reveal both beta enhancement and suppression within a single experiment and suggests a neurocognitive dissociation of enhancement and suppression within the beta band range.

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can phase-align and amplify endogenous brain oscillations and has often been used to control and thereby study oscillatory power. Causal investigation of oscillatory phase is more difficult, as it requires precise real-time temporal control over both oscillatory phase and sensory stimulation. Here, we present hardware and software solutions allowing temporally precise presentation of sensory stimuli during tACS at desired tACS phases, enabling causal investigations of oscillatory phase. We developed freely available and easy to use software, which can be coupled with standard commercially available hardware to allow flexible and multi-modal stimulus presentation (visual, auditory, magnetic stimuli, etc.) at pre-determined tACS-phases, opening up a range of new research opportunities. We validate that stimulus presentation at tACS phase in our setup is accurate to the sub-millisecond level with high inter-trial consistency. Conventional methods investigating the role of oscillatory phase such as magneto-/electroencephalography can only provide correlational evidence. Using brain stimulation with the described methodology enables investigations of the causal role of oscillatory phase. This setup turns oscillatory phase into an independent variable, allowing innovative, and systematic studies of its functional impact on perception and cognition.

The Ca(V)3.3 subtype dominates nRt rhythmic bursting and mediates a substantial fraction of spindle power in the NREM sleep EEG. Ca(V)3.2 channels are also found in nRt, but whether these contribute to nRt-dependent spindle generation is unexplored. We investigated thalamic rhythmogenesis in mice lacking this subtype in isolation (Ca(V)3.2KO mice) or in concomitance with Ca(V)3.3 deletion (Ca(V)3. double-knockout (DKO) mice). Methods: We examined discharge characteristics of thalamic cells and intrathalamic evoked synaptic transmission in brain slices from wild-type, Ca(V)3.2KO and Ca(V)3. DKO mice through patch-clamp recordings. The sleep profile of freely behaving Ca(V)3.2KO and Ca(V)3. DKO mice was assessed by polysomnographic recordings. Results: Ca(V)3.2 channel deficiency left nRt discharge properties largely unaltered, but additional deletion of Ca(V)3.3 channels fully abolished low-threshold whole-cell Ca2+ currents and bursting, and suppressed burst-mediated inhibitory responses in TC cells. Ca(V)3. DKO mice had more fragmented sleep, with shorter NREM sleep episodes and more frequent microarousals. The NREM sleep EEG power spectrum displayed a relative suppression of the sigma frequency band (10-15 Hz), which was accompanied by an increase in the delta band (1-4 Hz). Conclusions: Consistent with previous findings, Ca(V)3.3 channels dominate nRt rhythmogenesis, but the lack of Ca(V)3.2 channels further aggravates neuronal, synaptic, and EEG deficits. Therefore, Ca(V)3.2 channels can boost intrathalamic synaptic transmission, and might play a modulatory role adjusting the relative presence of NREM sleep EEG rhythms.

In particular, one of the most important limitations is the necessity to recalibrate the p-BCI system each time before its use, to avoid a significant reduction of its reliability in the detection of the considered mental states. The objective of the proposed study was to provide an example of p-BCIs used to evaluate the users' mental workload in a real operational environment. For this purpose, through the facilities provided by the Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile of Toulouse (France), the cerebral activity of 12 professional air traffic control officers (ATCOs) has been recorded while performing high realistic air traffic management scenarios. By the analysis of the ATCOs' brain activity (electroencephalographic signal-EEG) and the subjective workload perception (instantaneous self-assessment) provided by both the examined ATCOs and external air traffic control experts, it has been possible to estimate and evaluate the variation of the mental workload under which the controllers were operating. The results showed (i) a high significant correlation between the neurophysiological and the subjective workload assessment, and (ii) a high reliability over time (up to a month) of the proposed algorithm that was also able to maintain high discrimination accuracies by using a low number of EEG electrodes (similar to 3 EEG channels). In conclusion, the proposed methodology demonstrated the suitability of p-BCI systems in operational environments and the advantages of the neurophysiological measures with respect to the subjective ones.

High frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings are considered as promising clinical biomarkers of epileptogenic regions in the brain. The aim of this study is to improve and automatize the detection of HFOs by exploring the time frequency content of iEEG and to investigate the seizure onset zone (SOZ) detection accuracy during the sleep, awake and pre-ictal states in patients with epilepsy, for the purpose of assisting the localization of SOZ in clinical practice. Approach. Ten-minute iEEG segments were defined during different states in eight patients with refractory epilepsy. A three-stage algorithm was implemented to detect HFOs in these segments. First, an amplitude based initial detection threshold was used to generate a large pool of HFO candidates. Then distinguishing features were extracted from the time and time frequency domain of the raw iEEG and used with a Gaussian mixture model clustering to isolate HFO events from other activities. The spatial distribution of HFO clusters was correlated with the seizure onset channels identified by neurologists in seven patient with good surgical outcome. Main results. The overlapping rates of localized channels and seizure onset locations were high in all states. The best result was obtained using the iEEG data during sleep, achieving a sensitivity of 81%, and a specificity of 96%. The channels with maximum number of HFOs identified epileptogenic areas where the seizures occurred more frequently. Significance. The current study was conducted using iEEG data collected in realistic clinical conditions without channel pre-exclusion. HFOs were investigated with novel features extracted from the entire frequency band, and were correlated with SOZ in different states. The results indicate that automatic HFO detection with unsupervised clustering methods exploring the time frequency content of raw iEEG can be efficiently used to identify the epileptogenic zone with an accurate and efficient manner.

Graph theory and network science tools have revealed fundamental mechanisms of functional brain organization in resting-state M/EEG analysis. Nevertheless, it is still not clearly understood how several methodological aspects may bias the topology of the reconstructed functional networks. In this context, the literature shows inconsistency in the chosen length of the selected epochs, impeding a meaningful comparison between results from different studies. Approach. The aim of this study was to provide a network approach insensitive to the effects that epoch length has on functional connectivity and network reconstruction. Two different measures, the phase lag index (PLI) and the amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) were applied to EEG resting-state recordings for a group of 18 healthy volunteers using non-overlapping epochs with variable length (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 s). Weighted clustering coefficient (CCw), weighted characteristic path length (L-w) and minimum spanning tree (MST) parameters were computed to evaluate the network topology. The analysis was performed on both scalp and source-space data. Main results. Results from scalp analysis show a decrease in both mean PLI and AEC values with an increase in epoch length, with a tendency to stabilize at a length of 12 s for PLI and 6 s for AEC. Moreover, CCw and L-w show very similar behaviour, with metrics based on AEC more reliable in terms of stability. In general, MST parameters stabilize at short epoch lengths, particularly for MSTs based on PLI (1-6 s versus 4-8 s for AEC). At the source-level the results were even more reliable, with stability already at 1 s duration for PLI-based MSTs. Significance. The present work suggests that both PLI and AEC depend on epoch length and that this has an impact on the reconstructed network topology, particularly at the scalp-level. Source-level MST topology is less sensitive to differences in epoch length, therefore enabling the comparison of brain network topology between different studies.

A classical example of this influence is reported by listeners who perceive an illusory (cross-modal) speech sound (McGurk-effect) when presented with incongruent audio-visual (AV) speech stimuli. Recent neuroimaging studies of AV speech perception accentuate the role of frontal, parietal, and the integrative brain sites in the vicinity of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) for multisensory speech perception. However, if and how does the network across the whole brain participates during multisensory perception processing remains an open question. We posit that a large-scale functional connectivity among the neural population situated in distributed brain sites may provide valuable insights involved in processing and fusing of AV speech. Varying the psychophysical parameters in tandem with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we exploited the trial-by-trial perceptual variability of incongruent audio-visual (AV) speech stimuli to identify the characteristics of the large-scale cortical network that facilitates multisensory perception during synchronous and asynchronous AV speech. We evaluated the spectral landscape of EEG signals during multisensory speech perception at varying AV lags. Functional connectivity dynamics for all sensor pairs was computed using the time-frequency global coherence, the vector sum of pairwise coherence changes over time. During synchronous AV speech, we observed enhanced global gamma-band coherence and decreased alpha and beta-band coherence underlying cross-modal (illusory) perception compared to unisensory perception around a temporal window of 300-600 ms following onset of stimuli. During asynchronous speech stimuli, a global broadband coherence was observed during cross-modal perception at earlier times along with pre-stimulus decreases of lower frequency power, e.g., alpha rhythms for positive AV lags and theta rhythms for negative AV lags. Thus, our study indicates that the temporal integration underlying multisensory speech perception requires to be understood in the framework of large-scale functional brain network mechanisms in addition to the established cortical loci of multisensory speech perception.

J	Hsu, CH; Lee, CY; Liang, WK				Hsu, Chun-Hsien; Lee, Chia-Ying; Liang, Wei-Kuang			An improved method for measuring mismatch negativity using ensemble empirical mode decomposition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Event-related mode; Event-related potential; Hilbert-Huang transformation; Intrinsic mode function; Mismatch negativity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EFFECT SIZE; CHILDREN; STATISTICS; DYNAMICS; DESIGNS; PITCH; MMN	Background: Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a component of event-related potentials (ERPs). Conventional approaches to measuring MMN include recording a large number of trials (e.g., 1000 trials per participant) and extracting signals within a low frequency band, e.g., between 2 Hz and 8 Hz. New Method: Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a method to decompose time series data into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Each IMF has a dominant frequency. Similar to ERP measurement, averaging IMF5 across trials allows measurement of event-related modes (ERMs). This paper demonstrates a protocol that adopts EEMD and Hilbert spectral analyses and uses ERMs to extract MMN-related activity based on electroencephalography data recorded from 18 participants in an MMN paradigm. The effect of deviants was demonstrated by manipulating changes in lexical tones. Results: The mean amplitudes of ERMs revealed a significant effect of lexical tone on MMN. Based on effect size statistics, a significant effect of lexical tone on MMN could be observed using ERM measurements over fewer trials (about 300 trials per participant) in a small sample size (five to six participants). Comparison with Existing Method(s): The EEMD method provided ERMs with remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios and yielded a strong effect size. Furthermore, the experimental requirements for recording MMN (i.e., the number of trials and the sample size) could be reduced while using the suggested analytic method. Conclusions: ERMs may be useful for applying the MMN paradigm in clinical populations and children. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Form and Function of Sleep Spindles across the Lifespan	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; DEPENDENT SYNAPTIC CHANGES; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; EARLY MOTOR-ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; EARLY-ONSET; SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION	Since the advent of EEG recordings, sleep spindles have been identified as hallmarks of non-REM sleep. Despite a broad general understanding of mechanisms of spindle generation gleaned from animal studies, the mechanisms underlying certain features of spindles in the human brain, such as "global" versus "local" spindles, are largely unknown. Neither the topography nor the morphology of sleep spindles remains constant throughout the lifespan. It is likely that changes in spindle phenomenology during development and aging are the result of dramatic changes in brain structure and function. Across various developmental windows, spindle activity is correlated with general cognitive aptitude, learning, and memory; however, these correlations vary in strength, and even direction, depending on age and metrics used. Understanding these differences across the lifespan should further clarify how these oscillations are generated and their function under a variety of circumstances. We discuss these issues, and their translational implications for human cognitive function. Because sleep spindles are similarly affected in disorders of neurodevelopment (such as schizophrenia) and during aging (such as neurodegenerative conditions), both types of disorders may benefit from therapies based on a better understanding of spindle function.

In contrast to the perceptual segregation of two concurrent sounds, the perception of three simultaneous sound objects has not yet been studied systematically. We conducted two experiments in which participants were presented with complex sounds containing sound segregation cues (mistuning, onset asynchrony, differences in frequency or amplitude modulation or in sound location), which were set up to promote the perceptual organization of the tonal elements into one, two, or three concurrent sounds. In Experiment 1, listeners indicated whether they heard one, two, or three concurrent sounds. In Experiment 2, participants watched a silent subtitled movie while EEG was recorded to extract the object-related negativity (ORN) component of the event-related potential. Listeners predominantly reported hearing two sounds when the segregation promoting manipulations were applied to the same tonal element. When two different tonal elements received manipulations promoting them to be heard as separate auditory objects, participants reported hearing two and three concurrent sounds objects with equal probability. The ORN was elicited in most conditions; sounds that included the amplitude- or the frequency -modulation cue generated the smallest ORN amplitudes. Manipulating two different tonal elements yielded numerically and often significantly smaller ORNs than the sum of the ORNs elicited when the same cues were applied on a single tonal element. These results suggest that ORN reflects the presence of multiple concurrent sounds, but not their number. The ORN results are compatible with the horse-race principle of combining different cues of concurrent sound segregation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Proactive, but Not Reactive, Distractor Filtering Relies on Local Modulation of Alpha Oscillatory Activity	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; IRRELEVANT INFORMATION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURAL BASIS	Filter mechanisms that prevent irrelevant information from consuming the limited storage capacity of visual STM are critical for goal-directed behavior. Alpha oscillatory activity has been related to proactive filtering of anticipated distraction. Yet, distraction in everyday life is not always anticipated, necessitating rapid, reactive filtering mechanisms. Currently, the oscillatory mechanisms underlying reactive distractor filtering remain unclear. In the current EEG study, we investigated whether reactive filtering of distractors also relies on alpha-band oscillatory mechanisms and explored possible contributions by oscillations in other frequency bands. To this end, participants performed a lateralized change detection task in which a varying and unpredicted number of distractors were presented both in the relevant hemifield, among targets, and in the irrelevant hemifield. Results showed that, whereas proactive distractor filtering was accompanied by lateralization of alpha-band activity over posterior scalp regions, reactive distractor filtering was not associated with modulations of oscillatory power in any frequency band. Yet, behavioral and post hoc ERP analyses clearly showed that participants selectively encoded relevant information. On the basis of these results, we conclude that reactive distractor filtering may not be realized through local modulation of alpha-band oscillatory activity.

A multi-layer network approach to MEG connectivity analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multi-layer networks; Magnetoencephalography; MEG; Functional connectivity; Neural oscillations; Schizophrenia; Visual cortex; Motor cortex	RESTING-STATE ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; FMRI; EEG; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; STATIONARY; CORTEX; POWER	Recent years have shown the critical importance of inter-regional neural network connectivity in supporting healthy brain function. Such connectivity is measurable using neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, however the richness of the electrophysiological signal makes gaining a complete picture challenging. Specifically, connectivity can be calculated as statistical interdependencies between neural oscillations within a large range of different frequency bands. Further, connectivity can be computed between frequency bands. This pan-spectral network hierarchy likely helps to mediate simultaneous formation of multiple brain networks, which support ongoing task demand. However, to date it has been largely overlooked, with many electrophysiological functional connectivity studies treating individual frequency bands in isolation. Here, we combine oscillatory envelope based functional connectivity metrics with a multi-layer network framework in order to derive a more complete picture of connectivity within and between frequencies. We test this methodology using MEG data recorded during a visuomotor task, highlighting simultaneous and transient formation of motor networks in the beta band, visual networks in the gamma band and a beta to gamma interaction. Having tested our method, we use it to demonstrate differences in occipital alpha band connectivity in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. We further show that these connectivity differences are predictive of the severity of persistent symptoms of the disease, highlighting their clinical relevance. Our findings demonstrate the unique potential of MEG to characterise neural network formation and dissolution. Further, we add weight to the argument that dysconnectivity is a core feature of the neuropathology underlying schizophrenia. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Electroencephalogram was recorded while listeners detected repeating tonal complexes composed of a random set of pure tones within stimuli consisting of randomly varying tonal elements. The repeating pattern was perceived as a figure over the randomly changing background. It was found that detection performance improved both as the number of pure tones making up each repeated complex (figure coherence) increased, and as the number of repeated complexes (duration) increased - i.e., detection was easier when either the spectral or temporal structure of the figure was enhanced. Figure detection was accompanied by the elicitation of the object related negativity (ORN) and the P400 event-related potentials (ERPs), which have been previously shown to be evoked by the presence of two concurrent sounds. Both ERP components had generators within and outside of auditory cortex. The amplitudes of the ORN and the P400 increased with both figure coherence and figure duration. However, only the P400 amplitude correlated with detection performance. These results suggest that 1) the ORN and P400 reflect processes involved in detecting the emergence of a new auditory object in the presence of other concurrent auditory objects; 2) the ORN corresponds to the likelihood of the presence of two or more concurrent sound objects, whereas the P400 reflects the perceptual recognition of the presence of multiple auditory objects and/or preparation for reporting the detection of a target object.

Spectral Variability in the Aged Brain during Fine Motor Control	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; motor control; entropy; oscillations; EEG	ARM MOVEMENTS; ACTIVATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; INTERFERES; PATTERNS; ALPHA	Physiological aging is paralleled by a decline of fine motor skills accompanied by structural and functional alterations of the underlying brain network. Here, we aim to investigate age-related changes in the spectral distribution of neuronal oscillations during fine skilled motor function. We employ the concept of spectral entropy in order to describe the flatness and peaked-ness of a frequency spectrum to quantify changes in the spectral distribution of the oscillatory motor response in the aged brain. Electroencephalogram was recorded in elderly (n = 32) and young (n = 34) participants who performed either a cued finger movement or a pinch or a whole hand grip task with their dominant right hand. Whereas young participant showed distinct, well-defined movement-related power decreases in the alpha and upper beta band, elderly participants exhibited a flat broadband, frequency-unspecific power desynchronization. This broadband response was reflected by an increase of spectral entropy over sensorimotor and frontal areas in the aged brain. Neuronal activation patterns differed between motor tasks in the young brain, while the aged brain showed a similar activation pattern in all tasks. Moreover, we found a wider recruitment of the cortical motor network in the aged brain. The present study adds to the understanding of age-related changes of neural coding during skilled motor behavior, revealing a less predictable signal with great variability across frequencies in a wide cortical motor network in the aged brain. The increase in entropy in the aged brain could be a reflection of random noise-like activity or could represent a compensatory mechanism that serves a functional role.

Electrophysiological Evidence for Alternative Motor Networks in REM Sleep Behavior Disorder	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta oscillations; Parkinson's disease; REM sleep behavior disorder; sleep; subthalamic nucleus	PARKINSONS-DISEASE PATIENTS; HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; BETA-ACTIVITY; MOVEMENT; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT	Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) show mostly unimpaired motor behavior during REM sleep, which contrasts strongly to coexistent nocturnal bradykinesia. The reason for this sudden amelioration of motor control in REM sleep is unknown, however. We set out to determine whether movements during REM sleep are processed by different motor networks than movements in the waking state. We recorded local field potentials in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and scalp EEG (modified 10/20 montage) during sleep in humans withPDand RBD. Time-locked event-related beta band oscillations were calculated during movements in REMsleep compared with movements in the waking state and during NREM sleep. Spectral analysis of STN local field potentials revealed elevated beta power during REM sleep compared with NREM sleep and beta power in REM sleep reached levels similar as in the waking state. Event-related analysis showed time-locked beta desynchronization during WAKE movements. In contrast, we found significantly elevated beta activity before and during movements in REM sleep and NREM sleep. Corticosubthalamic coherence was reduced during REM and NREM movements. We conclude that sleep-related movements are not processed by the same corticobasal ganglia network as movements in the waking state. Therefore, the well-known seemingly normal motor performance during RBD in PD patients might be generated by activating alternative motor networks for movement initiation. These findings support the hypothesis that pathological movement-inhibiting basal ganglia networks in PD patients are bypassed during sleep.

The identification relies on the performance of the classifier. In this paper, identification and monitoring of electroencephalogram-based BCI for motor imagery (MI) task is proposed by an efficient adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier (NFC). The Jaya optimization algorithm is integrated with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems to enhance classification accuracy. The linguistic hedge (LH) is used for proper elicitation and pruning of the fuzzy rules and network is trained using scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) and speeding up SCG (SSCG) techniques. In this paper, Jaya-based k-means is applied to divide the feature set into two mutually exclusive clusters and fire the fuzzy rule. The performance of the proposed classifier, Jaya-based NFC using SSCG as training algorithm and is powered by LH (JayaNFCSSCGLH), is compared with four different NFCs for classifying two class MI-based tasks. We observed a shortening of computation time per iteration by 57.78% in the case of SSCG as compared with the SCG technique of training. LH-based feature selecting capability of the proposed classifier not only reduces computation time but also improves the accuracy by discarding irrelevant features. Lesser computation time with fast convergence and high accuracy among considered NFCs make it a suitable choice for the real-time application. Supremacy of JayaNFCSSCGLH among the considered classifier is validated through Friedman test. Classification result is used to control switching of light emitting diode, turning thoughts into action.

Methods Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to evaluate spontaneous neuromagnetic fields in the ischemic areas of 37 patients with unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease. Voxel-based time-averaged intensity of slow waves was obtained in two frequency bands (0.3-4 Hz and 4-8 Hz) using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) modified for a quantifiable method (sLORETA-qm). ROIs were automatically applied to the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), anterior middle cerebral artery (MCAa), posterior middle cerebral artery (MCAp), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Positron emission tomography with O-15-gas inhalation (O-15-PET) was also performed to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Statistical analyses were performed using laterality index of MEG and O-15-PET in each ROI with respect to distribution and intensity. Results MEG revealed statistically significant laterality in affected MCA regions, including 4-8 Hz waves in MCAa, and 0.3-4 Hz and 4-8 Hz waves in MCAp (95% confidence interval: 0.020-0.190, 0.030-0.207, and 0.034-0.213), respectively. We found that 0.3-4 Hz waves in MCAp were highly correlated with CBF in MCAa and MCAp (r = 0.74, r = 0.68, respectively), whereas 4-8 Hz waves were moderately correlated with CBF in both the MCAa and MCAp (r = 0.60, r = 0.63, respectively). We also found that 4-8 Hz waves in MCAp were statistically significant for misery perfusion identified on 15 O-PET (p<0.05). Conclusions Quantitatively imaged spontaneous neuromagnetic fields using the automated ROI setting enabled clear depiction of cerebral ischemic areas. Frequency analysis may reveal unique neural activity that is distributed in the impaired vascular metabolic territory, in which the cerebral infarction has not yet been completed.

Since the thalamus has extensive reciprocal connection with the cortex, structural and functional thalamic alterations in FM might be linked to aberrant thalamocortical oscillation. This study investigated the presence of abnormal brain rhythmicity in low- and high-frequency bands during resting state in patients with FM and their relationship to clinical pain symptom. Spontaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) activity was recorded in 18 females with FM and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy control (HO) subjects. The most remarkable finding was that FM patients had general increases in theta, beta and gamma power along with a slowing of the dominant alpha peak. Increased spectral powers in the theta-band were primarily localized to the left dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Beta and gamma over-activation were localized to insular, primary motor and primary and secondary somatosensory (S2) cortices, as well as the DLPFC and OFC. Furthermore, enhanced high-frequency oscillatory activities in the DLPFC and OFC were associated with higher affective pain scores in patients with FM. Our results demonstrate that FM patients feature enhanced low- and high-frequency oscillatory activity in the brain areas related to cognitive and emotional modulation of pain. Increased low- and high-frequency activity of the prefrontal cortex may contribute to persistent perception of pain in FM. Therapeutic intervention based on manipulating neural oscillation to restore normal thalamocortical rhythmicity may be beneficial to pain relief in FM.

Determining the Relationship Between Sleep Architecture, Seizure Variables and Memory in Patients With Focal Epilepsy	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	23rd Annual Meeting of International-Behavioral-Neuroscience-Society	JUN 10-15, 2014	Las Vegas, NV			REM latency; hippocampus; discharges; sleep stages; slow-wave sleep	HIPPOCAMPAL-LESIONS; PROCEDURAL MEMORY; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; REM-SLEEP; CONSOLIDATION; SPINDLES; RETENTION; HUMANS; ALZHEIMERS; CHILDHOOD	Sleep has been shown to be important to memory. Both sleep and memory have been found to be abnormal in patients with epilepsy. In this study, we explored the effects that nocturnal epileptiform discharges and the presence of a hippocampal lesion have on sleep patterns and memory. Twenty-five patients with focal epilepsy who underwent a 24-hr ambulatory EEG also completed the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ). The EEG record was scored for length of time spent in the various sleep stages, time spent awake after sleep onset, and rapid eye movement (REM) latency. Of these sleep variables, only REM latency differed when the epilepsy patients were divided on the bases of either presence/absence of nocturnal discharges or presence/absence of a hippocampal lesion. In both cases, presence of the abnormality was associated with longer latency. Furthermore, longer REM latency was found to be a better predictor of EMQ score than either number of discharges or presence of a hippocampal lesion. Longer REM latency was associated with a smaller percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep in the early part of the night and may serve as a particularly sensitive marker to disturbances in sleep architecture.

The Development of Nociceptive Network Activity in the Somatosensory Cortex of Freely Moving Rat Pups	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						development; EEG; neonatal; nociceptive networks; pain	EARLY GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; RECORDING EEG; NEONATAL-RAT; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; SURGICAL INCISION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; TELEMETRY SYSTEM; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; BARREL CORTEX; INFANT BRAIN	Cortical perception of noxious stimulation is an essential component of pain experience but it is not known how cortical nociceptive activity emerges during brain development. Here we use continuous telemetric electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake active rat pups to map functional nociceptive processing in the developing brain over the first 4 weeks of life. Cross-sectional and longitudinal recordings show that baseline S1 ECoG energy increases steadily with age, with a distinctive beta component replaced by a distinctive theta component in week 3. Event-related potentials were evoked by brief noxious hindpaw skin stimulation at all ages tested, confirming the presence of functional nociceptive spinothalamic inputs in S1. However, hindpaw incision, which increases pain sensitivity at all ages, did not increase S1 ECoG energy until week 3. A significant increase in gamma (20-50 Hz) energy occurred in the presence of skin incision at week 3 accompanied by a longer-lasting increase in theta (4-8Hz) energy at week 4. Continuous ECoG recording demonstrates specific postnatal functional stages in the maturation of S1 cortical nociception. Somatosensory cortical coding of an ongoing pain "state" in awake rat pups becomes apparent between 2 and 4 weeks of age.

One important aspect of this information concerns the emotional state of other individuals, conveyed by distinct visual cues such as facial expressions, overt actions, or by cues extracted from the situational context. A rich body of theoretical and empirical work has demonstrated that these socioemotional cues are processed by the human visual system in a prioritized fashion, in the service of optimizing social behavior. Furthermore, socioemotional perception is highly dependent on situational contexts and previous experience. Here, we review current issues in this area of research and discuss the utility of the steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) technique for addressing key empirical questions. Methodological advantages and caveats are discussed with particular regard to quantifying time-varying competition among multiple perceptual objects, trial-by-trial analysis of visual cortical activation, functional connectivity, and the control of low-level stimulus features. Studies on facial expression and emotional scene processing are summarized, with an emphasis on viewing faces and other social cues in emotional contexts, or when competing with each other. Further, because the ssVEP technique can be readily accommodated to studying the viewing of complex scenes with multiple elements, it enables researchers to advance theoretical models of socioemotional perception, based on complex, quasinaturalistic viewing situations.

Non-Sinusoidal Activity Can Produce Cross-Frequency Coupling in Cortical Signals in the Absence of Functional Interaction between Neural Sources	PLoS One			English	Article							OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-POWER; CORTEX; PHASE; MEMORY; EXCITABILITY; ALPHA; EEG	The analysis of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has become popular in studies involving intracranial and scalp EEG recordings in humans. It has been argued that some cases where CFC is mathematically present may not reflect an interaction of two distinct yet functionally coupled neural sources with different frequencies. Here we provide two empirical examples from intracranial recordings where CFC can be shown to be driven by the shape of a periodic waveform rather than by a functional interaction between distinct sources. Using simulations, we also present a generalized and realistic scenario where such coupling may arise. This scenario, which we term waveform-dependent CFC, arises when sharp waveforms (e.g., cortical potentials) occur throughout parts of the data, in particular if they occur rhythmically. Since the waveforms contain both low-and high-frequency components, these components can be inherently phase-aligned as long as the waveforms are spaced with appropriate intervals. We submit that such behavior of the data, which seems to be present in various cortical signals, cannot be interpreted as reflecting functional modulation between distinct neural sources without additional evidence. In addition, we show that even low amplitude periodic potentials that cannot be readily observed or controlled for, are sufficient for significant CFC to occur.

In this study, in a nonclinical sample, we compared effects of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms on oscillatory dynamics accompanying perception of emotional facial expressions in the context of social interactions. Anxiety was associated with a longer reaction time, with preference of avoidance behavior, and with enhanced event-related alpha desynchronization and diminished theta synchronization. Depression did not show significant behavioral effects and was associated with diminished alpha desynchronization and augmented delta and theta synchronization in prefrontal cortical regions. Thus, in spite of frequent comorbidity, anxiety and depression show opposite patterns of associations with oscillatory dynamics accompanying social interactions. These patterns imply that anxiety is associated with hyper-reactive attentional system, whereas depression show signs of diminished cognitive reactivity. Depression-related enhancement of low-frequency synchronization in prefrontal cortex may reflect a compensatory mechanism of cognitive and emotional upregulation, which depression-prone individuals engage in the process of social interactions.

Brain-activity-based feedback is a promising tool for the modulation of cortical activity. Here, we validated a neurofeedback protocol designed to change relative frontal asymmetry based on individual alpha peak frequencies, including real-time average referencing and eye-correction. Participants (N = 60) were randomly assigned to a right, left or placebo neurofeedback group. Results show a difference in trainability between groups, with a linear change in frontal alpha asymmetry over time for the right neurofeedback group during rest. Moreover, the asymmetry changes in the right group were frequency and location specific, even though trainability did not persist at 1 week and 1 month follow-ups. On the behavioral level, subjective stress on the second test day was reduced in the left and placebo neurofeedback groups, but not in the right neurofeedback group. We found individual differences in trainability that were dependent on training group, with participants in the right neurofeedback group being more likely to change their frontal asymmetry in the desired direction. Individual differences in trainability were also reflected in the ability to change frontal asymmetry during the feedback.	[Quaedflieg, C. W. E. M.; Smulders, F. T.

A unified statistical model for the human electrocorticogram	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Epilepsy; Log normal distribution; Power law; Synchronisation	AUTOMATED IMAGE REGISTRATION; POWER; DISTRIBUTIONS; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Extracellular field potentials ( ECFs) generated in the cerebral cortex span a vast range of spatiotemporal scales. The process(es) leading to this large dynamic range remain debatable. Here we propose a novel statistical description of the amplitude spectrum of the human electrocorticogram (ECoG). Methods: Spectral analysis was performed on long-term recordings from epilepsy patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation with intracranial electrodes. Amplitude spectra were fit with a multicomponent Gaussian model on semi-logarithmic axes. Results: The Gaussian formulation provided excellent fits to the data. It also suggested how the changes accompanying the sleep-wake cycle and certain epileptiform transitions could be understood by variation in the parameters of the model. Conclusions: The proposed continuum model synthesizes several previous observations regarding the statistical structure of the resting human ECoG. It offers a conceptual platform for understanding the EEG changes accompanying the sleep-wake cycle and pathologically hypersynchronous behaviour. Significance: Statistical characterisation of the spectral distribution of field potentials yield insight into the cortico-cortical interactions that underlie the summated cortical ECFs comprising the ECoG. Such insight is relevant for a synoptic understanding of major state changes in the brain that are diagnosed in clinical practice by visual inspection of the ECoG.

Magnetoencephalographic evidence from healthy aging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Precentral gyrus; Oscillations; Motor network; Motor control	MOTOR CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR-CORTEX; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; OSCILLATIONS; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; LOCALIZATION	Previous research has connected a specific pattern of beta oscillatory activity to proper motor execution, but no study to date has directly examined how resting beta levels affect motor-related beta oscillatory activity in the motor cortex. Understanding this relationship is imperative to determining the basic mechanisms of motor control, as well as the impact of pathological beta oscillations on movement execution. In the current study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a complex movement paradigm to quantify resting beta activity and movement-related beta oscillations in the context of healthy aging. We chose healthy aging as a model because preliminary evidence suggests that beta activity is elevated in older adults, and thus by examining older and younger adults we were able to naturally vary resting beta levels. To this end, healthy younger and older participantswere recorded during motor performance and at rest. Using beamforming, we imaged the peri-movement beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) and extracted virtual sensors from the peak voxels, which enabled absolute and relative beta power to be assessed. Interestingly, absolute beta power during the pre-movement baseline was much stronger in older relative to younger adults, and older adults also exhibited proportionally large beta desynchronization (ERD) responses during motor planning and execution compared to younger adults. Crucially, we found a significant relationship between spontaneous (resting) beta power and beta ERD magnitude in both primary motor cortices, above and beyond the effects of age. A similar link was found between beta ERD magnitude and movement duration. These findings suggest a direct linkage between beta reduction during movement and spontaneous activity in the motor cortex, such that as spontaneous beta power increases, a greater reduction in beta activity is required to execute movement. We propose that, on an individual level, the primary motor cortices have an absolute threshold of beta power that must be reached in order to move, and that an inability to suppress beta power to this threshold results in an increase in movement duration.

Until recently, mental fatigue is thought to be related to functional dysconnectivity among brain regions. However, the topological representation of brain functional connectivity altered by mental fatigue is only beginning to be revealed. In the current study, we applied a graph theoretical approach to analyse such topological alterations in the lower alpha band (8 similar to 10 Hz) of EEG data from 20 subjects undergoing a two-session experiment, in which one session includes four successive blocks with visual oddball tasks (session 1) whereas a mid-task break was introduced in the middle of four task blocks in the other session (session 2). Phase lag index (PLI) was then employed to measure functional connectivity strengths for all pairs of EEG channels. Behavior and connectivity maps were compared between the first and last task blocks in both sessions. Inverse efficiency scores (IES = reaction time/response accuracy) were significantly increased in the last task block, showing a clear effect of time-on-task in participants. Furthermore, a significant block-by-session interaction was revealed in the IES, suggesting the effectiveness of the mid-task break on maintaining task performance. More importantly, a significant session-independent deficit of global integration and an increase of local segregation were found in the last task block across both sessions, providing further support for the presence of a reshaped topology in functional brain connectivity networks under fatigue state. Moreover, a significant block-by-session interaction was revealed in the characteristic path length, small-worldness, and global efficiency, attributing to the significantly disrupted network topology in session 1 in comparison of the maintained network structure in session 2. Specifically, we found increased nodal betweenness centrality in several channels resided in frontal regions in session 1, resembling the observations of more segregated global architecture under fatigue state. Taken together, our findings provide insights into the substrates of brain functional dysconnectivity patterns for mental fatigue and reiterate the effectiveness of the mid-task break on maintaining brain network efficiency.

A phenomenon that is recently mentioned as one of information encoding strategies in the brain is cross frequency coupling (CFC), means the interactions between different frequency bands in physiological signals such as EEG. This interaction can occur between various components of such signals including amplitude or power, phase and frequency. Different types of CFC have been reported in various cognitive tasks and within or between different brain regions. However the role of CFC in encoding of information about the category of visual objects is greatly unknown and here we attempted to investigate it. So in this paper, we used machine learning algorithms to find out whether CFC contains such information. To this end, we recorded EEG from 10 participants while they were observing stimuli from 12 different visual object categories. Then amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and phase-phase coupling (PPC) within each electrode were calculated for the recorded signals in order to use them as input to SVM classifier. The results show that phase-phase coupling can provide more information about the category of objects compared to other types of CFC, by classification performance of 92.33% against 70.28% and 60.52% for phase-amplitude and amplitude-amplitude coupling, respectively. In addition, this feature was more informative when occurred between alpha and gamma frequency bands. The performance of classification by means of CFC features was then compared with the result of classification by wavelet transform on the same data. We observed that PAC can improve the performance of categorical-based classification relative to wavelet coefficients (with the performance of 70.73%). So we can conclude that cross frequency coupling encompass useful information about semantic category of stimuli which is not available in time-frequency components of the signal obtained by wavelet transform.

Recent studies have investigated the effects of OXT in different levels of analysis (from genetic to behavioral) chiefly targeting its impact on the social component and only indirectly indicating its implications in other components of our socio-interactive abilities. This article aims at shedding light onto how OXT might be modulating the multimodality that characterizes our higher-order linguistic abilities (vocal-auditory-attentional-memory-social systems). Based on evidence coming from genetic, EEG, fMRI, and behavioral studies, I attempt to establish the promises of this perspective with the goal of stressing the need for neuropeptide treatments to enter clinical practice.

Exploiting Electrocorticographic Spectral Characteristics for Optimized Signal Chain Design: A 1.08 Analog Front End With Reduced ADC Resolution Requirements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Biopotential; brain-computer interface (BCI); electrocorticography (ECoG); flicker noise; low-power; neural amplifier	GAMMA ACTIVITY; MU-W; OSCILLATIONS; AMPLIFIER; CORTEX; EEG	Electrocorticography (ECoG) is an important area of research for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development. ECoG, along with some other biopotentials, has spectral characteristics that can be exploited for more optimal front-end performance than is achievable with conventional techniques. This paper optimizes noise performance of such a system and discusses an equalization technique that reduces the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) dynamic range requirements and eliminates the need for a variable gain amplifier (VGA). We demonstrate a fabricated prototype in 1p9m 65 nm CMOS that takes advantage of the presented findings to achieve high-fidelity, full-spectrum ECoG recording. It requires 1.08 mu W over a 150 Hz bandwidth for the entire analog front end and only 7 bits of ADC resolution.

Li proposed in 1990 an odor segmentation mechanism using the centrifugal feedback from the olfactory cortex to the olfactory bulb. This feedback suppresses the bulbar responses to the ongoing and already recognized odors so that a subsequent addition of a foreground odor can be singled out for recognition. Additionally, the feedback can depend on context so as to, for example, enhance sensitivity to a target odor or improve discrimination between similar odors. I review experimental data that have since emerged in relation to the computational predictions and implications, and suggest experiments to test the model further.

Modulation of the beta rhythm (15-25Hz) as the well-established oscillatory movement execution-inhibition indicator was tested during a cognitive-motor task in patients with Tourette syndrome. MethodsPerforming a Go/NoGo task, 12 patients with Tourette syndrome and 12 matched controls were recorded using whole-head magnetoencephalography. ResultsCompared to healthy participants, patients showed less beta suppression in the sensorimotor area and enhanced beta power in parieto-occipital brain regions contralaterally to the response hand. Average beta power and power gain correlated negatively with tic severity. ConclusionsIncreased motor inhibitory as well as visuomotor attentional processes are likely to subserve tic compensation.

Human amygdala activation during rapid eye movements of rapid eye movement sleep: an intracranial study	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						Gamma activity; limbic system; stereo EEG; saccades	HUMAN REM-SLEEP; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PONTOGENICULOOCCIPITAL WAVES; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FEAR; EMOTION; MICROINJECTION; NEUROSCIENCE; ENHANCEMENT	The amygdaloid complex plays a crucial role in processing emotional signals and in the formation of emotional memories. Neuroimaging studies have shown human amygdala activation during rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Stereotactically implanted electrodes for presurgical evaluation in epileptic patients provide a unique opportunity to directly record amygdala activity. The present study analysed amygdala activity associated with REM sleep eye movements on the millisecond scale. We propose that phasic activation associated with rapid eye movements may provide the amygdala with endogenous excitation during REM sleep. Standard polysomnography and stereoelectroencephalograph (SEEG) were recorded simultaneously during spontaneous sleep in the left amygdala of four patients. Time-frequency analysis and absolute power of gamma activity were obtained for 250 ms time windows preceding and following eye movement onset in REM sleep, and in spontaneous waking eye movements in the dark. Absolute power of the 44-48 Hz band increased significantly during the 250 ms time window after REM sleep rapid eye movements onset, but not during waking eye movements. Transient activation of the amygdala provides physiological support for the proposed participation of the amygdala in emotional expression, in the emotional content of dreams and for the reactivation and consolidation of emotional memories during REM sleep, as well as for next-day emotional regulation, and its possible role in the bidirectional interaction between REM sleep and such sleep disorders as nightmares, anxiety and post-traumatic sleep disorder. These results provide unique, direct evidence of increased activation of the human amygdala time-locked to REM sleep rapid eye movements.

In this study we aimed for the classification of operator workload as it is expected in many real-life workplace environments. We explored brain-signal based workload predictors that differ with respect to the level of label information required for training, including entirely unsupervised approaches. Approach. Subjects executed a task on a touch screen that required continuous effort of visual and motor processing with alternating difficulty. We first employed classical approaches for workload state classification that operate on the sensor space of EEG and compared those to the performance of three state-of-the-art spatial filtering methods: common spatial patterns (CSPs) analysis, which requires binary label information; source power co-modulation (SPoC) analysis, which uses the subjects' error rate as a target function; and canonical SPoC (cSPoC) analysis, which solely makes use of cross-frequency power correlations induced by different states of workload and thus represents an unsupervised approach. Finally, we investigated the effects of fusing brain signals and peripheral physiological measures (PPMs) and examined the added value for improving classification performance. Main results. Mean classification accuracies of 94%, 92% and 82% were achieved with CSP, SPoC, cSPoC, respectively. These methods outperformed the approaches that did not use spatial filtering and they extracted physiologically plausible components. The performance of the unsupervised cSPoC is significantly increased by augmenting it with PPM features. Significance. Our analyses ensured that the signal sources used for classification were of cortical origin and not contaminated with artifacts. Our findings show that workload states can be successfully differentiated from brain signals, even when less and less information from the experimental paradigm is used, thus paving the way for real-world applications in which label information may be noisy or entirely unavailable.

Further studies on the neuromuscular substrates are needed. Methods: We analyzed 16 patients with advanced iPD and bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation, and 13 age-and gender-matched healthy controls. Patients were tested after overnight withdrawal of medication with 'stimulation off' (StimOff) and 'stimulation on' (StimOn). Subjects performed continuous tapping of the right index finger with simultaneous recordings of biomechanical registration, EMG of finger flexors and extensors, and EEG. First, we analyzed EEG and EMG spectral measures comparing StimOff with healthy controls and StimOff with StimOn (irrespective of freezing). Second, we contrasted 'regular (unimpaired) tapping' and 'freezing' resistant to subthalamic neurostimulation as obtained in StimOn. Results: iPD showed increased intermuscular coherence around 8 Hz in StimOff that was reduced in StimOn. This 8 Hz muscular activity was not coherent to cortical activity. 'Freezing' episodes showed increased muscle activity of finger flexors and extensors at 6-9 Hz, and increased cortical activity at 7-11 Hz. During transition from regular tapping to 'freezing' the cortical activity first increased over the left sensorimotor area followed by a spread to the left frontal and right parietal areas. Conclusions: We identified neuromuscular motor network features of subthalamic neurostimulation therapy and resistant upper limb freezing that point to increased low-frequency muscular and cortical activity. Significance: Together, our findings demonstrate several motor network abnormalities associated with upper limb freezing that may translate into future research on freezing of gait in iPD.

Here, we combined immersive virtual reality and EEG recording to explore whether embodying the errors of an avatar by seeing it from a first-person perspective may activate the error monitoring system in the brain of an onlooker. We asked healthy participants to observe, from a first-or third-person perspective, an avatar performing a correct or an incorrect reach-to-grasp movement toward one of two virtual mugs placed on a table. At the end of each trial, participants reported verbally how much they embodied the avatar's arm. Ratings were maximal in first-person perspective, indicating that immersive virtual reality can be a powerful tool to induce embodiment of an artificial agent, even through mere visual perception and in the absence of any cross-modal boosting. Observation of erroneous grasping from a first-person perspective enhanced error-related negativity and medial frontal theta power in the trials where human onlookers embodied the virtual character, hinting at the tight link between early, automatic coding of error detection and sense of embodiment. Error positivity was similar in 1PP and 3PP, suggesting that conscious coding of errors is similar for self and other. Thus, embodiment plays an important role in activating specific components of the action monitoring system when others' errors are coded as if they are one's own errors.

However, in contrast to faces, name processing has rarely been studied in individuals with ASD. Here, we investigated brain activity and functional connectivity associated with recognition of names in the high-functioning ASD group and in the control group. Methods: EEG was recorded in 15 young males with ASD and 15 matched one-to-one control individuals. EEG data were analyzed with the event-related potential (ERP), event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization (ERD/ S), as well as coherence and direct transfer function (DTF) methods. Four categories of names were presented visually: one's own, close-other's, famous, and unknown. Results: Differences between the ASD and control groups were found for ERP, coherence, and DTF. In individuals with ASD, P300 (a positive ERP component) to own-name and to a close-other's name were similar whereas in control participants, P300 to own-name was enhanced when compared to all other names. Analysis of coherence and DTF revealed disruption of fronto-posterior task-related connectivity in individuals with ASD within the beta range frequencies. Moreover, DTF indicated the directionality of those impaired connections-they were going from parieto-occipital to frontal regions. DTF also showed inter-group differences in short-range connectivity: weaker connections within the frontal region and stronger connections within the occipital region in the ASD group in comparison to the control group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a lack of the self-preference effect and impaired functioning of the attentional network during recognition of visually presented names in individuals with ASD.

The following study aimed to investigate whether this recovery is due to a loss in neural synchrony by regarding the response to a given frequency. Methods: Magnetoencephalography measurements were conducted in 36 survivors of severe sepsis and septic shock three times within a time range of 12 months after discharge from intensive care unit. We analyzed steady state visual evoked responses using a set of familiar vs. unfamiliar pictures. Results: Sepsis survivors exhibit oscillatory deficits in terms of an impaired response to periodic visual stimulation. Oscillatory deficits and neuropsychological impairments obtained by the DemTect questionnaire were strongly linked. Impaired responses were equally found during the presentation of familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. Compared to familiar stimuli however, the response to unfamiliar stimuli was significantly lower in the follow up but not in the post-acute stage. Conclusions: We assume that the processing of unfamiliar pictures requires a higher amount of networking. In case of a disrupted network, complex networking might not be maintained.

J	Perry, G				Perry, Gavin			The visual gamma response to faces reflects the presence of sensory evidence and not awareness of the stimulus	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; gamma-band; oscillations; awareness; face perception	CONSCIOUS AWARENESS; BAND ACTIVITY; CORTEX; ACTIVATION; SIGNAL; EEG	It has been suggested that gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations mediate awareness of visual stimuli, but tests of this hypothesis have produced differing results. We used phase scrambling to vary the perceptibility of face stimuli in order to determine whether gamma is indeed linked to perceptual awareness. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure the gamma response in 25 participants while viewing three conditions in which faces were presented either above, below or at the threshold for detection. In each of 400 trials (100 each for the sub-and suprathreshold conditions, 200 for the threshold condition), participants indicated whether they perceived a face in the stimulus. Gamma-band activity during the task was localized to bilateral ventral occipito-temporal cortex. For the threshold condition, we failed to find a significant difference in gamma amplitude between trials in which a face was perceived relative to those in which no face was perceived. However, we did find that gamma amplitude was significantly increased for threshold relative to subthreshold stimuli and for suprathreshold relative to threshold stimuli. This leads us to conclude that the gamma response to faces is primarily modulated by the presence of sensory evidence of a face rather by perceptual awareness.

Evidence from Frontal Theta Rhythm	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrophysiology; embodied cognition; inhibition processes; negation; theta rhythms	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; TEXT INFORMATION; GO/NOGO TASK; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; ACCESSIBILITY; DISEMBODIMENT; INTERFERENCE; RETRIEVAL; SENTENCES	According to the literature, negations such as "not" or "don't" reduce the accessibility in memory of the concepts under their scope. Moreover, negations applied to action contents (e.g., "don't write the letter") impede the activation of motor processes in the brain, inducing "disembodied" representations. These facts provide important information on the behavioral and neural consequences of negations. However, how negations themselves are processed in the brain is still poorly understood. In two electrophysiological experiments, we explored whether sentential negation shares neural mechanisms with action monitoring or inhibition. Human participants read action-related sentences in affirmative or negative form ("now you will cut the bread" vs "now you will not cut the bread") while performing a simultaneous Go/NoGo task. The analysis of the EEG rhythms revealed that theta oscillations were significantly reduced for NoGo trials in the context of negative sentences compared with affirmative sentences. Given the fact that theta oscillations are often considered as neural markers of response inhibition processes, their modulation by negative sentences strongly suggests that negation uses neural resources of response inhibition. We propose a new approach that views the syntactic operator of negation as relying on the neural machinery of high-order action-monitoring processes.

Aged rats show dominant modulation of lower frequency hippocampal theta rhythm during running	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; Treadmill running; Hippocampal theta rhythm; Physical activity; Heart rate	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MOTOR-ACTIVITY; SLOW ACTIVITY; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; WORKING-MEMORY; HEART-RATE; SLEEP	Aging causes considerable decline in both physiological and mental functions, particularly cognitive function. The hippocampal theta rhythm (4-12 Hz) is related to both cognition and locomotion. Aging-related findings of the frequency and amplitude of hippocampal theta oscillations are inconsistent and occasionally contradictory. This inconsistency may be due to the effects of the sleep/wake state and different frequency subbands being overlooked. We assumed that aged rats have lower responses of the hippocampal theta rhythm during running, which is mainly due to the dominant modulation of theta frequency subbands related to cognition. By simultaneously recording electroencephalography, physical activity (PA), and the heart rate (HR), this experiment explored the theta oscillations before, during, and after treadmill running at a constant speed in 8-week-old (adult) and 60-week-old (middle-aged) rats. Compared with adult rats, the middle-aged rats exhibited lower theta activity in all frequency ranges before running. Running increased the theta frequency (Frq, 4-12 Hz), total activity of the whole theta band (total power, TP), activity of the middle theta frequency (MT, 6.5-9.5 Hz), and PA in both age groups. However, the middle-aged rats still showed fewer changes in these parameters during the whole running process. After the waking baseline values were substracted, middle-aged rats showed significantly fewer differences in Delta Frq, Delta TP, and Delta MT but significantly more differences in low-frequency theta activity (4.0-6.5Hz) and HR than the adult rats did. Therefore, the decreasing activity and response of the whole theta band in the middle-aged rats resulted in dominant modulation of the middle to lower frequency (4.0-9.5 Hz) theta rhythm. The different alterations in the theta rhythm during treadmill running in the two groups may reflect that learning decline with age. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigate how such phoneme clusters that potentially serve as sublexical markers of affect can influence language processing. We registered the EEG signal during a lexical decision task with a novel manipulation of the words' putative sublexical affective potential: the means of valence and arousal values for single phoneme clusters, each computed as a function of respective values of words from the database these phoneme clusters occur in. Our experimental manipulations also investigate potential contributions of formal salience to the sublexical affective potential: Typically, negative high-arousing phonological segments based on our calculations tend to be less frequent and more structurally complex than neutral ones. We thus constructed two experimental sets, one involving this natural confound, while controlling for it in the other. A negative high-arousing sublexical affective potential in the strictly controlled stimulus set yielded an early posterior negativity (EPN), in similar ways as an independent manipulation of lexical affective content did. When other potentially salient formal features at the sublexical level were not controlled for, the effect of the sublexical affective potential was strengthened and prolonged (250-650 ms), presumably because formal salience helps making specific phoneme clusters efficient sublexical markers of negative high arousing affective meaning. These neurophysiological data support the assumption that the organization of a language's vocabulary involves systematic sound-to-meaning correspondences at the phonemic level that influence the way we process language.

Methods: We calculated mean and standard deviation of wavelet entropy in 303 non-epileptic and 334 epileptic channels from 50 patients with intracerebral depth electrodes and used these measures as predictors in a multivariable logistic regression model. We assessed sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) based on a probability threshold corresponding to 90% specificity. Results: The probability of a channel being epileptic increased with higher mean (p = 0.004) and particularly with higher standard deviation (p < 0.0001). The performance of the model was however not sufficient for fully classifying the channels. With a threshold corresponding to 90% specificity, sensitivity was 37%, PPV was 80%, and NPV was 56%. Conclusions: A channel with a high standard deviation of entropy is likely to be epileptic; with a threshold corresponding to 90% specificity our model can reliably select a subset of epileptic channels. Significance: Most studies have concentrated on brief ripple events. We showed that background activity in the ripple band also has some ability to discriminate epileptic channels.

Current source density and functional connectivity were measured using eLORETA software. We found significantly decreased eLORETA source analysis oscillations in the occipital, parietal, posterior cingulate, and posterior temporal lobes in Alpha and Alpha-2. For connectivity analysis, we assessed functional connectivity within Menon triple network model of neuropathology. We found support for all three networks of the triple network model, namely the central executive network (CEN), salience network (SN), and the default mode network (DMN) indicating hypo-connectivity in the Delta, Alpha, and Alpha-2 frequency bands in patients with ME compared to controls. In addition to the current source density resting state dysfunction in the occipital, parietal, posterior temporal and posterior cingulate, the disrupted connectivity of the CEN, SN, and DMN appears to be involved in cognitive impairment for patients with ME. This research suggests that disruptions in these regions and networks could be a neurobiological feature of the disorder, representing underlying neural dysfunction.

In our study, we hypothesized that an NFT with a motor imagery-based BCI (MI-BCI) could enhance cognitive functions related to aging effects. To assess the effectiveness of our MI-BCI application, 63 subjects (older than 60 years) were recruited. This novel application was used by 31 subjects (NFT group). Their Luria neuropsychological test scores were compared with the remaining 32 subjects, who did not perform NFT (control group). Electroencephalogram changes measured by relative power (RP) endorsed cognitive potential findings under study: visuospatial, oral language, memory, intellectual and attention functions. Three frequency bands were selected to assess cognitive changes: 12, 18, and 21 Hz (bandwidth 3 Hz). Significant increases (p < 0.01) in the RP of these frequency bands were found. Moreover, results from cognitive tests showed significant improvements (p < 0.01) in four cognitive functions after performing five NFT sessions: visuospatial, oral language, memory, and intellectual. This established evidence in the association between NFT performed by a MI-BCI and enhanced cognitive performance. Therefore, it could be a novel approach to help elderly people.

Effects of phase-locked acoustic stimulation during a nap on EEG spectra and declarative memory consolidation	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Sleep; Acoustic stimulation; Slow waves; Memory consolidation	CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; SLEEP SLOW OSCILLATIONS; ENHANCES MEMORY; NREM SLEEP; WAVES; SPINDLES; HUMANS; SYNCHRONIZATION; HOMEOSTASIS; DYNAMICS	Objectives: Acoustic stimulation synchronized to slow waves (SWs) can enhance these sleep features and facilitate memory consolidation during nocturnal sleep. Here, we investigated whether a similar benefit could be accrued following stimulation during an afternoon nap. We also evaluated the event-related dynamics of associated EEG spectral changes and their correlation with memory performance. Methods: Sixteen healthy young adults (mean age: 22 +/- 1.4 years; nine males) were studied under two conditions: stimulation (STIM) and no stimulation (SHAM), in counter-balanced order. In the STIM condition, acoustic stimulation was delivered using blocks of five tones, each phase-locked to the SW upstate during a 90-min nap opportunity. In the SHAM condition, these time points were marked, but tones were not presented. Prior to the nap, participants learned 40 semantically related word pairs and immediate recall was tested. A delayed recall test was administered 45 min after awakening. Results: Compared to the SHAM condition, acoustic stimulation increased SW amplitude, theta, and fast spindle activity and attenuated the forgetting of word pairs (p values < 0.05). Conclusion: Phase-locked acoustic stimulation can promote sleep-dependent declarative memory during a daytime nap. This can be achieved by stimulation in Stage 2 and SWS without a requirement for high-amplitude slow wave detection. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here we describe the properties of articulation-related artifacts and propose a novel correction procedure. Experiment 1 co-recorded ERPs and trajectories of the articulators with an electromagnetic articulograph from a single participant. The generalization of the findings from the single participant to standard picture naming was investigated in Experiment 2. Both experiments provided evidence that articulation-induced artifacts may start up to 300 ms or more prior to voice onset or voice key onset-depending on the specific measure; they are highly similar in topography across many different phoneme patterns and differ mainly in their time course and amplitude. ERPs were separated from articulation-related artifacts with residue iteration decomposition (RIDE). After obtaining the artifact-free ERPs, their correlations with the articulatory trajectories dropped near to zero. Artifact removal with independent component analysis was less successful; while correlations with the articulatory movements remained substantial, early components prior to voice onset were attenuated in reconstructed ERPs. These findings offer new insights into the nature of articulation artifacts; together with RIDE as method for artifact removal the present report offers a fresh perspective for ERP studies requiring overt articulation.

This procedure produces a third phantom binaural beat, whose frequency is equal to the difference of the two presented tones and which can be manipulated for non-invasive brain stimulation. The effects of binaural beats on working memory, the system in control of temporary retention and online organization of thoughts for successful goal directed behavior, have not been well studied. Furthermore, no studies have evaluated the effects of binaural beats on brain connectivity during working memory tasks. In this study, we determined the effects of different acoustic stimulation conditions on participant response accuracy and cortical network topology, as measured by EEG recordings, during a visuospatial working memory task. Three acoustic stimulation control conditions and three binaural beat stimulation conditions were used: None, Pure Tone, Classical Music, 5Hz binaural beats, 10Hz binaural beats, and 15Hz binaural beats. We found that listening to 15Hz binaural beats during a visuospatial working memory task not only increased the response accuracy, but also modified the strengths of the cortical networks during the task. The three auditory control conditions and the 5Hz and 10Hz binaural beats all decreased accuracy. Based on graphical network analyses, the cortical activity during 15Hz binaural beats produced networks characteristic of high information transfer with consistent connection strengths throughout the visuospatial working memory task.

The Role of Alpha Activity in Spatial and Feature-Based Attention	ENEURO			English	Article						alpha; attention; feature; poststimulus; spatial	THETA DYNAMICS REVEAL; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; FRONTAL THETA; OSCILLATIONS; POWER; CONFLICT; INCREASES; STIMULUS	Modulations in alpha oscillations (similar to 10 Hz) are typically studied in the context of anticipating upcoming stimuli. Alpha power decreases in sensory regions processing upcoming targets compared to regions processing distracting input, thereby likely facilitating processing of relevant information while suppressing irrelevant. In this electroencephalography study using healthy human volunteers, we examined whether modulations in alpha power also occur after the onset of a bilaterally presented target and distractor. Spatial attention was manipulated through spatial cues and feature-based attention through adjusting the color-similarity of distractors to the target. Consistent with previous studies, we found that informative spatial cues induced a relative decrease of pretarget alpha power at occipital electrodes contralateral to the expected target location. Interestingly, this pattern reemerged relatively late (300-750 ms) after stimulus onset, suggesting that lateralized alpha reflects not only preparatory attention, but also ongoing attentive stimulus processing. Uninformative cues (i. e., conveying no information about the spatial location of the target) resulted in an interaction between spatial attention and feature-based attention in post-target alpha lateralization. When the target was paired with a low-similarity distractor, post-target alpha was lateralized (500-900 ms). Crucially, the lateralization was absent when target selection was ambiguous because the distractor was highly similar to the target. Instead, during this condition, midfrontal theta was increased, indicative of reactive conflict resolution. Behaviorally, the degree of alpha lateralization was negatively correlated with the reaction time distraction cost induced by target-distractor similarity. These results suggest a pivotal role for poststimulus alpha lateralization in protecting sensory processing of target information.

J	Marshall, AC; Cooper, NR; Geeraert, N				Marshall, Amanda C.; Cooper, Nicholas R.; Geeraert, Nicolas			The Impact of Experienced Stress on Aged Spatial Discrimination: Cortical Overreliance as a Result of Hippocampal Impairment	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						hippocampus; neurocognitive aging; stress; spatial discrimination; EEG	PATTERN SEPARATION; DENTATE GYRUS; EEG; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; COGNITION; NETWORK; DECLINE; ADULTS	A large body of neuroscientific work indicates that exposure to experienced stress causes damage to both cortical and hippocampal cells and results in impairments to cognitive abilities associated with these structures. Similarly, work within the domain of cognitive aging demonstrates that elderly participants who report experiencing greater amounts of stress show reduced levels of cognitive functioning. The present article attempted to combine both findings by collecting data from elderly and young participants who completed a spatial discrimination paradigm developed by Reagh and colleagues [Reagh et al. (2013) Hippocampus 24:303-314] to measure hippocampal-mediated cognitive processes. In order to investigate the effect of stress on the cortex and, indirectly, the hippocampus, it paired the paradigm with electroencephalographic recordings of the theta frequency band, which is thought to reflect cortical/hippocampal interactions. Findings revealed that elderly participants with high levels of experienced stress performed significantly worse on target recognition and lure discrimination and demonstrated heightened levels of cortical theta synchronization compared with young and elderly low stress counterparts. Results therefore provided further evidence for the adverse effect of stress on cognitive aging and indicate that impaired behavioral performance among high stress elderly may coincide with an overreliance on cortical cognitive processing strategies as a result of early damage to the hippocampus.

Existing DBS systems are open-loop such that the system parameters are not adjusted automatically based on patient's behavior. Classification of human behavior is an important step in the design of the next generation of DBS systems that are closed-loop. This paper presents a classification approach to recognize such behavioral tasks using the subthalamic nucleus (STN) Local Field Potential (LFP) signals. In our approach, we use the timefrequency representation (spectrogram) of the raw LFP signals recorded from left and right STNs as the feature vectors. Then these features are combined together via Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) formulation. The MKL-based classification method is utilized to classify different tasks: button press, mouth movement, speech, and arm movement. Our experiments show that the lpnorm MKL significantly outperforms single kernel SVM-based classifiers in classifying behavioral tasks of five subjects even using signals acquired with a low sampling rate of 10 Hz. This leads to a lower computational cost.

However, little is known, about how neural activity within the higher frequency gamma band (>30 Hz) while at rest changes in those stabilized on MMT despite its association with the excitation-inhibition balance within pyramidal-interneuron networks. Our study investigated differences in resting gamma power (37-41 Hz) between patients undergoing MMT for opiate dependence, illicit opiate users, and healthy controls subjects. Electroencephalographic data were recorded from 26 sites according to the international 10-20 system. Compared with the healthy controls subjects, people either undergoing MMT (mean difference [MD] = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.09-0.55, P < .01) or currently using illicit opiates (MD = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.06-0.56, P = .01) exhibited significant increased gamma power. The sLORETA (standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography) between-group comparison revealed dysfunctional neuronal activity in the occipital, parietal, and frontal lobes in the patients undergoing MMT. A more severe profile of dysfunction was observed in those using illicit opiates. Our findings suggest that long-term exposure to opioids is associated with disrupted resting state network, which may be reduced after MMT.

There are several cognitive models attempting to explain the fundamentals of this information processing bottleneck. Here, we used electroencephalographic recordings and the analysis of interregional phase synchronization of rhythmical brain activity to investigate the neural bases of the AB. By investigating the time course of interregional phase synchronization separately for trials in which participants failed to report the second target correctly (AB trials) and trials in which no AB occurred, and by clustering interregional connections based on their functional similarity, it was possible to define several distinct cortical networks. Analyzing these networks comprising phase synchronization-over a large spectrum of brain frequencies from theta to gamma activity-it was possible to identify neural correlates for cognitive subfunctions involved in the AB, such as the encoding of targets into working memory, tuning of attentional filters, and the recruitment of general cognitive resources. This parallel activation of functionally distinct neural processes substantiates the eligibility of several cognitive models on the AB.

Network mechanisms underlying the shift from an active goal-directed behavior to a "seemingly purposeless" stereotypic locomotion remain unclear. In the present study we sought to determine the relationships between the behavioral effects of dopaminergic drugs and their effects on local field potentials (LFPs), which were telemetrically recorded within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of freely moving rats. We used the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole in a low, autoreceptor-selective (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and in a high (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) dose, and a moderate dose of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). In the control group, power spectrum analysis revealed a prominent peak of LFP power in the theta frequency range during active exploration. Cocaine alone stimulated locomotion, but had no significant effect on the peak of the LFP power. In contrast, co-administration of low dose quinpirole with cocaine markedly altered the pattern of locomotion, from goal-directed exploratory behavior to recurrent motion resembling loco motor stereotypy. This behavioral effect was accompanied by a shift of the dominant theta power toward a significantly lower (by similar to 15%) frequency. High dose quinpirole also provoked an increased locomotor activity with signs of behavioral stereotypies, and also induced a shift of the dominant oscillation frequency toward the lower range. These results demonstrate a correlation between the LFP oscillation frequency within the VTA and a qualitative aspect of locomotor behavior, perhaps due to a variable level of coherence of this region with its input or output areas.

Methods: Wide bandwidth local field potential recordings were acquired from micro-electrodes implanted in mesial temporal structures during spontaneous seizures from six patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Results: In the seizure onset zone, distinct epileptiform discharges were evident in the local field potential prior to the time of seizure onset in the intracranial EEG. In all three seizures with hypersynchronous (HYP) seizure onset, fast ripples with incrementally increasing power accompanied epileptiform discharges during the transition to the ictal state (p < 0.01). In a single low voltage fast (LVF) onset seizure a triad of evolving HYP LFP discharges, increased single unit activity, and fast ripples of incrementally increasing power were identified similar to 20 s prior to seizure onset (p < 0.01). In addition, incrementally increasing fast ripples occurred after seizure onset just prior to the transition to LVF activity (p < 0.01). HYP onset was associated with an increase in fast ripple and ripple rate (p < 0.05) and commonly each HYP discharge had a superimposed ripple followed by a fast ripple. Putative excitatory and inhibitory single units could be distinguished during limbic seizure onset, and heterogeneous shifts in firing rate were observed during LVF activity. Significance: Epileptiform activity is detected by microelectrodes before it is detected by depth macroelectrodes, and the one clinically identified LVF ictal onset was a HYP onset at the local level. Patterns of incrementally increasing fast ripple power are consistent with observations in rats with experimental hippocampal epilepsy, suggesting that limbic seizures arise when small clusters of synchronously bursting neurons increase in size, coalesce, and reach a critical mass for propagation.

Retino-cortical stimulus frequency-dependent gamma coupling: evidence and functional implications of oscillatory potentials	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						Oscillations; perception; synchrony	ELECTRORETINOGRAM	Long-range gamma band EEG oscillations mediate information transmission between distant brain regions. Gamma band-based coupling may not be restricted to cortex-to-cortex communication but may include extracortical parts of the visual system. The retinogram and visual event-related evoked potentials exhibit time-locked, forward propagating oscillations that are candidates of gamma oscillatory coupling between the retina and the visual cortex. In this study, we tested if this gamma coupling is present as indicated by the coherence of gamma-range (70-200 Hz) oscillatory potentials (OPs) recorded simultaneously from the retina and the primary visual cortex in freely moving, adult rats. We found significant retino-cortical OP coherence in a wide range of stimulus duration (0.01-1000 msec), stimulus intensity (800-5000 mcd/mm(2)), interstimulus interval (10-400 msec), and stimulus frequency (0.25-25 Hz). However, at low stimulus frequencies, the OPs were time-locked, flickering light at 25 Hz entrained continuous OP coherence (steady-state response, SSR). Our results suggest that the retina and the visual cortex exhibit oscillatory coupling at high-gamma frequency with precise time locking and synchronization of information transfer from the retina to the visual cortex, similar to cortico-cortical gamma coupling. The temporal fusion of retino-cortical gamma coherence at stimulus rates of theater movies may explain the mechanism of the visual illusion of continuity. How visual perception depends on early transformations of ascending sensory information is incompletely understood. By simultaneous measurement of flash-evoked potentials in the retina and the visual cortex in awake, freely moving rats, we demonstrate for the first time that time-locked gamma oscillatory potentials exhibit stable retino-cortical synchrony across a wide range of stimulus parameters and that the temporal continuity of coherence changes with stimulus frequency according to the expected change in the visual illusion of continuity.

A method to establish the spatiotemporal evolution of task-related cortical activity from electrocorticographic signals in single trials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electrocorticography; ECoG; Broadband; High gamma; Single trial	REACTION-TIME; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; GAMMA ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS; MEMORY; EEG; PERCEPTION; SPIKING	Background: Progress in neuroscience depends substantially on the ability to establish the detailed spatial and temporal sequence of neuronal population-level activity across large areas of the brain. Because there is substantial inter-trial variability in neuronal activity, traditional techniques that rely on signal averaging obscure where and when neuronal activity occurs. Thus, up to the present, it has been difficult to examine the detailed progression of neuronal activity across large areas of the brain. New method: Here we describe a method for establishing the spatiotemporal evolution of neuronal population-level activity across large brain regions by determining exactly where and when neural activity occurs during a behavioral task in individual trials. We validate the efficacy of the method, examine the effects of its parameterization, and demonstrate its utility by highlighting two sets of results that could not readily be achieved with traditional methods. Results: Our results reveal the precise spatiotemporal evolution of neuronal population activity that unfolds during a sensorimotor task in individual trials, and establishes the relationship between neuronal oscillations and the onset of this activity. Conclusions: The ability to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of neuronal population activity onsets in single trials gives investigators a powerful new tool with which to study large-scale cortical processes.

Diffusion imaging and postmortem analysis studies suggest that mTBI primarily affects myelinated axons in white matter tracts. In particular, corpus callosum, mediating interhemispheric information exchange, has been shown to be affected in mTBI. Yet little is known about the mechanisms linking the injury of myelinated callosal axons to the neurobehavioral sequelae of mTBI. To address this issue, we devised and studied a large, biologically plausible neuronal network model of cortical tissue. Importantly, the model architecture incorporated intra- and interhemispheric organization, including myelinated callosal axons and distance-dependent axonal conduction delays. In the resting state, the intact model network exhibited several salient features, including alpha-band (8-12 Hz) collective activity with low-frequency irregular spiking of individual neurons. The network model of callosal injury captured several clinical observations, including 1) "slowing down" of the network rhythms, manifested as an increased resting-state theta-to-alpha power ratio, 2) reduced response to attention-like network stimulation, manifested as a reduced spectral power of collective activity, and 3) increased population response time in response to stimulation. Importantly, these changes were positively correlated with injury severity, supporting proposals to use neurobehavioral indices as biomarkers for determining the severity of injury. Our modeling effort helps to understand the role played by the injury of callosal myelinated axons in defining the neurobehavioral sequelae of mTBI.

While maintenance of temporal order information during a working memory (WM) task was recently linked to FMT phase, a positive correlation between FMT power, WM demand and WM performance was shown. However, the relationship between these measures is not well understood, and it is unknown whether purposeful FMT phase manipulation during a WM task impacts FMT power and WM performance. Here we present evidence that FMT phase manipulation mediated by transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can block WM demand-related FMT power increase (FMT Delta power) and disrupt normal WM performance. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers were assigned to one of two groups (group A, group B) and performed a 2-back task across a baseline block (block 1) and an intervention block (block 2) while 275-sensor magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded. After no stimulation was applied during block 1, participants in group A received tACS oscillating at their individual FMT frequency over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) while group B received sham stimulation during block 2. After assessing and mapping phase locking values (PLV) between the tACS signal and brain oscillatory activity across the whole brain, FMT power and WM performance were assessed and compared between blocks and groups. Results: During block 2 of group A but not B, FMT oscillations showed increased PLV across task-related cortical areas underneath the frontal tACS electrode. While WM task-related FMT Delta power and WM performance were comparable across groups in block 1, tACS resulted in lower FMT Delta power and WM performance compared to sham stimulation in block 2. Conclusion: tACS-related manipulation of FMT phase can disrupt WM performance and influence WM task-related FMT Delta power. This finding may have important implications for the treatment of brain disorders such as depression and attention deficit disorder associated with abnormal regulation of FMT activity or disorders characterized by dysfunctional coupling of brain activity, e.g., epilepsy, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease (AD/PD).

In local field potentials (LFPs), measured either in the cortex or in the hippocampus, how gamma-oscillation amplitude is modulated by changes in theta-rhythms-phase is thought to be important in memory formation. Several methods were proposed to quantify CFC, but reported evidence suggests that experimental parameters affect the results. Therefore, a simulation tool to support the determination of minimal requirements for CFC estimation in order to obtain reliable results is particularly useful. An approach to generate computer-simulated signals having CFC intensity, sweep duration, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and multiphasic-coupling tunable by the user has been developed. Its utility has been proved by a study evaluating minimal sweep duration and SNR required for reliable theta-gamma CFC estimation from signals simulating LFP measured in the mouse hippocampus. A MATLAB (R) software was made available to facilitate methodology reproducibility. The analysis of the synthetic LFPs created by the simulator shows how the minimal sweep duration for achieving accurate theta-gamma CFC estimates increases as SNR decreases and the number of CFC levels to discriminate increases. In particular, a sufficient reliability in discriminating five different predetermined CFC levels is reached with 35-s sweep with SNR = 20, while SNR = 5 requires at least 140-s sweep.

We investigated whether and how different interneuronal circuits contribute to such resonance by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at motor (20 Hz) and a nonmotor resonance frequency (7 Hz). We tested different TMS interneuronal protocols and triggered TMS pulses at different tACS phases. The effect of cholinergic short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) was abolished by 20 Hz tACS, linking cortical beta activity to sensorimotor integration. However, this effect occurred regardless of the tACS phase. In contrast, 20 Hz tACS selectively modulated MEP size according to the phase of tACS during single pulse, GABAAergic short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and glutamatergic intracortical facilitation (ICF). For SICI this phase effect was more marked during 20 Hz stimulation. Phase modulation of SICI also depended on whether or not spontaneous beta activity occurred at similar to 20 Hz, supporting an interaction effect between tACS and underlying circuit resonances. The present study provides in vivo evidence linking cortical beta activity to sensorimotor integration, and for beta oscillations in motor cortex being promoted by resonance in GABAAergic interneuronal circuits.

THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS	IDEGGYOGYASZATI SZEMLE-CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			Hungarian	Article						seizure semiology; seizure propagation; nodes of networks; epileptic propensity	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX	Study objectives - The developing of diagnostical examinations in epileptology provides new challenges in seizure semiology. On the analysis of seizures it is important to examine the mechanisms of their propagation. The brain connectivity (based on the neuroimaging), the shadowing of the movement of excessive neuronal activity (based on computerized EEG and MEG methods), the cognition of the physiological and pathological brain networks are the foot-stone of the epileptic seizure propagation. The investigators prove, by means of case demonstrations of the role of the network nodes and the role of the epileptic hubs in the seizure symptomatology. Methods - The preoperative, intra and postoperative data are analised of three insular and one parietal epileptic patients in point of view of their seizure symptomes. Complex neuroimaging, noninvasive and invasive electrophysiology, intensive long-term video-EEG monitoring, computerized EEG analysis, fuctional mapping, intraoperative corticography were used. The etiology were confirmed with hystology. Results It is observed that on seizure semiology our patients plays the insula a double role. In some cases, it is the focus of insular seizures with their symptoms difficult to identify. However, in the majority of cases and as a consequence of its rich neural connections, the insula has a peculiar property in the evolution of the symptomatogenic features of seizures. This observations are developing new relationships between the mechanism of seizure propagation and its semiological consequences. Conclusions On epileptological point of view there are brain structures which has peculiar role in the "designe" of propagation of the epileptic excitement. The numerous new methods in neuroimaging and neurophysiology allowed the connectomical examination of the epileptic networks. The role of the epileptic diathesis is approachable with the metholdology of the brain connectivity. Theoretically the node of the epileptic network consist of the potential pathes where the localised excessive excitement can propagete. The route where the actual seizure can go adhead is determined by the actual edpileptic propensity of the above mentioned potential pathes.

Cognitive functions and information processing are mainly based on the interactions between distant brain regions. However, most of the 'feature extraction' methods used in the context of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) ignored the possible functional relationships between different signals recorded from distinct brain areas. In this paper, the functional connectivity quantified by the phase locking value (PLV) was introduced to characterize the evoked responses (ERPs) obtained in the case of target and non-targets visual stimuli. We also tested the possibility of using the functional connectivity in the context of 'P300 speller'. The proposed approach was compared to the well-known methods proposed in the state of the art of " P300 Speller", mainly the peak picking, the area, time/ frequency based features, the xDAWN spatial filtering and the stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA). The electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded from ten subjects were analyzed offline. The results indicated that phase synchrony offers relevant information for the classification in a P300 speller. High synchronization between the brain regions was clearly observed during target trials, although no significant synchronization was detected for a non-target trial. The results showed also that phase synchrony provides higher performance than some existing methods for letter classification in a P300 speller principally when large number of trials is available. Finally, we tested the possible combination of both approaches (classical features and phase synchrony). Our findings showed an overall improvement of the performance of the P300-speller when using Peak picking, the area and frequency based features. Similar performances were obtained compared to xDAWN and SWLDA when using large number of trials.

Oddly enough, the definition of a spindle is both incomplete and restrictive. In consequence, there is no consensus about how to detect spindles. Visual scoring is cumbersome and user dependent. To analyze spindle activity in a more robust way, automatic sleep spindle detection methods are essential. Various algorithms were developed, depending on individual research interest, which hampers direct comparisons and meta-analyses. In this review, sleep spindle is first defined physically and topographically. From this general description, we tentatively extract the main characteristics to be detected and analyzed. A nonexhaustive list of automatic spindle detection methods is provided along with a description of their main processing principles. Finally, we propose a technique to assess the detection methods in a robust and comparable way.

The cognitive impairment in the epileptic encephalopathies may be more concerning to the patient and parents than the epilepsy itself. There is increasing recognition that the cognitive comorbidity can be both chronic, primarily due to the underlying etiology of the epilepsy, and dynamic or evolving because of recurrent seizures, interictal spikes, and antiepileptic drugs. Much of scholars' understanding of the neurophysiological underpinnings of cognitive dysfunction in the epileptic encephalopathies comes from rodent studies. Frequent seizures and interictal EEG discharges in rats lead to considerable spatial and social-cognitive deficits. Paralleling these cognitive deficits are dyscoordination of dynamic neural activity within and between the neural networks that subserve normal cognitive processes.

We summarize emerging conceptual and methodological frameworks that are available to experimenters investigating a "brain in the loop" using non-invasive brain stimulation and briefly review the experimental and therapeutic implications. We take the view that closed-loop neuroscience in fact deals with two conceptually quite different loops: a 'brain-state dynamics" loop, used to couple with and modulate the trajectory of neuronal activity patterns, and a "task dynamics" loop, that is the bidirectional motor-sensory interaction between brain and (simulated) environment, and which enables goal-directed behavioral tasks to be incorporated. Both loops need to be considered and combined to realize the full experimental and therapeutic potential of closed-loop neuroscience.

Estimation of brain network ictogenicity predicts outcome from epilepsy surgery	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; EPILEPTOGENIC NETWORKS; SEIZURE ONSET; MODEL; EEG; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	Surgery is a valuable option for pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. However, significant postoperative improvements are not always attained. This is due in part to our incomplete understanding of the seizure generating (ictogenic) capabilities of brain networks. Here we introduce an in silico, model-based framework to study the effects of surgery within ictogenic brain networks. We find that factors conventionally determining the region of tissue to resect, such as the location of focal brain lesions or the presence of epileptiform rhythms, do not necessarily predict the best resection strategy. We validate our framework by analysing electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings from patients who have undergone epilepsy surgery. We find that when post-operative outcome is good, model predictions for optimal strategies align better with the actual surgery undertaken than when post-operative outcome is poor. Crucially, this allows the prediction of optimal surgical strategies and the provision of quantitative prognoses for patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.	[Goodfellow, M.; Terry, J.

The ictal wavefront is the spatiotemporal source of discharges during spontaneous human seizures	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; TRAVELING-WAVES; ACTION-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL NETWORK; PROPAGATION; TERMINATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; EPILEPSY; EEG	The extensive distribution and simultaneous termination of seizures across cortical areas has led to the hypothesis that seizures are caused by large-scale coordinated networks spanning these areas. This view, however, is difficult to reconcile with most proposed mechanisms of seizure spread and termination, which operate on a cellular scale. We hypothesize that seizures evolve into self-organized structures wherein a small seizing territory projects high-intensity electrical signals over a broad cortical area. Here we investigate human seizures on both small and large electrophysiological scales. We show that the migrating edge of the seizing territory is the source of travelling waves of synaptic activity into adjacent cortical areas. As the seizure progresses, slow dynamics in induced activity from these waves indicate a weakening and eventual failure of their source. These observations support a parsimonious theory for how large-scale evolution and termination of seizures are driven from a small, migrating cortical area.

We use diffusion tensor imaging data and alpha band-limited EEG signal recorded in a group of healthy individuals. Our results show that about 23.4% of the variance in empirical networks of resting-state functional connectivity is explained by the underlying white matter architecture. Simulating functional connectivity using a simple computational model based on the structural connectivity can increase the match to 45.4%. In a second step, we use our modeling framework to explore several technical alternatives along the modeling path. First, we find that an augmentation of homotopic connections in the structural connectivity matrix improves the link to functional connectivity while a correction for fiber distance slightly decreases the performance of the model. Second, a more complex computational model based on Kuramoto oscillators leads to a slight improvement of the model fit. Third, we show that the comparison of modeled and empirical functional connectivity at source level is much more specific for the underlying structural connectivity. However, different source reconstruction algorithms gave comparable results. Of note, as the fourth finding, the model fit was much better if zero-phase lag components were preserved in the empirical functional connectome, indicating a considerable amount of functionally relevant synchrony taking place with near zero or zero-phase lag. The combination of the best performing alternatives at each stage in the pipeline results in a model that explains 54.4% of the variance in the empirical EEG functional connectivity. Our study shows that large-scale brain circuits of fast neural network synchrony strongly rely upon the structural connectome and simple computational models of neural activity can explain missing links in the structure-function relationship.

Recent studies give evidence for memory deficits in infected older adults. To investigate working memory dysfunction in infected elderly, a double-blinded electrophysiological study was conducted. 84 persons derived from a sample of 131 healthy participants with the mean age of 70 years were assigned to two groups of 42 non-infected and 42 infected individuals. The outcome measures were behavioral performance, target and response-related ERPs, and time-frequency wavelets during performance in a n-back working-memory task. The infected individuals showed a reduced rate of detected targets and diminished P3b amplitude both in target-locked as well as response-locked data compared to the non-infected group. Time-frequency decomposition of the EEG-signals revealed lower evoked power in the theta frequency range in the target-locked as well as in the response-locked data in infected individuals. The reported effects were comparable with differences between healthy young and old adults described previously. Taking together, the reduced working-memory performance accompanied by an attenuated P3b and frontal theta activity may suggest neurotransmitter imbalance like dopamine and norepinephrine in T. gondii infected individuals. In face of a high prevalence of T. gondii infection and the increasing ratio of older population their accelerated memory decline may have substantial socioeconomic consequences.

Higher Balance Task Demands are Associated with an Increase in Individual Alpha Peak Frequency	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; stance; posture; theta; iAPF; sensorimotor; cortex; error detection	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; OSCILLATORY PLATFORM; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; INHIBITORY CONTROL; EEG DYNAMICS; OLDER-ADULTS; BRAIN; THETA; CORTEX	Balance control is fundamental for most daily motor activities, and its impairment is associated with an increased risk of falling. Growing evidence suggests the human cortex is essentially contributing to the control of standing balance. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear and need further investigation. In a previous study, we introduced a new protocol to identify electrocortical activity associated with performance of different continuous balance tasks with the eyes opened. The aim of this study was to extend our previous results by investigating the individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF), a neurophysiological marker of thalamo-cortical information transmission, which remained unconsidered so far in balance research. Thirty-seven subjects completed nine balance tasks varying in surface stability and base of support. Flectroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 32 scalp locations throughout balancing with the eyes closed to ensure reliable identification of the iAPE Balance performance was quantified as the sum of anterior-posterior and medio-lateral movements of the supporting platform. The iAPF, as well as power in the theta, lower alpha and upper alpha frequency bands were determined for each balance task after applying an ICA-based artifact rejection procedure. Higher demands on balance control were associated with a global increase in iAPF and a decrease in lower alpha power. These results may indicate increased thalamo-cortical information transfer and general cortical activation, respectively. In addition, a significant increase in upper alpha activity was observed in the fronto-central region whereas it decreased in the centro-parietal region. Furthermore, midline theta increased with higher task demands probably indicating activation of error detection/processing mechanisms. IAPF as well as theta and alpha power were correlated with platform movements. The results provide new insights into spectral and spatial characteristics of cortical oscillations subserving balance control. This information may be particularly useful in a clinical context as it could be used to reveal cortical contributions to balance dysfunction in specific populations such as Parkinson's or vestibular loss. However, this should be addressed in future studies.

Off-target potential of AMN082 on sleep EEG and related physiological variables: Evidence from mGluR7 (-/-) mice	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Glutamate; mGluR7; AMN082; Rats; mGluR7 (-/-) mice; Off-target; Sleep-wake cycle; EEG oscillations; Body temperature; Locomotor activity; Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; PRESYNAPTIC ACTIVE ZONES; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; WORKING-MEMORY; GABAERGIC TERMINALS; ADULT-RAT; REM-SLEEP; AMYGDALA; AGONIST	The metabotropic glutamate receptor type 7 (mGluR7), a most abundant presynaptic G protein-coupled receptor in the brain provides an attractive mechanism to fast fine-tune abnormal excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity associated with emotional and cognitive impairments in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Preclinical studies using AMN082, the mGluR7 allosteric agonist, produced conflicting results, so that results of further in-vivo studies are needed. Here, we investigated effects of subcutaneous administration at the lights onset of AMN082 on sleep-wake architecture and spectral contents in rats. In an attempt to solve the reported mixed results, we estimated the specific functional effects in mGluR7 (-/-) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates. In rats, AMN082 (2.5 mg/kg) elicited a primary waking effect over the first 2 h post-administration by consistent increases in the number of waking bouts and transitions from sleep states towards wakefulness. In mice, baseline recordings over 72 h showed comparable spontaneous sleep-wake cycle in mGluR7 (-/-) mice and their WI litter-mates, suggesting that mGluR7 is not involved in the regulation of vigilance states. Remarkably, cortical arousal properties of AMN082 were confirmed in WT mice, and occurred concomitantly with a marked decrease in body temperature, likely dissociated from locomotor activity. Surprisingly, the wake arousal and hypothermia effects of AMN082 were also observed in mGluR7 (-/-) mice. AMN082 significantly attenuated the slow wave activity during sleep and had no effect on waking EEG power in the 4-50 Hz range. The present findings in rats do not lend support to proposed somnogenic effects of AMN082, while comparable responses in WT and mGluR7 (-/-) mice provide further evidence of an off-target action of AMN082 that contributes to its waking properties.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were acquired during a visual oddball task in 14 patients with depressive disorder and 19 healthy controls. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were analyzed using event-related phase coherence (ERPCOH) to obtain the functional network. Alteration of the phase synchronization index (PSI) of the functional network was investigated. Patients with depression showed a decreased number of significant electrode pairs in delta phase synchronization, and an increased number of significant electrode pairs in theta, alpha and beta phase synchronization, compared with controls. Patients with depression showed lower target-dependent PSI increment in the frontal-parietal/temporal/occipital electrode pairs in delta-phase synchronization than healthy participants. However, patients with depression showed higher target-dependent PSI increments in theta band in the prefrontal/frontal and frontal-temporal electrode pairs, higher PSI increments in alpha band in the prefrontal pairs and higher increments of beta PSI in the central and right frontal-parietal pairs than controls. It implied that the decrease in delta PSI activity in major depression may indicate impairment of the connection between the frontal and parietal/temporal/occipital regions. The increase in theta, alpha and beta PSI in the frontal/prefrontal sites might reflect the compensatory mechanism to maintain normal cognitive performance. These findings may provide a foundation for a new approach to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies for depression.

The multisensory function of the human primary visual cortex	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Multisensory; Cross-modal; Primary cortex; Humans; Brain imaging; Brain mapping; Vision	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; SOUND-INDUCED ENHANCEMENT; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHOSPHENE PERCEPTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; BLIND HUMANS; HUMAN V1	It has been nearly 10 years since Ghazanfar and Schroeder (2006) proposed that the neocortex is essentially multisensory in nature. However, it is only recently that sufficient and hard evidence that supports this proposal has accrued. We review evidence that activity within the human primary visual cortex plays an active role in multisensory processes and directly impacts behavioural outcome. This evidence emerges from a full pallet of human brain imaging and brain mapping methods with which multisensory processes are quantitatively assessed by taking advantage of particular strengths of each technique as well as advances in signal analyses. Several general conclusions about multisensory processes in primary visual cortex of humans are supported relatively solidly. First, haemodynamic methods (fMRI/PET) show that there is both convergence and integration occurring within primary visual cortex. Second, primary visual cortex is involved in multisensory processes during early post-stimulus stages (as revealed by EEG/ERNERFs as well as TMS). Third, multisensory effects in primary visual cortex directly impact behaviour and perception, as revealed by correlational (EEG/ERPs/ERFs) as well as more causal measures (TMS/tACS). While the provocative claim of Ghazanfar and Schroeder (2006) that the whole of neocortex is multisensory in function has yet to be demonstrated, this can now be considered established in the case of the human primary visual cortex.

However, current technology enables much finer resolutions. The activity of hundreds of single neurons in the human brain can now be simultaneously explored before, during, and after a seizure or in association with an interictal discharge. This technology opens up new horizons to understanding epilepsy at a completely new level. This review therefore begins with a brief description of the basis of the technology, the microelectrodes, and the setup for their implantation in patients with epilepsy. Using these electrodes, recent studies provide novel insights into both the time domain and firing patterns of epileptic activity of single neurons. In the time domain, seizure-related activity may occur even minutes before seizure onset (in its current, EEG-based definition). Seizure-related neuronal interactions exhibit complex heterogeneous dynamics. In the seizure-onset zone, changes in firing patterns correlate with cell loss; in the penumbra, neurons maintain their spike stereotypy during a seizure. Hence, investigation of the extracellular electrical activity is expected to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease; it may, in the future, serve for a more accurate localization of the seizure focus; and it may also be employed to predict the occurrence of seizures prior to their behavioral manifestation in order to administer automatic therapeutic interventions.
