One prominent assumption holds that audio-visual synchrony can act as a strong attractor for spatial attention. Here, we tested for a similar effect of audio-visual synchrony on feature-selective attention. We presented two superimposed Gabor patches that differed in colour and orientation. On each trial, participants were cued to selectively attend to one of the two patches. Over time, spatial frequencies of both patches varied sinusoidally at distinct rates (3.14 and 3.63 Hz), giving rise to pulse-like percepts. A simultaneously presented pure tone carried a frequency modulation at the pulse rate of one of the two visual stimuli to introduce audio-visual synchrony. Pulsed stimulation elicited distinct time-locked oscillatory electrophysiological brain responses. These steady-state responses were quantified in the spectral domain to examine individual stimulus processing under conditions of synchronous versus asynchronous tone presentation and when respective stimuli were attended versus unattended. We found that both, attending to the colour of a stimulus and its synchrony with the tone, enhanced its processing. Moreover, both gain effects combined linearly for attended in-sync stimuli. Our results suggest that audio-visual synchrony can attract attention to specific stimulus features when stimuli overlap in space.

J	Wang, XL; Wang, B; Wang, WB; Yu, M				Wang Xiang-Li; Wang Bin; Wang Wen-Bo; Yu Min			Extractraction of non-stationary harmonic from chaotic background based on synchrosqueezed wavelet transform	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						synchrosqueezed wavelet transform; non-stationary harmonic; extraction of harmonic; chaos	MODE DECOMPOSITION	The signal detection in chaotic background has gradually become one of the research focuses in recent years. Previous research showed that the measured signals were often unavoidable to be contaminated by the chaotic noise, such as the radar signal detection from sea clutter wave, signal source extraction from chaotic secure communication and ECG/EEG abnormal signal detection, etc. At present, there are two methods to detect the target signal from the chaotic background. One is to detect the target signals by using the difference in geometric structure between the chaotic signal and the target signal, and the other is to regard the chaotic signal as the noise, and the target signal is extracted from the chaotic background by the time frequency analysis method, such as wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition. The first kind of method can detect the target signal well, but it needs to characterize the chaotic system and reconstruct the phase space, which is difficult in the practical applications. The second kind of method does not need to reconstruct the chaotic phase space and can effectively extract the target signal from the chaotic background. However, the wavelet transform lacks adaption and how to select the optimal wavelet basis and decomposition layers is a difficult problem. In the empirical mode decomposition there exists the mode mixing that is very sensitive to the noise. The synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SST) effectively improves the mixing of mode by compressing the continuous wavelet coefficients in the frequency direction, but also it has good robustness to noise. Therefore, the SST can extract the harmonic signal well from the chaotic background. In the present algorithm of abstracting harmonic signal from chaotic background by SST, the harmonic signals are extracted by using single accumulation frequency range SST (SAFR-SST) based on wavelet ridge detection. If the target signal is stable harmonic signal, whose frequency does not change with time, the SAFR-SST method can have a high abstraction precision. But if the target signal is the non-stable harmonic signal whose frequency changes with time, the SAFR-SST method is not enough nor can obtain high abstraction precision. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the SST in extracting the non-stationary harmonic signal from the chaotic background, an improved SST extracting method is proposed which is based on the adaptive optimal cumulative frequency range. Firstly, the formulas of calculating the adaptive cumulative frequency range in SST extraction are deduced according to the relationship between the wavelet coefficient of non-stationary harmonic and the interval of supporting wavelet bases. Then, the optimal values of the parameters in the adaptive cumulative frequency range formula are calculated by the minimum energy error criterion according to the integrity and orthogonality of the intrinsic mode types function. Finally, the SST adaptive extraction of the non-stationary harmonic signal is realized according to the SST inverse transform. In experiment, the different types of non-stationary harmonics are extracted from the Lorenz and Duffing chaotic background. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively extract the non-stationary harmonic from the noisy chaotic background. Compared with the classical SST method with single cumulative frequency range, the proposed method has good performance in both mean square error and correlation coefficient. And when the chaotic background contains different-intenity Gauss white noises, the proposed method can also effectively abstract the non-stationary harmonic from the chaos and noise interference. So, the proposed method has a good practice value.

However, the effects of the spatiotemporal dynamics of seizure on HG power generation are not well understood. Here, we studied HG generation and propagation, using a three-step, multiscale signal analysis and modeling approach. First, we analyzed concurrent neuronal and microscopic network HG activity in neocortical slices from seven intractable epilepsy patients. We found HG activity in these networks, especially when neurons displayed paroxysmal depolarization shifts and network activity was highly synchronized. Second, we examined HG activity acquired with microelectrode arrays recorded during human seizures (n = 8). We confirmed the presence of synchronized HG power across microelectrode records and the macroscale, both specifically associated with the core region of the seizure. Third, we used volume conduction-based modeling to relate HG activity and network synchrony at different network scales. We showed that local HG oscillations require high levels of synchrony to cross scales, and that this requirement is met at the microscopic scale, but not within macroscopic networks. Instead, we present evidence that HG power at the macroscale may result from harmonics of ongoing seizure activity. Ictal HG power marks the seizure core, but the generating mechanism can differ across spatial scales.

Salient, Irrelevant Sounds Reflexively Induce Alpha Rhythm Desynchronization in Parallel with Slow Potential Shifts in Visual Cortex	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG ALPHA; MECHANISMS; REFLECT; SUPPRESSION	Recent findings suggest that a salient, irrelevant sound attracts attention to its location involuntarily and facilitates processing of a colocalized visual event [McDonald, J. J., Stormer, V. S., Martinez, A., Feng, W. F., & Hillyard, S. A. Salient sounds activate human visual cortex automatically. Journal of Neuroscience, 33, 9194-9201, 2013]. Associated with this cross-modal facilitation is a sound-evoked slow potential over the contralateral visual cortex termed the auditory-evoked contralateral occipital positivity (ACOP). Here, we further tested the hypothesis that a salient sound captures visual attention involuntarily by examining sound-evoked modulations of the occipital alpha rhythm, which has been strongly associated with visual attention. In two purely auditory experiments, lateralized irrelevant sounds triggered a bilateral desynchronization of occipital alpha-band activity (10-14 Hz) that was more pronounced in the hemisphere contralateral to the sound's location. The timing of the contralateral alpha-band desynchronization overlapped with that of the ACOP (approximate to 240-400 msec), and both measures of neural activity were estimated to arise from neural generators in the ventral-occipital cortex. The magnitude of the lateralized alpha desynchronization was correlated with ACOP amplitude on a trial-by-trial basis and between participants, suggesting that they arise from or are dependent on a common neural mechanism. These results support the hypothesis that the sound-induced alpha desynchronization and ACOP both reflect the involuntary cross-modal orienting of spatial attention to the sound's location.

Monotherapy with first line anti-absence drugs only controls ASs in 50% of patients, indicating the need for novel therapeutic targets. Since serotonin family-2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) are known to modulate neuronal activity in the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop, the main network involved in AS generation, we investigated the effect of selective 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR ligands on ASs in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well established polygenic rat model of these non-convulsive seizures. GAERS rats were implanted with fronto-parietal EEG electrodes under general anesthesia, and their ASs were later recorded under freely moving conditions before and after intraperitoneal administration of various 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR ligands. The 5-HT2A agonist TCB-2 dose-dependently decreased the total time spent in ASs, an effect that was blocked by the selective 5-HT2A antagonist MDL11,939. Both MDL11,939 and another selective 5-HT2A antagonist (M100,907) increased the length of individual seizures when injected alone. The 5-HT2C agonists lorcaserin and CP-809,101 dose-dependently suppressed ASs, an effect blocked by the selective 5-HT2C antagonist SB 242984. In summary, 5-HT(2A)Rs and 5-HT(2C)Rs negatively control the expression of experimental ASs, indicating that selective agonists at these 5-HT2R subtypes might be potential novel anti-absence drugs.

These networks oscillate since early life and are modulated by diverse maturation factors, including educational processes. Objective To identify the power spectrum separated in delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha 1 (alpha l), alpha 2 (alpha 2), beta 1 (beta 1), beta 2 (beta 2), and their topography in cerebral hemispheres of children, youngsters, and adults to establish qEEG indicators. Method We studied three groups of 16 participants each: elementary school children (CG), undergraduate students (UG), and graduate students (GG). Parents and participants granted their consent. The EEG was recorded (Nicolet) following the 10/20 system. Bipolar samples were analyzed. Absolute power (AP) was obtained with Fourier transform; its average (AAP) relative power (RP), and slow/fast frequencies and indices were calculated. Differences were assessed with Kruskal Wallis and Dunnet's comparison for subgroups. Results The AAP of six frequencies was higher in CG than in UG and GG. Frequencies were similar with exceptions correlating with topographic distribution. The delta/alpha index was higher in CG with a particular topographic distribution, theta/alpha varied more. RP of alpha was higher in UG and GG than in CG; that of theta and delta were higher in some leads of CG. Discussion and conclusion During cerebral maturation, AP diminishes due to integration of more glial-neuronal ensembles, presenting greater asymmetry in a giving frequency. These profiles establish indicators for comparison with future EEG recordings.

This is a composite signal that receives contributions from multiple neural sources, yet interpreting its nature and significance may be hindered by several confounding factors and technical limitations. By and large, the main factor defining the amplitude of LFPs is the geometry of the current sources, over and above the degree of synchronization or the properties of the media. As such, similar levels of activity may result in potentials that differ in several orders of magnitude in different populations. The geometry of these sources has been experimentally inaccessible until intracerebral high density recordings enabled the co-activating sources to be revealed. Without this information, it has proven difficult to interpret a century's worth of recordings that used temporal cues alone, such as event or spike related potentials and frequency bands. Meanwhile, a collection of biophysically ill-founded concepts have been considered legitimate, which can now be corrected in the light of recent advances. The relationship of LFPs to their sources is often counterintuitive. For instance, most LFP activity is not local but remote, it may be larger further from rather than close to the source, the polarity does not define its excitatory or inhibitory nature, and the amplitude may increase when source's activity is reduced. As technological developments foster the use of LFPs, the time is now ripe to raise awareness of the need to take into account spatial aspects of these signals and of the errors derived from neglecting to do so.

The electrophysiological characteristics may serve as valuable biomarkers for the genetic vulnerability underlying alcoholism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the SGIP1 gene and the theta ERP quantitative traits. Method. The theta band (4-7 Hz) visual ERP occurring in the P300 response in the resting EEG were examined to explore the electrophysiological effects of alcohol on the brain in five regions: frontal, central, parietal, temporal and occipital in patients with alcohol addiction. In addition, we tested the potential associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the SGIP1 gene and ERP quantitative traits. Results. We found that the amplitude of the auditory P300 response differed considerably among groups of alcoholics in the frontal, central and temporal areas of the brain and it was lower in the studied brain regions in alcoholics in comparison to non-alcoholics. However, among subjects in the young adult group (GR-1) there was no statistical difference in amplitude of P300 response with control subjects in all studied brain regions in comparison with non-alcoholics. Moreover, we revealed that SNP rs10889635 had a significant effect on P300 amplitude in the central and temporal regions. The reduced P300 amplitude was in AA carriers in comparison to both carriers of GG and GA alleles. Conclusion. The present study demonstrated a possible association of target P300 evoked theta and of alcohol dependence with SNPs from the gene SGIP1 in the region of rs10889635, but further studies are required.

The vestibular network governs functions that might be impaired in patients affected with vestibular dysfunction. It is currently unclear how different brain regions/networks process vestibular information and integrate the information into a unified spatial percept related to somatosensory awareness and whether people with recurrent balance complaints have a neural signature as a trait affecting their development of chronic symptoms of vertigo. Pivotal evidence points to a vestibular-related brain network in humans that is widely distributed in nature. By using resting state source localized electroencephalography in non-vertiginous state, electrophysiological changes in activity and functional connectivity of 23 patients with balance complaints where chronic symptoms of vertigo and dizziness are among the most common reported complaints are analyzed and compared to healthy subjects. The analyses showed increased alpha2 activity within the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneues/ cuneus and reduced beta3 and gamma activity within the pregenual and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex for the subjects with balance complaints. These electrophysiological variations were correlated with reported chronic symptoms of vertigo intensity. A region of interest analysis found reduced functional connectivity for gamma activity within the vestibular cortex, precuneus, frontal eye field, intra-parietal sulcus, orbitofrontal cortex, and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. In addition, there was a positive correlation between chronic symptoms of vertigo intensity and increased alpha-gamma nesting in the left frontal eye field. When compared to healthy subjects, there is evidence of electrophysiological changes in the brain of patients with balance complaints even outside chronic symptoms of vertigo episodes. This suggests that these patients have a neural signature or trait that makes them prone to developing chronic balance problems.

In the present report we tested the hypothesis that the emotional modulation of the N170 may be driven by the perceived emotional arousal of the stimuli, rather than by specific emotional categories. Fifty-four participants viewed facial expressions of anger, disgust, fear and happiness, plus low arousal neutral faces. All emotional categories were matched in arousal, while stimuli within each category varied parametrically in this dimension. The modulation of the electrocortical activity on the N170 time-window was analyzed in the time domain and via time-frequency decomposition. The effects of emotion and arousal were analyzed separately. In the time domain N170 amplitudes co-varied parametrically with perceived arousal, regardless of emotional category. This modulation was linearly associated with the power of the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Moreover, fear was associated with a trend for increased N170 amplitudes, enhanced alpha power, and increased broad band inter-trial phase coherence. These results support the views that a) the activity in N170 time window is fundamentally modulated by perceived arousal, b) the modulation of the N170 may be the product of an increased evoked response, rather than the result of phase resetting processes, and c) facial expressions of fear retain some processing primacy, that may be related to their increased value as environmental cues.

We present two cases of patients with focal epilepsy (occipital, insular) who had seizures during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. Interictal (> 30 min pre-seizure) control data was available for one participant. The location and timing of pre-ictal blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal alterations were examined along with changes in pre-ictal functional connectivity. BOLD signal increases were seen at/close to the seizure onset zone and in/near a contralateral homologous region for both patients. In one patient, BOLD signal decreases were also observed distant from the seizure onset zone. The BOLD signal changes began 11 to 3 min prior to seizure onset. These findings add to a growing number of cases of pre-ictal hemodynamic alterations. The significant BOLD signal increases seen in/near the homologous region contralateral to the seizure onset zone in both patients suggests that this area may play a critical role in the pre-ictal state, perhaps functioning to inhibit the seizure onset zone, or alternatively, to be directly involved in seizure generation. Pre-ictal functional connectivity, using a seed at the presumed seizure onset zone, demonstrated increases in connectivity with regions near the contralateral homologous region prior to seizures. Alterations in connectivity were also observed and characterized in interictal data, highlighting the importance of future research in determining if the observed pre-ictal changes are specific indicators for impending seizures.

Computational models suggest that this feat is accomplished by pattern completion processes involving the hippocampus. However, empirical evidence for hippocampal pattern completion and its underlying mechanisms has remained elusive. Here, we recorded direct intracranial EEG as human participants performed an associative memory task. For each study (encoding) and test (retrieval) event, we derived time-frequency resolved representational patterns in the hippocampus and compared the extent of pattern reinstatement for different mnemonic outcomes. Results show that successful associative recognition (AR) yields enhanced event-specific reinstatement of encoding patterns compared to non-associative item recognition (IR). Moreover, we found that gamma power (50-90 Hz) increases in conjunction with alpha power (8-12 Hz) decreases not only distinguish AR from IR, but also correlate with the level of hippocampal reinstatement. These results link single-shot hippocampal pattern completion to episodic recollection and reveal how oscillatory dynamics in the gamma and alpha bands orchestrate these mnemonic processes.

J	Jones, SR				Jones, Stephanie R.			When brain rhythms aren't 'rhythmic': implication for their mechanisms and meaning	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; BODY OUTPUT NEURONS; MUSHROOM BODY; OLFACTORY BEHAVIOR; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; DROSOPHILA BRAIN; NUTRIENT SENSOR; EEG DYNAMICS; POPULATION; AVOIDANCE	Rhythms are a prominent signature of brain activity. Their expression is correlated with numerous examples of healthy information processing and their fluctuations are a marker of disease states. Yet, their causal or epiphenomenal role in brain function is still highly debated. We review recent studies showing brain rhythms are not always 'rhythmic', by which we mean representative of repeated cycles of activity. Rather, high power and continuous rhythms in averaged signals can represent brief transient events on single trials whose density accumulates in the average. We also review evidence showing time-domain signals with vastly different waveforms can exhibit identical spectral-domain frequency and power. Further, non oscillatory waveform feature can create spurious high spectral power. Knowledge of these possibilities is essential when interpreting rhythms and is easily missed without considering pre-processed data. Lastly, we discuss how these findings suggest new directions to pursue in our quest to discover the mechanism and meaning of brain rhythms.

KC can be considered a 'prototype' of reactive sleep slow waves. Similarly to slow waves, KCs feature up- and down-states, they are subject to homeostatic regulation but they are also associated with sensory activation. As a part of the continuum of reactive sleep slow waves, the study of the KC may offer a better understanding of how slow waves are activated by the sensory system. KCs appear to have a special place among sleep slow waves and in the newly established framework of input-related NREM sleep regulation. It is a key element highlighting how the brain may choose to maintain sleep in response to a sensory input when facing the question "to wake or not to wake". (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One widely held view is that excitation levels are elevated relative to inhibition in ASD. Understanding whether, and how, Ell balance may be altered in ASD is important given the recent interest in trialling pharmacological interventions for ASD which target inhibitory neurotransmitter function. Here we provide a critical review of evidence for E/I balance in ASD. We conclude that data from a number of domains provides support for alteration in excitation and inhibitory neurotransmission in ASD, but when considered collectively, the available literature provide little evidence to support claims for either a net increase in excitation or a net increase in inhibition. Strengths and limitations of available techniques are considered, and directions for future research discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ten right-handed healthy volunteers participated in our proposed sequential short-term memory task that provides a serial position effect in accuracy rate. We recorded alpha-band rhythms by magnetoencephalography during performance of the task and observed that the amplitude of the rhythm was suppressed dramatically in the memory recall period. The suppressed region was estimated to be in the occipital lobe, suggesting that alpha-band rhythm is suppressed by activation of the occipital attentional network. Additionally, the alpha-band suppression reflected accuracy rate, that is, the amplitude was suppressed more when recalling items with higher accuracy rate. The sensors with a significant correlation between alpha-band amplitude and accuracy rate were located widely from the frontal to occipital regions mainly in the right hemisphere. The results suggests that alpha-band rhythm is involved in memory recall and can be index of memory performance.

Conversely, neural responses to a predicted event are typically reduced relative to those from an unpredicted one (prediction suppression). What remains to be established is what happens with attended and predicted events. To examine the interaction between attention and prediction, we combined two robust paradigms developed for studying attention and prediction effects on ERPs into an orthogonal design. Participants were presented with sounds in attended or unattended intervals with onsets that were either predicted by a moving visual cue or unpredicted (no cue was provided). We demonstrated an N1 enhancement effect for attended sounds and an N1 suppression effect for predicted sounds; furthermore, an interaction between these effects was found that emerged early in the N1 (50-95 msec), indicating that attention enhancement only occurred when the sound was unpredicted. This pattern of results can be explained by the precision of the predictive cue that reduces the need for attention selection in the attended and predicted condition.

Spectral entropy analysis of the respiratory signal and its relationship with the cyclic alternating pattern during sleep	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Spectral entropy; cyclic alternating pattern; A-phase; air flow signal	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CAP; AROUSAL; INSOMNIA	A-phases consist of transient cortical events that normally occur during NREM sleep and can be observed directly in the EEG signals. One particular kind of A-phases, namely, A3-phases are related to arousals from sleep during which increased activity in other systems (such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems) can also be observed. This study aims to characterize disruptions in the oscillations of the airflow signal during A3-phases of sleep. Spectral entropy was used to quantify the bandwidth of the airflow signal, which under baseline conditions (prior to an A3-phase) resembles a sinusoidal wave with a frequency of about 0.25 Hz and has low spectral entropy values. It was found that during most A3-phases the spectral entropy increases significantly in 70% of the test subjects. These changes occur with higher probability during A3-phases that are longer than 10 s, suggesting a delay between the onset of an A3-phase and the effect it has on the respiratory system.

During transient periods of inattention, drivers may shift their attention towards internally-directed thoughts or feelings at the expense of staying focused on the road. This study examined whether increasing task difficulty by manipulating involved sensory modalities as the driver detected the lane-departure in a simulated driving task would promote a shift of brain activity between different modes of processing, reflected by brain network dynamics on electroencephalographic sources. Results showed that depriving the driver of salient sensory information imposes a relatively more perceptually-demanding task, leading to a stronger activation in the task-positive network. When the vehicle motion feedback is available, the drivers may rely on vehicle motion to perceive the perturbations, which frees attentional capacity and tends to activate the default mode network. Such brain network dynamics could have major implications for understanding fluctuations in driver attention and designing advance driver assistance systems.

The Impact of Cortical Lesions on Thalamo-Cortical Network Dynamics after Acute Ischaemic Stroke: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							NEUROGENIC PAIN; CORTICOCORTICAL COMMUNICATION; DELTA/ALPHA RATIO; THETA COHERENCE; EEG; BRAIN; THALAMUS; FREQUENCY; NEURONS; SYSTEMS	The neocortex and thalamus provide a core substrate for perception, cognition, and action, and are interconnected through different direct and indirect pathways that maintain specific dynamics associated with functional states including wakefulness and sleep. It has been shown that a lack of excitation, or enhanced subcortical inhibition, can disrupt this system and drive thalamic nuclei into an attractor state of low-frequency bursting and further entrainment of thalamo-cortical circuits, also called thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia (TCD). The question remains however whether similar TCD-like phenomena can arise with a cortical origin. For instance, in stroke, a cortical lesion could disrupt thalamo-cortical interactions through an attenuation of the excitatory drive onto the thalamus, creating an imbalance between excitation and inhibition that can lead to a state of TCD. Here we tested this hypothesis by comparing the resting-state EEG recordings of acute ischaemic stroke patients (N = 21) with those of healthy, age-matched control-subjects (N = 17). We observed that these patients displayed the hallmarks of TCD: a characteristic downward shift of dominant alpha-peaks in the EEG power spectra, together with increased power over the lower frequencies (delta and theta-range). Contrary to general observations in TCD, the patients also displayed a broad reduction in beta-band activity. In order to explain the genesis of this stroke-induced TCD, we developed a biologically constrained model of a general thalamocortical module, allowing us to identify the specific cellular and network mechanisms involved. Our model showed that a lesion in the cortical component leads to sustained cell membrane hyperpolarization in the corresponding thalamic relay neurons, that in turn leads to the de-inactivation of voltage-gated T-type Ca2+-channels, switching neurons from tonic spiking to a pathological bursting regime. This thalamic bursting synchronises activity on a population level through divergent intrathalamic circuits, and entrains thalamo-cortical pathways by means of propagating low-frequency oscillations beyond the restricted region of the lesion. Hence, pathological stroke-induced thalamo-cortical dynamics can be the source of diaschisis, and account for the dissociation between lesion location and non-specific symptoms of stroke such as neuropathic pain and hemispatial neglect.

We recorded electrical activities from the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the motor cortex during voluntary wrist movements. Seven patients with dystonia and six patients with Parkinson's disease underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode placement. Local field potentials from the DBS electrodes and scalp EEG from the electrodes placed over the motor cortices were recorded while the patients performed externally triggered and self-initiated movements. The coherence calculated between the motor cortex and STN or GPi was found to be coupled to its power in both the beta and the gamma bands. The association of coherence with power suggests that a coupling in neural activity between the basal ganglia and the motor cortex is required for the execution of voluntary movements. Finally, we propose a mathematical model involving coupled neural oscillators which provides a possible explanation for how inter-regional coupling takes place.

Toddlers' dysregulated fear predicts delta-beta coupling during preschool	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Delta-beta coupling; Anxiety risk; Dysregulated fear	BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; SOCIAL ANXIETY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EMOTION REGULATION; EEG; CHILDREN; ASSOCIATION; REACTIVITY; MOTIVATION; CONTEXT	Dysregulated fear, or the persistence of high levels of fear in low-threat contexts, is an early risk factor for the development of anxiety symptoms. Previous work has suggested both propensities for over control and under-control of fearfulness as risk factors for anxiety problems, each of which may be relevant to observations of dysregulated fear. Given difficulty disentangling over-control and under control through traditional behavioral measures, we used delta-beta coupling to begin to understand the degree to which dysregulated fear may reflect propensities for over- or under-control. We found that toddlers who showed high levels of dysregulated fear evidenced greater delta-beta coupling at frontal and central electrode sites as preschoolers relative to children who were low in dysregulated fear. Importantly, these differences were not observed when comparisons were made based on fear levels in high threat contexts. Results suggest dysregulated fear may involve tendencies toward over-control at the neural level. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To improve the interpretability of sensor-level connectivity analysis, we introduce and test a new connectivity measure based on imaginary coherence in this study. New method: MEG signals from axial gradiometers are subjected to a wavelet transform at a frequency of interest, and are used to reconstruct 2D tangential magnetometer signals. The Euclidean norm of imaginary coherence values obtained from four available pairs between 2D tangential components at two locations is then used to estimate functional connectivity between sensor locations. The use of this new connectivity measure can be extended to 2D planar gradiometer signals or 3D source signals, where the functional relationship between multi-dimensional signals at different locations needs to be quantified as scalar variables. Results: The proposed method was applied to measured and simulated auditory evoked MEG data. The Euclidean norm of imaginary coherence reliably eliminated the field spread effect and showed increased inter-hemispheric coherence between sensors above the left and the right auditory cortex. The significance of the results was tested by introducing variability in spontaneous brain activities in multi-trial evoked data simulations. Comparison with existing method: The distribution of imaginary coherence among axial gradiometer signals shows peaks not at the sensors directly above the neuronal current sources, but at sensors with field extreme.

Decoding the Attentional Demands of Gait through EEG Gamma Band Features	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MAXIMUM-ENTROPY METHOD; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; MOTOR IMAGERY; BHATTACHARYYA DISTANCE; NEUROLOGICAL REHABILITATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; TASK DEMANDS	Rehabilitation techniques are evolving focused on improving their performance in terms of duration and level of recovery. Current studies encourage the patient's involvement in their rehabilitation. Brain-Computer Interfaces are capable of decoding the cognitive state of users to provide feedback to an external device. On this paper, cortical information obtained from the scalp is acquired with the goal of studying the cognitive mechanisms related to the users' attention to the gait. Data from 10 healthy users and 3 incomplete Spinal Cord Injury patients are acquired during treadmill walking. During gait, users are asked to perform 4 attentional tasks. Data obtained are treated to reduce movement artifacts. Features from delta(1 - 4Hz), theta(4 -8Hz), alpha(8 - 12Hz), beta(12 -30Hz), gamma(low)(30 -50Hz), gamma(high)(50 - 90Hz) frequency bands are extracted and analyzed to find which ones provide more information related to attention. The selected bands are tested with 5 classifiers to distinguish between tasks. Classification results are also compared with chance levels to evaluate performance. Results show success rates of similar to 67% for healthy users and similar to 59% for patients. These values are obtained using features from. band suggesting that the attention mechanisms are related to selective attention mechanisms, meaning that, while the attention on gait decreases the level of attention on the environment and external visual information increases. Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine classifiers provide the best results for all users. Results from patients are slightly lower, but significantly different, than those obtained from healthy users supporting the idea that the patients pay more attention to gait during non-attentional tasks due to the inherent difficulties they have during normal gait. This study provides evidence of the existence of classifiable cortical information related to the attention level on the gait. This fact could allow the development of a real-time system that obtains the attention level during lower limb rehabilitation. This information could be used as feedback to adapt the rehabilitation strategy.

In individuals with AS, mechanisms in the brain's visual area that underlie visual processing play a more prominent role in visual reasoning tasks than they do in normal individuals. In addition, increased connectivity with the visual area is thought to be one of the neural bases of autistic visual cognitive abilities. However, the contribution of such brain connectivity to visual cognitive abilities is not well understood, particularly in children. In this study, we investigated how functional connectivity between the visual areas and higher-order regions, which is reflected by alpha, beta and gamma band oscillations, contributes to the performance of visual reasoning tasks in typically developing (TD) (n = 18) children and AS children (n = 18). Brain activity was measured using a custom child-sized magneto-encephalograph. Imaginary coherence analysis was used as a proxy to estimate the functional connectivity between the occipital and other areas of the brain. Stronger connectivity from the occipital area, as evidenced by higher imaginary coherence in the gamma band, was associated with higher performance in the AS children only. We observed no significant correlation between the alpha or beta bands imaginary coherence and performance in the both groups. Alpha and beta bands reflect top-down pathways, while gamma band oscillations reflect a bottom-up influence. Therefore, our results suggest that visual reasoning in AS children is at least partially based on an enhanced reliance on visual perception and increased bottom-up connectivity from the visual areas.

We examined age and alcohol effects on brain oscillations during simulated driving, focusing on 2 region-specific frequency bands implicated in task performance and attention: parietal alpha power (PAP; 8 to 12Hz) and frontal theta power (FTP; 4 to 7Hz). MethodsParticipants included 80 younger (aged 25 to 35years) and 40 older (aged 55 to 70years) community-dwelling, moderate drinkers. Participants consumed placebo, low, or moderate doses of alcohol designed to achieve target peak breath alcohol concentrations of 0, 0.04, or 0.065g/dl, respectively. Electrophysiological measures were recorded during engagement in a simulated driving task involving 4 scenarios of varied environmental complexity. ResultsA main effect of age was detected in FTP, but neither an alcohol effect nor interactions were observed. For PAP, an age-by-alcohol interaction was detected. Relative to placebo controls, older and younger participants receiving low-dose (0.04g/dl) alcohol evinced divergent PAP alterations, with a pattern of higher power among older participants and lower power among younger participants. This interaction was noted across the varied environmental contexts. ConclusionsThese findings are consistent with the hypothesis that compared with younger individuals, older drivers may be differentially susceptible to alcohol effects. While these age-by-alcohol interactions in neural activity are provocative, further investigation exploring the mechanisms and behavioral correlates of these effects will be crucial in determining their behavioral impact.

The purpose of this paper was to describe and compare consumer (patient and caregivers) and professional understanding of seizure clusters and to describe how consumers and HCPs communicate regarding seizure clusters. We reviewed social media discussion sites to explore consumers' understanding of seizure clusters. We analyzed professional (medical) literature to explore the HCPs' understanding of seizure clusters. Major themes were revealed in one or both groups, including: communication about diagnosis; frequency, duration, and time frame; seizure type and pattern; severity; and self-management. When comparing discussions of professionals and consumers, both consumers and clinicians discussed the definition of seizure clusters. Discussions of HCPs were understandably clinically focused, and consumer discussions reflected the experience of seizure clusters; however, both groups struggled with a common lexicon. Seizure cluster events remain a problem associated with serious outcomes. Herein, we outline the lack of a common understanding and recommend the development of a common lexicon to improve communication regarding seizure clusters. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J	Zhou, GY; Bourguignon, M; Parkkonen, L; Hari, R				Zhou, Guangyu; Bourguignon, Mathieu; Parkkonen, Lauri; Hari, Riitta			Neural signatures of hand kinematics in leaders vs. followers: A dual-MEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Social interaction; Hyperscanning; MEG; Hand kinematics; Modulation index; Sensorimotor integration	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; VISUAL PATHWAYS; COHERENCE; ALPHA; MODULATIONS; ATTENTION; EEG; REPRESENTATION	During joint actions, people typically adjust their own actions according to the ongoing actions of the partner, which implies that the interaction modulates the behavior of both participants. However, the neural substrates of such mutual adaptation are still poorly understood. Here, we set out to identify the kinematics-related brain activity of leaders and followers performing hand actions. Sixteen participants as 8 pairs performed continuous, repetitive right-hand opening and closing actions with similar to 3-s cycles in a leader-follower task. Subjects played each role for 5 min. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain signals were recorded simultaneously from both partners with a dual-MEG setup, and hand kinematics was monitored with accelerometers. Modulation index, a cross-frequency coupling measure, was computed between the hand acceleration and the MEG signals in the alpha (7-13 Hz) and beta (13-25 Hz) bands. Regardless of the participants' role, the strongest alpha and beta modulations occurred bilaterally in the sensorimotor cortices. In the occipital region, beta modulation was stronger in followers than leaders; these oscillations originated, according to beamformer source reconstructions, in early visual cortices. Despite differences in the modulation indices, alpha and beta power did not differ between the conditions. Our results indicate that the beta modulation in the early visual cortices depends on the subject's role as a follower or leader in a joint hand-action task. This finding could reflect the different strategies employed by leaders and followers in integrating kinematics-related visual information to control their own actions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Each type of epilepsy is associated with a different set of questions and goals. In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS), postoperative seizure outcome is satisfactory. A recent meta-analysis revealed superior seizure outcome after anterior temporal lobectomy compared with selective amygdalohippocampectomy; in terms of cognitive outcome; however, amygdalohippocampectomy may be beneficial. In temporal lobe epilepsy with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postoperative seizure outcome is not as favorable as it is in MTLE with HS; further improvement of seizure outcome in these cases is necessary. Focal cortical dysplasia is the most common substrate in intractable neocortical epilepsy, especially in children, as well as in MRI-invisible neocortical epilepsy. Postoperative seizure-free outcome is approximately 60-70%; further diagnostic and therapeutic improvement is required. Regarding diagnostic methodology, an important topic currently under discussion is wideband electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis. Although high-frequency oscillations and ictal direct current shifts are considered important markers of epileptogenic zones, the clinical significance of these findings should be clarified further. Regarding alternatives to surgery, neuromodulation therapy can be an option for patients who are not amenable to resective surgery. In addition to vagus nerve stimulation, intracranial stimulation such as responsive neurostimulation or anterior thalamic stimulation is reported to have a modest seizure suppression effect. Postoperative management such as rehabilitation and antiepileptic drug (AED) management is important. It has been reported that postoperative rehabilitation improves postoperative employment status. Pre- and post-operative comprehensive care is mandatory for postoperative improvement of quality of life.

The current knowledge on how neurostimulation affects FRs is, however, very limited. In this study, we assess the influence of the vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) frequency on ictal FRs associated with spike-and-wave (SW) seizures. Methods: SW discharges were induced and maintained by an infusion of pentylenetetrazol in rat. During ongoing SW seizures, SCS was conducted at 30, 80, 130, and 180 Hz and VNS at 10, 30, 80, 130, and 180 Hz. The FRs were derived from intracortical recordings and the FR rate was used for quantifying the level of FR activity. Results: The FR rate was significantly correlated (r - 0.81) with the level of total pentylenetetrazol dose. Compared with no stimulation intervals, SCS conducted at 80, 130, and 180 Hz significantly reduced the normalized FR rate by 24, 38, and 44%, respectively. Similarly, VNS conducted at 30, 80, 130, and 180 Hz significantly reduced the normalized FR rate by 23, 40, 61, and 65%, respectively. Conclusions: In the present model of sustained SW seizures, the FR rate was proportional with the severity of the SW seizures. Both SCS and VNS attenuated the FR rate and this attenuation was consistently strongest at the higher stimulation frequencies. Our results suggest that SCS may induce some of the same antiepileptic effects as VNS.

The former seems to apply to merely tracking another's visual perspective in the world (i.e., what a conspecific can or cannot perceive), while the latter applies to perspective taking in form of mentally "embodying" another's viewpoint. Our previous behavioural research had indicated that only perspective taking, but not tracking, relies on simulating a body schema rotation into another's viewpoint. In the current study we employed Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and revealed that this mechanism of mental body schema rotation is primarily linked to theta oscillations in a wider brain network of body-schema, somatosensory and motor-related areas, with the right posterior temporoparietal junction (pTPJ) at its core. The latter was reflected by a convergence of theta oscillatory power in right pTPJ obtained by overlapping the separately localised effects of rotation demands (angular disparity effect), cognitive embodiment (posture congruence effect), and basic body schema involvement (posture relevance effect) during perspective taking in contrast to perspective tracking. In a subsequent experiment we interfered with right pTPJ processing using dual pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dpTMS) and observed a significant reduction of embodied processing. We conclude that right TPJ is the crucial network hub for transforming the embodied self into another's viewpoint, body and/or mind, thus, substantiating how conflicting representations between self and other may be resolved and potentially highlighting the embodied origins of high-level social cognition in general.

The parasubiculum, which receives input from multiple hippocampal subfields, sends its single major output projection to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that it may modulate processing of synaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex. Indeed, stimulation of the parasubiculum can enhance entorhinal responses to synaptic input from the piriform cortex in vivo. Theta EEG activity contributes to spatial and mnemonic processes in this region, and the current study assessed how stimulation of the parasubiculum with either single pulses or short, five-pulse, theta-frequency trains may modulate synaptic responses in layer II entorhinal stellate neurons evoked by stimulation of layer I afferents in vitro. Parasubicular stimulation pulses or trains suppressed responses to layer I stimulation at intervals of 5 ms, and parasubicular stimulation trains facilitated layer I responses at a train-pulse interval of 25 ms. This suggests that firing of parasubicular neurons during theta activity may heterosynaptically enhance incoming sensory inputs to the entorhinal cortex. Bath application of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I-h) blocker ZD7288 enhanced the facilitation effect, suggesting that cholinergic inhibition of I-h may contribute. In addition, repetitive pairing of parasubicular trains and layer I stimulation induced a lasting depression of entorhinal responses to layer I stimulation. These findings provide evidence that theta activity in the parasubiculum may promote heterosynaptic modulation effects that may alter sensory processing in the entorhinal cortex.

Quiet Connections: Reduced Fronto-Temporal Connectivity in Nondemented Parkinson's Disease During Working Memory Encoding	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						cortical oscillations; phase synchronization; magnetoencephalography; local field potentials	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; DE-NOVO; MOVEMENT; EEG; MODULATION; DOPAMINE; DYNAMICS; GAMMA	Parkinson's disease ( PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and resting tremor. It is now broadly accepted that these motor symptoms frequently co-occur with cognitive impairments, with deficits in working memory and attention being among the most common cognitive sequelae associated with PD. While these cognitive impairments are now recognized, the underlying neural dynamics and precise regions involved remain largely unknown. To this end, we examined the oscillatory dynamics and interregional functional connectivity that serve working memory processing in a group of unmedicated adults with PD and a matched group without PD. Each participant completed a high-load, Sternberg-type working memory task during magnetoencephalography ( MEG), and we focused on the encoding and maintenance phases. All data were transformed into the time-frequency domain and significant oscillatory activity was imaged using a beamforming approach. Phase-coherence ( connectivity) was also computed among the brain subregions exhibiting the strongest responses. Our most important findings were that unmedicated patients with PD had significantly diminished working memory performance ( i.e., accuracy), and reduced functional connectivity between left inferior frontal cortices and left supramarginal-superior temporal cortices compared to participants without PD during the encoding phase of working memory processing. We conclude that patients with PD have reduced neural interactions between left prefrontal executive circuits and temporary verbal storage centers in the left supramarginal/ superior temporal cortices during the stimulus encoding phase, which may underlie their diminished working memory function.

The network usually exhibits complex behaviors of rhythmic, balancing and coupling between the oscillations, and the quantification of these behaviors would provide valuable insight into organization of the local network related to brain states. New method: An integrated approach to quantify rhythmic, balancing and coupling neural behaviors based upon power spectral analysis, power ratio analysis and cross-frequency power coupling analysis was presented. Deep brain local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the thalamus of patients with neuropathic pain and dystonic tremor. t-Test was applied to assess the difference between the two patient groups. Results: The rhythmic behavior measured by power spectral analysis showed significant power spectrum difference in the high beta band between the two patient groups. The balancing behavior measured by power ratio analysis showed significant power ratio differences at high beta band to 8-20 Hz, and 30-40 Hz to high beta band between the patient groups. The coupling behavior measured by cross frequency power coupling analysis showed power coupling differences at (theta band, high beta band) and (45-55 Hz, 70-80 Hz) between the patient groups. Comparison with existing method: The study provides a strategy for studying the brain states in a multidimensional behavior space and a framework to screen quantitative characteristics for biomarkers related to diseases or nuclei. Conclusions: The work provides a comprehensive approach for understanding the complex behaviors of deep brain LFPs and identifying quantitative biomarkers for brain states related to diseases or nuclei.

During sensory conflict, medial pFC oscillations in the theta band (<8 Hz) drive those of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and this is thought to increase the threshold of evidence needed for one competing response to be selected over another. Here, we were interested in testing whether STN activity is also altered by the rate at which evidence is presented during a congruent dot motion task absent of any explicit sensory conflict. By having a series of randomly moving dots gradually transform to congruent motion at three different rates (slow, medium, fast), we were able to show that a slower rate increased the time it took participants to make a response but did not alter the total amount of evidence that was integrated before the response. Notably, this resulted in a decision being made with a lower amount of instantaneous evidence during the slow and medium trials. Consistent with the idea that medial pFC-STN activity is involved in executing cognitive control, the higher levels of ambiguity during these trials were associated with increased theta band synchrony between the cortex and the STN, with the cortical oscillations Granger-causal to those of the STN. These results further confirm the involvement of the STN in decision-making and suggest that the disruption of this network may underlie some of the unwanted cognitive deficits associated with STN deep brain stimulation.

Desynchronization of Fronto-Temporal Networks During Working Memory Processing in Autism	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						alpha oscillations; phase-locking values; executive functions; MEG; children	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; WHITE-MATTER; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG-ALPHA; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY	Background: Mounting evidence suggests that autism is a network disorder, characterized by atypical brain connectivity, especially in the context of high level cognitive processes such as working memory (WM). Accordingly, atypical WM processes have been related to the social and cognitive deficits observed in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate connectivity differences during a high memory load (2-back) WM task between 17 children with ASD and 20 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched controls. Results: We identified reduced inter-regional alpha-band (9-15 Hz) phase synchronization in children with ASD during the WM task. Reduced WM-related brain synchronization encompassed fronto-temporal networks (ps<0.04 corrected) previously associated with challenging high-level conditions (i.e. the left insula and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) and memory encoding and/or recognition (i.e. the right middle temporal gyrus and the right fusiform gyrus). Additionally, we found that reduced connectivity processes related to the right fusiform were correlated with the severity of symptoms in children with ASD, suggesting that such atypicalities could be directly related to the behavioural deficits observed. Discussion: This study provides new evidence of atypical long-range synchronization in children with ASD in fronto-temporal areas that crucially contribute to challenging WM tasks, but also emotion regulation and social cognition processes. Thus, these results support the network disorder hypothesis of ASD and argue for a specific pathophysiological contribution of brain processes related to working memory and executive functions on the symptomatology of autism.

In previous work, we studied the spatial distribution of a noise power measure (scalp-recorded electroencephalographic activity unlocked to stimuli) and found higher magnitudes in the gamma band related to symptoms and cognition in schizophrenia. In the current study, we sought to replicate those findings and to study its specificity for schizophrenia in a completely independent sample. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the factorial structure of gamma noise power acquired with an electroencephalographic recording during an odd-ball P300 paradigm in the 250- to 550-ms window in 70 patients with schizophrenia (16 patients with first episode), 45 bipolar patients and 65 healthy controls. Clinical and cognitive correlates of the resulting factors were also assessed. Three factors arose from the PCA. The first displayed a midline-parietal distribution (roughly corresponding to the default mode network), the second was centro-temporal and the third anterior-frontal. Schizophrenia but not bipolar patients showed higher gamma noise power loadings in the first factor in comparison with controls. Scores for this factor were significantly and directly associated with positive and total symptoms in patients and inversely associated with global cognition in all participants. The results of this study replicate those of our previous publication and suggest an elevated midline-parietal gamma noise power specific to schizophrenia. The gamma noise power measure seems to be a useful tool for studying background oscillatory activity during performance of cognitive tasks.

Aging Modulates the Oscillatory Dynamics Underlying Successful Working Memory Encoding and Maintenance	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; compensation; oscillation; Broca's; Wernicke's; prefrontal cortex; alpha; CRUNCH	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; NEURAL ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; SIGNAL; SPACE; PERFORMANCE; TASKS	Working memory is central to the execution of many daily functions and is typically divided into three phases: encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. While working memory performance has been repeatedly shown to decline with age, less is known regarding the underlying neural processes. We examined age-related differences in the neural dynamics that serve working memory by recording high-density magnetoencephalography (MEG) in younger and older adults while they performed a modified, high-load Sternberg working memory task with letters as stimuli. MEG data were evaluated in the time-frequency domain and significant oscillatory responses were imaged using a beamformer. A hierarchical regression was performed to investigate whether age moderated the relationship between oscillatory activity and accuracy on the working memory task. Our results indicated that the spatiotemporal dynamics of oscillatory activity in language-related areas of the left fronto-temporal cortices were similar across groups. Age-related differences emerged during early encoding in the right-hemispheric homologue of Wernicke's area. Slightly later, group differences emerged in the homologue of Broca's area and these persisted throughout memory maintenance. Additionally, occipital alpha activity during maintenance was stronger, occurred earlier, and involved more cortical tissue in older adults. Finally, age significantly moderated the relationship between accuracy and neural activity in the prefrontal cortices. In younger adults, as prefrontal activity decreased, accuracy tended to increase. Our results are consistent with predictions of the compensation-related utilization of neural circuits hypothesis (CRUNCH). Such differences in the oscillatory dynamics could reflect compensatory mechanisms, which would aid working memory performance in older age. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It suggests that we can become conscious of distinct properties of an object independently, ranging from low-level features to complex forms of representation. We investigated this hypothesis using classic visual word masking adapted to a near-threshold paradigm. The masking intensity was adjusted to the individual perception threshold, at which individual alphabetical letters, but not words, could be perceived in approximately half of the trials. We confined perception to a pre-lexical stage of word processing that corresponded to a clear condition of partial awareness. At this level of representation, the stimulus properties began to emerge within consciousness, yet they did not escalate to full stimulus awareness. In other words, participants were able to perceive individual letters, while remaining unaware of the whole letter strings presented. Cortical activity measured with MEG was compared between physically identical trials that differed in perception (perceived, not perceived). We found that compared to no awareness, partial awareness of words was characterized by suppression of oscillatory alpha power in left temporal and parietal cortices. The analysis of functional connectivity with seeds based on the power effect in these two regions revealed sparse connections for the parietal seed, and strong connections between the temporal seed and other regions of the language network. We suggest that the engagement of language regions indexed by alpha power suppression is responsible for establishing and maintaining conscious representations of individual pre-lexical units.

Memorable Audiovisual Narratives Synchronize Sensory and Supramodal Neural Responses	ENEURO			English	Article						episodic encoding; intersubject correlation; multisensory integration; naturalistic stimuli	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; RETRIEVAL; MEMORIES; DISCRIMINATION; RECOGNITION; RELIABILITY; EXPERIENCE; COMPONENTS; PREDICTS	Our brains integrate information across sensory modalities to generate perceptual experiences and form memories. However, it is difficult to determine the conditions under which multisensory stimulation will benefit or hinder the retrieval of everyday experiences. We hypothesized that the determining factor is the reliability of information processing during stimulus presentation, which can be measured through intersubject correlation of stimulus-evoked activity. We therefore presented biographical auditory narratives and visual animations to 72 human subjects visually, auditorily, or combined, while neural activity was recorded using electroencephalography. Memory for the narrated information, contained in the auditory stream, was tested 3 weeks later. While the visual stimulus alone led to no meaningful retrieval, this related stimulus improved memory when it was combined with the story, even when it was temporally incongruent with the audio. Further, individuals with better subsequent memory elicited neural responses during encoding that were more correlated with their peers. Surprisingly, portions of this predictive synchronized activity were present regardless of the sensory modality of the stimulus. These data suggest that the strength of sensory and supramodal activity is predictive of memory performance after 3 weeks, and that neural synchrony may explain the mnemonic benefit of the functionally uninformative visual context observed for these real-world stimuli.

ROLE OF LASER-EVOKED POTENTIAL-INDUCED GAMMA-BAND OSCILLATIONS IN DETECTING CORTICAL PAIN PROCESSING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						gamma-band oscillations; laser-evoked potentials; Nociception Coma Scale-Revised; pain arousal; pain perception	PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE; MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATES; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; NOCICEPTIVE STIMULI; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; DISORDERS; RECOVERY; MODULATION; CORRELATE	It has been proposed that a neural signature of aware pain perception could be represented by the modulation of gamma-band oscillation (GBO) power induced by nociceptive repetitive laser stimulation (RLS). The aim of our study was to correlate the RLS-induced GBO modulation with the Nociception Coma Scale-Revised (NCS-R) scores (a validated scale assessing possible aware pain perception in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness), in an attempt to differentiate unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients from minimally conscious state (MCS) ones (both of them are awake but exhibit no or limited and fluctuant behavioral signs of awareness and mentation, and low and high NCS-R scores, respectively). In addition, we attempted to identify those among UWS patients who probably experienced pain at covert level (i.e. being aware but unable to show pain-related purposeful behaviors, which are those sustained, reproducible, and voluntary behavioral responses to nociceptive stimuli). Notably, the possibility of clearly differentiating UWS from MCS patients has outmost consequences concerning prognosis (worse in UWS) and adequate pain treatment. RLS consisted in 80 trains of three laser stimuli (delivered at 1 Hz), at four different energies, able to evoke Ad-fiber related laser evoked potentials. After each train, we assessed the NCSR score. EEG was divided into epochs according to the laser trains, and the obtained epochs were classified in four categories according to the NCS-R score magnitude. We quantified the GBO absolute power for each category. RLS protocol induced a strongly correlated increase in GBO power and NCS-R score (the higher the laser stimulation intensity, the higher the NCS-R, independently of stimulus repetition) in all the MCS patients, thus confirming the presence of aware pain processing. Nonetheless, such findings were present even in five UWS individuals. This could suggest the presence of covert pain processing in such subjects, despite the low NCS-R scores. In conclusion, RSL-induced GBO power evaluation could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between MCS and UWS patients, besides the clinical assessment, and in identifying covert pain perception in some UWS individuals.

J	VanRullen, R				VanRullen, Rufin			How to Evaluate Phase Differences between Trial Groups in Ongoing Electrophysiological Signals	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						perceptual cycles; rhythmic perception; discrete perception; oscillations; phase; phase opposition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OCCIPITAL ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; REACTION-TIME; DETECTION PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY BANDS; STIMULUS ONSET; BRAIN STATES	A growing number of studies endeavor to reveal periodicities in sensory and cognitive functions, by comparing the distribution of ongoing (pre-stimulus) oscillatory phases between two (or more) trial groups reflecting distinct experimental outcomes. A systematic relation between the phase of spontaneous electrophysiological signals, before a stimulus is even presented, and the eventual result of sensory or cognitive processing for that stimulus, would be indicative of an intrinsic periodicity in the underlying neural process. Prior studies of phase-dependent perception have used a variety of analytical methods to measure and evaluate phase differences, and there is currently no established standard practice in this field. The present report intends to remediate this need, by systematically comparing the statistical power of various measures of "phase opposition" between two trial groups, in a number of real and simulated experimental situations. Seven measures were evaluated: one parametric test (circular Watson-Williams test), and three distinct measures of phase opposition (phase bifurcation index, phase opposition sum, and phase opposition product) combined with two procedures for non-parametric statistical testing (permutation, or a combination of z-score and permutation). While these are obviously not the only existing or conceivable measures, they have all been used in recent studies. All tested methods performed adequately on a previously published dataset (Busch et al., 2009). On a variety of artificially constructed datasets, no single measure was found to surpass all others, but instead the suitability of each measure was contingent on several experimental factors: the time, frequency, and depth of oscillatory phase modulation; the absolute and relative amplitudes of post-stimulus event-related potentials for the two trial groups; the absolute and relative trial numbers for the two groups; and the number of permutations used for non-parametric testing. The concurrent use of two phase opposition measures, the parametric Watson-Williams test and a non-parametric test based on summing inter-trial coherence values for the two trial groups, appears to provide the most satisfactory outcome in all situations tested. Matlab code is provided to automatically compute these phase opposition measures.

These regions constitute the limbic structure in non-conscious perception of emotions and modulate cortical activity either directly or indirectly(2). In contrast, the conscious representation of emotions is more pronounced in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory cortex for directing voluntary attention to details in faces(3,4). Asperger's syndrome (AS)(5,6) represents an atypical mental disturbance that affects sensory, affective and communicative abilities, without interfering with normal linguistic skills and intellectual ability. Several studies have found that functional deficits in the neural circuitry important for facial emotion recognition can partly explain social communication failure in patients with AS(7-9). In order to clarify the interplay between conscious and non-conscious representations of emotional faces in AS, an EEG experimental protocol is designed with two tasks involving emotionality evaluation of either photograph or line-drawing faces. A pilot study is introduced for selecting face stimuli that minimize the differences in reaction times and scores assigned to facial emotions between the pretested patients with AS and IQ/gender-matched healthy controls. Information from the pretested patients was used to develop the scoring system used for the emotionality evaluation. Research into facial emotions and visual stimuli with different spatial frequency contents has reached discrepant findings depending on the demographic characteristics of participants and task demands(2). The experimental protocol is intended to clarify deficits in patients with AS in processing emotional faces when compared with healthy controls by controlling for factors unrelated to recognition of facial emotions, such as task difficulty, IQ and gender.

For the entire brain cortical areas, this approach has been challenging, especially in freely moving states, owing to the need for extensive craniotomy. Here, we introduce a flexible microelectrode array system, termed iWEBS, which can be inserted through a small cranial slit and stably wrap onto the curved cortical surface. Using iWEBS, we measured dynamic changes of signals across major cortical domains, namely, somatosensory, motor, visual and retrosplenial areas, in freely moving mice. iWEBS robustly displayed somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in corresponding cortical areas to specific somatosensory stimuli. We also used iWEBS for mapping functional interactions between cortical areas in the propagation of spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), the neurological marker of absence seizures, triggered by optogenetic inhibition of a specific thalamic nucleus. This demonstrates that iWEBS represents a significant improvement over conventional ECoG recording methodologies and, therefore, is a competitive recording system for mapping wide-range brain connectivity under various behavioral conditions.

However, it is so far unknown what is the brain dynamics underlying the semantic priming effect induced by music, and its relation to language. To elucidate these issues, we compare the brain oscillatory response to visual words that have been semantically primed either by a musical excerpt or by an auditory sentence. We found that semantic violation between music-word pairs triggers a classical ERP N400, and induces a sustained increase of long-distance theta phase synchrony, along with a transient increase of local gamma activity. Similar results were observed after linguistic semantic violation except for gamma activity, which increased after semantic congruence between sentence-word pairs. Our findings indicate that local gamma activity is a neural marker that signals different ways of semantic processing between music and language, revealing the dynamic and self-organized nature of the semantic processing.

Although neuronal cultures lack the characteristic high-frequency waves of wakefulness, it is possible to modulate their spontaneous firing pattern through the administration of specific neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine. We thus stimulated the cortical cultures with an agonist of acetylcholine receptor, Carbachol, which caused a desynchronization of the spontaneous firing of the cultures. We recorded and monitored the cultures for a period of over 31 h. We analyzed the electrophysiological signals by exploiting novel methodological approaches, taking into account the different temporal scales of the recorded signals, and considering both spikes and local field potentials. Supporting the electrophysiological analysis results, gene expressions of targeted genes showed the activation of specific markers involved in sleep-wake rhythms. Our results demonstrate that the Carbachol treatment induces desynchronization of neuronal activity, altering sleep-like properties in an in vitro model.

One view is that dyslexia is characterised by a cognitive impairment in the "phonological representation" of word forms, which arises long before the child presents with a reading problem. Here we investigate a possible neural basis for developmental phonological impairments. We assess the neural quality of speech encoding in children with dyslexia by measuring the accuracy of low-frequency speech envelope encoding using EEG. We tested children with dyslexia and chronological age-matched (CA) and reading-level matched (RL) younger children. Participants listened to semantically-unpredictable sentences in a word report task. The sentences were noise-vocoded to increase reliance on envelope cues. Envelope reconstruction for envelopes between 0 and 10 Hz showed that the children with dyslexia had significantly poorer speech encoding in the 0-2 Hz band compared to both CA and RL controls. These data suggest that impaired neural encoding of low frequency speech envelopes, related to speech prosody, may underpin the phonological deficit that causes dyslexia across languages.

Using fMRI, we recently characterized neural patterns of word generation in response to episodic, semantic, and phonemic cues by comparing free recall of wordlists, category fluency, and letter fluency [Shapira-Lichter, I., Oren, N., Jacob, Y., Gruberger, M., & Hendler, T. Portraying the unique contribution of the default mode network to internally driven mnemonic processes. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 110, 4950-4955, 2013]. Distinct selectivity for each condition was evident, representing discrete aspects of word generation-related memory retrieval. For example, the precuneus, implicated in processing spatiotemporal information, emerged as a key contributor to the episodic condition, which uniquely requires this information. Gamma band is known to play a central role in memory, and increased gamma power has been observed before word generation. Yet, gamma modulation in response to task demands has not been investigated. To capture the task-specific modulation of gamma power, we analyzed the EEG data recorded simultaneously with the aforementioned fMRI, focusing on the activity locked to and immediately preceding word articulation. Transient increases in gamma power were identified in a parietal electrode immediately before episodic and semantic word generation, however, within a different time frame relative to articulation. Gamma increases were followed by an alpha-theta decrease in the episodic condition, a gamma decrease in the semantic condition. This pattern indicates a task-specific modulation of the gamma signal corresponding to the specific demands of each word generation task. The gamma power and fMRI signal from the precuneus were correlated during the episodic condition, implying the existence of a common cognitive construct uniquely required for this task, possibly the reactivation or processing of spatiotemporal information.

This process, known as repetition suppression (RS), is involved in the acquisition of familiarity. Current models suggest that RS results from interactions between visual information processing areas located in the occipito-temporal cortex and higher order areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Brain signal complexity, which reflects information dynamics of cortical networks, has been shown to increase as unfamiliar faces become familiar. However, the complementarity of RS and increases in brain signal complexity have yet to be demonstrated within the same measurements. We hypothesized that RS and brain signal complexity increase occur simultaneously during learning of unfamiliar faces. Further, we expected alteration of DLPFC function by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate RS and brain signal complexity over the occipito-temporal cortex. Participants underwent three tDCS conditions in random order: right anodal/left cathodal, right cathodal/left anodal and sham. Following tDCS, participants learned unfamiliar faces, while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Results revealed RS over occipito-temporal electrode sites during learning, reflected by a decrease in signal energy, a measure of amplitude. Simultaneously, as signal energy decreased, brain signal complexity, as estimated with multiscale entropy (MSE), increased. In addition, prefrontal tDCS modulated brain signal complexity over the right occipitotemporal cortex during the first presentation of faces. These results suggest that although RS may reflect a brain mechanism essential to learning, complementary processes reflected by increases in brain signal complexity, may be instrumental in the acquisition of novel visual information. Such processes likely involve long-range coordinated activity between prefrontal and lower order visual areas. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present magnetoencephalography study, we scrutinised these pre-stimulus network states with a focus on the primary somatosensory cortex. For this purpose participants performed a simple near-threshold tactile detection task. Confirming previous studies, we found reduced alpha and beta power in the somatosensory region contralateral to stimulation prior to correct stimulus detection as compared to undetected stimuli, and stronger event-related responses following successful stimulus detection. As expected, using graph theoretical measures, we also observed modulated pre-stimulus network level integration. Specifically, the right primary somatosensory cortex contralateral to stimulation showed an increased integration in the theta band, and additionally, a decreased integration in the beta band. Overall, these results underline the importance of network states for enabling conscious perception. Moreover, they indicate that also a reduction of irrelevant functional connections contributes to the window to consciousness by tuning pre-stimulus pathways of information flow.

Altered cross-frequency coupling in resting-state MEG after mild traumatic brain injury	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Mild traumatic brain injury; Cross-frequency coupling; Tensors; Biomarkers	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; AXONAL INJURY; DYNAMICS; EEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SYNCHRONIZATION; REORGANIZATION; CORTEX	Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is thought to represent a basic mechanism of functional integration of neural networks across distant brain regions. In this study, we analyzed CFC profiles from resting state Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings obtained from 30 mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients and 50 controls. We used mutual information (MI) to quantify the phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) of activity among the recording sensors in six nonoverlapping frequency bands. After forming the CFC-based functional connectivity graphs, we employed a tensor representation and tensor subspace analysis to identify the optimal set of features for subject classification as mTBI or control. Our results showed that controls formed a dense network of stronger local and global connections indicating higher functional integration compared to mTBI patients. Furthermore, mTBI patients could be separated from controls with more than 90% classification accuracy. These findings indicate that analysis of brain networks computed from resting-state MEG with PAC and tensorial representation of connectivity profiles may provide a valuable biomarker for the diagnosis of mTBI.

We analyzed, at single-trial level, whole head MEG recorded during an observer-triggered apparent motion task. Episodes of globally coherent activity occurred in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands of the signal in the form of large-scale waves, which propagated with a variety of velocities. Their mean speed at each frequency band was proportional to temporal frequency, giving a range of 0.06 to 4.0 m/s, from delta to beta. The wave peaks moved over the entire measurement array, during both ongoing activity and task-relevant intervals; direction of motion was more predictable during the latter. A large proportion of the cortical signal, measurable at the scalp, exists as large-scale coherent motion. We argue that the distribution of observable phase velocities in MEG is dominated by spatial filtering considerations in combination with group velocity of cortical activity. Traveling waves may index processes involved in global coordination of cortical activity.

Rhythmic neuronal interactions can be quantified using multiple metrics, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This tutorial will review and summarize current analysis methods used in the field of invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology to study the dynamic connections between neuronal populations. First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the sample size bias problem. These pitfalls will be illustrated by presenting a set of MATLAB-scripts, which can be executed by the reader to simulate each of these potential problems. We discuss how these issues can be addressed using current methods.

Here, we present a cortical parcellation model based on macroanatomical information and test its validity on visuomotor-related cortical functional networks. The parcellation model is based on a recently developed cortical parameterization method (Auzias et al., [2013]: IEEE Trans Med Imaging 32:873-887), called HIP-HOP. This method exploits a set of primary and secondary sulci to create an orthogonal coordinate system on the cortical surface. A natural parcellation scheme arises from the axes of the HIP-HOP model running along the fundus of selected sulci. The resulting parcellation scheme, called MarsAtlas, complies with dorsoventral/rostrocaudal direction fields and allows inter-subject matching. To test it for functional mapping, we analyzed a MEG dataset collected from human participants performing an arbitrary visuomotor mapping task. Single-trial high-gamma activity, HGA (60-120 Hz), was estimated using spectral analysis and beamforming techniques at cortical areas arising from a Talairach atlas (i.e., Brodmann areas) and MarsAtlas. Using both atlases, we confirmed that visuomotor associations involve an increase in HGA over the sensorimotor and fronto-parietal network, in addition to medial prefrontal areas. However, MarsAtlas provided: (1) crucial functional information along both the dorsolateral and rostrocaudal direction; (2) an increase in statistical significance. To conclude, our results suggest that the MarsAtlas is a valid anatomical atlas for functional mapping, and represents a potential anatomical framework for integration of functional data arising from multiple techniques such as MEG, intracranial EEG and fMRI.

Five consistently identified major trait dimensions, also referred to as "big five" (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness), are considered to account for virtually all personality variances in both healthy people and those with psychiatric disorders. The purpose of the present study was, for the first time, to establish the link between 40-Hz ASSR and "big five" major personality trait dimensions in young healthy adults. Ninety-four young healthy volunteers participated (38 males and 56 females; mean age +/- A SD 22.180 +/- A 2.75). The 40-Hz click trains were presented for each subject 30 times with an inter-train interval of 1-1.5 s. The EEG responses were recorded from F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz and P4 locations according to 10/20 electrode placement system. Phase-locking index (PLI) and event-related power perturbation (ERSP) were calculated, each providing the following characteristics: peak time, entrainment frequency, peak value and mean value. For assessing "big five" personality traits, NEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PI-R) was used. No significant correlation between 40-Hz ASSR PLI or ERSP and "big five" personality traits was observed. Our results indicate that there is no dependence between 40-Hz ASSR entrainment and personality traits, demonstrating low individual 40-Hz variability in this domain. Our results support further development of 40-Hz ASSR as a neurophysiological marker allowing distinguishing between healthy population and patients with psychiatric disorders.

Intentional actions are essential to reach individual goals. In previous empirical studies, internally guided actions were predominantly related to functional responses in frontal and parietal areas. The aim of the present study was to distinguish event-related potentials and oscillatory responses of intentional actions and externally guided actions. In addition, we compared neurobiological findings of the decision which action to perform with those referring to the decision whether or not to perform an action. Methods: Twenty-eight subjects participated in adapted go/nogo paradigms, including a voluntary selection condition allowing participants to (1) freely decide whether to press the response button or (2) to decide whether they wanted to press the response button with the right index finger or the left index finger. Results: The reaction times were increased when participants freely decided whether and how they wanted to respond compared to the go condition. Intentional processes were associated with a fronto-centrally located N2 and P3 potential. N2 and P3 amplitudes were increased during intentional actions compared to instructed responses (go). In addition, increased activity in the alpha-, beta- and gamma-frequency range was shown during voluntary behavior rather than during externally guided responses. Conclusion: These results may indicate that an additional cognitive process is needed for intentional actions compared to instructed behavior. However, the neural responses were comparatively independent of the kind of decision that was made (1) decision which action to perform; (2) decision whether or not to perform an action). Significance: The study demonstrates the importance of fronto-central alpha-, beta-, and gamma oscillations for voluntary behavior.

There are no clinical trials or prospective reports validating the use of FR as characterized by electrocorticography (ECoG), to guide the scope of epilepsy surgery, and to inform prognosis thereafter. We set out to prospectively evaluate the utility of FR resection to predict postoperative epilepsy outcomes, and examine the feasibility of "live" intraoperative FR ascertainment. Methods: FR were prospectively reviewed in 30 consecutive pediatric cases including 11 reviewed "live" during surgery. Intraoperative ECoG studies were recorded at 2000 Hz sampling rate, interpreted conventionally to guide surgical resection, and visually inspected for FR. Seizure outcome was tallied for all 30 children. Results: Median age at surgery was 9.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4.7-13.2), median ECoG duration was 10.5 min (IQR 8.0-13.2), and median postoperative follow-up was 58.4 months (IQR 25.7-79.0). FR were identified in 24 of 30 ECoG studies. The incomplete resection of FR was strongly linked to postoperative seizures (hazard ratio 11.6, p = 0.005). "Live" ECoG review in the operating room to ascertain FR proved feasible and did not differ from conventional FR ascertainment. Significance:: In a prospective fashion, including "live" review, FR were detected in 80% of pediatric ECoG studies, and incomplete resection of FR cortex predicted postoperative seizures. These findings extend the notion that interictal FR are surrogate markers of the epileptogenic zone, and that their intraoperative localization could be used to inform prognosis and guide surgical resections in children.

Development of Activity in the Mouse Visual Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; mouse; spindle-burst; spontaneous activity	EARLY GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EARLY MOTOR-ACTIVITY; RAT BARREL CORTEX; CORTICAL CIRCUITS; RETINAL WAVES; DEVELOPING NEOCORTEX; SPINDLE BURSTS; NEONATAL-RAT; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ACTIVITY TRANSIENTS	A comprehensive developmental timeline of activity in the mouse cortex in vivo is lacking. Understanding the activity changes that accompany synapse and circuit formation is important to understand the mechanisms by which activity molds circuits and would help to identify critical checkpoints for normal development. To identify key principles of cortical activity maturation, we systematically tracked spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity with extracellular recordings of primary visual cortex (V1) in nonanesthetized mice. During the first postnatal week (postnatal days P4-P7), V1 was not visually responsive and exhibited long (>10 s) periods of network silence. Activation consisted exclusively of "slow-activity transients," 2-10 s periods of 6-10 Hz "spindle-burst' oscillations; the response to spontaneous retinal waves. By tracking daily changes in this activity, two key components of spontaneous activity maturation were revealed: (1) spindle-burst frequency acceleration (eventually becoming the 20-50 Hz broadband activity caused by the asynchronous state) and (2) "filling-in" of silent periods with low-frequency (2-4 Hz) activity (beginning on P10 and complete by P13). These two changes are sufficient to create the adult-like pattern of continuous activity, alternation between fast-asynchronous and slow-synchronous activity, by eye opening. Visual responses emerged on P8 as evoked spindle-bursts and neuronal firing with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than adult. Both were eliminated by eye opening, leaving only the mature, short-latency response. These results identify the developmental origins of mature cortical activity and implicate the period before eye opening as a critical checkpoint. By providing a systematic description of electrical activity development, we establish the murine visual cortex as a model for the electroencephalographic development of fetal humans.

Causal Role of Thalamic Interneurons in Brain State Transitions: A Study Using a Neural Mass Model Implementing Synaptic Kinetics	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Thalamic Interneurons; Neural mass model; neurological disorders; Kinetic model of synaptic transmission; alpha rhythms; theta rhythms; lateral geniculate nucleus	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; UNDERLYING SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL THALAMUS; INHIBITORY CIRCUITS; CELLULAR MECHANISMS; RELAY NEURONS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; DYNAMICS; CAT; CHANNELS	Experimental studies on the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) of mammals and rodents show that the inhibitory interneurons (IN) receive around 47.1% of their afferents from the retinal spiking neurons, and constitute around 2025% of the LGN cell population. However, there is a definite gap in knowledge about the role and impact of IN on thalamocortical dynamics in both experimental and model-based research. We use a neural mass computational model of the LGN with three neural populations viz. IN, thalamocortical relay (TCR), thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), to study the causality of IN on LGN oscillations and state-transitions. The synaptic information transmission in the model is implemented with kinetic modeling, facilitating the linking of low-level cellular attributes with high-level population dynamics. The model is parameterized and tuned to simulate alpha (813 Hz) rhythm that is dominant in both Local Field Potential (LFP) of LGN and electroencephalogram (EEG) of visual cortex in an awake resting state with eyes closed. The results show that: First, the response of the TRN is suppressed in the presence of IN in the circuit; disconnecting the IN from the circuit effects a dramatic change in the model output, displaying high amplitude synchronous oscillations within the alpha band in both TCR and TRN. These observations conform to experimental reports implicating the IN as the primary inhibitory modulator of LGN dynamics in a cognitive state, and that reduced cognition is achieved by suppressing the TRN response. Second, the model validates steady state visually evoked potential response in humans corresponding to periodic input stimuli; however, when the IN is disconnected from the circuit, the output power spectra do not reflect the input frequency. This agrees with experimental reports underpinning the role of IN in efficient retino-geniculate information transmission. Third, a smooth transition from alpha to theta band is observed by progressive decrease of neurotransmitter concentrations in the synaptic clefts; however, the transition is abrupt with removal of the IN circuitry in the model. The results imply a role of IN toward maintaining homeostasis in the LGN by suppressing any instability that may arise due to anomalous synaptic attributes.

The enhanced sensitivity has always been attributed to incipient cholinergic neuronal dysfunction, as a part of the normal aging process. The aim of the study was to correlate age-dependent pharmacodynamic neuro-physiologic effects of scopolamine after correcting for differences in individual exposure. MethodsWe applied a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling approach to describe individual exposure and neurocognitive effects of intravenous scopolamine administration in healthy subjects. ResultsA two-compartment linear kinetics model best described the plasma concentrations of scopolamine. The estimated scopolamine population mean apparent central and peripheral volume of distribution was 2.66 1.050l and 62.10 +/- 10.100l, respectively and the clearance was 1.09 +/- 0.096lmin(-1). Age was not related to a decrease of performance in the tests following scopolamine administration in older subjects. Only the saccadic peak velocity showed a positive correlation between age and sensitivity to scopolamine. Age was, however, correlated at baseline with an estimated slower reaction time while performing the cognitive tests and to higher global and frontal frequency bands measured with the surface EEG. ConclusionsMost of the differences in response to scopolamine administration between young and older subjects could be explained by pharmacokinetic differences (lower clearance) and not to an enhanced sensitivity when corrected for exposure levels.

Responses to brief electrical pulses mimic the physiological propagation of signals and manifest as cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEP). The first CCEP component is believed to reflect direct connectivity with the stimulated region but the stimulation artifact, a sharp deflection occurring during a few milliseconds, frequently contaminates it. New method: In order to recover the characteristics of early CCEP responses, we developed an artifact correction method based on electrical modeling of the electrode tissue interface. The biophysically motivated artifact templates are then regressed out of the recorded data as in any classical template-matching removal artifact methods. Results: Our approach is able to make the distinction between the physiological responses time-locked to the stimulation pulses and the non-physiological component. We tested the correction on simulated CCEP data in order to quantify its efficiency for different stimulation and recording parameters. We demonstrated the efficiency of the new correction method on simulations of single trial recordings for early responses contaminated with the stimulation artifact. The results highlight the importance of sampling frequency for an accurate analysis of CCEP. We then applied the approach to experimental data. Comparison with existing method: The Model-based template removal was compared to a correction based on the subtraction of the averaged artifact. Conclusions: This new correction method of stimulation artifact will enable investigators to better analyze early CCEP components and infer direct effective connectivity in future CCEP studies.

This study investigated whether possible effects of RF-EMF exposure differ between individuals. Objective: In a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled cross-over study possible effects of electromagnetic fields emitted by pulsed Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) 900 and Wideband Code-Division Multiple Access (WCDMA)/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (WCDMA/UMTS) devices on sleep were analysed. Methods: Thirty healthy young men (range 18-30 years) were exposed three times per exposure condition while their sleep was recorded. Sleep was evaluated according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine standard and eight basic sleep variables were considered. Results: Data analyses at the individual level indicate that RF-EMF effects are observed in 90% of the individuals and that all sleep variables are affected in at least four subjects. While sleep of participants was affected in various numbers, combinations of sleep variables and in different directions, showing improvements but also deteriorations, the only consistent finding was an increase of stage R sleep under GSM 900 MHz exposure (9 of 30 subjects) as well as under WCDMA/UMTS exposure (10 of 30 subjects). Conclusions: The results underline that sleep of individuals can be affected differently. The observations found here may indicate an underlying thermal mechanism of RF-EMF on human REM sleep. Nevertheless, the effect of an increase in stage R sleep in one third of the individuals does not necessarily indicate a disturbance of sleep. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The mechanisms underlying temporal variability of resting-state functional networks remain unclear. Using simultaneous EEG/functional MRI and functional MRI/DTI data, Zhang et al. identify the neural and anatomical basis of variability in regional functional architecture, and reveal disease-specific changes. The findings shed light on the dynamic organization of normal and disordered brain networks.Functional brain networks demonstrate significant temporal variability and dynamic reconfiguration even in the resting state. Currently, most studies investigate temporal variability of brain networks at the scale of single (micro) or whole-brain (macro) connectivity. However, the mechanism underlying time-varying properties remains unclear, as the coupling between brain network variability and neural activity is not readily apparent when analysed at either micro or macroscales. We propose an intermediate (meso) scale analysis and characterize temporal variability of the functional architecture associated with a particular region. This yields a topography of variability that reflects the whole-brain and, most importantly, creates an analytical framework to establish the fundamental relationship between variability of regional functional architecture and its neural activity or structural connectivity. We find that temporal variability reflects the dynamical reconfiguration of a brain region into distinct functional modules at different times and may be indicative of brain flexibility and adaptability. Primary and unimodal sensory-motor cortices demonstrate low temporal variability, while transmodal areas, including heteromodal association areas and limbic system, demonstrate the high variability. In particular, regions with highest variability such as hippocampus/parahippocampus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, olfactory gyrus and caudate are all related to learning, suggesting that the temporal variability may indicate the level of brain adaptability. With simultaneously recorded electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging/diffusion tensor imaging data, we also find that variability of regional functional architecture is modulated by local blood oxygen level-dependent activity and alpha-band oscillation, and is governed by the ratio of intra- to inter-community structural connectivity. Application of the mesoscale variability measure to multicentre datasets of three mental disorders and matched controls involving 1180 subjects reveals that those regions demonstrating extreme, i.e. highest/lowest variability in controls are most liable to change in mental disorders. Specifically, we draw attention to the identification of diametrically opposing patterns of variability changes between schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/autism. Regions of the default-mode network demonstrate lower variability in patients with schizophrenia, but high variability in patients with autism/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, compared with respective controls. In contrast, subcortical regions, especially the thalamus, show higher variability in schizophrenia patients, but lower variability in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The changes in variability of these regions are also closely related to symptom scores. Our work provides insights into the dynamic organization of the resting brain and how it changes in brain disorders. The nodal variability measure may also be potentially useful as a predictor for learning and neural rehabilitation.

However, it is non-trivial to identify multiregion dynamics at fast sub-second time-scales in electrophysiological data. We propose a method that, with no knowledge of any task timings, can simultaneously identify and describe fast transient multiregion dynamics in terms of their temporal, spectral and spatial properties. The approach models brain activity using a discrete set of sequential states, with each state distinguished by its own multiregion spectral properties. This can identify potentially very short-lived visits to a brain state, at the same time as inferring the state's properties, by pooling over many repeated visits to that state. We show how this can be used to compute state-specific measures such as power spectra and coherence. We demonstrate that this can be used to identify short-lived transient brain states with distinct power and functional connectivity (e.g., coherence) properties in an MEG data set collected during a volitional motor task.

By combining electrophysiological recordings, optogenetics, and pharmacology, we dissected the contribution of the mGlu7 receptor at mouse thalamic synapses. We found that mGlu7 is functionally expressed at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, where it can inhibit neurotransmission and regulate short-term plasticity. These effects depend on the PDZ-ligand of the receptor, as they are lost in mutant mice. Interestingly, the very low affinity of mGlu7 receptors for glutamate raises the question of how it can be activated, namely at GABAergic synapses and in basal conditions. Inactivation of the receptor activity with the mGlu7 negative allosteric modulator (NAM), ADX71743, enhances thalamic synaptic transmission. In vivo administration of the NAM induces a lethargic state with spindle and/or spike and -wave discharges accompanied by a behavioral arrest typical of absence epileptic seizures. This provides evidence for mGlu7 receptor -mediated tonic modulation of a physiological function in vivo preventing synchronous and potentially pathological oscillations.

Direction of information flow in large-scale resting-state networks is frequency-dependent	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						information flow; phase transfer entropy; resting-state networks; magnetoencephalography; atlas-based beamforming	PHASE-LAG INDEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; MEG; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA; INTEGRATION; FEEDFORWARD	Normal brain function requires interactions between spatially separated, and functionally specialized, macroscopic regions, yet the directionality of these interactions in large-scale functional networks is unknown. Magnetoencephalography was used to determine the directionality of these interactions, where directionality was inferred from time series of beamformer-reconstructed estimates of neuronal activation, using a recently proposed measure of phase transfer entropy. We observed well-organized posterior-to-anterior patterns of information flow in the higher-frequency bands (alpha1, alpha2, and beta band), dominated by regions in the visual cortex and posterior default mode network. Opposite patterns of anterior-to-posterior flow were found in the theta band, involving mainly regions in the frontal lobe that were sending information to a more distributed network. Many strong information senders in the theta band were also frequent receivers in the alpha2 band, and vice versa. Our results provide evidence that large-scale resting-state patterns of information flow in the human brain form frequency-dependent reentry loops that are dominated by flow from parieto-occipital cortex to integrative frontal areas in the higher-frequency bands, which is mirrored by a theta band anterior-to-posterior flow.

Crucially, the efficient motor control of the articulators relies on the accurate anticipation of the somatosensory reafference. Nevertheless, evidence about somatosensory activities elicited by auditory speech processing is sparse. The present work looked for specific interactions between auditory speech presentation and somatosensory cortical information processing. We used an auditory speech identification task with sounds having different place of articulation (bilabials and dentals). We tested whether coupling the auditory task with a peripheral electrical stimulation of the lips would affect the pattern of sensorimotor electroencephalographic rhythms. Peripheral electrical stimulation elicits a series of spectral perturbations of which the beta rebound reflects the return-to-baseline stage of somatosensory processing. We show a left-lateralized and selective reduction in the beta rebound following lip somatosensory stimulation when listening to speech sounds produced with the lips (i.e. bilabials). Thus, the somatosensory processing could not return to baseline due to the recruitment of the same neural resources by speech stimuli. Our results are a clear demonstration that heard speech sounds are somatotopically mapped onto somatosensory cortices, according to place of articulation.

Eyes Open on Sleep and Wake: In Vivo to In Silico Neural Networks	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; PROLONGED WAKEFULNESS; SYNAPTIC HOMEOSTASIS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; BRAIN RESPONSES; LOCAL SLEEP; SLOW WAVES; PLASTICITY; EEG	Functional and effective connectivity of cortical areas are essential for normal brain function under different behavioral states. Appropriate cortical activity during sleep and wakefulness is ensured by the balanced activity of excitatory and inhibitory circuits. Ultimately, fast, millisecond cortical rhythmic oscillations shape cortical function in time and space. On a much longer time scale, brain function also depends on prior sleep-wake history and circadian processes. However, much remains to be established on how the brain operates at the neuronal level in humans during sleep and wakefulness. A key limitation of human neuroscience is the difficulty in isolating neuronal excitation/inhibition drive in vivo. Therefore, computational models are noninvasive approaches of choice to indirectly access hidden neuronal states. In this review, we present a physiologically driven in silico approach, Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), as a means to comprehend brain function under different experimental paradigms. Importantly, DCM has allowed for the understanding of how brain dynamics underscore brain plasticity, cognition, and different states of consciousness. In a broader perspective, noninvasive computational approaches, such as DCM, may help to puzzle out the spatial and temporal dynamics of human brain function at different behavioural states.

This work was aimed at investigating the mechanisms by which selective attention to spatial frequency (SF) mediates global and local perception in general and how these perceptual levels are integrated with the shapes that define them. The experiments demonstrate that attention to global and local aspects of a hierarchical display biases the flexible selection of relatively lower and relatively higher SFs during image processing. Additionally, attentional selection of SF allows for the shapes in a hierarchical display to be integrated with the level (global/local) at which they occur. The studies reviewed here provide strong evidence that the flexible, top-down selection of low-level SF channels mediates the perception of global and local elements of visual displays. The studies also support a hemisphere asymmetry in this process, with right hemisphere functions biased toward global perception and left hemisphere functions biased toward local.

Clock genes play an important role in the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms but are also involved in regulating sleep homeostasis. The lateral habenular nucleus (LHb) has been implicated in sleep-wake regulation, since LHb gene expression demonstrates circadian oscillation characteristics. This study focuses on the participation of LHb clock genes in regulating sleep homeostasis, as the nature of their involvement is unclear. In this study, we observed changes in sleep pattern following sleep deprivation in LHb-lesioned rats using EEG recording techniques. And then the changes of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, and Bmal1) in the LHb after 6 hours of sleep deprivation were detected by using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). We found that sleep deprivation increased the length of Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREMS) and decreased wakefulness. LHb-lesioning decreased the amplitude of reduced wake time and increased NREMS following sleep deprivation in rats. qPCR results demonstrated that Per2 expression was elevated after sleep deprivation, while the other two genes were unaffected. Following sleep recovery, Per2 expression was comparable to the control group. This study provides the basis for further research on the role of LHb Per2 gene in the regulation of sleep homeostasis.

Description of Ictal HFO Mapping in Patients with Both Temporal and Extratemporal Seizure Focus	NEUROLOGY RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EEG; EPILEPSY	Objective. Review presurgical use of ictal HFO mapping to detect ictal activation areas with dual seizure focus in both the temporal and extratemporal cortex. Methods. Review of consecutive patients admitted to the University of South Alabama Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (SouthCEP) between January 2014 and October 2015, with suspected temporal lobe epilepsy and intracranial electrode recording. Ictal HFO localization was displayed in 3D reconstructed brain images using the patient's own coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) with the implanted electrodes. Results. Four of fifteen patients showed evidence of extratemporal involvement at the onset of the clinical seizures. Ictal HFO mapping involving both frontal and temporal lobe changed the surgical resection areas in three patients where the initial surgical plan included only the temporal lobe. Resection of the ictal HFO at the onset of the seizure and the initial propagation region was associated with seizure freedom in all patients; follow-up period ranged from 12 to 25 months. Significance. Extratemporal ictal involvement may not have clinical manifestations and may account for surgical failure in temporal lobe epilepsy. Ictal HFO mapping is useful to define the ictal cortical network and may help detect an extratemporal focus.

Interictal spikes during sleep are an early defect in the Tg2576 mouse model of beta-amyloid neuropathology	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; A-BETA; HIPPOCAMPAL HYPERACTIVITY; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; CHOLINERGIC NEURONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURES; PLAQUES; MEMORY	It has been suggested that neuronal hyperexcitability contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD), so we asked how hyperexcitability develops in a common mouse model of beta-amyloid neuropathology - Tg2576 mice. Using video-EEG recordings, we found synchronized, large amplitude potentials resembling interictal spikes (IIS) in epilepsy at just 5 weeks of age, long before memory impairments or eta-amyloid deposition. Seizures were not detected, but they did occur later in life, suggesting that IIS are possibly the earliest stage of hyperexcitability. Interestingly, IIS primarily occurred during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, which is notable because REM is associated with increased cholinergic tone and cholinergic impairments are implicated in AD. Although previous studies suggest that cholinergic antagonists would worsen pathophysiology, the muscarinic antagonist atropine reduced IIS frequency. In addition, we found IIS occurred in APP51 mice which overexpress wild type (WT)-APP, although not as uniformly or as early in life as Tg2576 mice. Taken together with results from prior studies, the data suggest that surprising and multiple mechanisms contribute to hyperexcitability. The data also suggest that IIS may be a biomarker for early detection of AD.

Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals were recorded using a 148-channel whole-head magnetometer in 13 patients with ADHD (range: 8-12 years) and 14 control subjects (range: 8-13 years). Three complementary measures (coherence, phase-locking value, and Euclidean distance) were calculated in the conventional MEG frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Our results showed that the interactions among MEG channels are higher for ADHD patients than for control subjects in all frequency bands. Statistically significant differences were observed for short-distance values within right-anterior and central regions, especially at delta, beta, and gamma-frequency bands (P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test with false discovery rate correction). These frequency bands also showed statistically significant differences in long-distance interactions, mainly among anterior and central regions, as well as among anterior, central, and other areas. These differences might reflect alterations during brain development in children with ADHD. Our results support the role of frontal abnormalities in ADHD pathophysiology, which may reflect a delay in cortical maturation in the frontal cortex.

However, the brain processes associated with the perception of limb ownership, a key correlate of MT, are unknown. Objective: To examine whether transient perceptions of limb ownership together with associated neural activity can be elucidated using a purpose-developed mirror reflection task combined with electrophysiological (EEG) measures and cutting-edge analyses. Methods: Brain activity was measured online using EEG in 20 healthy controls while they produced opening-closing movements of one hand in control conditions or while viewing the mirror reflection of the movements. The key experimental condition required participants to make a foot pedal response whenever a change in perception of ownership (of a mirror-reflected limb) occurred (Mirror condition). Control conditions and a strict epoching regime were employed using standard subtractive logic to isolate the perception of limb ownership (which was further verified by self-reports). Results: Data from 15 participants were suitable for complete analysis; the remaining reported no experience of ownership. Significant spectral power increases were found in central-parietal regions in association with perceptions of ownership, with the most prominent effect specific to the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) measured at the right parietal area. Source localization analyses further identified brain networks associated with the mirror reflection condition in the alpha frequency (parietal lobe) and the beta frequency (middle temporal areas). These were distinct from localized networks associated with the foot pedal response. Conclusion: Transient perceptions of ownership can be captured experimentally, and are associated with localized sites of neural activation. This is an initial step toward eventual development of therapeutic targets for interventions including brain computer interfaces (BCIs) aimed at ameliorating the negative effects associated with impaired or missing limbs.

Shift in interictal relative gamma power as a novel biomarker for drug response in two mouse models of absence epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						stargazer; tottering; Interneurons; NMDA receptors; Parvalbumin	FAST-SPIKING INTERNEURONS; CHANNEL MUTANT MICE; HIGH-FREQUENCY; FEEDFORWARD INHIBITION; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; STARGAZER MICE; SEIZURES; EEG; HZ; CARBAMAZEPINE	Objective: Two monogenic mouse models of childhood absence epilepsy, stargazer and tottering, differ strikingly in their response to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade. We sought to evaluate the change in interictal relative gamma power as a reliable biomarker for this gene-linked antiepileptic drug (AED) response. Methods: The effects of AEDs on absolute and relative (to the total) power of frequencies between 2 and 300 Hz were analyzed within the interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) and correlated with antiseizure efficacy in awake behaving stargazer, tottering, and wild-type (WT) littermate control mice. Results: At baseline, we found a significant absolute as well as relative augmentation of 16-41 Hz power in stargazer compared to both tottering and WT mice. In stargazer, the NMDA receptor-antagonist MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) paradoxically exacerbates absence seizures but normalizes the augmented beta/gamma band of power to WT levels, suggesting that the elevation in 16- to 41-Hz power is an NMDA receptor-mediated network property. In contrast, ethosuximide (200 mg/kg) and 4-aminopyridine (2.5 mg/kg) reduce seizure activity and increase relative power within the gamma range in both stargazer and tottering mice. Intraperitoneal saline injection had no significant effect on either seizure frequency or relative gamma power. Along with results using carbamazepine and flupirtine, there was a strong inverse relationship between relative change in seizure duration and change in peak relative gamma power (r(2) = 0.726). Significance: In these two models of absence epilepsy, drugs that reduce relative gamma power are associated with an increase in seizures, whereas drugs that augment relative gamma power reduce seizures. Therefore, drug-induced modulation of relative gamma power may serve as a biomarker for AED efficacy in absence epilepsy. Given the relationship between gamma power and fast-spiking interneurons, these results also suggest that a drug's effect may in part be determined by its impact on specific inhibitory networks.

An emerging therapeutic modality for seizure suppression is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Despite being considered a safe technique, rTMS carries the risk of inducing seizures, among other milder adverse events, and thus, its safety in the population with epilepsy should be continuously assessed. We performed an updated systematic review on the safety and tolerability of rTMS in patients with epilepsy, similar to a previous report published in 2007 (Bae EH, Schrader LM, Machii K, Alonso-Alonso M, Riviello IL Pascual -Leone A, Rotenberg A. Safety and tolerability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with epilepsy: a review of the literature. Epilepsy Behay. 2007; 10 (4): 521-8), and estimated the risk of seizures and other ad Seizure verse events during or shortly after rTMS application. We searched the literature for reports of rTMS being apSafcty plied on patients with epilepsy, with no time or language restrictions, and obtained studies published from January 1990 to August 2015.A total of 46 publications were identified, of which 16 were new studies published after the previous safety review of 2007. We noted the total number of subjects with epilepsy undergoing rTMS, medication usage, incidence of adverse events, and rTMS protocol parameters: frequency, intensity, total number of stimuli, train duration, intertrain intervals, coil type, and stimulation site. Our main data analysis included separate calculations for crude per subject risk of seizure and other adverse events, as well as risk per 1000 stimuli. We also performed an exploratory, secondary analysis on the risk of seizure and other adverse events according to the type of coil used (figure -of -S or circular), stimulation frequency 1 Hz or >1 Hz), pulse intensity in terms of motor threshold (<100% or> 100%), and number of stimuli per session (<500 or> 500). Presence or absence of adverse events was reported in 40 studies (n 426 subjects). A total of 78 (18.3%) subjects reported adverse events, of which 85% were mild. Headache or dizziness was the most common one, occurring in 8.9%. We found a crude per subject seizure risk of 2.9% (95% Cl: 1.3-4.5), given that 12 subjects reported seizures out of 410 subjects included in the analysis after data of patients with epilepsia partialis continua or status epilepticus were excluded from the estimate. Only one of the reported seizures was considered atypical in terms of the clinical characteristics of the patients baseline seizures. The atypical seizure happened during high frequencyrTMS with maximum stimulator output for speech arrest, clinically arising from the region of stimulation. Although we estimated a larger crude per subject seizure risk compared with the previous safety review, the corresponding confidence intervals contained both risks. Furthermore, the exclusive case of atypical seizure was the same as reported in the previous report We conclude that the risk of seizure induction in patients with epilepsy undergoing rTMS is small and that the risk of other adverse events is similar to that of rTMS applied to other conditions and to healthy subjects. Our results should be interpreted with caution, given the need for adjusted analysis controlling for potential confounders, such as baseline seizure frequency. The similarity between the safely profiles of rTMS applied to the population with epilepsy and to individuals without epilepsy supports further investigation of rTMS as a therapy for seizure suppression.

Though emotional signals are often conveyed by multiple modalities, how emotional changes in vocal and facial modalities integrate into a unified percept has yet to be directly investigated. To address this issue, we asked participants to detect emotional changes delivered by facial, vocal and facial-vocal expressions while behavioral responses and electroencephalogram were recorded. Behavioral results showed that bimodal emotional changes were detected with higher accuracy and shorter response latencies compared with each unimodal condition. Moreover, the detection of emotional change, regardless of modalities, was associated with enhanced amplitudes in the N2 and P3 component, as well as greater theta synchronization. More importantly, the P3 amplitudes and theta synchronization were larger for the bimodal emotional change condition than for the sum of the two unimodal conditions. The superadditive responses in P3 amplitudes and theta synchronization were both positively correlated with the magnitude of the bimodal superadditivity in accuracy. These behavioral and electrophysiological data consistently illustrated an effect of audiovisual integration during the detection of emotional changes, which is most likely mediated by the P3 activity and theta oscillations in brain responses.

It involves a mapping from continuous acoustic waveforms onto the discrete phonological units computed to store words in the mental lexicon. In this article, we review the magnetoencephalographic studies that have explored the timing and morphology of the Ni m component to investigate how vowels and consonants are computed and represented within the auditory cortex. The neurons that are involved in the Nlm act to construct a sensory memory of the stimulus due to spatially and temporally distributed activation patterns within the auditory cortex. Indeed, localization of auditory fields maps in animals and humans suggested two levels of sound coding, a tonotopy dimension for spectral properties and a tonochrony dimension for temporal properties of sounds. When the stimulus is a complex speech sound, tonotopy and tonochrony data may give important information to assess whether the speech sound parsing and decoding are generated by pure bottom-up reflection of acoustic differences or whether they are additionally affected by top-down processes related to phonological categories. Hints supporting pure bottom-up processing coexist with hints supporting top-down abstract phoneme representation. Actually. N1 m data (amplitude, latency, source generators, and hemispheric distribution) are limited and do not help to disentangle the issue. The nature of these limitations is discussed. Moreover, neurophysiological studies on animals and neuroimaging studies on humans have been taken into consideration. We compare also the N1m findings with the investigation of the magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) component and with the analogous electrical components, the N1 and the MMN. We conclude that N1 seems more sensitive to capture lateralization and hierarchical processes than N1 m, although the data are very preliminary. Finally, we suggest that MEG data should be integrated with EEG data in the light of the neural oscillations framework	[Manca, Anna Dora; Grimaldi, Mirko] Univ Salento, Ctr Ric Interdisciplinare Linguaggio, Dipartimento Studi Umanistici, Lecce, Italy; [Manca, Anna Dora; Grimaldi, Mirko] Lab Diffuso Ric Interdisciplinare Applicata, Lecce, Italy		Grimaldi, M (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Ctr Ric Interdisciplinare Linguaggio, Dipartimento Studi Umanistici, Lecce, Italy.; Grimaldi, M (corresponding author), Lab Diffuso Ric Interdisciplinare Applicata, Lecce, Italy.	mirko.grimaldi@unisalento.it		Grimaldi, Mirko/0000-0002-0940-3645	Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research [PRIN 20128YAFKB_006]	Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))	We thank Francesco Sigona for the technical assistance in developing some of the Figures and Bianca Sisinni for providing us the data for the Figure 2.

J	Zizlsperger, L; Kummel, F; Haarmeier, T				Zizlsperger, Leopold; Kuemmel, Florian; Haarmeier, Thomas			Metacognitive Confidence Increases with, but Does Not Determine, Visual Perceptual Learning	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; BAND EEG ACTIVITY; MOTION PERCEPTION; OSCILLATIONS; DECISION; COHERENCE; FEEDBACK; PHASE; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE	While perceptual learning increases objective sensitivity, the effects on the constant interaction of the process of perception and its metacognitive evaluation have been rarely investigated. Visual perception has been described as a process of probabilistic inference featuring metacognitive evaluations of choice certainty. For visual motion perception in healthy, naive human subjects here we show that perceptual sensitivity and confidence in it increased with training. The metacognitive sensitivity-estimated from certainty ratings by a bias-free signal detection theoretic approach-in contrast, did not. Concomitant 3Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) was applied in compliance with previous findings on effective high-low cross-frequency coupling subserving signal detection. While perceptual accuracy and confidence in it improved with training, there were no statistically significant tACS effects. Neither metacognitive sensitivity in distinguishing between their own correct and incorrect stimulus classifications, nor decision confidence itself determined the subjects' visual perceptual learning. Improvements of objective performance and the metacognitive confidence in it were rather determined by the perceptual sensitivity at the outset of the experiment. Post-decision certainty in visual perceptual learning was neither independent of objective performance, nor requisite for changes in sensitivity, but rather covaried with objective performance. The exact functional role of metacognitive confidence in human visual perception has yet to be determined.

As there exist differences in the conductivity over frequency between blood, ischemic cortical tissue and normal cortical tissue, MFEIT has potential application in the detection of acute stroke. However, because the conductivity distribution of the human head is highly inhomogeneous and the conductivities of normal head tissue and stroke lesion tissue both change with frequency, the anomaly and normal head tissues are often mixed together in the reconstructed image, which makes it difficult to discern the anomaly. Here we present a spectral decomposition frequency-difference (SD-FD) imaging algorithm in an attempt to address this issue: firstly, we reconstruct so-called EIT spectral images according to the conductivity spectra of tissues; secondly, we obtain the EIT image of the anomaly from the spectral images by using independent component analysis. The results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of detecting the anomaly in a numerical head phantom, as well as in a realistic human head tank with frequency-dependent and heterogeneous conductivities distribution. The proposed SD-FD algorithm may support MFEIT use for human stroke imaging in the future.

However, for proper interpretation, it is important to know whether these measures depend on stimulus/behavioral conditions or the reference scheme used to analyze data. We recorded local field potential (LFP) from an array of microelectrodes chronically implanted in area V1 of monkeys under different stimulus/behavioral conditions and computed PSD slopes, coherence, and phase difference between LFPs as a function of frequency and interelectrode distance while using four reference schemes: single wire, average, bipolar, and current source density. PSD slopes were dependent on reference scheme at low frequencies (below 200 Hz) but became invariant at higher frequencies. Average phase differences between sites also depended critically on referencing, switching from 0 degrees for single-wire to 180 degrees for average reference. Results were consistent across different stimulus/behavioral conditions. We were able to account for these results based on the coherence profile across sites and properties of the spectral estimator. Our results show that using different reference schemes can have drastic effects on phase differences and PSD slopes and therefore must be interpreted carefully to gain insights about network properties.

Many BCI implementations are based on the recognition of task-specific event-related potentials (ERP) such as P300 responses. However, because of the high signal-to-noise ratio in noninvasive brain recordings, reliable detection of single trial ERPs is challenging. Furthermore, the relevant signal is often heterogeneously distributed over several channels. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for recognizing a sequence of attended events from multi-channel brain recordings. The framework utilizes spatial filtering to reduce both noise and signal space considerably. We introduce different models that can be used to construct the spatial filter and evaluate the approach using magnetoencephalography (MEG) data involving P300 responses, recorded during a BCI experiment. Compared to the accuracy achieved in the BCI experiment performed without spatial filtering, the recognition rate increased significantly to up to 95.3% on average (SD: 5.3%). In combination with the data-driven spatial filter construction we introduce here, our framework represents a powerful method to reliably recognize a sequence of brain potentials from high-density electrophysiological data, which could greatly improve the control of BCIs.

Interference effects are typically investigated using classical paradigms like the Flanker and Simon task. The sources of interference for Flanker and Simon effect are known to be different and according to dual process accounts, two distinct functional pathways are involved in resolving these types of interference. It is an open question how far these sources of interference are related to each other and interact. We investigated this question in a system neurophysiological study utilizing a hybrid paradigm combining both Flanker effect-like and Simon effect-like features. We focus on event-related theta oscillations and use beamforming methods to examine functional neuroanatomical networks. The results show that Simon and Flanker interference interacted in a non-additive fashion by modulating theta band activity, probably reflecting the recruitment of cognitive control processes. Beamforming source reconstruction revealed that theta band activity was related to a broad neuronal network comprising prefrontal and cerebellar regions, including the MFG, SFG, IFG, and SMA. These regions were connected to interference processing and conflict resolution, but differed in the amount of specificity for different sources of interference. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Sleep Spindles Characteristics in Insomnia Sufferers and Their Relationship with Sleep Misperception	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Article							PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INSOMNIA; BRAIN RHYTHMS; K-COMPLEXES; NREM SLEEP; EEG; EPIDEMIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; DEPRIVATION; VALIDATION; INVENTORY	Cortical hyperarousal is higher in insomnia sufferers (INS) than in good sleepers (GS) and could be related to an alteration in sleep protection mechanisms, like reduced density or altered characteristics in sleep spindles. The deficient sleep protection mechanisms might in turn enhance underestimation of sleep. This study's objective was to document sleep spindles characteristics in INS compared with GS and to investigate their potential role in sleep consolidation and misperception. Seventeen individuals with paradoxical insomnia (PARA-I), 24 individuals with psychophysiological insomnia (PSY-I), and 29 GS completed four consecutive polysomnographic nights in laboratory. Sleep spindles were detected automatically during stage 2 and SWS (3-4) on night 3. Number, density, duration, frequency, and amplitude of sleep spindles were calculated. A misperception index was used to determine the degree of discrepancy between subjective and objective total sleep times. Kruskal-Wallis.. tests and post hoc tests revealed that PARA-I had significantly shorter sleep spindles than GS but that PSY-I and GS did not differ on spindles length. A standard multiple regression model revealed that neither sleep spindles characteristics nor objective sleep measures were predictive of sleep misperception. A longer duration of spindles could reflect a higher gating process but this hypothesis still needs to be confirmed in replication studies.

Localization of visual SSRs normally shows a very focal modulation of power in visual cortex and led to the treatment and interpretation of SSRs as a local phenomenon. Given the brain network dynamics, we hypothesized that SSRs have additional large-scale effects on the brain functional network that can be revealed by means of graph theory. We used rhythmic visual stimulation at a range of frequencies (4-30 Hz), recorded MEG and investigated source level connectivity across the whole brain. Using graph theoretical measures we observed a frequency unspecific reduction of global density in the alpha band "disconnecting" visual cortex from the rest of the network. Also, a frequency-specific increase of connectivity between occipital cortex and precuneus was found at the stimulation frequency that exhibited the highest resonance (30 Hz). In conclusion, we showed that SSRs dynamically reorganized the brain functional network. These large-scale effects should be taken into account not only when attempting to explain the nature of SSRs, but also when used in various experimental designs. (C) 2016 The Authors.

It has been hypothesized that cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between different frequency bands is the carrier mechanism for the coordination of global and local neural processes and hence supports the distributed information processing in the brain. In the present study, we attempt to study the dynamic evolution of CFC at resting-state and during a mental task. The concept of CFC microstates (CFC mu states) is introduced as emerged short-lived patterns of CFC. We analyzed dynamic CFC (dCFC) at resting-state and during a comparison task by adopting a phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator for [delta phase-gamma-amplitude] coupling at every sensor. Modifying a well-established framework for mining brain dynamics, we show that a small sized repertoire of CFCstates can be derived so as to encapsulate connectivity variations and further provide novel insights into network's functional reorganization. By analyzing the transition dynamics among CFC mu states, in both tasks, we provided a clear evidence about intrinsic networks that may play a crucial role in information integration.

Sleep deprivation dampens brain energy metabolism and impairs cognitive functions. Intriguingly, sleep fragmentation, despite normal total sleep duration, has a similar cognitive impact, and in this paper we ask the question of whether it may also impair brain energy metabolism. To this end, we used a recently developed mouse model of 2 weeks of sleep fragmentation and measured 2-deoxy-glucose uptake and glycogen, glucose and lactate concentration in different brain regions. In order to homogenize mice behaviour during metabolic measurements, we exposed them to a novel environment for 1 h. Using an intra-hippocampal electrode, we first showed that hippocampal electroencephalograph (EEG) response to exploration was unaltered by 1 or 14 days of sleep fragmentation. However, after 14 days, sleep fragmented mice exhibited a lower uptake of 2-deoxy-glucose in cortex and hippocampus and lower cortical lactate levels than control mice. Our results suggest that long-term sleep fragmentation impaired brain metabolism to a similar extent as total sleep deprivation without affecting the neuronal responsiveness of hippocampus to a novel environment.

Status epilepticus is a neurological emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. This study describes the clinical profile, treatment, and predictors of outcome of status epilepticus in a tertiary referral centre in a developing country and aims to highlight the similarities and differences from data available from the western world. Methods. A retrospective analysis of data of patients treated for status epilepticus was conducted from prospectively maintained records, between January 2000 and September 2010. The demographic data, clinical profile and investigations (including neuroimaging and EEG), aetiology, treatment, and outcomes were studied and compared with data available from the western world. Results. The analysis included 108 events in 84 patients. A single episode of status epilepticus was treated in 72 patients (86%) and multiple status epilepticus events, ranging from two to six per patient, were managed in 12 patients (14%). Mean age was 24.1 +/- 20.3 years and 63% were males. The types of status epilepticus included convulsive status in 98 (90.7%), non-convulsive status in seven (6.5%), and myoclonic status in three (2.8%). The majority of events (60%) were remote symptomatic, 16% were acute symptomatic, 16% were of unexplained aetiology, and 8% were progressive symptomatic. In 85 events (79%), status epilepticus could be aborted with first and second-line drugs. The remaining 23 events (21%) progressed to refractory status epilepticus, among which, 13 (56%) were controlled with continuous intravenous midazolam infusion. Case fatality rate was 11%, neurological sequelae were reported in 22%, and 67% returned to baseline. Acute symptomatic status, older age, altered sensorium at the time of admission, and delayed hospitalisation were predictors of poor outcome. Conclusions. Aetiologywas the most important determinant of outcome of status epilepticus, as in reports from the western world, with remote symptomatic aetiology secondary to gliosis being the most common. Treatment delay was frequent and adversely affected the outcome.

Subsequently, the Talairach methodology was adopted at a number of additional centers in Europe and Canada. Technical aspects remained essentially unchanged for the following 30 years. Only in the last two decades, because of advancements in image-guided surgery systems, robotics, and computer-aided planning, use of SEEG has become more widespread, and reports describing these new developments have been published. Objectives: This systematic review was designed to assess published reports of SEEG surgical techniques and safety profile. Data sources: An electronic search was performed of Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases. In addition, the content pages of several standard epilepsy surgery textbooks were searched. Full-text English studies describing SEEG surgical technique or pertinent epidemiological data were included. Conference abstracts, reviews, posters, editorials, comments, and letters were excluded. Results: Three hundred fifty-nine of 2,903 potentially eligible studies published by 32 centers were reviewed. Thirty-one of these primarily discussed the surgical technique. Thirty-five major complications (including 4 fatalities) were reported among 4,000 patients (0.8%) implanted with 33,000 electrodes. Limitations: The number of SEEG patients is likely to be underestimated because only a few groups have exhaustively reported their experience. Moreover, it is possible that a number of teams performing SEEG have not published studies on the topic. Conclusions: Rigorous SEEG, thanks to its basic principles and updated technologies, is a safe and accurate method to define the epileptogenic zone by means of stereotactically implanted intracerebral electrodes.

Although these processes have been separately studied in young and old adults, little is known about the age-related changes in PMBS during selective inhibitory control (i.e. stop a part of an action). The present study examines the age-related modulations of PMBS associated with sensory reafferences and inhibitory processes in selective inhibitory control. Young (n = 17) and old (n = 13) participants performed a switching task first engaging bimanual finger tapping then requiring to stop the left while maintaining the right unimanual tapping (i.e. selective inhibition) at an imperative stimulus. Age groups were compared on behavioral (mean, variability and percentage of errors of inter-tap interval during and after the switching) and electrophysiological (time-frequency and source estimations in the 14-30 Hz beta frequency range) data time-locked on the imperative stimulus. Behaviorally, old adults showed larger variability and percentage of errors during the switching but performed as well as young adults after the switching. Electrophysiologically, PMBS significantly increased after the switching in the old compared to the young group within bilateral frontal and parietal areas. Our results show that the effort to maintain selective inhibition involves increased brain activation in old compared to young adults. The larger PMBS within frontal and parietal regions in old adults may reflect an age-related brain compensation enabling to efficiently maintain post-switching inhibition.

In schizophrenia, perception and cognition are impaired. Aberrant gating of irrelevant sensory information, which has been related to altered oscillatory neural activity, presumably contributes to these impairments. However, the link between schizophrenia symptoms and sensory gating deficits, as reflected in oscillatory activity, is not clear. In this electroencephalography study, we used a paired-stimulus paradigm to investigate frequency-resolved oscillatory activity in 22 schizophrenia patients and 22 healthy controls. We found sensory gating deficits in patients compared to controls, as reflected in reduced gamma-band power and alpha-band phase synchrony difference between the first and the second auditory stimulus. We correlated these markers of neural activity with a five-factor model of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Gamma-band power sensory gating was positively correlated with positive symptoms. Moreover, alpha-band phase synchrony sensory gating was negatively correlated with negative symptoms. A cluster analysis revealed three schizophrenia phenotypes, characterized by (i) aberrant gamma-band power and high positive symptoms, (ii) aberrant alpha band phase synchrony, low positive, and low negative symptom scores or (iii) by intact sensory gating and high negative symptoms. Our study demonstrates that aberrant neural synchronization, as reflected in gamma-band power and alpha-band phase synchrony, relates to the schizophrenia psychopathology. Different schizophrenia phenotypes express distinct levels of positive and negative symptoms as well as varying degrees of aberrant oscillatory neural activity. Identifying the individual phenotype might improve therapeutic interventions in schizophrenia.

Due to the review character of the presentation a high overlap to the above mentioned contributions is unavoidable. When analysing cognition, it is often useful to combine information from various modalities (see e.g. Biessmann et al., 2011, Sui et al., 2012). In BCI recently multimodal fusion concepts have received great attention under the label hybrid BCI (Pfurtscheller et al., 2010, Muller-Putz et al. 2015, Dahne et al. 2015, Fazli et al. 2015) or as data analysis technique for extracting (non-) linear relations between data (see e.g. Biessmann et al., 2010, Biessmann et al., 2011, Fazli et al., 2009, 2011, 2012, Dahne et al., 2013, 2014a,b, 2015, Winkler et al. 2015). They are rooted in the modern machine learning and signal processing techniques that are now available for analysing EEG, for decoding mental states etc. (see Muller et al. 2008, Bunau et al. 2009, Tomioka and Muller, 2010, Blankertz et al., 2008, 2011, Lemm et al., 2011, Porbadnigk et al. 2015 for recent reviews and contributions to Machine Learning for BCI, see Samek et al. 2014 for a review on robust methods). Note that fusing information has also been a very common practice in the sciences and engineering (Waltz and Llinas, 1990). The talk will discuss a number of recent contributions from the BBCI group that have helped to broaden the spectrum of applicability for Brain Computer Interfaces and mental state monitoring in particular and for analysis of neuroimaging data in general. I will introduce a novel reliable method for estimating the Hurst exponent, a quantity that has recently become popular for describing network properties and is being used for diagnostic purposes (cf. Blythe et al. 2014). It is applied to estimate and analyse cognitive properties in neurophysiological data from BCI experiments (Samek et al. 2016). Furthermore if time permits I will discuss a recent attractive application of BCI in the context of video coding (Scholler et al. 2012 and Acqualagna et al 2015).

We here combined rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion imaging to study the relation between frontal oscillatory activity and visual performance, and we associated these phenomena to a specific set of white matter pathways that in humans subtend attentional processes. High-beta rhythmic activity on the right frontal eye field (FEF) was induced with TMS and its causal effects on a contrast sensitivity function were recorded to explore its ability to improve visual detection performance across different stimulus contrast levels. Our results show that frequency-specific activity patterns engaged in the right FEF have the ability to induce a leftward shift of the psychometric function. This increase in visual performance across different levels of stimulus contrast is likely mediated by a contrast gain mechanism. Interestingly, microstructural measures of white matter connectivity suggest a strong implication of right fronto-parietal connectivity linking the FEF and the intraparietal sulcus in propagating high-beta rhythmic signals across brain networks and subtending top-down frontal influences on visual performance.

AV associations were indexed by early and late event related potentials (ERPs) and by oscillatory power and phase locking. Different AV experience was produced via a context manipulation. Participants were presented with valid (the conventional pairing) and invalid AV speech items in either a 'reliable' context (80% AVvalid items) or an 'unreliable' context (80% AVinvalid items). The results showed that for the reliable context, there was N1 facilitation for AV compared to auditory only speech. This N1 facilitation was not affected by AV validity. Later ERPs showed a difference in amplitude between valid and invalid AV speech and there was significant enhancement of power for valid versus invalid AV speech. These response patterns did not change over the context manipulation, suggesting that the internal models of AV speech were not updated by experience. The results also showed that the facilitation of N1 responses did not vary as a function of the salience of visual speech (as previously reported); in post-hoc analyses, it appeared instead that N1 facilitation varied according to the relative time of the acoustic onset, suggesting for AV events N1 may be more sensitive to the relationship of AV timing than form.

This early sensory input may involve: (1) stimulation arising from passive interactions with the mother and littermates and (2) sensory feedback arising from spontaneous infant movements. The relative contributions of these mechanisms under natural conditions remain largely unknown, however. Here, we show that, in the whisker-related barrel cortex of neonatal rats, spontaneous whisker movements and passive stimulation by the littermates cooperate, with comparable efficiency, in driving cortical activity. Both tactile signals arising from the littermate's movements under conditions simulating the littermates' position in the litter, and spontaneous whisker movements efficiently triggered bursts of activity in barrel cortex. Yet, whisker movements with touch were more efficient than free movements. Comparison of the various experimental conditions mimicking the natural environment showed that tactile signals arising from the whisker movements with touch and stimulation by the littermates, support: (1) a twofold higher level of cortical activity than in the isolated animal, and (2) a threefold higher level of activity than in the deafferented animal after the infraorbital nerve cut. Together, these results indicate that endogenous (self-generated movements) and exogenous (stimulation by the littermates) mechanisms cooperate in driving cortical activity in newborn rats and point to the importance of the environment in shaping cortical activity during the neonatal period.

To predict seizure event, small-world characteristic in nine minutes before seizure, divided in three 3-min periods (T0, T1, T2) were investigated. Methods: Intracerebral recordings were obtained from 10 patients with drug resistant focal epilepsy examined by means of stereotactically implanted electrodes; analysis was focused in a period of low spiking (Baseline) and during two seizures. Networks' architecture is undirected and weighted. Electrodes' contacts close to epileptic focus are the vertices, edges are weighted by mscohere (=magnitude squared coherence). Results: Differences were observed between Baseline and T1 and between Baseline and T2 in theta band; and between Baseline and T1, Baseline and T2, and near-significant difference between T0 and T2 in Alpha 2 band. Moreover, an intra-band index was computed for small worldness as difference between Theta and Alpha 2. It was found a growing index trend from Baseline to T2. Conclusions: Cortical network features a specific pre-seizure architecture which could predict the incoming epileptic seizure. Significance: Through this study future researches could investigate brain connectivity modifications approximating a clinical seizure also in order to address a preventive therapy.

Exploring the unknown: electrophysiological and behavioural measures of visuospatial learning	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; P3; P3b; visual learning; visuospatial memory	TO-TARGET INTERVAL; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 AMPLITUDE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ACTIVITY; TASK; ACCUMULATION; PROBABILITY; PERFORMANCE	Visuospatial memory describes our ability to temporarily store and manipulate visual and spatial information and is employed for a wide variety of complex cognitive tasks. Here, a visuospatial learning task requiring fine motor control is employed to investigate visuospatial learning in a group of typically developing adults. Electrophysiological and behavioural data are collected during a target location task under two experimental conditions: Target Learning and Target Cued. Movement times (MTs) are employed as a behavioural metric of performance, while dynamic P3b amplitudes and power in the alpha band (approximately 10 Hz) are explored as electrophysiological metrics during visuospatial learning. Results demonstrate that task performance, as measured by MT, is highly correlated with P3b amplitude and alpha power at a consecutive trial level (trials 1-30). The current set of results, in conjunction with the existing literature, suggests that changes in P3b amplitude and alpha power could correspond to different aspects of the learning process. Here it is hypothesized that changes in P3b correspond to a diminishing inter-stimulus interval and reduced stimulus relevance, while the corresponding changes in alpha power represent an automation of response as habituation occurs in participants. The novel analysis presented in the current study demonstrates how gradual electrophysiological changes can be tracked during the visuospatial learning process under the current paradigm.

Here, we studied the influence of prestimulus alpha power fluctuations on temporal perceptual discrimination of suprathreshold tactile stimuli and subjects' confidence regarding their perceptual decisions. We investigated how prestimulus alpha-band power influences poststimulus decision-making variables. We presented electrical stimuli with different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) to human subjects, and determined the SOA for which temporal perceptual discrimination varied on a trial-by-trial basis between perceiving 1 or 2 stimuli, prior to recording brain activity with magnetoencephalography. We found that low prestimulus alpha power in contralateral somatosensory and occipital areas predicts the veridical temporal perceptual discrimination of 2 stimuli. Additionally, prestimulus alpha power was negatively correlated with confidence ratings in correctly perceived trials, but positively correlated for incorrectly perceived trials. Finally, poststimulus event-related fields (ERFs) were modulated by prestimulus alpha power and reflect the result of a decisional process rather than physical stimulus parameters around similar to 150 ms. These findings provide new insights into the link between spontaneous prestimulus alpha power fluctuations, temporal perceptual discrimination, decision making, and decisional confidence. The results suggest that prestimulus alpha power modulates perception and decisions on a continuous scale, as reflected in confidence ratings.

Whether these deficits reflect aberrant sensory processing, an inability to maintain information in memory, or dysfunctional integration of these two functions remains unclear. Methods: A facial emotion memory paradigm was administered to 38 schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 42 healthy controls (HC). P100, N170 and N250 ERP amplitudes were measured to assess sensory processing. Evoked theta power during the delay interval was quantified to assess memory maintenance. Results: The N170 ERP was larger to negative compared to neutral facial expressions in both groups, while SZ exhibited increased evoked theta power during the delay interval. Increased theta power was associated with worse behavioral performance in response to sad and fearful expressions for HC, but this relationship was only found in response to fearful expressions for SZ. Finally, only HC showed consistent correlations between N170 amplitude and theta power during the delay interval. Conclusions: Integration between measures of sensory processing and memory functioning may be affected in SZ. Significance: These findings may indicate that the oscillatory networks subserving emotion processing and sustained attention are intertwined, and comprise part of the social brain network that is affected in schizophrenia.

Nonlinear Connectivity in the Human Stretch Reflex Assessed by Cross-Frequency Phase Coupling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Stretch reflex; sensorimotor system; nonlinear connectivity; time delay; EEG; EMG	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; HUMAN ANKLE JOINT; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; INFORMATION-FLOW; HUMAN WRIST; PROPRIOCEPTIVE REFLEXES; IMPOSED DISPLACEMENTS; MUSCLE; OSCILLATIONS	Communication between neuronal populations is facilitated by synchronization of their oscillatory activity. Although nonlinearity has been observed in the sensorimotor system, its nonlinear connectivity has not been widely investigated yet. This study investigates nonlinear connectivity during the human stretch reflex based on neuronal synchronization. Healthy participants generated isotonic wrist flexion while receiving a periodic mechanical perturbation to the wrist. Using a novel cross-frequency phase coupling metric, we estimate directional nonlinear connectivity, including time delay, from the perturbation to brain and to muscle, as well as from brain to muscle. Nonlinear phase coupling is significantly stronger from the perturbation to the muscle than to the brain, with a shorter time delay. The time delay from the perturbation to the muscle is 33 ms, similar to the reported latency of the spinal stretch reflex at the wrist. Source localization of nonlinear phase coupling from the brain to the muscle suggests activity originating from the motor cortex, although its effect on the stretch reflex is weak. As such nonlinear phase coupling between the perturbation and muscle activity is dominated by the spinal reflex loop. This study provides new evidence of nonlinear neuronal synchronization in the stretch reflex at the wrist joint with respect to spinal and transcortical loops.

To derive precise structure-function maps from direct neural signals, we collected intracranial EEG (icEEG) recordings in a large human cohort (n = 26) undergoing implantation of subdural electrodes. A surface-based approach to grouped icEEG analysis was used to overcome challenges from sparse electrode coverage within subjects and variable cortical anatomy across subjects. The topology of category-selectivity in bilateral VTC and LOC was assessed for five classes of visual stimuli-faces, animate non-face (animals/ body-parts), places, tools, and words-using correlational and linear mixed effects analyses. In the LOC, selectivity for living (faces and animate non-face) and non-living (places and tools) classes was arranged in a ventral-to-dorsal axis along the LOS. In the VTC, selectivity for living and non-living stimuli was arranged in a latero-medial axis along the MFS. Written word-selectivity was reliably localized to the intersection of the left MFS and the occipito-temporal sulcus. These findings provide direct electrophysiological evidence for topological information structuring of functional representations within higher-order visual cortex.

Cocaine attenuates blood flow but not neuronal responses to stimulation while preserving neurovascular coupling for resting brain activity	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ALPHA-CHLORALOSE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; DOPAMINE; ABNORMALITIES; COMPLICATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; HALOTHANE; DISEASE	Cocaine affects neuronal activity and constricts cerebral blood vessels, making it difficult to determine whether cocaine-induced changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) reflect neuronal activation or its vasoactive effects. Here we assessed the effects of acute cocaine on both resting-state and stimulation responses to investigate cocaine's effects on neurovascular coupling and to differentiate its effects on neuronal activity from its vasoactive actions. We concurrently measured cortical field potentials via thinned-skull electroencephalography recordings and CBF with laser Doppler flowmetry in the rat's somatosensory cortex for both resting state and forepaw stimulation before and following cocaine administration (1 mg kg(-1), intravenously). Results show both resting-state field potentials and CBF were depressed after cocaine administration (19.8 +/- 4.7% and 52.1 +/- 13.4%, respectively) and these changes were strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.81, P<0.001), indicating that cocaine did not affect neurovascular coupling at rest and that the reduction in resting CBF reflected reduction in synchronized spontaneous neuronal activity rather than vasoconstriction. In contrast, the forepaw stimulation-evoked neuronal activity was not changed by cocaine (P = 0.244), whereas the CBF to the stimulation was reduced 49.9 +/- 2.6% (P = 0.028) gradually recovering similar to 20 min after cocaine injection, indicating that neurovascular coupling during stimulation was temporarily disrupted by cocaine. Neurovascular uncoupling by cocaine during stimulation but not during rest indicates that distinct processes might underlie neurovascular regulation for both stimulation and spontaneous activity. The greater reductions by cocaine to the stimulation-induced CBF increases than to the background CBF should be considered when interpreting functional MRI studies comparing activation responses between controls and cocaine abusers. Neurovascular uncoupling could contribute to cocaine's neurotoxicity, particularly for stimulation conditions when CBF might be insufficient to cover for the energetic demands of neuronal tissue.

Oscillatory decoupling differentiates auditory encoding deficits in children with listening problems	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory processing; Auditory processing disorder; Auditory evoked potential; Child development; Neural oscillations; Oscillatory coupling	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; SPEECH; CORTEX; COMORBIDITY; COMPONENTS; ALPHA; GAMMA; THETA	Objective: We sought to examine whether oscillatory EEG responses to a speech stimulus in both quiet and noise were different in children with listening problems than in children with normal hearing. Methods: We employed a high-resolution spectral-temporal analysis of the cortical auditory evoked potential in response to a 150 ms speech sound /da/ in quiet and 3 dB SNR in 21 typically developing children (mean age = 10.7 years, standard deviation = 1.7) and 44 children with reported listening problems (LP) with absence of hearing loss (mean age = 10.3 years, standard deviation = 1.6). Children with LP were assessed for auditory processing disorder (APD) by which 24 children had APD, and 20 children did not. Peak latencies, magnitudes, and frequencies were compared between these groups. Results: Children with LP had frequency shifts in the theta, and alpha bands (p < 0.05), and children with LP + APD had additional frequency (p < 0.01) and latency shifts (p < 0.05) in the upper beta and in the lower gamma bands. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for differences in higher level modulatory processing in children with LP, and that APD is driven by differences in early auditory encoding. Significance: These findings may better guide future research toward improving the differential diagnosis and treatment of listening problems in this population of children.

Intermuscular Coherence in Normal Adults: Variability and Changes with Age	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; HAND-MUSCLE; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; CORTICOSPINAL SYSTEM; EMG COHERENCE; EEG-EMG; OSCILLATIONS; TASK	We investigated beta-band intermuscular coherence (IMC) in 92 healthy adults stratified by decade of age, and analysed variability between and within subjects. In the dominant upper limb, IMC was estimated between extensor digitorum communis and first dorsal interosseous as well as between flexor digitorum superficialis and first dorsal interosseous. In the ipsilateral lower limb, IMC was measured between medial gastrocnemius and extensor digitorum brevis as well as between tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum brevis. Age-related changes in IMC were analysed with age as a continuous variable or binned by decade. Intrasession variance of IMC was examined by dividing sessions into pairs of epochs and comparing coherence estimates between these pairs. Eight volunteers returned for a further session after one year, allowing us to compare intrasession and intersession variance. We found no age-related changes in IMC amplitude across almost six decades of age, allowing us to collate data from all ages into an aggregate normative dataset. Interindividual variability ranged over two orders of magnitude. Intrasession variance was significantly greater than expected from statistical variability alone, and intersession variance was even larger. Potential contributors include fluctuations in task performance, differences in electrode montage and short-term random variation in central coupling. These factors require further exploration and, where possible, minimisation. This study provides evidence that coherence is remarkably robust to senescent changes in the nervous system and provides a large normative dataset for future applications of IMC as a biomarker in disease states.

Orexin Receptor Antagonism Improves Sleep and Reduces Seizures in Kcna1-null Mice	SLEEP			English	Article						dual orexin receptor antagonist; epilepsy; Kcna1-null; orexin; sleep	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ALMOREXANT PROMOTES SLEEP; PATHOLOGICAL SHARP WAVES; VITRO HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; PILOCARPINE MODEL; NEURONAL DEATH; MAMILLARY BODY	Study Objective: Comorbid sleep disorders occur in approximately one-third of people with epilepsy. Seizures and sleep disorders have an interdependent relationship where the occurrence of one can exacerbate the other. Orexin, a wake-promoting neuropeptide, is associated with sleep disorder symptoms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that orexin dysregulation plays a role in the comorbid sleep disorder symptoms in the Kcna1-null mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Rest-activity was assessed using infrared beam actigraphy. Sleep architecture and seizures were assessed using continuous video-electroencephalography- electromyography recordings in Kcna1-null mice treated with vehicle or the dual orexin receptor antagonist, almorexant (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Orexin levels in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical region (LH/P) and hypothalamic pathology were assessed with immunohistochemistry and oxygen polarography. Results: Kcna1-null mice have increased latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep onset, sleep fragmentation, and number of wake epochs. The numbers of REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep epochs are significantly reduced in Kcna1-null mice. Severe seizures propagate to the wake-promoting LH/P where injury is apparent (indicated by astrogliosis, blood-brain barrier permeability, and impaired mitochondrial function). The number of orexin-positive neurons is increased in the LH/P compared to wild-type LH/P. Treatment with a dual orexin receptor antagonist significantly increases the number and duration of NREM sleep epochs and reduces the latency to REM sleep onset. Further, almorexant treatment reduces the incidence of severe seizures and overall seizure burden. Interestingly, we report a significant positive correlation between latency to REM onset and seizure burden in Kcna1-null mice. Conclusion: Dual orexin receptor antagonists may be an effective sleeping aid in epilepsy, and warrants further study on their somnogenic and ant-seizure effects in other epilepsy models.

Improvements in motor learning have been found in multiple studies when tDCS was applied to the motor cortex before or during task learning. The motor cortex is also active during the performance of motor imagination, a cognitive task during which a person imagines, but does not execute, a movement. Motor imagery can be used with noninvasive brain computer interfaces (BCIs) to control virtual objects in up to three dimensions, but to master control of such devices requires long training times. Objective: To evaluate the effect of high-definition tDCS on the performance and underlying electrophysiology of motor imagery based BCI. Methods: We utilize high-definition tDCS to investigate the effect of stimulation on motor imagery based BCI performance across and within sessions over multiple training days. Results: We report a decreased time-to-hit with anodal stimulation both within and across sessions. We also found differing electrophysiological changes of the stimulated sensorimotor cortex during online BCI task performance for left vs. right trials. Cathodal stimulation led to a decrease in alpha and beta band power during task performance compared to sham stimulation for right hand imagination trials. Conclusion: These results suggest that unilateral tDCS over the sensorimotor motor cortex differentially affects cortical areas based on task specific neural activation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Electrocortical spectral analysis and fractal methods for assessing the effects of unilateral brain injury on rat cerebellum	ARCHIVES ITALIENNES DE BIOLOGIE			English	Article						Cerebellum; Injury; Spectral analysis; Fractal dimension	EEG-ANALYSIS; OSCILLATIONS; STROKE	We used electrocortical spectral analysis and fractal methods for assessing the effects of unilateral, single brain injury on cerebellum. Cerebellar electrocortical activity was recorded in control state (before the injury) and after a single brain injury of the cerebellar cortex in anesthetized rats. We noticed that the mean power in gamma high-frequency domain (32-128 Hz) of the cerebellum, was increased after the first brain injury, while after a two-week recovery, it was larger than before the injury. The unilateral brain injury induced a permanent increase of the mild gamma activity in both the left and the right side of cerebellum cortex, but there was no further increase after the lesion was repeated. Our recent electrophysiological study on the cerebellum (Culic et al., 2005) suggested that the mean power spectra of the cerebellar cortical activity in the gamma frequency range might be the indicator of acute single focal brain injury. However, there is insufficient information on the effects of the repeated brain injury on the cerebellar electrocortical activity and morphology. There was no significant difference between the absolute and the relative mean power of the left and the right paravermal cortical activity (before, as well as, after the injury), in each of the animals tested afterwards, but there were differences between the left and the right side of cerebellum in experimental animals. Repeated injury of the cerebellar cortical areas, is strengthened by morphological changes in the cerebellar hemisphere, and shows a decrease in delta and an increase in gamma range.

Reduced prefrontal MEG alpha-band power in mild traumatic brain injury with associated posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Post-traumatic stress disorder; Traumatic brain injury; Resting-state; Alpha-band oscillations; Magnetoencephalography	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; EEG; VETERANS; CORTEX; RISK; MECHANISMS; RHYTHMS; ANXIETY	Objective: To determine if changes in cortical alpha-band power in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are associated with the severity of their post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and if injury severity and level of exposure to psychologically traumatic events are predictors of these electrophysiological changes. Methods: Resting-state magnetoencephalographic recordings were analyzed in 32 patients with mTBI. Alpha-band power was estimated for each patient in 68 cortical regions and was compared between groups of patients with low versus high PTSD symptoms severity. Results: Participants with high PTSD symptom severity showed reduced alpha-band power bilaterally in the superior and middle frontal gyri and frontal poles, and in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Alpha-band power in bilateral middle frontal gyri and frontal poles was negatively correlated with scores reflecting symptoms of emotional numbing. Loss of consciousness (LOC) associated with mTBI and level of exposure to psychologically traumatic events were predictors of decreased prefrontal alpha-band power in some of these regions. Conclusion: Altered prefrontal alpha-band activity, shown to be partly explained by mTBI-related LOC, is associated with PTSD symptoms severity. Significance: Our findings will guide future studies addressing the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying a higher incidence of PTSD in patients with mTBI.

Methods Internet Addiction Inventory (IAT) and personality trait (Behavioural Inhibition System, BIS; Behavioural Activation System, BAS) were applied to 28 subjects. Electroencephalographic (EEG, alpha frequency band) and response times (RTs) were registered during a Go-NoGo task execution in response to different online stimuli: gambling videos, videogames or neutral stimuli. Higher-IAT (more than 50 score, with moderate or severe internet addiction) and lower-IAT (<50 score, with no internet addiction). Results Alpha band and RTs were affected by IAT, with significant bias (reduced RTs) for high-IAT in response to gambling videos and videogames; and by BAS, BAS-Reward subscale (BAS-R), since not only higher-IAT, but also BAS and BAS-R values determined an increasing of left prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity (alpha reduction) in response to videogames and gambling stimuli for both Go and NoGo conditions, in addition to decreased RTs for these stimuli categories. Conclusion The increased PFC responsiveness and the lateralisation (left PFC hemisphere) effect in NoGo condition was explained on the basis of a rewarding bias' towards more rewarding cues and a deficit in inhibitory control in higher-IAT and higher-BAS subjects. In contrast lower-IAT and lower-BAS predicted a decreased PFC response and increased RTs for NoGo (inhibitory mechanism). These results may support the significance of personality (BAS) and IAT measures for explaining future internet addiction behaviour based on this observed vulnerability'.

Distinct Mechanisms for Distractor Suppression and Target Facilitation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; attention; distractor inhibition; expectation suppression; prediction	WORKING-MEMORY BIASES; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; INHIBITION; EXPECTATION; TEMPLATES; LOCATIONS	It is well established that preparatory attention improves processing of task-relevant stimuli. Although it is often more important to ignore task-irrelevant stimuli, comparatively little is known about preparatory attentional mechanisms for inhibiting expected distractions. Here, we establish that distractor inhibition is not under the same top-down control as target facilitation. Using a variant of the Posner paradigm, participants were cued to either the location of a target stimulus, the location of a distractor, or were provided no predictive information. In Experiment 1, we found that participants were able to use target-relevant cues to facilitate target processing in both blocked and flexible conditions, but distractor cueing was only effective in the blocked version of the task. In Experiment 2, we replicate these findings in a larger sample and leveraged the additional statistical power to perform individual differences analyses to tease apart potential underlying mechanisms. We found no evidence for a correlation between these two types of benefit, suggesting that flexible target cueing and distractor suppression depend on distinct cognitive mechanisms. In Experiment 3, we use EEG to show that preparatory distractor suppression is associated with a diminished P1, but we found no evidence to suggest that this effect was mediated by top-down control of oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz). We conclude that flexible top-down mechanisms of cognitive control are specialized for target-related attention, whereas distractor suppression only emerges when the predictive information can be derived directly from experience. This is consistent with a predictive coding model of expectation suppression.

From an overview of resting state activity findings to a proposed spatiotemporal psychopathology	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Schizophrenia; Resting-state; Intrinsic activity; Cross-frequency coupling; Temporal structure; Functional connectivity	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; BASIC SELF-DISTURBANCE; SLOW EEG FLUCTUATIONS; CORTICAL GABA NEURONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INTEGRATING PHENOMENOLOGY; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA ACTIVITY	Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a variety of symptoms that include sensorimotor, affective, cognitive, and social changes. The exact neuronal mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain unclear though. Neuroimaging has focused mainly on the brain's extrinsic activity, specifically task-evoked or stimulus-induced activity, as related to the sensorimotor, affective, cognitive, and social functions. Recently, the focus has shifted to the brain's spontaneous activity, otherwise known as its resting state activity. While various spatial and temporal abnormalities have been observed in spontaneous activity in schizophrenia, their meaning and significance for the different psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenia, are yet to be defined. The first aim in this paper is to provide an overview of recent findings concerning changes in the spatial (e.g., functional connectivity) and temporal (e.g., couplings between different frequency fluctuations) properties of spontaneous activity in schizophrenia. The second aim is to link these spatiotemporal changes to the various psychopathological symptoms of schizophrenia, with a specific focus on basic symptoms, formal thought disorder, and ego-disturbances. Based on the various findings described, we postulate that the spatiotemporal changes on the neuronal level of the brain's spontaneous activity transform into corresponding spatiotemporal changes on the psychological level which, in turn, leads to the different kinds of psychopathological symptoms. We consequently suggest a spatiotemporal rather than cognitive or sensory approach to the condition, amounting to what we describe as "Spatiotemporal Psychopathology". (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

On the Potential of a New Generation of Magnetometers for MEG: A Beamformer Simulation Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; BRAIN; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONY; FMRI	Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a sophisticated tool which yields rich information on the spatial, spectral and temporal signatures of human brain function. Despite unique potential, MEG is limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which is caused by both the inherently small magnetic fields generated by the brain, and the scalp-to-sensor distance. The latter is limited in current systems due to a requirement for pickup coils to be cryogenically cooled. Recent work suggests that optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) might be a viable alternative to superconducting detectors for MEG measurement. They have the advantage that sensors can be brought to within similar to 4 mm of the scalp, thus offering increased sensitivity. Here, using simulations, we quantify the advantages of hypothetical OPM systems in terms of sensitivity, reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution. Our results show that a multichannel whole-head OPM system offers (on average) a fivefold improvement in sensitivity for an adult brain, as well as clear improvements in reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution. However, we also show that such improvements depend critically on accurate forward models; indeed, the reconstruction accuracy of our simulated OPM system only outperformed that of a simulated superconducting system in cases where forward field error was less than 5%. Overall, our results imply that the realisation of a viable whole-head multi-channel OPM system could generate a step change in the utility of MEG as a means to assess brain electrophysiological activity in health and disease. However in practice, this will require both improved hardware and modelling algorithms.

Although this suggestion is attracting, it is unclear whether increased plantar sole pressure simply reduces the transmission of plantar sole afferent to the cortex or also alters the sensorimotor integrative mechanisms. Here we used electrical stimulation applied under the sole of the foot to probe the sensorimotor mechanisms processing foot mechanoreceptors. Balance control of healthy individuals was assessed either when wearing a loaded vest or in normal-weight condition. In the Loaded condition, we observed decreased cortical activity over the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) for both an early P-50-N-90 somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and for oscillatory brain activity within the gamma band (30-80 Hz). These reductions were interpreted as a disrupted early sensory transmission (i.e., decreased early SEP) leading to a decreased perception of plantar sole sensory information (i.e., decreased gamma band power). These early sensory mechanisms for the Loaded condition were associated with an increase in the late P-170-N-210 SEP and oscillatory brain activity within the beta band (19-24 Hz). These neural signatures involved areas which are engaged in sensorimotor integrative processes (secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) and right temporoparietal junction). Altered early and late sensory processes may result from the increase pressure on the mechanoreceptors of the foot sole and not from postural instability per se. Indeed, postural instability with normal weight condition did not lead to SEP changes.

J	Northoff, G; Stanghellini, G				Northoff, Georg; Stanghellini, Giovanni			How to Link Brain and Experience? Spatiotemporal Psychopathology of the Lived Body	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						abnormal bodily phenomena; brain resting state; phenomenology; schizophrenia; spatio-temporal; psychopathology	ABNORMAL BODILY PHENOMENA; STATE EEG POWER; NEURONAL DYNAMICS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK; CONSCIOUSNESS; COORDINATION; PSYCHOSIS; INSIGHTS	The focus of the present article is on sketching a psychopathology of the body in schizophrenia and linking it to brain activity. This is done providing converging data from psychopathological evidence (phenomenal), phenomenological contructs (transphenomenal) and neuroscientific measures (pre-phenomenal). The phenomenal level is the detailed documentation of the patients' subjective anomalous experiences. These phenomena are explicit contents in the patients' field of consciousness. The trans-phenomenal level targets the implicit yet operative matrix that underlies these anomalous subjective experiences. Abnormal phenomena are viewed as expressions of amodification of trans-phenomenal matrix, that is, interms of an abnormal synthesis or integration through time of intero-, proprio- and extero-ceptive stimuli. Finally, we link the abnormalities of the trans-phenomenal matrix to pre- phenomenal alterations of the brain resting state and of its spatio-temporal organization, as documented by neurobiological methods providing spatial and temporal resolution of intrinsic brain activity (with many features of the resting state remaining yet unclear though). Based on phenomenological research, the body in schizophrenia is typically experienced in an itemized way as an object external to one's self and unrelated to events in the external world. Based on neurobiological data, we tentatively hypothesize that such anomalies of the lived body are related to decreased integration between intero-, extero- and proprioceptive experiences by the brain's spontaneous activity and its temporal structure. Taken all together, this suggests that we view abnormalities of bodilyexperience interms of their underlying abnormal spatiotemporal features which, as we suppose, can be traced back to the spatiotemporal features of the brains spantaneous activity.

Movement Anticipation and EEG: Implications for BCI-Contingent Robot Therapy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); man machine systems; rehabilitation robotics	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; BETA SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; RHYTHMS; REHABILITATION; STIMULATION; MODULATION; PATTERNS; FINGER	Brain-computer interfacing is a technology that has the potential to improve patient engagement in robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy. For example, movement intention reduces mu ( 8-13 Hz) oscillation amplitude over the sensorimotor cortex, a phenomenon referred to as event-related desynchronization ( ERD). In an ERD-contingent assistance paradigm, initial BCI-enhanced robotic therapy studies have used ERD to provide robotic assistance for movement. Here we investigated how ERD changed as a function of audio-visual stimuli, overt movement from the participant, and robotic assistance. Twelve unimpaired subjects played a computer game designed for rehabilitation therapy with their fingers using the FINGER robotic exoskeleton. In the game, the participant and robot matched movement timing to audio-visual stimuli in the form of notes approaching a target on the screen set to the consistent beat of popular music. The audio-visual stimulation of the game alone did not cause ERD, before or after training. In contrast, overt movement by the subject caused ERD, whether or not the robot assisted the finger movement. Notably, ERD was also present when the subjects remained passive and the robot moved their fingers to play the game. This ERD occurred in anticipation of the passive finger movement with similar onset timing as for the overt movement conditions. These results demonstrate that ERD can be contingent on expectation of robotic assistance; that is, the brain generates an anticipatory ERD in expectation of a robot-imposed but predictable movement. This is a caveat that should be considered in designing BCIs for enhancing patient effort in robotically-assisted therapy.

In particular, spectral BGC and conditional spectral BGC are used to disclose blockwise causal flow among different brain areas in various frequencies. In this paper, we demonstrate that: 1) BGC in time domain may not necessarily disclose true causality and 2) due to the use of the transfer function or its inverse matrix and partial information of the multivariate linear regression model, both of spectral BGC and conditional spectral BGC have shortcomings and/or limitations, which may inevitably lead to misinterpretation. We then, in time and frequency domains, develop two new multivariate blockwise causality methods for the linear regression model called blockwise new causality (BNC) and spectral BNC, respectively. By several examples, we confirm that BNC measures are more reasonable and sensitive to reflect true causality or trend of true causality than BGC or conditional BGC. Finally, for electroencephalograph data from an epilepsy patient, we analyze event-related potential causality and demonstrate that both of the BGC and BNC methods show significant causality flow in frequency domain, but the spectral BNC method yields satisfactory and convincing results, which are consistent with an event-related time-frequency power spectrum activity. The spectral BGC method is shown to generate misleading results. Thus, we deeply believe that our new blockwise causality definitions as well as our previous NC definitions may have wide applications to reflect true causality among two blocks of time series or two univariate time series in economics, neuroscience, and engineering.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the receptor antagonists 5HT1A and 5HT2A, B, C will increase FR in rats treated with kainic acid (KA, 0.8 mu g/0.5 mu l). For this purpose, the intracranial EEG recordings of the hippocampus from animals treated with KA and the serotonin antagonists WAY100135 and ritanserin (dose 0.2 mg/Kg, i.p) were analyzed. In addition, morphologic parameters were analyzed after staining samples with cresyl violet, Timm stain, NeuN and GFAP and observing immunofluorescence. The results showed an increase in the number of events of FR (p < 0.0001) and duration of each FR event after the administration of WAY100135 (p < 0.030). Additionally, there was an increase in the number of events of FR (p < 0.0001) and amplitude of FR after ritanserin administration (p < 0.014). In relation to changes in unspecified cells, there was a significant decrement in the width of the CA3 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus (p < 0.001), and there were no significant changes in reactive glia and fiber sprouting. However, a slight gain of astrocytes marked with GFAP and larger astrocytes with more projections were observed. In conclusion, these results support the modulation of FR by serotonin with participation of the 5HT1A receptor as a possible mediator of the effect. However the exact mechanisms resulting in such effect is not known. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Papera, M; Richards, A				Papera, Massimiliano; Richards, Anne			Attentional gain and processing capacity limits predict the propensity to neglect unexpected visual stimuli	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Awareness; ERPs; Computational modeling; Visual processes; Human factors	INATTENTIONAL BLINDNESS; EEG ALPHA; COMPONENT; THETA; BAND; MECHANISM; SEARCH; CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATIONS	Exogenous allocation of attentional resources allows the visual system to encode and maintain representations of stimuli in visual working memory (VWM). However, limits in the processing capacity to allocate resources can prevent unexpected visual stimuli from gaining access to VWM and thereby to consciousness. Using a novel approach to create unbiased stimuli of increasing saliency, we investigated visual processing during a visual search task in individuals who show a high or low propensity to neglect unexpected stimuli. When propensity to inattention is high, ERP recordings show a diminished amplification concomitantly with a decrease in theta band power during the N1 latency, followed by a poor target enhancement during the N2 latency. Furthermore, a later modulation in the P3 latency was also found in individuals showing propensity to visual neglect, suggesting that more effort is required for conscious maintenance of visual information in VWM. Effects during early stages of processing (N80 and P1) were also observed suggesting that sensitivity to contrasts and medium-to-high spatial frequencies may be modulated by low-level saliency (albeit no statistical group differences were found). In accordance with the Global Workplace Model, our data indicate that a lack of resources in low-level processors and visual attention may be responsible for the failure to "ignite" a state of high-level activity spread across several brain areas that is necessary for stimuli to access awareness. These findings may aid in the development of diagnostic tests and intervention to detect/reduce inattention propensity to visual neglect of unexpected stimuli.

J	Leonhardt, G				Leonhardt, Georg			Presurgical evaluation - state of the art	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EPILEPTOLOGIE			German	Article						Epilepsy; Pharmacorefractory; Epilepsy surgery; Presurgical evaluation; Telemetry	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY; WADA TEST; SEIZURES; EEG; LOCALIZATION; ELECTRODES; LOBECTOMY; MRI	Epilepsy surgery offers a remedy for patients with pharmacorefractory epilepsy. The identification of the epileptogenic zone is a prerequisite. Presurgical evaluation begins with the present and past medical history to elicit all potential seizures and semiologic features. The neuropsychological evaluation shows the deficits, especially of the higher cognitive functions, that may help in lateralising of the epileptogenic zone and also in predicting putative postoperative deficits. MR-imaging with 3D-T1-weighted and 3D-FLAIR sequences, as well as 2D images in thin slices and aligned with either the hippocampus or the AC-PC-line (temporal vs. extratemporal epilepsy), are helpful. During telemetry all potential seizure types should be recorded. Montages with narrow spaced electrodes over areas that might harbour the seizure onset zone are helpful. Patients should be clearly visible to the camera at all times and the scene illuminated adequately. Invasive recording with depth electrodes or subdural grids or strips is indicated if surface electrodes show no seizure pattern, seizure pattern does not match other tests, or only non-localising seizure patterns are detected. Invasive monitoring needs a clear hypothesis since its field of view is restricted. FDG-PET is useful in MR-negative patients (i.e. non-lesional) since the area of hypometabolism has a high sensitivity and specificity for the seizure onset zone. SPECT, especially when interictal and ictal recordings are subtracted (SISCOM), can elicit the area of ictal hyperperfusion that corresponds well with the seizure onset zone. Only patients who in principle are willing to undergo resective surgery and who can cooperate are good candidates for presurgical evaluation.

Pharmacological Targeting the REV-ERBs in Sleep/Wake Regulation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; CAFFEINE DEPENDENCE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; WAKE PATTERNS; MODAFINIL; DOPAMINE; ALPHA; AMPHETAMINE; DURATION	The circadian clock maintains appropriate timing for a wide range of behaviors and physiological processes. Circadian behaviors such as sleep and wakefulness are intrinsically dependent on the precise oscillation of the endogenous molecular machinery that regulates the circadian clock. The identical core clock machinery regulates myriad endocrine and metabolic functions providing a link between sleep and metabolic health. The REV-ERBs (REV-ERB alpha and REV-ERB beta) are nuclear receptors that are key regulators of the molecular clock and have been successfully targeted using small molecule ligands. Recent studies in mice suggest that REV-ERB-specific synthetic agonists modulate metabolic activity as well as alter sleep architecture, inducing wakefulness during the light period. Therefore, these small molecules represent unique tools to extensively study REV-ERB regulation of sleep and wakefulness. In these studies, our aim was to further investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting the REV-ERBs for regulation of sleep by characterizing efficacy, and optimal dosing time of the REV-ERB agonist SR9009 using electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Applying different experimental paradigms in mice, our studies establish that SR9009 does not lose efficacy when administered more than once a day, nor does tolerance develop when administered once a day over a three-day dosing regimen. Moreover, through use of a time response paradigm, we determined that although there is an optimal time for administration of SR9009 in terms of maximal efficacy, there is a 12-hour window in which SR9009 elicited a response. Our studies indicate that the REV-ERBs are potential therapeutic targets for treating sleep problems as those encountered as a consequence of shift work or jet lag.

Prefrontal activity decline in women under a single dose of diazepam during rule-guided responses: an fMRI study	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Benzodiazepine; Diazepam; Sex differences; fMRI; Rule-guided behavior; Frontal lobes	AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID LEVELS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; PERSISTENT ACTIVITY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE CONTROL; EEG OSCILLATIONS; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; HORMONES; FEMALE	Daily life events confront us with new situations demanding responses to usual and unusual rules. Diazepam (DZ), a clinically important drug, facilitates the inhibitory activity of the GABAergic system. Prefrontal cortex, rich in DZ receptors, coordinates necessary resources to direct actions according to rules. The balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity is critical to achieve optimal function of brain systems leading to complex functions. Major sex differences in the physiological mechanisms of the GABAergic system have been reported. However, the differential influence of DZ on men and women in neural activity during behavior directed by frontal lobes remains unexplored. The ability of healthy volunteers to select responses following usual/congruent and novel/incongruent rules, and brain correlates were measured with fMRI under the administration of DZ and a placebo. 10 mg of DZ was enough to decrease the performance in a different manner between men and women. While reaction times increased in both men and women, women committed more errors selecting responses than men under DZ. Men demonstrated increased activity, while women demonstrated decreased activity in frontal regions involved in response selection of rules. These findings could have important consequences in understanding the differential influences of DZ between the sexes in complex daily life situations. More importantly, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the differential effects on men and women of drugs widely employed by society, thereby achieves better therapeutic results and avoids side effects that the present study revealed to be different between sexes.

Using EEG recorded in 12 adults with autism and age-matched controls performing a visual target detection task, we characterized the influence of a certain context (targets preceded by a predictive sequence of three distinct stimuli) or an uncertain context (random targets) on behavior and electrophysiological markers of predictive processing. During an uncertain context, adults with autism were faster than controls to detect targets. They also had an enhancement in CNV amplitude preceding all random stimuli indexing enhanced preparatory mechanisms, and an earlier N2 to targets reflecting faster information processing compared to controls. During a certain context, both controls and adults with autism presented an increase in P3 amplitude to predictive stimuli indexing information encoding of the predictive sequence, an enhancement in CNV amplitude preceding predictable targets corresponding to the deployment of preparatory mechanisms, and an earlier P3 to predictable targets reflecting efficient prediction building and implementation. These results suggest an efficient extraction of predictive information to generate predictions in both controls and adults with autism during a certain context. However, adults with autism displayed a failure to decrease mu power during motor preparation accompanied by a reduced benefit in reaction times to predictable targets. The data reveal that patients with autism over-anticipate stimuli occurring in an uncertain context, in accord with their sense of being overwhelmed by incoming information. These results suggest that adults with autism cannot flexibly modulate cortical activity according to changing levels of uncertainty.

J	Takaura, K; Fujii, N				Takaura, Kana; Fujii, Naotaka			Facilitative effect of repetitive presentation of one stimuluson cortical responses to other stimuli in macaquemonkeys - a possible neural mechanism for mismatch negativity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adaptation; auditory; electrocorticogram; roving oddball paradigm	AUDITORY CHANGE-DETECTION; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SENSORY MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTEX; EEG; ADAPTATION; DEVIANCE; NEURONS	The event-related potential mismatch negativity' (MMN) is an indicator of a perceiver's ability to detect deviations in sensory signal streams. MMN and its homologue in animals, mismatch activity (MMA), are differential neural responses to a repeatedly presented stimulus and a subsequent deviant stimulus (oddball). Because neural mechanisms underlying MMN and MMA remain unclear, there is a controversy as to whether MMN and MMA arise solely from stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), in which the response to a stimulus cumulatively attenuates with its repetitive presentation. To address this issue, we used electrocorticography and the auditory roving-oddball paradigm in two awake macaque monkeys. We examined the effect of stimulus repetition number on MMA and on responses to repeated stimuli and oddballs across the cerebral cortex in the time-frequency domain. As the repetition number increased, MMA spread across the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, and each electrode yielded a larger MMA. Surprisingly, this increment in MMA largely depended on response augmentation to the oddball rather than on SSA to the repeated stimulus. Following sufficient repetition, the oddball evoked a spectral power increment in some electrodes on the frontal cortex that had shown no power increase to the stimuli with less or no preceding repetition. We thereby revealed that repetitive presentation of one stimulus not only leads to SSA but also facilitates the cortical response to oddballs involving a wide range of cortical regions. This facilitative effect might underlie the generation of MMN-like scalp potentials in macaques that potentially shares similar neural mechanisms with MMN in humans.

Neural correlates of maintaining generated images in visual working memory	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						mental imagery; visual working memory; phase coupling; electroencephalogram; phase-locking value; fronto-parietal network	EEG-THETA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; MENTAL-IMAGERY; FRONTOPARIETAL NETWORK; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONY; AMPLITUDE DYNAMICS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN	How are images that have been assembled from their constituting elements maintained as a coherent representation in visual working memory (vWM)? Here, we compared two conditions of vWM maintenance that only differed in how vWM contents had been created. Participants maintained images that they either had to assemble from single features or that they had perceived as complete objects. Object complexity varied between two and four features. We analyzed electroencephalogram phase coupling as a measure of cortical connectivity in a time interval immediately before a probe stimulus appeared. We assumed that during this time both groups maintained essentially the same images, but that images constructed from their elements would require more neural coupling than images based on a complete percept. Increased coupling between frontal and parietal-to-occipital cortical sources was found for the maintenance of constructed in comparison to nonconstructed objects in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. A similar pattern was found for an increase in vWM load (2 vs. 4 features) for nonconstructed objects. Under increased construction load (2 vs. 4 features for constructed images), the pattern was restricted to fronto-parietal couplings, suggesting that the fronto-parietal attention network is coping with the higher attentional demands involved in maintaining constructed images, but without increasing the communication with the occipital visual buffer in which the visual representations are assumed to be stored. We conclude from these findings that the maintenance of constructed images in vWM requires additional attentional processes to keep object elements together as a coherent representation.

Alpha rhythm of the frontoparietal region are associated with either the intelligence or memory of healthy subjects and are also related to pathological states. In this study, alpha NFT effects on memory performances were explored. Fifty healthy participants were recruited and randomly assigned into a group receiving a 8-12-Hz amplitude (Alpha) or a group receiving a random 4-Hz amplitude from the range of 7 to 20 Hz (Ctrl). Three NFT sessions per week were conducted for 4 weeks. Working memory was assessed by both a backward digit span task and an operation span task, and episodic memory was assessed using a word pair task. Four questionnaires were used to assess anxiety, depression, insomnia, and cognitive function. The Ctrl group had no change in alpha amplitude and duration. In contrast, the Alpha group showed a progressive significant increase in the alpha amplitude and total alpha duration of the frontoparietal region. Accuracies of both working and episodic memories were significantly improved in a large proportion of participants of the Alpha group, particularly for those with remarkable alpha-amplitude increases. Scores of four questionnaires fell in a normal range before and after NFT. The current study provided supporting evidence for alpha trainability within a small session number compared with that of therapy. The findings suggested the enhancement of working and episodic memory through alpha NFT. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG): assessing the impact of tDCS on slow cortical magnetic fields	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Transcranial direct current stimulation; Magnetoencephalography; Slow cortical fields; Source-reconstruction	NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; NETWORK DYNAMICS; EEG FLUCTUATIONS; MOTOR FUNCTION; CORTEX; EXCITABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; ENHANCEMENT; INFORMATION; POTENTIALS	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can influence cognitive, affective or motor brain functions. Whereas previous imaging studies demonstrated widespread tDCS effects on brain metabolism, direct impact of tDCS on electric or magnetic source activity in task-related brain areas could not be confirmed due to the difficulty to record such activity simultaneously during tDCS. The aim of this proof-of-principal study was to demonstrate the feasibility of whole-head source localization and reconstruction of neuromagnetic brain activity during tDCS and to confirm the direct effect of tDCS on ongoing neuromagnetic activity in task-related brain areas. Here we show for the first time that tDCS has an immediate impact on slow cortical magnetic fields (SCF, 0-4 Hz) of task-related areas that are identical with brain regions previously described in metabolic neuroimaging studies. 14 healthy volunteers performed a choice reaction time (RT) task while whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded. Task-related source-activity of SCFs was calculated using synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) in absence of stimulation and while anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS was delivered over the right primary motor cortex (M1). Source reconstruction revealed task-related SCF modulations in brain regions that precisely matched prior metabolic neuroimaging studies. Anodal and cathodal tDCS had a polarity-dependent impact on RT and SCF in primary sensorimotor and medial centro-parietal cortices. Combining tDCS and whole-head MEG is a powerful approach to investigate the direct effects of transcranial electric currents on ongoing neuromagnetic source activity, brain function and behavior.

Electrocorticography (ECoG) has become an important tool in human neuroscience and has tremendous potential for emerging applications in neural interface technology. Electrode array design parameters are outstanding issues for both research and clinical applications, and these parameters depend critically on the nature of the neural signals to be recorded. Here, we investigate the functional spatial resolution of neural signals recorded at the human cortical surface. We empirically derive spatial spread functions to quantify the shared neural activity for each frequency band of the electrocorticogram. Approach. Five subjects with high-density (4 mm center-to-center spacing) ECoG grid implants participated in speech perception and production tasks while neural activity was recorded from the speech cortex, including superior temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. The cortical surface field potential was decomposed into traditional EEG frequency bands. Signal similarity between electrode pairs for each frequency band was quantified using a Pearson correlation coefficient. Main results. The correlation of neural activity between electrode pairs was inversely related to the distance between the electrodes; this relationship was used to quantify spatial falloff functions for cortical subdomains. As expected, lower frequencies remained correlated over larger distances than higher frequencies. However, both the envelope and phase of gamma and high gamma frequencies (30-150 Hz) are largely uncorrelated (<90%) at 4 mm, the smallest spacing of the high-density arrays. Thus, ECoG arrays smaller than 4 mm have significant promise for increasing signal resolution at high frequencies, whereas less additional gain is achieved for lower frequencies. Significance. Our findings quantitatively demonstrate the dependence of ECoG spatial resolution on the neural frequency of interest. We demonstrate that this relationship is consistent across patients and across cortical areas during activity.

J	Mert, A				Mert, Ahmet			ECG feature extraction based on the bandwidth properties of variational mode decomposition	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						variational mode decomposition; electrocardiogram; arrhythmia; classification	WAVELET TRANSFORM; EEG SIGNALS; DECISION TREE; CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURE; RECOGNITION; IMPACT; DOMAIN	It is a difficult process to detect abnormal heart beats, known as arrhythmia, in long-term ECG recording. Thus, computer-aided diagnosis systems have become a supportive tool for helping physicians improve the diagnostic accuracy of heartbeat detection. This paper explores the bandwidth properties of the modes obtained using variational mode decomposition (VMD) to classify arrhythmia electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. VMD is an enhanced version of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm for analyzing non-linear and non-stationary signals. It decomposes the signal into a set of band-limited oscillations called modes. ECG signals from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database are decomposed using VMD, and the amplitude modulation bandwidth BAM, the frequency modulation bandwidth BFM and the total bandwidth B of the modes are used as feature vectors to detect heartbeats such as normal (N), premature ventricular contraction (V), left bundle branch block (L), right bundle branch block (R), paced beat (P) and atrial premature beat (A). Bandwidth estimations based on the instantaneous frequency (IF) and amplitude (IA) spectra of the modes indicate that the proposed VMD-based features have sufficient class discrimination capability regarding ECG beats. Moreover, the extracted features using the bandwidths (BAM, BFM and B) of four modes are used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy rates of several classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbor classifier (k-NN), the decision tree (DT), the artificial neural network (ANN), the bagged decision tree (BDT), the AdaBoost decision tree (ABDT) and random sub-spaced k-NN (RSNN) for N, R, L, V, P, and A beats. The performance of the proposed VMD-based feature extraction with a BDT classifier has accuracy rates of 99.06%, 99.00%, 99.40%, 99.51%, 98.72%, 98.71%, and 99.02% for overall, N-, R-, L-, V-, P-, and A-type ECG beats, respectively.

Glutamatergic theories of psychosis propose that hypofunction of NMDA receptors (on pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons) causes a loss of synaptic gain control. We measured changes in neuronal effective connectivity underlying the MMN using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), where the gain (excitability) of superficial pyramidal cells is explicitly parameterised. EEG data were obtained during a MMN task-for 24 patients with psychosis, 25 of their first-degree unaffected relatives, and 35 controls-and DCM was used to estimate the excitability (modeled as self-inhibition) of (source-specific) superficial pyramidal populations. The MMN sources, based on previous research, included primary and secondary auditory cortices, and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Both patients with psychosis and unaffected relatives (to a lesser degree) showed increased excitability in right inferior frontal gyrus across task conditions, compared to controls. Furthermore, in the same region, both patients and their relatives showed a reversal of the normal response to deviant stimuli; that is, a decrease in excitability in comparison to standard conditions. Our results suggest that psychosis and genetic risk for the illness are associated with both context-dependent (condition-specific) and context-independent abnormalities of the excitability of superficial pyramidal cell populations in the MMN paradigm. These abnormalities could relate to NMDA receptor hypofunction on both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, and appear to be linked to the genetic aetiology of the illness, thereby constituting potential endophenotypes for psychosis.

Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide relatively easy, reliable and high speed communication. However, the performance is still not satisfactory, especially in some users who are not able to generate strong enough SSVEP signals. This work aims to strengthen a user's SSVEP by alpha down-regulating neurofeedback training (NFT) and consequently improve the performance of the user in using SSVEP-based BCIs. Approach. An experiment with two steps was designed and conducted. The first step was to investigate the relationship between the resting alpha activity and the SSVEP-based BCI performance, in order to determine the training parameter for the NFT. Then in the second step, half of the subjects with 'low' performance (i.e. BCI classification accuracy <80%) were randomly assigned to a NFT group to perform a real-time NFT, and the rest half to a non-NFT control group for comparison. Main results. The first step revealed a significant negative correlation between the BCI performance and the individual alpha band (IAB) amplitudes in the eyes-open resting condition in a total of 33 subjects. In the second step, it was found that during the IAB down-regulating NFT, on average the subjects were able to successfully decrease their IAB amplitude over training sessions. More importantly, the NFT group showed an average increase of 16.5% in the SSVEP signal SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and an average increase of 20.3% in the BCI classification accuracy, which was significant compared to the non-NFT control group. Significance. These findings indicate that the alpha down-regulating NFT can be used to improve the SSVEP signal quality and the subjects' performance in using SSVEP-based BCIs. It could be helpful to the SSVEP related studies and would contribute to more effective SSVEP-based BCI applications.

There is an increasing necessity to use these measures in early diagnosis and pathology progression; however, there is a lack of studies addressing how reliable they are. Here, we provide the first test-retest reliability estimate of MEG power in resting-state at sensor and source space. In this study, we recorded 3 sessions of resting-state MEG activity from 24 healthy subjects with an interval of a week between each session. Power values were estimated at sensor and source space with beamforming for classical frequency bands: delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), low beta (13-20 Hz), high beta (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz). Then, test-retest reliability was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We also evaluated the relation between source power and the within-subject variability. In general, ICC of theta, alpha, and low beta power was fairly high (ICC>0.6) while in delta and gamma power was lower. In source space, fronto-posterior alpha, frontal beta, and medial temporal theta showed the most reliable profiles. Signal-to-noise ratio could be partially responsible for reliability as low signal intensity resulted in high within-subject variability, but also the inherent nature of some brain rhythms in resting-state might be driving these reliability patterns. In conclusion, our results described the reliability of MEG power estimates in each frequency band, which could be considered in disease characterization or clinical trials.

The IFEs are amongst the most commonly encountered epilepsy syndromes affecting children. They are fascinating disorders that hold many "treats" for both clinicians and researchers. For example, the IFEs pose many of the most interesting questions central to epileptology: how are functional brain networks involved in the manifestation of epilepsy? What are the shared mechanisms of comorbidity between epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders? How do focal EEG discharges impact cognitive functioning? What explains the age-related expression of these syndromes? Why are EEG discharges and seizures so tightly locked to slow-wave sleep? In the last few decades, the clinical symptomatology and the respective courses of many IFEs have been described, although they are still not widely appreciated beyond the specialist community. Most neurologists would recognise the core syndromes of IFE to comprise: benign epilepsy of childhood with centro-temporal spikes or Rolandic epilepsy (BECTS/RE); Panayiotopoulos syndrome; and the idiopathic occipital epilepsies (Gastaut and photosensitive types). The Landau-Kleffner syndrome and the related (idiopathic) epilepsy with continuous spikes and waves in sleep (CSWS or ESES) are also often included, both as a consequence of the shared morphology of the interictal discharges and their potential evolution from core syndromes, for example, CSWS from BECTS. Atypical benign focal epilepsy of childhood also has shared electro-clinical features-warranting inclusion. In addition, a number of less well-defined syndromes of IFE have been proposed, including benign childhood seizures with affective symptoms, benign childhood epilepsy with parietal spikes, benign childhood seizures with frontal or midline spikes, and benign focal seizures of adolescence. The term "benign" is often used in connection with the IFEs and is increasingly being challenged. Certainly most of these disorders are not associated with the devastating cognitive and behavioural problems seen with early childhood epileptic encephalopathies, such as West or Dravet syndromes. However, it is clear that specific, and sometimes persistent, neuropsychological deficits in attention, language and literacy accompany many of the IFEs that, when multiplied by the large numbers affected, make up a significant public health problem. Understanding the nature, distribution, evolution, risk and management of these is an important area of current research.A corollary to such questions regarding comorbidities is the role of focal interictal spikes and their enduring impact on cognitive functioning. What explains the paradox that epilepsies characterised by abundant interictal epileptiform abnormalities are often associated with very few clinical seizures? This is an exciting area in both clinical and experimental arenas and will eventually have important implications for clinical management of the whole child, taking into account not just seizures, but also adaptive functioning and quality of life. For several decades, we have accepted an evidence-free approach to using or not using antiepileptic drugs in IFEs. There is huge international variation and only a handful of studies examining neurocognitive outcomes. Clearly, this is a situation ready for an overhaul in practice. Fundamental to understanding treatment is knowledge of aetiology. In recent years, there have been several significant discoveries in IFEs from studies of copy number variation, exome sequencing, and linkage that prompt reconsideration of the "unknown cause" classification and strongly suggest a genetic aetiology. The IFE are strongly age-related, both with regards to age of seizure onset and remission. Does this time window solely relate to a similar age-related gene expression, or are there epigenetic factors involved that might also explain low observed twin concordance? The genetic (and epigenetic) models for different IFEs, their comorbidities, and their similarities to other neurodevelopmental disorders deserve investigation in the coming years. In so doing, we will probably learn much about normal brain functioning. This is because these disorders, perhaps more than any other human brain disease, are disorders of functional brain systems (even though these functional networks may not yet be fully defined). In June 2012, an international group of clinical and basic science researchers met in London under the auspices of the Waterloo Foundation to discuss and debate these issues in relation to IFEs. This Waterloo Foundation Symposium on the Idiopathic Focal Epilepsies: Phenotype to Genotype witnessed presentations that explored the clinical phenomenology, phenotypes and endophenotypes, and genetic approaches to investigation of these disorders. In parallel, the impact of these epilepsies on children and their families was reviewed. The papers in this supplement are based upon these presentations. They represent an updated state-of-the-art thinking on the topics explored. The symposium led to the formation of internationalworking groups under the umbrella of "Luke's Idiopathic Focal Epilepsy Project" to investigate various aspects of the idiopathic focal epilepsies including: semiology and classification, genetics, cognition, sleep, high-frequency oscillations, and parental resources (see www.childhood-epilepsy.org). The next sponsored international workshop, in June 2014, was on randomised controlled trials in IFEs and overnight learning outcome measures.

A Walk Through Freeman Neurodynamics	COGNITIVE PHASE TRANSITIONS IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX - ENHANCING THE NEURON DOCTRINE BY MODELING NEURAL FIELDS	Studies in Systems Decision and Control		English	Editorial Material; Book Chapter							OSCILLATIONS	Freeman Neurodynamicsmay be complementary to conventional analysis of direct cortical recording. (ECoG) Freeman and Kozma have discovered nonlinear dynamical phenomena in cortex, involving the dendritic feltwork of Layer I. After Hilbert analysis, a strip of electrodes with sufficient spatial density reveals intermittent phase equilibria interrupted by similar to 10Hz phase collapses. This activity propagates via phase dispersion. Kozma and Freeman, Advances in cognitive neurodynamics, 2015, [10] propose that "the rapid propagation of phase dispersion over the hemisphere is the manifestation of the cognitive broadcast as described in Baars' global workspace theory." Sensory contents might be expressed in "spatial patterns of amplitude modulation of beta and gamma waves." This view emerges from Freeman K sets, including recent modeling using the concept of neuropercolation in sets of cellular automata. It also implies scale-free dynamics and inverse power-law distributions of cortical connectivity and EEG power. Yet what is it that is being propagated? In the conventional view, conscious visual percepts emerge from more than 40 visuotopical activity arrays linked bidirectionally, so that adaptive resonance enables a problem-solving trajectory terminating in a coherent visual gestalt via winner-take-all competition. New findings indicate that such visual gestalts emerge in at high levels of the visual hierarchy, whence they are accurately propagated to the prefrontal lobe, consistent with global workspace theory Panagiotaropoulos et al., Neuron 74(5):924-935, 2012, [12] and Baars et al., Front Psychol 4: 200, 2013, [2]. Conventional ECoG analysis may reflect the cognitive aspect of global binding and broadcasting, while Freeman Neurodynamics may convey intentional information-biological goals and conditioned stimuli. In Franklin's terms, the dendritic neuropil may shape action selection, while axonal resonance may support perceptual contents. One possibility is that cortex evolved a variety of Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) Kanerva, Sparse distributed memory, 2003, [7] and Snaider and Franklin, Cogn. Comput. 6(3):510-527, 2014, [13], a very efficient, non-local way to pack information into high-dimensional bit vectors. This suggests that some brain region acts as a minimal retrieval vector for episodic learning. The hippocampus and the claustrum may be candidates for such an SDM vector substrate.

Preresection intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) abnormalities predict seizure-onset zone and outcome in pediatric epilepsy surgery	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Invasive EEG; Nonlesional; ECoG; Electrocorticography	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; ETOMIDATE; RESECTION; CLASSIFICATION; REMIFENTANIL; FREEDOM; TUMORS	Objective: The predictive value of intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) in pediatric epilepsy surgery is unknown. In a population of children undergoing ECoG followed typically by invasive extraoperative monitoring (IEM) and resection, we aimed to determine the relationship between frequent ECoG abnormalities and the seizure onset zone and outcome after resection. Methods: We retrospectively identified 103 children with preresection ECoG of sufficient technical quality. ECoG records were scored based on electrode location and frequency, blinded to the seizure-onset zone and outcome. Electrographic seizure and spike locations were identified. Locations of seizures and spike populations were then compared to the location of seizure-onset zone defined by IEM using subdural electrodes and resection margin. Results: Electrographic seizures were identified in 11 (11%) of 103 patients. A spike population of one or more was noted in 79 (77%) of 103 patients. In 50 (63%) of 79 patients, spike populations correlated with seizure-onset zone location. The overall surgical outcome was good (ILAE 1 to 3) in 53 (52%) of 101 patients. Outcome was good in seven (78%) of nine patients when electrographic seizure location was resected. The best outcomes were obtained with resection of both the seizure-onset zone and ECoG abnormalities to include seizures and spike locations (22/33 good outcome, 67%, p = 0.008). There was a significantly better outcome in children with complete resection of ECoG-identified spike populations (14/26, 62% good outcome) compared to when none were resected (4/14, 29%, p = 0.043). Significance: Electrographic seizures and frequent spikes are frequently seen on preresection ECoG in children. The brain locations corresponding to these discharges are highly concordant with the seizure-onset zone; resection of these regions is correlated with good seizure outcome. Further research is needed to design interventions that increase the reliability of ECoG prediction of the epileptogenic zone and obviate the need for IEM.

When a beat is perceived, predictions about upcoming events can be generated. These predictions can influence processing of subsequent rhythmic events. However, statistical learning of the order of sounds in a sequence can also affect processing of rhythmic events and must be differentiated from beat perception. In the current study, using EEG, we examined the effects of attention and musical abilities on beat perception. To ensure we measured beat perception and not absolute perception of temporal intervals, we used alternating loud and soft tones to create a rhythm with two hierarchical metrical levels. To control for sequential learning of the order of the different sounds, we used temporally regular (isochronous) and jittered rhythmic sequences. The order of sounds was identical in both conditions, but only the regular condition allowed for the perception of a beat. Unexpected intensity decrements were introduced on the beat and offbeat. In the regular condition, both beat perception and sequential learning were expected to enhance detection of these deviants on the beat. In the jittered condition, only sequential learning was expected to affect processing of the deviants. ERP responses to deviants were larger on the beat than offbeat in both conditions. Importantly, this difference was larger in the regular condition than in the jittered condition, suggesting that beat perception influenced responses to rhythmic events in addition to sequential learning. The influence of beat perception was present both with and without attention directed at the rhythm. Moreover, beat perception as measured with ERPs correlated with musical abilities, but only when attention was directed at the stimuli. Our study shows that beat perception is possible when attention is not directed at a rhythm. In addition, our results suggest that attention may mediate the influence of musical abilities on beat perception. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Halme, HL; Parkkonen, L				Halme, Hanna-Leena; Parkkonen, Lauri			Comparing Features for Classification of MEG Responses to Motor Imagery	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EEG; BCI; MOVEMENT; SOFTWARE; NEUROFEEDBACK; EXECUTION; PATTERNS; FILTERS; SIGNAL	Background Motor imagery (MI) with real-time neurofeedback could be a viable approach, e.g., in rehabilitation of cerebral stroke. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) noninvasively measures electric brain activity at high temporal resolution and is well-suited for recording oscillatory brain signals. MI is known to modulate 10-and 20-Hz oscillations in the somatomotor system. In order to provide accurate feedback to the subject, the most relevant MI-related features should be extracted from MEG data. In this study, we evaluated several MEG signal features for discriminating between left-and right-hand MI and between MI and rest. Methods MEG was measured from nine healthy participants imagining either left-or right-hand finger tapping according to visual cues. Data preprocessing, feature extraction and classification were performed offline. The evaluated MI-related features were power spectral density (PSD), Morlet wavelets, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), common spatial patterns (CSP), filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP), spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD), and combined SSD+ CSP, CSP+ PSD, CSP+ Morlet, and CSP+ STFT. We also compared four classifiers applied to single trials using 5-fold cross-validation for evaluating the classification accuracy and its possible dependence on the classification algorithm. In addition, we estimated the inter-session left-vs-right accuracy for each subject. Results The SSD+ CSP combination yielded the best accuracy in both left-vs-right (mean 73.7%) and MI-vs-rest (mean 81.3%) classification. CSP+ Morlet yielded the best mean accuracy in inter-session left-vs-right classification (mean 69.1%). There were large inter-subject differences in classification accuracy, and the level of the 20-Hz suppression correlated significantly with the subjective MI-vs-rest accuracy. Selection of the classification algorithm had only a minor effect on the results. Conclusions We obtained good accuracy in sensor-level decoding of MI from single-trial MEG data. Feature extraction methods utilizing both the spatial and spectral profile of MI-related signals provided the best classification results, suggesting good performance of these methods in an online MEG neurofeedback system.

J	Kimura, K; Chitose, R; Yokosawa, K				Kimura, Keisuke; Chitose, Ryota; Yokosawa, Koichi			Alpha-band Amplitude During Memory Encoding Is an Index of Memory Performance	ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						alpha-band rhythm; memory; magnetoencephalography (MEG); statistical parametric mapping (SPM)	WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EEG-ALPHA; LOAD; THETA; TASK; RESPONSES; POWER; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MAINTENANCE	Alpha-band (8-13 Hz) rhythm during encoding of sequentially presenting memory items was recorded using a 76-channel magnetoencephalograph. In a memory task, seven images each with an arrow pointing up, down, left or right were presented sequentially. Thereafter, a recall number was presented. Each participant memorized the arrow directions in the order of presentation and recalled the direction of the arrow for the recall number, and responded by pressing a button. Each participant also took part in a control task, in which the participant looked at the same images as those in the memory task but pressed the button previously instructed. Ten right-handed male volunteers performed 280 epochs of the memory task and 120 epochs of control task. The amplitudes of alpha-band rhythm during presentation of midterm (3rd-5th) items were compared with those of beginning (1st and 2nd) items. Fifteen sensors showed significant differences (midterm > beginning) in the memory task (0.01 < p < 0.05 at 11 sensors, 0.001 < p < 0.01 at 4 sensors), while no sensors showed a significant increase in the control task. Using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) method, the region of increase in alpha-band rhythm from beginning to midterm was estimated to be located in the visual cortex and around bilateral temporal gyri. Additionally, the increase in amplitude from beginning to midterm was significantly greater before a correct answer than before a wrong answer (0.01 < p < 0.05 at 7 sensors and p < 0.001 at 1 sensor). Previous works demonstrated that alpha-band rhythm is increased by active inhibition of visual inputs that are irrelevant to memory. The region of increase estimated to be in the visual cortex agrees with previous works. An interpretation of our results is that since irrelevant visual inputs are successfully inhibited before a correct answer, the amplitude of alpha-band rhythm increases more than that before a wrong answer. These results indicate the possibility that alpha-band amplitude during memory encoding can be used as an index of memory performance.

Interests of chaotic models to study adult psychiatric disorders and developmental disorders	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						Nonlinear dynamic; Chaos theory; Psychiatric disorder; Developmental disorder; Developmental psychopathology	MOOD; BRAIN; INSTABILITY; COMPLEXITY; DYNAMICS	Background. - Many clinical and biological parameters have nonlinear chaotic fluctuations. These variations result in unexpected pseudo-random transitions. In these models, few risk factors can lead to unexpected phenomena if oscillations and self-reinforcement patterns occur. Complex rhythms could ease the ability of a physiological system to adapt and react quickly to a constantly changing environment. Objectives. -It has been proposed that several psychiatric disorders and developmental disorders are characterized by a loss of complex rhythm in favor of a more organized pattern. We examine evidence to support these assumptions in literatures. Methods. - We performed a literature review of the main computerized databases (Medline, PubMed) and manual searches of the literature concerning non dynamic rhythms in time series analysis, in adults with psychiatric disorder and children with developmental disorder. These results were interpreted through a developmental approach that highlights the role of the learning process in the emergence of abilities. Results. - Analysis of clinical scores and electroencephalographic data have found that subjects with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, tested over a time series, have lower chaotic rhythms compared with healthy subjects. Growing children share several properties of a complex system: the interdependence of developmental axes (motor, emotional, language, social skills), multiple hierarchical levels (i.e. genetic, biological, environmental, and cultural), the two-way transactions between the child and his environment, and the sensitivity to initial conditions. This could explain the difficulty to predict the emergence of abilities or the long-term prognosis of impairment in children. This limitation is not only due to errors in the explanatory model or the lack of explanatory variable. It is also caused by instability, which is a core characteristic of a chaotic system. Conclusion. - The study of chaotic rhythms in time-series clinical and nonclinical data (e.g. EEG, functional neuroimaging) could improve the prediction of an acute event, such as relapse of mood disorder. Moreover, the complex rhythms in children may play a major part in synchronicity during interactions with a caregiver, held as essential for later development of self-regulation skills, such as emotional stability.

Slowing of Hippocampal Activity Correlates with Cognitive Decline in Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease. An MEG Study with Virtual Electrodes	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; MEG; source-space; beamformer; virtual electrode; hippocampus; relative power; peak frequency	SIGNAL-SPACE SEPARATION; DELTA-DIPOLE DENSITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PATTERNS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; IMPAIRMENT; DYNAMICS; ATROPHY; ALPHA	Pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) starts in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Because of their deep location, activity from these areas is difficult to record with conventional electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). The purpose of this study was to explore hippocampal activity in AD patients and healthy controls using "virtual MEG electrodes". We used resting-state MEG recordings from 27 early onset AD patients [age 60.6 +/- 5.4, 12 females, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) range: 19-28] and 26 cognitively healthy age- and gender-matched controls (age 61.8 +/- 5.5, 14 females). Activity was reconstructed using beamformer-based virtual electrodes for 78 cortical regions and 6 hippocampal regions. Group differences in peak frequency and relative power in six frequency bands were identified using permutation testing. For the patients, spearman correlations between the MMSE scores and peak frequency or relative power were calculated. Moreover, receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted to estimate the diagnostic accuracy. We found a lower hippocampal peak frequency in AD compared to controls, which, in the patients, correlated positively with MMSE [r(25) = 0.61; p < 0.01] whereas hippocampal relative theta power correlated negatively with MMSE [r(25) =-0.54; p < 0.01]. Cortical peak frequency was also lower in AD in association areas. Furthermore, cortical peak frequency correlated positively with MMSE [r(25) = 0.43; p < 0.05]. In line with this finding, relative theta power was higher in AD across the cortex, and relative alpha and beta power was lower in more circumscribed areas. The average cortical relative theta power was the best discriminator between AD and controls (sensitivity 82%; specificity 81%). Using beamformer-based virtual electrodes, we were able to detect hippocampal activity in AD. In AD, this hippocampal activity is slowed, and correlates better with cognition than the (slowed) activity in cortical areas. On the other hand, the average cortical relative power in the theta band was shown to be the best diagnostic discriminator. We postulate that this novel approach using virtual electrodes can be used in future research to quantify functional interactions between the hippocampi and cortical areas.	[Engels, Marjolein M.
