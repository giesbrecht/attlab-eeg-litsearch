Methods: We investigated the possibility of applying the synchrosqueezing transform spectrum for TMS evoked EEG analysis. Synchrosqueezing is a special case of reallocation method which aims to give a high resolution and readable time-frequency representation. In order to evaluate the performance of it, we compared it with the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and Wavelet transform (WT). Simulated data based tests were applied to compare time and frequency resolution of spectrums from these methods. Then we used a modified neural mass model to simulate oscillations and the propagation evoked by TMS. The model could generate natural frequency of Brodmann Area 19, 7 and 6 evoked by TMS. Spectrums measured by the three algorithms were compared. Results: It showed that the synchrosqueezing outperforms than HHT and WT in detecting transient activity. Synchrosqueezing offers clearer instantaneous frequency information and it was more sensitive in detecting the TMS evoked oscillations. Conclusions: It suggests that synchroqueezing is a reliable analytical tool and it outperforms than HHT and WT in exploring the time-frequency features of TMS-evoked oscillations. Significance: It will contribute to investigating the TMS evoked oscillations and giving more details of the evoked activity.

Pharmacologically, hippocampal theta is heterogeneous (see dualistic theory) and can be differentiated into type I and type II theta. These individual EEG subtypes are related to specific cognitive and behavioral states, such as arousal, exploration, learning and memory, higher integrative functions, etc. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, structural and functional alterations of the septohippocampal system can result in impaired theta activity/oscillations. A standard quantitative analysis of the hippocampal EEG includes a Fast-Fourier-Transformation (FFT)-based frequency analysis. However, this procedure does not provide details about theta activity in general and highly-organized theta oscillations in particular. In order to obtain detailed information on highly-organized theta oscillations in the hippocampus, we have developed a new analytical approach. This approach allows for time-and cost-effective quantification of the duration of highly-organized theta oscillations and their frequency characteristics.

These functions can be related to their frequency and spatial patterns. These properties are relatively unknown in infants. The first year of life includes stages of significant growth neurologically and behaviorally. The present study is aimed to investigate infant brain development using high-density EEG(124 channel) collected on a weekly basis from 5 to 7 months of age. Spectral power and spatial topography of infant EEG were used to study the changing nature of infant brains during that time period. Data driven clustering analysis was used to blindly classify EEG spatial topographies as functions of frequency and time into different classes. Our results indicate that more differences in EEG spatial topographies are revealed in frequency domain than time domain (5-7 months). However, dynamic changes are further revealed in the spectral properties of classified spatial topographies, including shifts of frequency boundary and peak frequency, along the EEG spectrum (i.e., delta, theta, and alpha bands). These data provide insight on spectral structure of infant EEG and their dynamic patterns along maturation.

It is possible to examine this disease which is manifested in seizures by electroencephalography method. In this study, it was aimed to investigate EEG signals received from epileptic patients who have had seizures continuously during the day by applying wavelet transform. EEG records of 4 epileptic patients having 6 consecutive seizures were taken from the MIT EEG database. The signals were transferred to the time-frequency plane using Wavelet Transform (WT), where the energy values were investigated in delta, teta, alpha and beta sub-frequency bands. Then, the data was analyzed with statistical program and significant differences were observed. In conclusion, the method proposed in this study is thought to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment process by detecting brain oscillations between the seizures of epileptic.

Canonical Correlation Analysis of EEG for Classification of Motor Imagery	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 05-08, 2017	Banff, CANADA	IEEE		Electroencephalography; Brain Computer Interface; Canonical Correlation Analysis	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MU-RHYTHM; COMMUNICATION; TASKS	The performance of classification of various mental states using Electroencephalography (EEG) is often limited by the lack of information regarding the most discriminative channels and frequency bands. The paper proposes a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) of EEG recorded during bilateral imagined hand movement. CCA determines linear transformation of EEG that is maximally correlated with a transformed version of neural response to imagined movement. In the proposed method, the linear weights are identified for the spatial and spectral components of EEG signal. The study investigates how the CCA-based transformation of the signal improves discrimination between two movement classes. Further, two parallel CCA blocks, determine two transformations of EEG, one that maximizes correlation with the corresponding class, and other that minimizes the correlation with the mismatched class. Features derived using this approach are used for single-trial classification of bilateral imagined hand movement. Time-frequency patterns of EEG derived from the proposed approach illustrate their discriminative ability in mu and beta bands. An average classification accuracy of 61.12% (109 subjects) and 73.34% (Best 40 subjects) are obtained. The results indicate the scope of CCA to obtain time-frequency representations of EEG and for single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI).	[Robinson, Neethu; Thomas, K. P.; Vinod, A.

Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 15 male adolescent and young adult patients with MSD and 15 healthy controls. We characterized the temporal correlations of neuronal oscillations, both on long temporal scale (i.e., > 1 second) and short-to-intermediate temporal scale (i.e., <approximate to 1 second) using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and an analysis of the life-and waiting-time statistics of oscillation bursts respectively. The DFA exponents at alpha and beta bands, the life-time biomarker of alpha oscillation, and the life-and waiting-time biomarkers of beta oscillation were significantly attenuated in the patients compared with controls. Moreover, altered scalp distributions of some temporal correlation measures were found at alpha and beta bands in these patients. All these findings suggest that MSD is associated with highly volatile neuronal states of alpha and beta oscillations on short-to-intermediate and much longer time scales, which may be related to cognitive dysfunction in patients with MSD.

The methodology underlying the computation of such a stepsize is based on sampling the contrast function using the information carried by its frequency components. Epileptic ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG)-based simulations show that the proposed approach stands for the best extraction accuracy/numerical complexity tradeoff with 15 times faster execution time. This is compared to a deterministic implementation of the DelLR technique and its recently proposed Jacobi-based variant, namely the JDICA method.

A semi-automated method for rapid detection of ripple events on interictal voltage discharges in the scalp electroencephalogram	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; High frequency oscillations; Ripples; Automated detection	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; 80-500 HZ; EEG; EPILEPSY; GENERATION; NETWORKS; RHYTHMS; SPIKES; MARKER	Background: High frequency oscillations are emerging as a clinically important indicator of epileptic networks. However, manual detection of these high frequency oscillations is difficult, time consuming, and subjective, especially in the scalp EEG, thus hindering further clinical exploration and application. Semi-automated detection methods augment manual detection by reducing inspection to a subset of time intervals. We propose a new method to detect high frequency oscillations that co-occur with interictal epileptiform discharges. New method: The new method proceeds in two steps. The first step identifies candidate time intervals during which high frequency activity is increased. The second step computes a set of seven features for each candidate interval. These features require that the candidate event contain a high frequency oscillation approximately sinusoidal in shape, with at least three cycles, that co-occurs with a large amplitude discharge. Candidate events that satisfy these features are stored for validation through visual analysis. Results: We evaluate the detector performance in simulation and on ten examples of scalp EEG data, and show that the proposed method successfully detects spike-ripple events, with high positive predictive value, low false positive rate, and high intra-rater reliability. Comparison with existing method: The proposed method is less sensitive than the existing method of visual inspection, but much faster and much more reliable. Conclusions: Accurate and rapid detection of high frequency activity increases the clinical viability of this rhythmic biomarker of epilepsy.

In the first experiment, ten healthy participants were exposed to stimulation of the right median nerve while registering brain activity using 32-channel electroencephalography. Electrical stimulations were organized in four blocks of 20 stimuli with four intensities - 100%, 120%, 140%, and 160% - of the electrical pain threshold. In the second experiment, 15 healthy participants received electrical stimulation on the dominant median nerve before and during the application of a second painful stimulus. Raw data were converted into the time-frequency domain by applying a continuous wavelet transform. Separated domain information was extracted by calculating Parafac models. The results demonstrated that it is possible to capture a reproducible cortical neural response after painful electrical stimulation, more specifically at 250 milliseconds poststimulus, at the midline electrodes Cz and FCz with predominant delta-oscillations. The signature of the top-down nociceptive inhibitory mechanisms is delta-activity at 235 ms poststimulus at the prefrontal electrodes. This study presents a methodology to overcome the a priori determination of the regions of interest to analyze the brain response after painful electrical stimulation.

This study utilized our time-frequency method to examine sleep oscillations as characteristic features of human sleep EEG. Data were collected from a longitudinal sample of young children (n = 8; 3 males) at ages 2, 3, and 5 years. Following sleep stage scoring, we detected and characterized oscillatory events across age and examined how their features corresponded to spectral changes in the sleep EEG. Results indicated a developmental decrease in the incidence of delta and theta oscillations. Spindle oscillations, however, were almost absent at 2 years but pronounced at 5 years. All oscillatory event changes were stronger during light sleep than slow-wave sleep. Large interindividual differences in sleep oscillations and their characteristics (e. g., "ultrafast" spindle-like oscillations, theta oscillation incidence/ frequency) also existed. Changes in delta and spindle oscillations across early childhood may indicate early maturation of the thalamocortical system. Our analytic approach holds promise for revealing novel types of sleep oscillatory events that are specific to periods of rapid normal development across the lifespan and during other times of aberrant changes in neurobehavioral function.

Still, there is growing evidence that oscillatory activity-whether in the gamma band (30-120 Hz) or at higher frequencies is another important marker of hyperexcitable tissues. A major difficulty arises from the fact that interictal spikes and oscillations overlap in the frequency domain. This hampers the correct delineation of the cortex producing pathological oscillations by simple filtering. Here, we propose a nonlinear technique for fitting the spike waveform in order to remove it, resulting in a 'despiked' signal. This strategy was first applied to simulated data inspired from real stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) signals, then to real data. We show that despiking leads to a better space-time-frequency analysis of the oscillatory part of the signal. Thus, in the real SEEG signals, the spatio-temporal maps show a buildup of gamma oscillations during the preictal period in the despiked signals, whereas in the original signals this activity is masked by spikes. Despiking is thus a promising venue for a better characterization of oscillatory activity in electrophysiology of epilepsy.

However, the signal-to-noise (SNR) of PEPs is low. Here, using time-frequency analysis, we characterize the phase-locked and non-phase-locked EEG responses to pinprick stimulation, before and after secondary hyperalgesia. Methods: Secondary hyperalgesia was induced using high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of the left/right forearm skin in 16 volunteers. EEG responses to 64 and 96 mN pinprick stimuli were elicited from both arms, before and 20 min after HFS. Results: Pinprick stimulation applied to normal skin elicited a phase-locked low-frequency (<5 Hz) response followed by a reduction of alpha-band oscillations (7-10 Hz). The low-frequency response was significantly increased when pinprick stimuli were delivered to the area of secondary hyperalgesia. There was no change in the reduction of alpha-band oscillations. Whereas the low-frequency response was enhanced for both 64 and 96 mN intensities, PEPs analyzed in the time domain were only significantly enhanced for the 64 mN intensity. Conclusions: Time-frequency analysis may be more sensitive than conventional time-domain analysis in revealing EEG changes associated to secondary hyperalgesia. Significance: Time-frequency analysis of PEPs can be used to investigate central sensitization in humans. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Performing attention-related tasks in real life involves the need to ignore a variety of distractions and inhibit attention shifts to irrelevant activities. This study investigates electroencephalography (EEG) spectral changes during a sustained attention task within a real classroom environment. Eighteen healthy students were instructed to recognize as fast as possible special visual targets that were displayed during regular university lectures. Sorting their EEG spectra with respect to response times, which indicated the level of visual alertness to randomly introduced visual stimuli, revealed significant changes in the brain oscillation patterns. The results of power-frequency analysis demonstrated a relationship between variations in the EEG spectral dynamics and impaired performance in the sustained attention task. Across subjects and sessions, prolongation of the response time was preceded by an increase in the delta and theta EEG powers over the occipital region, and decrease in the beta power over the occipital and temporal regions. Meanwhile, implementation of the complex attention task paradigm into a real-world classroom setting makes it possible to investigate specific mutual links between brain activities and factors that cause impaired behavioral performance, such as development and manifestation of classroom mental fatigue. The findings of the study set a basis for developing a system capable of estimating the level of visual attention during real classroom activities by monitoring changes in the EEG spectra.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) including ripple and fast ripple oscillations (80-200 Hz and >200/250 Hz, respectively) are particularly of note due to their very close relationship to epileptogenicity, with the possibility that they could function as a surrogate biomarker of epileptogenicity. In contrast, physiological high-frequency activity plays an important role in higher brain functions, and the differentiation between pathological/epileptic and physiological HFOs is a critical issue, especially in epilepsy surgery. HFOs were initially recorded with intracranial electrodes in patients with intractable epilepsy as part of a long-term invasive seizure monitoring study. However, fast oscillations (FOs) in the ripple and gamma bands (40-80 Hz) are now noninvasively detected by scalp EEG and magnetoencephalography, and thus the scope of studies on HFOs/FOs is rapidly expanding.

Detecting deficits are vital in making a decision about the treatment plan as it can persist one year or more following a brain injury. The reliability of traditional cognitive assessment tools is debatable, and thus attention has turned to assessments based on electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate subtle post-concussive alterations. In this study, we calculated neurocognitive deficits combining EEG analysis with three standard post-concussive assessment tools. Data were collected for all testing modalities from 21 adolescent athletes (seven concussive and fourteen healthy) in three different trials. For EEG assessment, along with linear frequency-based features, we introduced a set of time-frequency (Hjorth Parameters) and nonlinear features (approximate entropy and Hurst exponent) for the first time to explore post-concussive deficits. Besides traditional frequency-band analysis, we also presented a new individual frequency-based approach for EEG assessment. While EEG analysis exhibited significant discrepancies between the groups, none of the cognitive assessment resulted in significant deficits. Therefore, the evidence from the study highlights that our proposed EEG analysis and markers are more efficient at deciphering post-concussion residual neurocognitive deficits and thus has a potential clinical utility of proper concussion assessment and management.

However, the mechanism of rTMS effect during this phase is still unclear. In this study, we stimulated the superior parietal lobe (SPL) using 5-Hz rTMS in 26 participants and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while they performed a delayed-recognition WM task. The analyses included the comparisons of event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) value variations in theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) band frequencies between conditions (rTMS vs. sham), as well as the correlations between different brain areas. Following rTMS, the ERSP values of theta-band oscillations were significantly increased in the parietal and occipital-parietal brain areas (P < 0.05*), whereas the ERSP values of alpha-band oscillations were significantly decreased in the parietal area (P < 0.05*). The ERSP value variations of theta-band oscillations between the two conditions in the left parietal and left prefrontal areas were positively correlated with the response time (RT) variations (by using rTMS, the more subject RT decreased, the more ERSP value of theta oscillation increased). The ERSP value variations of alpha-band oscillations in the left parietal and bilateral prefrontal areas were negatively correlated with RT variations (by using rTMS, the more RT of the subject decreased, the more ERSP value of alpha oscillation decreased). Inter-sites phase synchronization of theta-band EEG between the left parietal and left prefrontal areas, as well as alpha-band EEG between the left parietal and bilateral prefrontal areas were enhanced by rTMS. These results indicated that activities of both parietal and prefrontal areas were required for information storage, and these activities were related to the behavioral responses. Moreover, the connectivity between these two regions was intensified following rTMS. Thus, rTMS may affect the frontal area indirectly via the frontal parietal pathway.

But some important problems have not yet been benefitted from DWT, including epileptic focus localization, a key task in epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, the parameters and settings for DWT are chosen empirically or arbitrarily in previous work. In this work, we propose a framework to use DWT and support vector machine (SVM) for epileptic focus localization problem based on EEG. To provide a guideline in selecting the best settings for DWT, we decompose the EEG segments in seven commonly used wavelet families to their maximum theoretical levels. The wavelet and its level of decomposition providing the highest accuracy in each wavelet family are then used in a grid search for obtaining the optimal frequency bands and wavelet coefficient features. Our approach achieves promising performance on two widely-recognized intrancranial EEG datasets that are also seizure-free, with an accuracy of 83.07% on the Bern-Barcelona dataset and an accuracy of 88.00% on the UBonn dataset. Compared with existing DWT-based approaches in epileptic EEG analysis, the proposed approach leads to more accurate and robust results. A guideline for DWT parameter setting is provided at the end of the paper.

This is useful for people who have lost or present serial low limb motor difficulties in order to work in conjunction with an exoskeleton. Normally, the frequency bands that are used to detect the gait or stop intentions are related to mu and beta frequency bands. However, in order to enhance the electroencephalography signal quality, it is necessary to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. In the paper, a former research is complemented with the use of different types of frequency and spatial filters. A multi resolution analysis tool based on Hilbert-Huang transform is also introduced as a new processing tool and its results discussed with the help of a recent developed comparison index.

Traditional EEG analogue front end (AFE) requires a driven right leg (DRL) circuit that restricts the number of channels of the device. The authors are proposing a new DRL-less' AFE design, and have developed a wearable EEG device (NeuroMonitor), which is small, low-power, wireless, and battery operated. The EEG device with two independent channels was fabricated on an 11.35cm(2) PCB that contained a system-on-a-chip microcontroller, a low-noise instrument amplifier, a low-power Bluetooth module, a microSD, a microUSB, and a LiPo battery. The DRL circuit was eliminated by utilising the high CMRR instrument amplifier with differential inputs, and followed by a modified high-Q active Twin-T notch filter ((f(c)(Notch)=60Hz, -38dB). The signal was conditioned with a band-pass filter composed of a two-stage 2nd-order Chebyshev-I Sallen-Key low-pass filter cascaded with a passive 2nd-order low-pass filter (f(c)(LP)=125Hz) and a 1st-order passive high-pass filter (f(c)(HP)=0.5Hz). Finally, the signal was amplified to achieve an overall gain of 55.84dB, and digitised with a 16-bit delta-sigma ADC (256sps). The prototype weighs 41.8gm, and has been validated against a research-grade EEG system (Neuroscan).

However, where do EEG signals come from and what do they mean? The purpose of this paper is to argue that we know shockingly little about the answer to this question, to highlight what we do know, how important the answers are, and how modern neuroscience technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate neural circuits with high spatiotemporal accuracy might finally bring us some answers. Neural oscillations are perhaps the best feature of EEG to use as anchors because oscillations are observed and are studied at multiple spatiotemporal scales of the brain, in multiple species, and are widely implicated in cognition and in neural computations.

Scalp EEG Ictal gamma and beta activity during infantile spasms: Evidence of focality	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						West syndrome; High-frequency oscillations; Gamma activity; Beta activity; Infantile spasms; Seizure semiology	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; WEST-SYNDROME; EPILEPTIC SPASMS; SEIZURES; ACTIVATION; ONSET	Objective: We investigated temporal and spatial characteristics of ictal gamma and beta activity on scalp EEG during spasms in patients with West syndrome (WS) to evaluate potential focal cortical onset. Methods: A total of 1,033 spasms from 34 patients with WS of various etiologies were analyzed on video-electroencephalography (EEG) using time-frequency analysis. Ictal gamma (35-90Hz) and beta (15-30Hz) activities were correlated with visual symmetry of spasms, objective EMG (electromyography) analysis, and etiology of WS. Results: Prior to the ictal motor manifestation, focal ictal gamma activity emerged from one hemisphere (71%, 24/34) or from midline (26%, 9/34), and was rarely simultaneously bilateral (3%, 1/34). Focal ictal beta activity emerged from either one hemisphere (68%, 23/34) or from midline (32%, 11/34). Onsets of focal ictal gamma and beta activity were most commonly observed around the parietal areas. Focal ictal gamma activity propagated faster than ictal beta activity to adjacent electrodes (median: 65 vs. 170msec, p<0.01), and to contralateral hemisphere (median: 100 vs. 170msec, p=0.01). Asymmetric peak amplitude of ictal gamma activity in the centroparietal areas (C3-P3 vs. C4-P4) correlated with asymmetric semiology. On the other hand, most of the visually symmetric spasms showed asymmetry in peak amplitude and interhemispheric onset latency difference in both ictal gamma and beta activity. Significance: Spasms may be a seizure with focal electrographic onset regardless of visual symmetry. Asymmetric involvement of ictal gamma activity to the centroparietal areas may determine the motor manifestations in WS. Scalp EEG ictal gamma and beta activity may be useful to demonstrate localized seizure onset in infants with WS.

However, under certain conditions, pain intensity can substantially dissociate from stimulus intensity, e.g. during longer-lasting pain in chronic pain syndromes. How stimulus intensity and pain intensity are differentially represented in the human brain is, however, not yet fully understood. We therefore used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the cerebral representation of noxious stimulus intensity and pain intensity during 10 min of painful heat stimulation in 39 healthy human participants. Time courses of objective stimulus intensity and subjective pain ratings indicated a dissociation of both measures. EEG data showed that stimulus intensity was encoded by decreases of neuronal oscillations at alpha and beta frequencies in sensorimotor areas. In contrast, pain intensity was encoded by gamma oscillations in the medial prefrontal cortex. Contrasting right versus left hand stimulation revealed that the encoding of stimulus intensity in contralateral sensorimotor areas depended on the stimulation side. In contrast, a conjunction analysis of right and left hand stimulation revealed that the encoding of pain in the medial prefrontal cortex was independent of the side of stimulation. Thus, the translation of noxious stimulus intensity into pain is associated with a change from a spatially specific representation of stimulus intensity by alpha and beta oscillations in sensorimotor areas to a spatially independent representation of pain by gamma oscillations in brain areas related to cognitive and affective motivational processes. These findings extend the understanding of the brain mechanisms of nociception and pain and their dissociations during longer-lasting pain as a key symptom of chronic pain syndromes.

So far, ESI has been used primarily on interictal events. Emerging evidence suggests that ictal ESI is also feasible and potentially useful. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of ESI on ictal events using high-density electroencephalography (EEG). MethodsWe performed ictal ESI on 14 patients (9 with temporal lobe epilepsy) admitted for presurgical evaluation who presented seizures during a long-term (18 h) high-density EEG recording (13 with 256 electrodes and one with 128 electrodes), and subsequently 8 of them underwent epilepsy surgery (postoperative follow-up >1 year). Artifact-free EEG epochs at ictal nset were selected for further analysis. The predominant ictal rhythm was identified and filtered (1 Hz around the main frequency). ESI was computed for each time point using an individual head model and a distributed linear inverse solution, and the average across source localizations was localized. For validation, results were compared with the resection area and postoperative outcome. ResultsIctal ESI correctly localized the epileptic seizure-onset zone in the resection area in five of six postoperatively seizure-free patients. Interictal and ictal ESI were concordant in 9 of 14 patients and partially concordant in additional 4 of 14 patients (93%). Divergent solutions were found in only one of the 14 patients (7%). SignificanceIctal ESI is a promising localization technique in focal epilepsy.

Furthermore, frequency-specific synchronization of neuronal excitability within the gamma band (30-80 Hz) is attributable to a homeostatic balance between excitation and inhibition. However, our understanding of the physiological mechanism underlying gamma rhythms is based on animal models. Investigations of the relationship between GABA concentrations, glutamate concentrations, and gamma band activity in humans were mostly restricted to the visual cortex and are conflicting. Here, we performed a multimodal imaging study combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with electroencephalography (EEG) in the auditory cortex. In 14 healthy subjects, we investigated the impact of individual differences in GABA and glutamate concentration on gamma band response (GBR) following auditory stimulus presentation. We explored the effects of bulk GABA on the GBR across frequency (30-200 Hz) and time (-200 to 600 ms) and found no significant relationship. Furthermore, no correlations were found between gamma peak frequency or power measures and metabolite concentrations (GABA, glutamate, and GABA/glutamate ratio). These findings suggest that, according to MRS measurements, and given the auditory stimuli used in this study, GABA and glutamate concentrations are unlikely to play a significant role in the inhibitory and excitatory drive in the generation of gamma band activity in the auditory cortex.

EEG signals are recorded with multiple electrodes either by scalp or intracranial method. It is well proven tool for brain disease detection or prediction. These brain signals are recorded with multiple electrodes with sampling rate. Thus the very huge data need to process and hence computationally intensive. Different architectures have been proposed and implemented to get high performance with accuracy from the device. This proposed work covers comparative study of different efficient architectures of the EEG signal analyzer and designs biosignal processor using FPGA by establishing link between FPGA and PC with URART serial link. More or less of the architectures of EEG signal processing are mainly used for seizure detection. The basic objective of this paper is to understand the implementation of real tiem EEG analyser using FPGA and SoC, to design simple bisignal processor for EEG analysis and analyze architectures based on different performance parameters like frequency of operation, peak power consumption, technology, memory size (bits), accuracy, ADC Resolution, chip area, gates/SRAM.

Analysis of local dynamic changes surrounding Interictal Epileptic Spikes (IES) might improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that propel neurons to the hypersynchronization of IES in BECTS. Transient distant changes in the dynamics of neurons populationsmay also interact with neuronal networks involved in various functions that are impaired in BECTS patients. Methods: HD EEG (64 electrodes) of eight well-characterized BECTS patients (8 males; mean age: 7.2 years, range: 5-9 years) were analyzed. Unilateral IES were selected in 6 patients. They were bilateral and independent in 2 other patients. This resulted in a total of 10 groups of IES. Time-frequency analysis was performed on HD EEG epochs around the peak of the IES (+/- 1000 ms), including phase-locked and non-phase-locked activities to the IES. The time frequency analyses were calculated for the frequencies between 4 and 200 Hz. Results: Time-frequency analysis revealed two patterns of dysregulation of the synchronization between neuronal networks preceding and following hypersynchronization of interictal spikes (+/- 400 ms) in the epileptogenic zone. Dysregulation consists of either desynchronization (n = 6) or oscillating synchronization (n = 4) (4-50 Hz) surrounding the IES. The 2 patients with bilateral IES exhibited only local desynchronization whatever the IES considered. Distant desynchronization in low frequencies within the same window occurs simultaneously in bilateral frontal, temporal and occipital areas (n = 7). Significance: Using time-frequency analysis of HD EEG data in a well-defined population of BECTS, we demonstrated repeated complex changes in the dynamics of neuronal networks not only during, but also, before and after the IES. In the epileptogenic zone, our results found more complex reorganization of the local network than initially thought. In line with previous results obtained at a microscopic or macroscopic level, these changes suggested the variability strategies of neuronal assemblies to raise IES. Distant changes from the epileptogenic zone in desynchronization observed in the same time window suggested interactions between larger embedded networks and opened new avenues about their possible role in the underlying mechanism leading to cognitive deficits.

Here, we systematically review the studies that have examined resting-state MEG changes in AD and identify areas that lack scientific or clinical progress. Three levels of MEG analysis will be covered: (i) single-channel signal analysis, (ii) pairwise analyses over time series, which includes the study of interdependencies between two time series and (iii) global network analyses. We discuss the findings in the light of other functional modalities, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Overall, single-channel MEG results show consistent changes in AD that are in line with EEG studies, but the full potential of the high spatial resolution of MEG and advanced functional connectivity and network analysis has yet to be fully exploited. Adding these features to the current knowledge will potentially aid in uncovering organizational patterns of brain function in AD and thereby aid the understanding of neuronal mechanisms leading to cognitive deficits.

We included 205 nondemented amyloid positive subjects (63 subjective cognitive decline [SCD]; 142 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) with a baseline resting-state EEG data and >= 1-year follow-up. Peak frequency and relative power of 4 frequency bands were calculated. Relationships between normalized EEG measures and time to clinical progression (conversion from SCD to MCI/dementia or from MCI to dementia) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. One hundred eight (53%) subjects clinically progressed after 2.1 (IQR 1.3-3.0) years. In the total sample, none of the EEG spectral measures were significant predictors. Stratified for baseline diagnosis, we found that in SCD patients higher delta and theta power (HR [95% CI] = 1.7 [1.0-2.7] resp. 2.3 [1.2-4.4]), and lower alpha power and peak frequency (HR [95% CI] = 0.5 [0.3-1.0] resp. 0.6 [0.4-1.0]) were associated with clinical progression over time. In amyloid positive subjects with normal cognition, slowing of oscillatory brain activity is related to clinical progression. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In particular, we use EEG data from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) pilot study and apply several wavelet functions to determine the signals' time and frequency characteristics. The wavelet entropy and wavelet sample entropy of the continuous wavelet transformed data are then determined at various scale ranges corresponding to major brain frequency bands. Non parametric statistical analysis is then used to compare the entropy features of the EEG data obtained in trials with AD patients and age-matched healthy normal subjects under resting eyes-closed (EC) and eye-open (EO) conditions. The effectiveness and reliability of both choice of wavelet functions and the parameters used in wavelet sample entropy calculations are discussed and the ideal choices are identified. The result shows that, when applied to wavelet transformed filtered data, information entropy can be effective in determining EEG discriminant features, after selecting the best wavelet functions and window size of the sample entropy.

Acute Phencyclidine Alters Neural Oscillations Evoked by Tones in the Auditory Cortex of Rats	NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism; Phencyclidine; Auditory event-related potential; Neural synchrony; Schizophrenia; Rat model	NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; STEADY-STATE RESPONSE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINE RELEASE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYNCHRONY; KETAMINE; DEFICITS	Background/Aims: The onset response to a single tone as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) is diminished in power and synchrony in schizophrenia. Because neural synchrony, particularly at gamma frequencies (30-80 Hz), is hypothesized to be supported by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) system, we tested whether phencyclidine (PCP), an NMDAr antagonist, produced similar deficits to tone stimuli in rats. Methods: Experiment 1 tested the effect of a PCP dose (1.0, 2.5, and 4.5 mg/kg) on response to single tones on intracranial EEG recorded over the auditory cortex in rats. Experiment 2 evaluated the effect of PCP after acute administration of saline or PCP (5 mg/kg), after continuous subchronic administration of saline or PCP (5 mg/kg/day), and after a week of drug cessation. In both experiments, a time-frequency analysis quantified mean power (MP) and phase locking factor (PLF) between 1 and 80 Hz. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were also measured to tones, and EEG spectral power in the absence of auditory stimuli. Results: Acute PCP increased PLF and MP between 10 and 30 Hz, while decreasing MP and PLF between approximately 50 and 70 Hz. Acute PCP produced a dose-dependent broad-band increase in EEG power that extended into gamma range frequencies. There were no consistent effects of sub-chronic administration on gamma range activity. Acute PCP increased ERP amplitudes for the P16 and N70 components. Conclusions: Findings suggest that acute PCP-induced NMDAr hypofunction has differential effects on neural power and synchrony which vary with dose, time course of administration and EEG frequency. EEG synchrony and power appear to be sensitive translational biomarkers for disrupted NMDAr function, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Methods: We evaluated the consistency of two ictal spectral activation patterns (mean power change and power change onset time) in intracranial recordings across focal seizures from seven patients with clinically marked seizure onset zone (SOZ). We examined SOZ discrimination using both patterns in different frequency bands and periods of interest. Results: Activation patterns were proved to be consistent across more than 80% of recurrent ictal epochs. In all patients, whole-seizure mean activations were significantly higher for SOZ than non-SOZ regions (P < 0.05) while activation onset times were significantly lower for SOZ than for non-SOZ regions (P < 0.001) in six patients. Alpha-beta bands (8-20 Hz) achieved the highest patient-average effect size on the whole-seizure period while gamma band (20-70 Hz) achieved the highest discrimination values between SOZ and non-SOZ sites near seizure onset (0-5 s). Conclusions: Consistent spectral activation patterns in focal epilepsies discriminate the SOZ with high effect sizes upon appropriate selection of frequency bands and activation periods.

This study compared spectral power and oscillatory activity of EEG mu () rhythms between persons who stutter (PWS) and controls in listening and auditory discrimination tasks. EEG data were analyzed from passive listening in noise and accurate (same/different) discrimination of tones or syllables in quiet and noisy backgrounds. Independent component analysis identified left and/or right mu rhythms with characteristic alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) peaks localized to premotor/motor regions in 23 of 27 people who stutter (PWS) and 24 of 27 controls. PWS produced mu spectra with reduced beta amplitudes across conditions, suggesting reduced forward modeling capacity. Group time-frequency differences were associated with noisy conditions only. PWS showed increased mu-beta desynchronization when listening to noise and early in discrimination events, suggesting evidence of heightened motor activity that might be related to forward modeling deficits. PWS also showed reduced mu-alpha synchronization in discrimination conditions, indicating reduced sensory gating. Together these findings indicate spectral and oscillatory analyses of mu rhythms are sensitive to stuttering. More specifically, they can reveal stuttering-related sensorimotor processing differences in listening and auditory discrimination that also may be influenced by basal ganglia deficits.

The objective of this work is to implement a technique for characterizing and extracting significant, robust and informative features from EEG signals which are representative of the interictal migraine brain state. We extract three brain characteristics using brain network analysis of alpha phase synchronization; transient abnormality analysis using wavelet scale; and finally joint time-frequency analysis using AR modeling. Feature selection and reduction techniques were performed on the sub-features of these three mutually independent features, to combat the over-fit problem as well as to maximize the generality of the classifier. Interpretation of the reduced features resembled to previous migraine studies. Furthermore, extracted features were used as inputs to a 10-fold cross validated non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The results showed a 92.9% classification accuracy for MwA in the interictal stage from the normal control (NC) group. Findings suggest electrical features for the predisposition of migraine which can lead to possible preventative interventions in the future.

Among these technologies, resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recording and analysis has been widely applied by clinicians due to its relatively low cost and convenience. EEG reflects the electrical activity of the underlying neurons, and it contains information regarding neuronal population oscillations, the information flow pathway, and neural activity networks. Some features derived from EEG signal processing methods have been proposed to describe the electrical features of the brain with DOC. The computation of these features is challenging for clinicians working to comprehend the corresponding physiological meanings and then to put them into clinical applications. This paper reviews studies that analyze spontaneous EEG of DOC, with the purpose of diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of brain interventions. It is expected that this review will promote our understanding of the EEG characteristics in DOC.

EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interface for Decoding Motor Imagery Tasks within the Same Hand Using Choi-Williams Time-Frequency Distribution	SENSORS			English	Article						motor imagery; Choi-Williams time-frequency distribution; electroencephalography; time-frequency features; hierarchical classification; support vector machines; subject-independent analysis	HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SIGNAL; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; PROSTHESIS; MOVEMENTS; FEATURES; SEIZURE	This paper presents an EEG-based brain-computer interface system for classifying eleven motor imagery (MI) tasks within the same hand. The proposed system utilizes the Choi-Williams time-frequency distribution (CWD) to construct a time-frequency representation (TFR) of the EEG signals. The constructed TFR is used to extract five categories of time-frequency features (TFFs). The TFFs are processed using a hierarchical classification model to identify the MI task encapsulated within the EEG signals. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, EEG data were recorded for eighteen intact subjects and four amputated subjects while imagining to perform each of the eleven hand MI tasks. Two performance evaluation analyses, namely channel-and TFF-based analyses, are conducted to identify the best subset of EEG channels and the TFFs category, respectively, that enable the highest classification accuracy between the MI tasks. In each evaluation analysis, the hierarchical classification model is trained using two training procedures, namely subject-dependent and subject-independent procedures. These two training procedures quantify the capability of the proposed approach to capture both intra-and inter-personal variations in the EEG signals for different MI tasks within the same hand. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for classifying the MI tasks within the same hand. In particular, the classification accuracies obtained for the intact and amputated subjects are as high as 88.8% and 90.2%, respectively, for the subject-dependent training procedure, and 80.8% and 87.8%, respectively, for the subject-independent training procedure. These results suggest the feasibility of applying the proposed approach to control dexterous prosthetic hands, which can be of great benefit for individuals suffering from hand amputations.

J	Onojima, T; Kitajo, K; Mizuhara, H				Onojima, Takayuki; Kitajo, Keiichi; Mizuhara, Hiroaki			Ongoing slow oscillatory phase modulates speech intelligibility in cooperation with motor cortical activity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PREMOTOR CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN SCALP; PERCEPTION; ARTIFACT; ENTRAINMENT; SELECTION; DYNAMICS	Neural oscillation is attracting attention as an underlying mechanism for speech recognition. Speech intelligibility is enhanced by the synchronization of speech rhythms and slow neural oscillation, which is typically observed as human scalp electroencephalography (EEG). In addition to the effect of neural oscillation, it has been proposed that speech recognition is enhanced by the identification of a speaker's motor signals, which are used for speech production. To verify the relationship between the effect of neural oscillation and motor cortical activity, we measured scalp EEG, and simultaneous EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a speech recognition task in which participants were required to recognize spoken words embedded in noise sound. We proposed an index to quantitatively evaluate the EEG phase effect on behavioral performance. The results showed that the delta and theta EEG phase before speech inputs modulated the participant's response time when conducting speech recognition tasks. The simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment showed that slow EEG activity was correlated with motor cortical activity. These results suggested that the effect of the slow oscillatory phase was associated with the activity of the motor cortex during speech recognition.

Ear-EEG detects ictal and interictal abnormalities in focal and generalized epilepsy - A comparison with scalp EEG monitoring	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Long-term monitoring; Mobile EEG; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Wearable EEG; Ear-EEG; Ultra-long term monitoring	OUTPATIENT AMBULATORY EEG; SEIZURES; SPIKES	Objective: Ear-EEG is recording of electroencephalography from a small device in the ear. This is the first study to compare ictal and interictal abnormalities recorded with ear-EEG and simultaneous scalp-EEG in an epilepsy monitoring unit.& para;& para;Methods: We recorded and compared simultaneous ear-EEG and scalp-EEG from 15 patients with suspected temporal lobe epilepsy. EEGs were compared visually by independent neurophysiologists. Correlation and time-frequency analysis was used to quantify the similarity between ear and scalp electrodes. Spike-averages were used to assess similarity of interictal spikes.& para;& para;Results: There were no differences in sensitivity or specificity for seizure detection. Mean correlation coefficient between ear-EEG and nearest scalp electrode was above 0.6 with a statistically significant decreasing trend with increasing distance away from the ear. Ictal morphology and frequency dynamics can be observed from visual inspection and time-frequency analysis. Spike averages derived from ear-EEG electrodes yield a recognizable spike appearance.& para;& para;Conclusions: Our results suggest that ear-EEG can reliably detect electroencephalographic patterns associated with focal temporal lobe seizures. Interictal spike morphology from sufficiently large temporal spike sources can be sampled using ear-EEG.& para;& para;Significance: Ear-EEG is likely to become an important tool in clinical epilepsy monitoring and diagnosis.

The results of the brain topographic map (absolute power) in the alpha frequency band and the brain connectivity (coherence) in the delta frequency bands represented their anxiety and decision-making levels, respectively. These phenomena occurred in the brain activities of the athletes, which could be used to predict their performances during the competition. Moreover, the value of the correlation coefficient between the brain activity ranking and average performance score revealed a moderate to good relationship (r(s) = .586, p = .001).

Monitoring tools are required to evaluate biomarkers, identify biological events, and predict their outcomes. Being one of the valuable indicators, brain biomarkers derived from temporal or spectral electroencephalography (EEG) signals processing, allow for the classification of mental disorders and mental tasks. An EEG signal has a non-stationary nature and individual frequency feature, hence it can be concluded that each subject has peculiar timing and data to extract unique features. In order to classify data, which are collected by performing four mental task (reciting the alphabet backwards, imagination of rotation of a cube, imagination of right hand movements (open/close) and performing mathematical operations), discriminative features were extracted using four competitive time-frequency techniques; Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), Morlet Wavelet Transform (MWT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Filter Bank (WFB), respectively. The extracted features using both time and frequency domain information were then reduced using a principal component analysis for subset reduction. Finally, the reduced subsets were fed into a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MP-NN) trained with back propagation (BP) algorithm to generate a predictive model. This study mainly focuses on comparing the relative performance of time-frequency feature extraction methods that are used to classify mental tasks. The real-time (RT) conducted experimental results underlined that the WPD feature extraction method outperforms with 92% classification accuracy compared to three other aforementioned methods for four different mental tasks.

Single-pulse TMS of the human primary motor cortex induces a specific pattern of oscillatory changes, characterized by an early (30-200 ms after TMS) synchronization in the alpha- and beta-bands over the stimulated sensorimotor cortex and adjacent lateral frontal cortex, followed by a late (200-400 ms) alpha- and beta-desynchronization over the stimulated and contralateral sensorimotor cortex. As GABAergic inhibition plays an important role in shaping oscillatory brain activity, we sought here to understand if GABAergic inhibition contributes to these TMS-induced oscillations. We tested single oral doses of alprazolam, diazepam, Zolpidem (positive modulators of the GABAA receptor), and baclofen (specific GABAB receptor agonist). Diazepam and Zolpidem enhanced, and alprazolam tended to enhance while baclofen decreased the early alpha-synchronization. Alprazolam and baclofen enhanced the early beta-synchronization. Baclofen enhanced the late alpha-desynchronization, and alprazolam, diazepam and baclofen enhanced the late beta-desynchronization. The observed GABAergic drug effects on TMS-induced alpha- and beta-band oscillations were not explained by drug-induced changes on corticospinal excitability, muscle response size, or resting-state EEG power. Our results provide first insights into the pharmacological profile of TMS-induced oscillatory responses of motor cortex.

Effective assessments of electroencephalography during stroke recovery: contemporary approaches and considerations	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						stroke; electroencephalography; brain connectivity; neural oscillations; neurorehabilitation	EEG	Stroke is one of the leading causes of permanent disability worldwide, relying conventionally on extended periods of physiotherapy to recover functional ability. While neuro-imaging techniques and emerging neurorehabilitation paradigms have advanced our understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying stroke, recent evidence has renewed focus on quantifying features of cortical activity present in electroencephalography recordings to greatly enhance our understanding of stroke treatment and recovery. This Neuro Forum article reviews these key advances and discusses the importance of quantifying electroencephalography in future assessments of stroke survivors.

However, it is still unknown how consecutive swallows affect brain activity. Therefore, we sought to investigate differences in swallowing brain networks formed during consecutive swallows using a signal processing on graph approach. Data were collected from 55 healthy people using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Participants performed dry swallows (i.e., saliva swallows) and wet swallows (i.e., water, nectar-thick, and honey thick swallows). After standard pre-processing of the EEG time series, brain networks were formed using the time-frequency-based synchrony measure, while signals on graphs were formed as a line graph of the brain networks. For calculating the vertex frequency information from the signals on graphs, the proposed algorithm was based on the optimized window size for calculating the windowed graph Fourier transform and the graph S-transform. The proposed algorithms were tested using synthetic signals and showed improved energy concentration in comparison to the original algorithm. When applied to EEG swallowing data, the optimized windowed graph Fourier transform and the optimized graph S-transform showed that differences exist in brain activity between consecutive swallows. In addition, the results showed higher differences between consecutive swallows for thicker liquids. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While EEG signals are known to be reliable indicators of fatigue and drowsiness, they have not been used widely due to their size and form factor. However, the use of lightweight wearable EEGs alleviates this concern. Spectral analysis of EEG signals from these sensors using support vector machines (SVMs) is shown to classify drowsy states with high accuracy. The system is validated using data collected on 23 subjects in fresh and drowsy states. An accuracy of 81% is obtained at a per-subject level and 74% in cross-subject validation using SVM with radial basis kernel. Using a temporal aggregation strategy, the cross-subject validation accuracy is shown to improve to 87%. The EEG signals are also used to characterise the blink duration and frequency of subjects. However, classification of drowsy states using blink analysis is shown to have lower accuracy than that using spectral analysis.

These methods are currently advancing rapidly and continue to offer unparalleled insight in the near-to-real-time neural dynamics of speech processing. We provide a historically informed overview over dependent measures in the time and frequency domain and highlight recent advances resulting from these measures. We discuss the notorious challenges (and solutions) speech and language researchers are faced with when studying auditory brain responses in M/EEG. We argue that a key to understanding the neural basis of speech comprehension will lie in studying interactions between the neural tracking of speech and the functional neural network dynamics. This article is intended for both, non-experts who want to learn how to use M/EEG to study speech comprehension and scholars aiming for an overview of state-of-the-art M/EEG analysis methods.

Rigor and replication in time-frequency analyses of cognitive electrophysiology data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Time-frequency; Oscillations; Replication; Methods; Electrophysiology	GAMMA FREQUENCY; RESTING GABA; AMPLITUDE; NETWORKS; PREDICTS; RHYTHMS; SIZE; EEG	Cognitive electrophysiology is a subfield of neuroscience that focused on linking M/EEG data to aspects of cognition and the neurophysiological processes that produce them. This field is growing in terms of the novelty and sophistication of findings, data, and data analysis methods. Simultaneously, many areas of modern sciences are experiencing a "replication crisis," prompting discussions of best practices to produce robust and replicable research. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this discussion with a particular focus on cognitive electrophysiology. More issues are raised than are answered. Several recommendations are made, including (1) incorporate replications into new experiments, (2) write clear Methods and Results sections, and (3) publish null results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Adapted wavelet transform improves time-frequency representations: a study of auditory elicited P300-like event-related potentials in rats	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; P300 event-related potentials; phase-locking factor; spectral power; wavelet; rat	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; THETA OSCILLATION; P300; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; RESPONSES; DISORDER; MECHANISM; CAPACITY; NOVELTY	Objective. Active auditory oddball paradigms are simple tone discrimination tasks used to study the P300 deflection of event-related potentials (ERPs). These ERPs may be quantified by time-frequency analysis. As auditory stimuli cause early high frequency and late low frequency ERP oscillations, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is often chosen for decomposition due to its multi-resolution properties. However, as the conventional CWT traditionally applies only one mother wavelet to represent the entire spectrum, the time-frequency resolution is not optimal across all scales. To account for this, we developed and validated a novel method specifically refined to analyse P300-like ERPs in rats. Approach. An adapted CWT (aCWT) was implemented to preserve high time-frequency resolution across all scales by commissioning of multiple wavelets operating at different scales. First, decomposition of simulated ERPs was illustrated using the classical CWT and the aCWT. Next, the two methods were applied to EEG recordings obtained from prefrontal cortex in rats performing a two-tone auditory discrimination task. Main results. While only early ERP frequency changes between responses to target and non-target tones were detected by the CWT, both early and late changes were successfully described with strong accuracy by the aCWT in rat ERPs. Increased frontal gamma power and phase synchrony was observed particularly within theta and gamma frequency bands during deviant tones. Significance. The study suggests superior performance of the aCWT over the CWT in terms of detailed quantification of time-frequency properties of ERPs. Our methodological investigation indicates that accurate and complete assessment of time-frequency components of short-time neural signals is feasible with the novel analysis approach which may be advantageous for characterisation of several types of evoked potentials in particularly rodents.

The method is based on analysis of EEG signals with empirical mode decomposition (Hilbert-Huang transform). We consider noises and physiological artifacts on EEG as specific oscillatory patterns that cause problems during EEG analysis and can be detected with additional signals recorded simultaneously with EEG (ECG, EMG, EOG, etc.) We introduce the algorithm of the method with following steps: empirical mode decomposition of EEG signal, choosing of empirical modes with artifacts, removing empirical modes with artifacts, reconstruction of the initial EEG signal. We test the method on filtration of experimental human EEG signals from eye-moving artifacts and show high efficiency of the method.

Timely and accurate assessments of its modulation effects are very useful. This study evaluated rTMS modulation effects on electroencephalography (EEG) oscillation in patients with chronic DOC. Eighteen patients with a diagnosis of DOC lasting more than 3 months were recruited. All patients received one session of 10-Hz rTMS at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and then 12 of them received consecutive rTMS treatment everyday for 20 consecutive days. Resting-state EEGs were recorded before the experiment (T0) after one session of rTMS (T1) and after the entire treatment (T2). The JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised scale scores were also recorded at the time points. Our data showed that application of 10-Hz rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex decreased low-frequency band power and increased high-frequency band power in DOC patients, especially in minimal conscious state patients. Considering the correlation of the EEG spectrum with the consciousness level of patients with DOC, quantitative EEG might be useful for assessment of the effect of rTMS in DOC patients.

Detection of Turning Freeze in Parkinson's Disease based on S-transform Decomposition of EEG signals	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn			GAIT	Freezing of Gait (FOG) is a highly debilitating and poorly understood symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), causing severe immobility and decreased quality of life. Turning Freezing (TF) is known as the most common sub-type of FOG, also causing the highest rate of falls in PD patients. During a TF, the feet of PD patients appear to become stuck whilst making a turn. This paper presents an electroencephalography (EEG) based classification method for detecting turning freezing episodes in six PD patients during Timed Up and Go Task experiments. Since EEG signals have a time-variant nature, time-frequency Stockwell Transform (S-Transform) techniques were used for feature extraction. The EEG sources were separated by means of independent component analysis using entropy bound minimization (ICA-EBM). The distinctive frequency-based features of selected independent components of EEG were extracted and classified using Bayesian Neural Networks. The classification demonstrated a high sensitivity of 84.2%, a specificity of 88.0% and an accuracy of 86.2% for detecting TF. These promising results pave the way for the development of a real-time device for detecting different sub-types of FOG during ambulation.	[Quynh Tran Ly; Handojoseno, A. M.

However, EEG recordings are contaminated by other interferences, particularly facial and ocular artifacts generated by the user. This is specifically an issue during continuous EEG recording sessions, and is therefore a key step in using EEG signals for either physiological monitoring and diagnosis or brain-computer interface to identify such artifacts from useful EEG components. In this study, we aim to design a new generic framework in order to process and characterize EEG recording as a multi-component and non-stationary signal with the aim of localizing and identifying its component (e.g., artifact). In the proposed method, we gather three complementary algorithms together to enhance the efficiency of the system. Algorithms include time-frequency (TF) analysis and representation, two-dimensional multi-resolution analysis (2D MRA), and feature extraction and classification. Then, a combination of spectro-temporal and geometric features are extracted by combining key instantaneous TF space descriptors, which enables the system to characterize the non-stationarities in the EEG dynamics. We fit a curvelet transform (as a MRA method) to 2D TF representation of EEG segments to decompose the given space to various levels of resolution. Such a decomposition efficiently improves the analysis of the TF spaces with different characteristics (e.g., resolution). Our experimental results demonstrate that the combination of expansion to TF space, analysis using MRA, and extracting a set of suitable features and applying a proper predictive model is effective in enhancing the EEG artifact identification performance. We also compare the performance of the designed system with another common EEG signal processing technique-namely, 1D wavelet transform. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms 1D wavelet.

S-transform is a technique for analysis of any non-stationary time series in joint time-frequency frame. In this work, epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals have been taken from an available existing database and generalised S-transform is applied individually on different sets of EEG signals. Selective features like standard deviation and energy are evaluated from the joint time-frequency S-transform contour of the transformed signals and are eventually being classified using support vector machines (SVMs) and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifier. In this work, two different classification problems are addressed, namely (i) seizure and healthy (ii) seizure and inter-ictal, where both EEG signals of healthy and inter-ictal zone are considered to be in seizure-free class. For different cases investigated in this study, the highest overall classification accuracy of 98.44% is achieved using SVM classifier where as 100% accuracy is obtained using kNN classifier, which are comparable and even better than the results obtained in the existing literatures, analysed on the same dataset.

J	Chand, GB; Dhamala, M				Chand, Ganesh B.; Dhamala, Mukesh			Interactions between the anterior cingulate-insula network and the fronto-parietal network during perceptual decision-making	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Beta oscillation; Gamma oscillation; Large-scale networks; EEG source reconstruction; Granger causality	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; VON ECONOMO NEURONS; HUMAN BRAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SALIENCE NETWORK; COGNITIVE CONTROL; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	Information processing in the human brain during cognitively demanding goal-directed tasks is thought to involve several large-scale brain networks, including the anterior cingulate-insula network (aCIN) and the fronto-parietal network (FPN). Recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies have provided clues that the aCIN initiates activity changes in the FPN. However, when and how often these networks interact remains largely unknown to date. Here, we systematically examined the oscillatory interactions between the aCIN and the FPN by using the spectral Granger causality analysis of reconstructed brain source signals from the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from human participants performing a face-house perceptual categorization task. We investigated how the aCIN and the FPN interact, what the temporal sequence of events in these nodes is, and what frequency bands of information flow bind these nodes in networks. We found that beta band (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-100 Hz) bands of interactions are involved between the aCIN and the FPN during decision-making tasks. In gamma band, the aCIN initiated the Granger causal control over the FPN in 25-225 ms timeframe. In beta band, the FPN achieved a control over the aCIN in 225-425 ms timeframe. These band-specific time-dependent Granger causal controls of the aCIN and the FPN were retained for behaviorally harder decision-making tasks. These findings of times and frequencies of oscillatory interactions in the aCIN and FPN provide us new insights into the general neural mechanisms for sensory information-guided, goal-directed behaviors, including perceptual decision-making processes.

Drowsiness leads to deterioration in driver's performance and vehicle-handling abilities. This research aims at using time analysis techniques to automatically detect the level of drowsiness in EEG records. Noise from the EEG signals were removed by subjecting it to band-pass filtering with cut-off frequency 0.5 Hz to 60 Hz and then segmented into 5 second intervals. 1 EEG channel was used to compute 3 features s to differentiate the awareness and drowsiness stages. This method gets up to 85.7% of alertness and drowsiness correct detections rates. Both the stages can be distinguished based on the parameters and acquired results. Real time outputs can be obtained making it easily accessible. An automatic drowsiness detection system in vehicles can be employed using these parameters thereby decreasing the risk posed by drowsy driving. The algorithm developed here has been tested on samples obtained from The MIT-BIH Polysonographic Database on physionet.org.

Patients with schizophrenia had longer sleep latency than controls. In N2 sleep, the patients had significantly lower 0.5-1 Hz power and higher theta power in the left frontal region, and higher beta power in the left occipital region than did control subjects. In N3 sleep, the patients with schizophrenia had significantly higher alpha power in the left occipital region than did controls. These findings show distinctive EEG, sleep patterns in patients with schizophrenia, which may reflect brain dysfunction or medication effects.

A lot of neurological, psychological and psychiatric disorders have been evaluated by EEG. Traditional EEG data-analysis methods consider linear data and stationary processes. In particular, Fourier transform deals with signals that are composed of superimposed sinusoidal oscillations, and are signals of constant frequency and amplitude. This study analyzes non-linear and non-stationary data processing using Hilbert Huang Transform (HET), and proposes a new topography method that allows representing the brain activity. The Hilbert Transform performed on each IMF component, allows transforming the spatio-temporal data to time-frequency space, computing the amplitude and instantaneous frequency for every IMF at every time-step.

An evaluation of mental workload with frontal EEG	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; ALPHA	Using a wireless single channel EEG device, we investigated the feasibility of using shortterm frontal EEG as a means to evaluate the dynamic changes of mental workload. Frontal EEG signals were recorded from twenty healthy subjects performing four cognitive and motor tasks, including arithmetic operation, finger tapping, mental rotation and lexical decision task. Our findings revealed that theta activity is the common EEG feature that increases with difficulty across four tasks. Meanwhile, with a short-time analysis window, the level of mental workload could be classified from EEG features with 65% - 75% accuracy across subjects using a SVM model. These findings suggest that frontal EEG could be used for evaluating the dynamic changes of mental workload.	[So, Winnie K. Y.; Chan, Rosa H.

In addition to self-report, an objective pain assessment system can provide a more complete picture of the neurophysiological basis for pain. In this study, a robust and accurate machine learning approach is developed to quantify tonic thermal pain across healthy subjects into a maximum of ten distinct classes. Methods: A random forest model was trained to predict pain scores using time-frequency wavelet representations of independent components obtained from electroencephalography ( EEG) data, and the relative importance of each frequency band to pain quantification is assessed. Results: The mean classification accuracy for predicting pain on an independent test subject for a range of 1-10 is 89.45%, highest among existing state of the art quantification algorithms for EEG. The gamma band is the most important to both intersubject and intrasubject classification accuracy. Conclusion: The robustness and generalizability of the classifier are demonstrated. Significance: Our results demonstrate the potential of this tool to be used clinically to help us to improve chronic pain treatment and establish spectral biomarkers for future pain-related studies using EEG.

Recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG)studies show that cortical activity is concurrently entrained/synchronized to the rhythms of multiple levels of linguistic units including words, phrases, and sentences. Here we investigate whether this phenomenon can be observed using electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that is more widely available than MEG and ECoG. We show that the EEG responses concurrently track the rhythms of hierarchical linguistic units such as syllables/words, phrases, and sentences. The strength of the sentential-rate response correlates with how well each subject can detect random words embedded in a sequence of sentences. In contrast, only a syllabic-rate response is observed for an unintelligible control stimulus. In sum, EEG provides a useful tool to characterize neural encoding of hierarchical linguistic units, potentially even in individual participants.

Therefore, even though the down sampled and smoothed envelope of EEG gamma band power is correlated with fMRI fluctuations in the RSNs, it does not mean that the electrical substrates of the RSNs fluctuate with periods <100 ms. Based on the scale free properties of EEG microstates and their correlation with resting state fMRI fluctuations in the RSNs, researchers have speculated that truly high frequency electrical substrates may exist for the RSNs, which would make resting fluctuations obtained from fMRI more meaningful to typically occurring fast neuronal processes in the sub -100 ms time scale. In this study, we test this critical hypothesis using an integrated framework involving simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition, fast fMRI sampling (TR = 200 ms) using multiband EPI (MB EPI), and EEG/fMRI fusion using parallel independent component analysis (pICA) which does not require the down sampling of EEG to fMRI temporal resolution. Our results demonstrate that with faster sampling, high frequency electrical substrates (fluctuating with periods < 100 ms time scale) of the RSNs can be observed. This provides a sounder neurophysiological basis for the RSNs.

Its applications are however currently limited by a number of methodological issues, among which the difficulty in obtaining accurate source localizations. In particular, these issues have so far prevented EEG studies from reporting brain networks similar to those previously detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here, we report for the first time a robust detection of brain networks from resting state (256-channel) hdEEG recordings. Specifically, we obtained 14 networks previously described in fMRI studies by means of realistic 12-layer head models and exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) source localization, together with independent component analysis (ICA) for functional connectivity analysis. Our analyses revealed three important methodological aspects. First, brain network reconstruction can be improved by performing source localization using the gray matter as source space, instead of the whole brain. Second, conducting EEG connectivity analyses in individual space rather than on concatenated datasets may be preferable, as it permits to incorporate realistic information on head modeling and electrode positioning. Third, the use of a wide frequency band leads to an unbiased and generally accurate reconstruction of several network maps, whereas filtering data in a narrow frequency band may enhance the detection of specific networks and penalize that of others. We hope that our methodological work will contribute to rise of hdEEG as a powerful tool for brain research. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We hypothesized that the synchronization of interneurons could be detected as changes in the regularity of gamma oscillation rhythmicity. We used multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis, which can quantify the regularity of EEG rhythmicity, to investigate how the regularity of gamma oscillations changes over the course of a seizure event. We analyzed intracranial EEG data from 13 pediatric patients with focal cortical dysplasia. The MSE analysis revealed the following characteristic changes of MSE score (gamma oscillations): (1) during the interictal periods, the lowest MSE score (the most regular gamma oscillations) was always found in the SOZ; (2) during the preictal periods, the SOZ became more similar to the epileptogenic zone as the MSE score increased in the SOZ (gamma oscillations became less regular in the SOZ); and (3) during the ictal periods, a decreasing MSE score (highly regular gamma oscillations) propagated over the epileptogenic zone.

The epileptic detection in most previous research suffers from low power and unsuitability for processing large datasets. Therefore, a computerized epileptic seizure detection method is highly required to eradicate the aforementioned problems, expedite epilepsy research and aid medical professionals. In this work, we propose an automatic epilepsy diagnosis framework based on the combination of multi-domain feature extraction and nonlinear analysis of EEG signals. Firstly, EEG signals are pre-processed by using the wavelet threshold method to remove the artifacts. We then extract representative features in the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain and nonlinear analysis features based on the information theory. These features are further extracted in five frequency sub-bands based on the clinical interest, and the dimension of the original feature space is then reduced by using both a principal component analysis and an analysis of variance. Furthermore, the optimal combination of the extracted features is identified and evaluated via different classifiers for the epileptic seizure detection of EEG signals. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is investigated by using a public EEG database at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed epileptic seizure detection method can achieve a high average accuracy of 99.25%, indicating a powerful method in the detection and classification of epileptic seizures. The proposed seizure detection scheme is thus hoped to eliminate the burden of expert clinicians when they are processing a large number of data by visual observation and to speed-up the epilepsy diagnosis.

To better comprehend the processing of empathic pain, we report the frequency-dependent modulation of cortical oscillations induced by watching movies depicting pain using high-density electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and motor evoked potentials (MEP). Methods: Event-related desynchronization of EEG and MEG was assessed while participants viewed videos of painful (needle) or neutral (cotton swab) situations. The amplitudes of MEPs were also compared between the needle and cotton swab conditions. Results: The degree of suppression in alpha/beta band power was significantly increased, whereas that of. band power was significantly decreased, in the needle condition compared with the cotton swab condition. EEG revealed that significant differences in alpha/beta band were distributed in the right frontocentral and left parietooccipital regions, whereas significant. band differences were distributed predominantly over the right hemisphere, which were confirmed by source estimation using MEG. There was a significant positive correlation between the difference in. power of the two conditions and the visual analog scale subjective rating of aversion, but not in the alpha/beta band. The amplitude of MEPs decreased in the needle condition, which confirmed the inhibition of the primary motor cortex. Conclusion: MEP suppression supports that modulation of cortical oscillations by viewing movies depicting pain involves sensorimotor processing. Our results suggest that alpha/beta oscillations underlie the sensory qualities of others' pain, whereas the. band reflects the cognitive aspect. Therefore, alpha/beta and. band oscillations are differentially involved in empathic pain processing under the condition of motor cortical suppression.

J	Sharma, M; Pachori, RB; Acharya, UR				Sharma, Manish; Pachori, Ram Bilas; Acharya, U. Rajendra			A new approach to characterize epileptic seizures using analytic time-frequency flexible wavelet transform and fractal dimension	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; EEG; Epilepsy; Seizure; Analytic time-frequency flexible wavelet; transforms; Fractal dimension	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; LEAST-SQUARES; CLASSIFICATION; SERIES; EXTRACTION; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN; SYSTEM	The identification of seizure activities in non-stationary electroencephalography (EEG) is a challenging task. The seizure detection by human inspection of EEG signals is prone to errors, inaccurate as well as time-consuming. Several attempts have been made to develop automatic systems so as to assist neurophysiologists in identifying epileptic seizures accurately. The proposed study brings forth a novel automatic approach to detect epileptic seizures using analytic time-frequency flexible wavelet transform (ATFFWT) and fractal dimension (FD). The ATFFWT has inherent attractive features such as, shift-invariance property, tunable oscillatory attribute and flexible time-frequency covering favorable for the analysis of non-stationary and transient signals. We have used ATFFWT to decompose EEG signals into the desired subbands. Following the ATFFWT decomposition, we calculate FD for each subband. Finally, FDs of all sub bands have been fed to the least-squares support Vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. The 10-fold cross validation has been used to obtain stable and reliable performance and to avoid the over fitting of the model. In this study, we investigate various different classification problems (CPs) pertaining to different classes of EEG signals, including the following popular CPs: (i) ictal versus normal (ii) ictal versus interictal (iii) ictal versus non-ictal. The proposed model is found to be outperforming all existing models in terms of classification sensitivity (CSE) as it achieves perfect 100% sensitivity for seven CPs investigated by us. The prominent attribute of the proposed system is that though the model employs only one set of discriminating features (FD) for all CPs, it yields promising classification accuracy. Since, the proposed model attains the perfect classification performance it appears that a system is in place to assist clinicians to diagnose seizures accurately in less time. Further, the proposed system seems useful and attractive, especially, in the rural areas of developing countries where there is a shortage of experienced clinicians and expensive machines like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

The proposed method is to characterize some pathological EEG signals using some time-frequency distributions (TFD). TFDs are useful tools for analyzing the non-stationary signals such as EEG signals. We have used spectrogram (SP), Choi-Williams Distribution (CWD) and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Ville Distribution (SPWVD) in conjunction with Renyi entropy (RE) to calculate the best value of their parameters. The study is conducted on some case of epileptic seizure of EEG signals collected on a known database. The best values of the analysis parameters are extracted by the evaluation of the minimization of the RE values. The results have permit to visualize in time domain some pathological EEG signals. Also, the Renyi marginal entropy (RME) has been used in order to identify the peak seizure. The characterization is achieved by evaluating the frequency bands using the marginal frequency (MF).

Traditionally, EEG signals are recorded by positioning electrodes on the scalp and keeping them in place with glue, rubber bands, or elastic caps. This setup provides good coverage of the head, but is impractical for EEG acquisition in natural daily-life situations. Here, we propose the transparent EEG concept. Transparent EEG aims for motion tolerant, highly portable, unobtrusive, and near invisible data acquisition with minimum disturbance of a user's daily activities. In recent years several ear-centered EEG solutions that are compatible with the transparent EEG concept have been presented. We discuss work showing that miniature electrodes placed in and around the human ear are a feasible solution, as they are sensitive enough to pick up electrical signals stemming from various brain and non-brain sources. We also describe the cEEGrid flex-printed sensor array, which enables unobtrusive multi-channel EEG acquisition from around the ear. In a number of validation studies we found that the cEEGrid enables the recording of meaningful continuous EEG, event-related potentials and neural oscillations. Here, we explain the rationale underlying the cEEGrid ear-EEG solution, present possible use cases and identify open issues that need to be solved on the way toward transparent EEG.

In epilepsy, research of the past decade focused particularly on interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) > 80 Hz. The first large application of HFOs was in the context of epilepsy surgery. This is now followed by other applications such as assessment of epilepsy severity and monitoring of antiepileptic therapy. This article reviews the evidence on the clinical use of HFOs in epilepsy with an emphasis on the latest developments. It highlights the growing literature on the association betweenHFOs and postsurgical seizure outcome. A recent meta-analysis confirmed a higher resection ratio for HFOs in seizure-free versus non-seizure-free patients. Residual HFOs in the postoperative electrocorticogram were shown to predict epilepsy surgery outcome better than preoperative HFOrates. The review further discusses the different attempts to separate physiological from epileptic HFOs, as this might increase the specificity of HFOs. As an example, analysis of sleep microstructure demonstrated a different coupling between HFOs inside and outside the epileptogenic zone. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that HFOs are useful to measure disease activity and assess treatment response using noninvasive EEG and magnetoencephalography. This approach is particularly promising in children, because they show high scalp HFO rates. HFO rates in West syndrome decrease after adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment. Presence of HFOs at the time of rolandic spikes correlates with seizure frequency. The time-consuming visual assessment of HFOs, which prevented their clinical application in the past, is now overcome by validated computer-assisted algorithms. HFO research has considerably advanced over the past decade, and use of noninvasive methods will make HFOs accessible to large numbers of patients. Prospective multicenter trials are awaited to gather information over long recording periods in large patient samples.

In a 30-minute EEG and electrocardiogram recording, heart rate variability and EEG variability (measured by the variability of relative power in a modified alpha band = RAP) and their coupled oscillations were quantified using linear (least-square periodogram and magnitude square coherence) and nonlinear (Shannon entropy and mutual information) measures. These measures were compared between the three groups and correlated with outcome, adjusting for severity of sepsis. Results: Several measures of heart rate variability and EEG variability and of their coupled oscillations were significantly lower in patients with sepsis compared with controls and correlated with outcome. This correlation was not independent when adjusting for severity of sepsis. Conclusions: Sepsis is associated with lower variability of both heart rate and RAP on EEG and reduction of their coupled oscillations. This uncoupling is associated with the severity of encephalopathy. Combined EEG and electrocardiogram monitoring may be used to gain insight in underlying mechanisms of sepsis and quantify brainstem or thalamic dysfunction.

Dominant Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) resulting from wavelet-EMD operation are utilized to propose higher order statistics, entropy and root mean square (r.m.s) based features. One way ANOVA test has been performed for selecting r.m.s value as the most effective feature for the discrimination of ictal and inter-ictal stages in seizure patients using k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Comprehensive simulations are passed with a standard EEG dataset. It is found that the suggested scheme is accomplished with causing greater accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in comparison to that acquired by using an up to date method engaging the identical EEG dataset.

We propose a combination of a constrained independent component analysis (cICA) with an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to analyze electroencephalographic recordings from depressed or schizophrenic subjects during olfactory stimulation. Approach. EEMD serves to extract intrinsic modes (IMFs) underlying the recorded EEG time. The latter then serve as reference signals to extract the most similar underlying independent component within a constrained ICA. The extracted modes are further analyzed considering their power spectra. Main results. The analysis of the extracted modes reveals clear differences in the related power spectra between the disease characteristics of depressed and schizophrenic patients. Such differences appear in the high frequency gamma-band in the intrinsic modes, but also in much more detail in the low frequency range in the alpha-,theta- and delta-bands. Significance. The proposed method provides various means to discriminate both disease pictures in a clinical environment.	[Goetz, Th; Stadler, L.; Fraunhofer, G.; Lang, E.

We use some Time Frequency Distributions (TFDs) to analyze its nonstationarity. The analysis is conducted by the spectrogram (SP), the ChoiWilliams Distribution (CWD) and the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Ville Distribution (SPWVD). The studies are carried on some real EEG signals collected from a known database. The estimation of the best value of parameters for each distribution is achieved using the Renyi entropy ( RE). The time-frequency results have permitted to characterize some pathological EEG signals. In addition, the Renyi Marginal Entropy (RME) is used for the purpose of detecting the peak seizures and discriminates between normal and pathological EEG signals. The frequency bands are evaluated using the Marginal Frequency (MF). The EEG signal classiffication of two sets A and E containing normal and pathologic EEG signals, respectively, is performed using our proposed method based on energy extraction of signals from time-frequency plane. Also, the Moving Average (MA) is used as a tool to obtain better classification results. The results conducted on real-life EEG signals illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

When coupled with high-density electroencephalography (TMS/hd-EEG), TMS pulses revealed electrophysiological signatures of different cortical modules in health and disease. However, the neural underpinnings of these signatures remain unclear. Here, by applying multimodal analyses of cortical response to TMS recordings and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography, we investigated the relationship between functional and structural features of different cortical modules in a cohort of awake healthy volunteers. For each subject, we computed directed functional connectivity interactions between cortical areas from the source-reconstructed TMS/hd-EEG recordings and correlated them with the correspondent structural connectivity matrix extracted from dMRI tractography, in three different frequency bands (alpha, beta, gamma) and two sites of stimulation (left precuneus and left premotor). Each stimulated area appeared to mainly respond to TMS by being functionally elicited in specific frequency bands, that is, beta for precuneus and gamma for premotor. We also observed a temporary decrease in the whole-brain correlation between directed functional connectivity and structural connectivity after TMS in all frequency bands. Notably, when focusing on the stimulated areas only, we found that the structure-function correlation significantly increases over time in the premotor area controlateral to TMS. Our study points out the importance of taking into account the major role played by different cortical oscillations when investigating the mechanisms for integration and segregation of information in the human brain.

On optimal spatial filtering for the detection of phase coupling in multivariate neural recordings	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Optimization; Spatial filtering; Phase coupling; Neuronal oscillations; EEG; Reaction times	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CNV; DYNAMICS; POWER; TRANSFORM; MECHANISM; COMPONENT; AMPLITUDE	Introduction: Neuronal oscillations synchronize processing in the brain over large spatiotemporal scales and thereby facilitate integration of individual functional modules. Up to now, the relation between the phases of neuronal oscillations and behavior or perception has mainly been analyzed in sensor space of multivariate EEG/MEG recordings. However, sensor-space analysis distorts the topographies of the underlying neuronal sources and suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio. Instead, we propose an optimized source reconstruction approach (Phase Coupling Optimization, PCO). Methods: PCO maximizes the 'mean vector length', calculated from the phases of recovered neuronal sources and a target variable of interest (e.g., experimental performance). As pre-processing, the signal-to-noise ratio in the search-space is maximized by spatio-spectral decomposition. PCO was benchmarked against several competing algorithms and sensor-space analysis using realistic forward model simulations. As a practical example, thirteen 96-channel EEG measurements during a simple reaction time task were analyzed. After time-frequency decomposition, PCO was applied to the EEG to examine the relation between the phases of pre-stimulus EEG activity and reaction times. Results: In simulations, PCO outperformed other spatial optimization approaches and sensor-space analysis. Scalp topographies of the underlying source patterns and the relation between the phases of the source activity and the target variable could be reconstructed accurately even for very low SNRs (-10 dB). In a simple reaction time experiment, the phases of pre-stimulus delta waves (< 0.1 Hz) with widely distributed fronto-parietal source topographies were found predictive of the reaction times. Discussion and conclusions: From multivariate recordings, PCO can reconstruct neuronal sources that are phase-coupled to a target variable using a data-driven optimization approach. Its superiority has been shown in simulations and in the analysis of a simple reaction time experiment. From this data, we hypothesize that the phase entrainment of slow delta waves (< 1 Hz) facilitates sensorimotor integration in the brain and that this mechanism underlies the faster processing of anticipated stimuli. We further propose that the examined slow delta waves, observed to be phase-coupled to reaction times, correspond to the compound potentials typically observed in paradigms of stimulus anticipation and motor preparation.

Electroencephalographic alpha wave power suppression above the somatosensory cortex is thought to reveal a movement or attention type pattern when contrasted to a baseline. The proposed research attempts to reveal whether there are ADHD-related differences in the activity and nature of alpha EEG wave oscillations during observation-execution tasks. To do so, alpha power suppression through time, frequency and spatial analysis was performed. It is reasonable to assume that different processes may be present in the alpha band, but new research advises about the strong relevance of the somatosensory system during observation-execution processes and indeed, a disruption of this mechanism can lead to some developmental disorders. The results show significant differences in suppressing Mu rhythm for the control group and ADHD group, and also for the combined and inattentive subtypes. Differences were detected for 8-10 and 10-12 Hz frequency ranges in the case of the ADHD group and the combined subtype, and 8-10, 8-12 and 10-12 Hz in the case of the inattentive and hyperactive subtypes. Hence, from these findings it could be interpreted that the ADHD groups have a different conceptualization of external stimuli, and this was perceived in different EEG activity within the somatosensory area. In conclusion, this research could help to understand the mechanism underlying conceptual representation and behavioral performance associated with this disorder.

Neuronal oscillations and synchronicity associated with gamma-hydroxybutyrate during resting-state in healthy male volunteers	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Sodium oxybate; Gamma hydroxybutyric acid; Source localization; Lagged phase synchronization; Global omega complexity; EEG-behavioral dissociation; Sedation	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; PERMUTATION ENTROPY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; THETA-RHYTHM; EEG	Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a putative neurotransmitter, a drug of abuse, an anesthetic agent, and a treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. In previous electroencephalography (EEG) studies, GHB was shown to induce an electrophysiological pattern of "paradoxical EEG-behavioral dissociation" characterized by increased delta and theta oscillations usually associated with sleep during awake states. However, no detailed source localization of these alterations and no connectivity analyses have been performed yet. We tested the effects of GHB (20 and 35 mg/kg, p.o.) on current source density (CSD), lagged phase synchronization (LPS), and global omega complexity (GOC) of neuronal oscillations in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over study in 19 healthy, male participants using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) of resting-state high-density EEG recordings. Compared to placebo, GHB increased CSD of theta oscillations (5-7 Hz) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and alpha1 (8-10 Hz) oscillations in the anterior cingulate cortex. Higher blood plasma values were associated with higher LPS values of delta (2-4 Hz) oscillations between the PCC and the right inferior parietal lobulus. Additionally, GHB decreased GOC of alpha1 oscillations. These findings indicate that alterations in neuronal oscillations in the PCC mediate the psychotropic effects of GHB. Theta oscillations emerging from the PCC in combination with stability of functional connectivity within the default mode network might explain the GHB-related "paradoxical EEG-behavioral dissociation." Our findings related to GOC suggest a reduced number of relatively independent neuronal processes, an effect that has also been demonstrated for other anesthetic agents.

The illusion is promoted by the spatial and temporal contingencies of visual inputs near a fake hand and physical touches to the real hand. The neural basis of this phenomenon is not fully understood. We hypothesized that the RHI is associated with a fronto-parietal circuit, and the goal of this study was to determine the dynamics of neural oscillation associated with this phenomenon. We measured electroencephalography while delivering spatially congruent/incongruent visuo-tactile stimulations to fake and real hands. We applied time-frequency analyses and calculated renormalized partial directed coherence (rPDC) to examine cortical dynamics during the bodily illusion. When visuo-tactile stimulation was spatially congruent, and the fake and real hands were aligned, we observed a reduced causal relationship from the medial frontal to the parietal regions with respect to baseline, around 200 ms post-stimulus. This change in rPDC was negatively correlated with a subjective report of the RHI intensity. Moreover, we observed a link between the proprioceptive drift and an increased causal relationship from the parietal cortex to the right somatosensory cortex during a relatively late period (550-750 ms post-stimulus). These findings suggest a two-stage process in which (1) reduced influence from the medial frontal regions over the parietal areas unlocks the mechanisms that preserve body integrity, allowing RHI to emerge; and (2) information processed at the parietal cortex is back-projected to the somatosensory cortex contralateral to the real hand, inducing proprioceptive drift.

These signals are highly nonlinear and nonstationary, and some specific patterns exist for certain disease types that are hard to develop an automatic epileptic seizure detection system. This paper discussed statistical mechanics of complex networks, which inherit the characteristic properties of electroencephalography signals, for feature extraction via a horizontal visibility algorithm in order to reduce processing time and complexity. The algorithm transforms a time series signal into a complex network, which some features are abbreviated. The statistical mechanics are calculated to capture distinctions pertaining to certain diseases to form a feature vector. The feature vector is classified by multiclass classification via a k-nearest neighbor classifier, a multilayer perceptron neural network, and a support vector machine with a 10-fold cross-validation criterion. In performance evaluation of proposed method with healthy, seizure-free interval, and seizure signals, firstly, input data length is regarded among some practical signal samples by optimizing between accuracy-processing time, and the proposed method yields outstanding performance on the average classification accuracy for 3-class problems mainly for detection of seizure-free interval and seizure signals and acceptable results for 2-class and 5-class problems comparing with conventional methods. The proposed method is another tool that can be used for classifying signal patterns, as an alternative to time/frequency analyses.

However, the causal role of neural oscillations in regulating cortico-cortical signal transmission has so far not been directly demonstrated. To date, due to methodological limitations, studies on the online modulatory mechanisms of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)-induced neural oscillations are confined to the primary motor cortex. To address the causal role of oscillatory activity in modulating cortico-cortical signal transmission, we have established a new method using concurrent tACS, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Through tACS, we introduced 6-Hz (theta) oscillatory activity in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). During tACS, we applied single-pulse TMS over the DLPFC at different phases of tACS and assessed propagation of TMS-induced neural activity with EEG. We show that tACS-induced theta oscillations modulate the propagation of TMS-induced activity in a phase-dependent manner and that phase-dependent modulation is not simply explained by the instantaneous amplitude of tACS. The results demonstrate a phase-dependent modulatory mechanism of tACS at a cortical network level, which is consistent with a causal role of neural oscillations in regulating the efficacy of signal transmission in the brain.

This work demonstrates the development of a first BCI system in INAYA Medical College based on electroencephalography pattern recognition. A BCI system recorded the activity of the brain and classified it into two different classes: up and down movements. Both offline and online BCI systems were handled. The offline approach was tested using data set provided by University of Tubingen, while the online approach was designed using real-time EEG data that recorded using five scalp electrodes including the reference electrode. 'Blind Source Separation' by independent component analysis was used to remove the artefacts contaminated signal to get artefact-free signal from which certain features were extracted by applying various techniques in both time and frequency domains. The features were fed to five different types of classifiers where classification accuracy reached 90%.

Switching direction affects switching costs: Behavioral, ERP and time frequency analyses of intra-sentential codeswitching	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Intra-sentential codeswitching; Bilingualism; Event-related potentials; Time-frequency analysis	BILINGUAL WORD RECOGNITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; UNIFICATION; INHIBITION; DYNAMICS; LEVEL	Bilinguals have the unique ability to produce utterances that switch between languages. Most language switching research has focused on isolated, unrelated items, which emphasizes separation of the languages. Fewer studies examined the cognitive and neural mechanisms of switching languages in natural discourse. The present study examined the effect of codeswitching direction on the comprehension of intra-sentential codeswitching in Spanish-English bilinguals, using self-paced reading behavioral measurements (Experiment 1) and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements (Experiment 2), analyzed via both event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency analysis (TFR). Reading times showed a significant switching cost for codeswitched sentences in both codeswitching directions, though switching costs were somewhat higher into the dominant language than into the weaker language. ERPs showed that codeswitched as compared to non-switched words elicited a late positivity, but only when switching from the dominant into the weaker language, not in the reverse direction. TFRs showed complementary and converging results: switches into the weaker language resulted in a power decrease in lower beta band while switches into the dominant language resulted in a power increase in theta band. These multi-method findings provide novel insights into neurocognitive resources engaged in the comprehension of intra-sentential codeswitches related to sentence-level restructuring processes to activate and access the weaker language.

Brainstem Influence on Thalamocortical Oscillations during Anesthesia Emergence	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; EEG; anesthesia; thalamus; brainstem; spindles; spectrum; emergence	VENTROLATERAL PREOPTIC NUCLEUS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; VOLATILE ANESTHETICS; SLEEP-WAKE; PROPOFOL; CONSCIOUSNESS; NEURONS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MECHANISMS; CONTRIBUTES	Theories of mechanisms that impair or prevent consciousness during anesthesia that are related to thalamocortical oscillations have been proposed. Many methods of EEG analysis have been proposed as measures of anesthetic effects but only a few have potential to provide measures of those anesthetic effects that are directly related to thalamocortical oscillations. Some of these methods will be explained and demonstrated with examples chosen to provide evidence for or against two of the proposed mechanisms. The first of the two mechanisms to be addressed is the "traveling peak" (Ching et al., 2010), which relates to anesthetic agents synchronizing neural oscillations that occur in subjects who are awake and reducing their frequency from the gamma (25-40 Hz) to the beta range (13-24 Hz) as a state of sedation develops. The mechanism continues to lower the frequency of this oscillation to the alpha (8-12 Hz) range. In the alpha frequency range, responses to sounds and words stop. It has been proposed that the mechanism changes fundamentally at this point and the oscillations are not compatible with consciousness. The second mechanism that will be addressed is a modification of the generally accepted mechanism for the spindle oscillations that occur during natural sleep (Steriade et al., 1993a, b). These two different mechanisms imply two different patterns for changes in the frequency of the thalamocortical oscillations during emergence. The first mechanism implies that the frequency of the oscillations should increase from the alpha range to the beta range during emergence. The "spindle" mechanism implies that the frequency of the oscillation would not increase much beyond the alpha range. Examples of EEG recordings during anesthesia and emergence from anesthesia were found which were consistent with either mechanism alone or both mechanisms at the same time. Neither theory was able to explain all examples. It is possible that both mechanisms can occur and that brainstem activity may influence the characteristics of emergence. The brainstem activity in question may be influenced by nociception and analgesic supplementation. It may be possible to control the path of emergence by controlling brainstem activity with opioids and other agents in order to allow the patient to awaken without going through an excitement phase or delirium at the transition to consciousness.

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can potentially stimulate the brain in-phase to its natural oscillations as recorded by electroencephalography (EEG), but matching these oscillations is a challenging problem due to the complex and time-varying nature of the EEG signals. Here we address this challenge by developing and testing a novel approach intended to deliver tACS phase-locked to the activity of the underlying brain region in real-time. This novel approach extracts phase and frequency from a segment of EEG, then forecasts the signal to control the stimulation. A careful tuning of the EEG segment length and prediction horizon is required and has been investigated here for different EEG frequency bands. The algorithm was tested on EEG data from 5 healthy volunteers. Algorithm performance was quantified in terms of phase-locking values across a variety of EEG frequency bands. Phase-locking performance was found to be consistent across individuals and recording locations. With current parameters, the algorithm performs best when tracking oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), with a phase-locking value of 0.77 +/- 0.08. Performance was maximized when the frequency band of interest had a dominant frequency that was stable over time. The algorithm performs faster, and provides better phase-locked stimulation, compared to other recently published algorithms devised for this purpose. The algorithm is suitable for use in future studies of phase-locked tACS in preclinical and clinical applications.

The collected EEG signals were first decomposed into time and frequency domain representations using continuous wavelet transformation. Based on the wavelet coefficients, conditional sampling and synchronous phase average technique are proposed to assess the phase synchronization of a rhythm by analyzing the phase average waveforms and phase difference. The investigation suggests that the phase differences present a negative linear relationship with age. The results can benefit our understanding of aging and also provide a new quantitative index for the basic research of nerve electrophysiology.

Little is known about the moderation of those effects by timing and duration of exposure. The present electroencephalography (EEG) study examined such moderations on delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, and beta EEG bands. A counterbalanced repeated-measures design was applied. The 16-hr daytime period was divided into three sessions: 07: 00-12: 20, 12: 20-17: 40, and 17: 40-23: 00 (timing of exposure). Two light conditions comparable in luminance but differing in wavelength were applied, namely polychromatic white light and monochromatic blue light (460 nm). There were two durations of exposure-the shorter one lasting 30 min and the longer one lasting 4 hrs. Thirty male students participated in the study. Four factors analyses of variance (ANOVAs, for light conditions, timing of exposure, duration of exposure, and brain area) were performed on each EEG band. Results indicated an alerting effect of short exposure to monochromatic blue light at midday and in the evening, which was demonstrated by a decrease in lower frequency bands (alpha1, delta, and theta, respectively). Long exposure to blue light may have a reverse effect, especially in the morning and at midday, when increases in lower frequency bands (theta in the morning and theta and alpha1 at midday) were observed. It can be concluded that the daytime effect of monochromatic blue light on EEG activity depends on timing and duration of exposure.

Monitoring the changes of brain signals provides an effective and direct way for drowsiness detection. One 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN)-based forecasting system has been proposed to monitor electroencephalography (EEG) signals and predict fatigue level during driving. The limited weight sharing and channel-wise convolution were both applied to extract the significant phenomenon in various frequency bands of brain signals and the spatial information of EEG channel location, respectively. The proposed 3D CNN with limited weight sharing and channel-wise convolution has been demonstrated to predict reaction time (RT) of driving with low root mean square error (RMSE) through the brain dynamics. This proposed approach outperforms with the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as traditional CNN, Neural Network (NN), and support vector regression (SVR). Compared with traditional CNN and Artificial Neural Network, the RMSE of 3D CNN-based RT prediction has been improved 9.5% (RMSE from 0.6322 to 0.5720) and 8% (RMSE from 0.6217 to 0.5720), respectively. We envision that this study might open a new branch between deep learning application in neuro-cognitive analysis and real world application.

The day to day life of the patient is severely disturbed because of the abrupt and unpredictable nature of the epileptic seizures. An investigative technique which provides comprehensive information about the classification, analysis and diagnosis of brain conditions is Electroencephalography (EEG). The useful information about the different diseases affecting the brain especially epilepsy are given by the frequency and energy content of this signal. As the recordings made from the EEG are quite large and difficult to process, Power Spectral Density (PSD) is employed here to reduce the dimensions of the entire data. Then the dimensionally reduced EEG data is transmitted through the Space Time Trellis Coded Multiple Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (STTC MIMO OFDM) system. As the system suffers a high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR), entropy based Partial Transmit Scheme (E-PTS) is proposed to reduce the PAPR and Bit Error Rate (BER) is analyzed in the receiver side. Also at the receiver side, Radial Basis Function Kernel Based Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to classify the epilepsy from EEG signals. The performance metrics analyzed here are Specificity, Sensitivity, Time Delay, Quality Value, Accuracy, Performance Index, PAPR and BER.	[Prabhakar, S.

Oscillatory EEG dynamics underlying automatic chunking during sentence processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; FRONTAL THETA ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; POWER INCREASES; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; LONG-TERM; TASK	Sentences are easier to remember than random word sequences, likely because linguistic regularities facilitate chunking of words into meaningful groups. The present electroencephalography study investigated the neural oscillations modulated by this so-called sentence superiority effect during the encoding and maintenance of sentence fragments versus word lists. We hypothesized a chunking-related modulation of neural processing during the encoding and retention of sentences (i.e., sentence fragments) as compared to word lists. Time frequency analysis revealed a two-fold oscillatory pattern for the memorization of sentences: Sentence encoding was accompanied by higher delta amplitude (4 Hz), originating both from regions processing syntax as well as semantics (bilateral superior/middle temporal regions and fusiform gyrus). Subsequent sentence retention was reflected in decreased theta (6 Hz) and beta/gamma (27-32 Hz) amplitude instead. Notably, whether participants simply read or properly memorized the sentences did not impact chunking-related activity during encoding. Therefore, we argue that the sentence superiority effect is grounded in highly automatized language processing mechanisms, which generate meaningful memory chunks irrespective of task demands.

Analysing concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalographic data: A review and introduction to the open-source TESA software	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Electroencephalography; EEGLAB; Artifacts	TMS-INDUCED ARTIFACTS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN RESPONSES; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG; DYNAMICS; IDENTIFICATION; MECHANISMS; SEPARATION; REDUCTION	The concurrent use of transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is growing in popularity as a method for assessing various cortical properties such as excitability, oscillations and connectivity. However, this combination of methods is technically challenging, resulting in artifacts both during recording and following typical EEG analysis methods, which can distort the underlying neural signal. In this article, we review the causes of artifacts in EEG recordings resulting from TMS, as well as artifacts introduced during analysis (e.g. as the result of filtering over high-frequency, large amplitude artifacts). We then discuss methods for removing artifacts, and ways of designing pipelines to minimise analysis-related artifacts. Finally, we introduce the TMS-EEG signal analyser (TESA), an open-source extension for EEGLAB, which includes functions that are specific for TMS-EEG analysis, such as removing and interpolating the TMS pulse artifact, removing and minimising TMS-evoked muscle activity, and analysing TMS-evoked potentials. The aims of TESA are to provide users with easy access to current TMS-EEG analysis methods and to encourage direct comparisons of these methods and pipelines. It is hoped that providing open-source functions will aid in both improving and standardising analysis across the field of TMS-EEG research.

J	Sameni, R; Seraj, E				Sameni, Reza; Seraj, Esmaeil			A robust statistical framework for instantaneous electroencephalogram phase and frequency estimation and analysis	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						electroencephalogram phase calculation; time-domain phase synchrony; phase resetting; phase locking value; phase amplitude coupling; phase slipping	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BAND GAUSSIAN-NOISE; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; STATE TRANSITIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; AMPLITUDE; SIGNAL	Objective: The instantaneous phase (IP) and instantaneous frequency (IF) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are considered as notable complements for the EEG spectrum. The calculation of these parameters commonly includes narrow-band filtering, followed by the calculation of the signal's analytical form. The calculation of the IP and IF is highly susceptible to the filter parameters and background noise level, especially in low analytical signal amplitudes. The objective of this study is to propose a robust statistical framework for EEG IP/IF estimation and analysis. Approach: Herein, a Monte Carlo estimation scheme is proposed for the robust estimation of the EEG IP and IF. It is proposed that any EEG phase-related inference should be reported as an average with confidence intervals obtained by repeating the IP and IF estimation under infinitesimal variations (selected by an expert), in algorithmic parameters such as the filter's bandwidth, center frequency and background noise level. In the second part of the paper, a stochastic model consisting of the superposition of narrow-band foreground and background EEG is used to derive analytically probability density functions of the instantaneous envelope (IE) and IP of EEG signals, which justify the proposed Monte Carlo scheme. Main results: The instantaneous analytical envelope of the EEG, which has been empirically used in previous studies, is shown to have a fundamental impact on the accuracy of the EEG phase contents. It is rigorously shown that the IP/IF estimation quality highly depends on the IE and any phase/frequency interpretations in low IE are statistically unreliable and require a hypothesis test. Significance: The impact of the proposed method on previous studies, including time-domain phase synchrony, phase resetting, phase locking value and phase amplitude coupling are studied with examples. The findings of this research can set forth new standards for EEG phase/frequency estimation and analysis techniques.

Theta Oscillations Rapidly Convey Odor-Specific Content in Human Piriform Cortex	NEURON			English	Article							BULB GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; OLFACTORY SYSTEM; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN AMYGDALA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; RAT; DISCRIMINATION; PHASE; BRAIN; TASK	Olfactory oscillations are pervasive throughout vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Such observations have long implied that rhythmic activity patterns play a fundamental role in odor coding. Using intracranial EEG recordings from rare patients with medically resistant epilepsy, we find that theta oscillations are a distinct electrophysiological signature of olfactory processing in the human brain. Across seven patients, odor stimulation enhanced theta power in human piriform cortex, with robust effects at the level of single trials. Importantly, classification analysis revealed that piriform oscillatory activity conveys olfactory-specific information that can be decoded within 110-518 ms of a sniff, and maximally within the theta frequency band. This temporal window was also associated with increased thetaspecific phase coupling between piriform cortex and hippocampus. Together these findings suggest that human piriform cortex has access to olfactory content in the time-frequency domain and can utilize these signals to rapidly differentiate odor stimuli.

Brain electrical activity signatures during performance of the Multisource Interference Task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Multisource Interference Task; Cognitive control; EEG; Time-frequency; Theta	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG; DYNAMICS; PHASE; ALPHA	The Multisource Interference Task (MSIT) was developed to test cognitive control in normal and pathological conditions and has become a reliable tool for exploring the integrity of cingulo-frontal-parietal cognitive/attentional networks in fMRI studies. Analysis of EEG recordings made during performance of the MSIT may provide additional information about the temporal dynamics of cognitive control. However, this has not yet been investigated in depth. In this study, we analyzed the ERPs and carried out time-frequency decomposition of EEG recorded during control and interference conditions of the MSIT. The N2 ERP component and midfrontal theta power (both considered neural signatures of conflict processing) were significantly larger in interference than in control trials. Theta also showed higher phase synchronization between midfrontal and right frontolateral scalp locations in the interference condition, supporting the view that this frequency band entrains additional brain resources when a need for greater control arises. In interference trials, we also observed longer P3 latency, larger P3 amplitude, and greater reduction of posterior alpha (modulations related to allocation of attentional resources), in addition to a greater reduction of central beta power (related to motor preparation). In conclusion, the MSIT reliably modulated brain electrical activity related to cognitive control and attention. The EEG indices obtained during the performance of this task may be useful for exploring the functioning of cognitive/attentional networks in healthy and clinical populations.

To elucidate the neurophysiological hallmarks of motor cortex development, we investigated the differences in motor cortical excitability and connectivity between healthy children, adolescents, and adults by means of navigated suprathreshold motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrated that with development, the excitability of the motor system increases, the TMS-evoked EEG waveform increases in complexity, the magnitude of induced activation decreases, and signal spreading increases. Furthermore, the phase of the oscillatory response to TMS becomes less consistent with age. These changes parallel an improvement in manual dexterity and may reflect developmental changes in functional connectivity. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methods: Resting EEG of 16 electrodes in 58 stroke subjects, 26 of whom had poststroke depression (13 with left-hemisphere lesion and 13 with right) and 32 of whom did not (18 with left lesion and 14 with right), was recorded to obtain spectral power analysis for several frequency bands. Multiple analysis of variance and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify differences between poststroke depression (PSD) and poststroke non-depression (PSND), treating the different lesion hemispheres separately. Moreover, Pearson linear correlation analysis was conducted to test the severity of depressive symptoms and EEG indices. Results: PSD with left-hemisphere lesion showed increased beta2 power in frontal and central areas, but PSD with right-hemisphere lesion showed increased theta and alpha power mainly in occipital and temporal regions. Additionally, for left-hemisphere lesions, beta2 power in central and right parietal regions provided high discrimination between PSD and PSND, and for right-hemisphere lesions, theta power was similarly discriminative in most regions, especially temporal regions. We also explored the association between symptoms of depression and the power of abnormal bands, but we found no such relationship. Limitations: The sample size was relatively small and included subjects with different lesions of the basal ganglia. Conclusions: The aberrant EEG oscillation in subjects with PSD differs between subjects with lesions of the left and right hemispheres, suggesting a complex association between depression and lesion location in stroke patients.

Detecting and extracting their components may help clinicians to localize brain neurological dysfurictionalities for patients with motor control disorders due to the fact that movement-related cortical activities are reflected in spectral EEG changes. A new algorithm for EEG signal components detection from its time-frequency distribution (TFD) has been proposed in this paper. The algorithm utilizes the modification of the Renyi entropy-based technique for number of components estimation, called short-term Renyi entropy (STRE), and upgraded by an iterative algorithm which was shown to enhance existing approaches. Combined with instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation, the proposed method was applied to EEG signal analysis both in noise-free and noisy environments for limb movements EEG signals, and was shown to be an efficient technique providing spectral description of brain activities at each electrode location up to moderate additive noise levels. Furthermore, the obtained information concerning the number of EEG signal components and their IFs show potentials to enhance diagnostics and treatment of neurological disorders for patients with motor control illnesses.

Thus, event-related brain potentials (ERPs), response force (RF) and oscillatory electroencephalography (EEG) activity were measured while participants were presented with pictures of body parts in painful or neutral situations. Their task consisted in either judging the painfulness of the stimuli or counting the body parts displayed. ERP results supported the assumption of an early automatic component of empathy for pain, as reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN), and of a late controlled component, as reflected by the late posterior positivity (P3). RF indicated that empathy-evoking stimuli facilitate motor responses if attention is directed toward the pain dimension, whereas EEG oscillations in the mu-and beta-band revealed, independent of the task, an enhanced activation of the sensorimotor cortex after the response to painful compared to neutral stimuli. In conclusion, present findings indicate that empathy-evoking stimuli produce automatic and controlled effects on both perceptual and motor processing.

However, reliable, commercially available EEG systems are expensive, often making them impractical for individual use and research development. Moreover, by design, a majority of these systems cannot be easily altered to the specification needed by the end user. We focused on mitigating these issues by implementing open-source tools to develop a new EEG platform to drive down research costs and promote collaboration and innovation. Approach. Here, we present methods to expand the open-source electrophysiology system, Open Ephys (www.openephys.org), to include human EEG recordings. We describe the equipment and protocol necessary to interface various EEG caps with the Open Ephys acquisition board, and detail methods for processing data. We present applications of Open Ephys + EEG as a research tool and discuss how this innovative EEG technology lays a framework for improved closed-loop paradigms and novel brain-computer interface experiments. Main results. The Open Ephys + EEG system can record reliable human EEG data, as well as human EMG data. A side-by-side comparison of eyes closed 8-14 Hz activity between the Open Ephys + EEG system and the Brainvision ActiCHamp EEG system showed similar average power and signal to noise. Significance. Open Ephys + EEG enables users to acquire high-quality human EEG data comparable to that of commercially available systems, while maintaining the price point and extensibility inherent to open-source systems.

How Useful is electroencephalography in the Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders and the Delineation of Subtypes: A Systematic Review	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						autism spectrum disorders; autism; electroencephalography; functional connectivity; spectral analysis; information dynamics	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; INTERHEMISPHERIC CONNECTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; BAND POWER; REM-SLEEP; CHILDREN; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; METHODOLOGY	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are thought to be associated with abnormal neural connectivity. Presently, neural connectivity is a theoretical construct that cannot be easily measured. Research in network science and time series analysis suggests that neural network structure, a marker of neural activity, can be measured with electroencephalography (EEG). EEG can be quantified by different methods of analysis to potentially detect brain abnormalities. The aim of this review is to examine evidence for the utility of three methods of EEG signal analysis in the ASD diagnosis and subtype delineation. We conducted a review of literature in which 40 studies were identified and classified according to the principal method of EEG analysis in three categories: functional connectivity analysis, spectral power analysis, and information dynamics. All studies identified significant differences between ASD patients and non-ASD subjects. However, due to high heterogeneity in the results, generalizations could not be inferred and none of the methods alone are currently useful as a new diagnostic tool. The lack of studies prevented the analysis of these methods as tools for ASD subtypes delineation. These results confirm EEG abnormalities in ASD, but as yet not sufficient to help in the diagnosis. Future research with larger samples and more robust study designs could allow for higher sensitivity and consistency in characterizing ASD, paving the way for developing new means of diagnosis.

Guiding transcranial brain stimulation by EEG/MEG to interact with ongoing brain activity and associated functions: A position paper	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Non-invasive transcranial brain stimulation (NTBS); Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography; Brain oscillations; Temporally guided NTBS	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; CONSCIOUS VISUAL-PERCEPTION; CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; INDUCED I-WAVES; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; ELECTRIC-STIMULATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY	Non-invasive transcranial brain stimulation (NTBS) techniques have a wide range of applications but also suffer from a number of limitations mainly related to poor specificity of intervention and variable effect size. These limitations motivated recent efforts to focus on the temporal dimension of NTBS with respect to the ongoing brain activity. Temporal patterns of ongoing neuronal activity, in particular brain oscillations and their fluctuations, can be traced with electro-or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), to guide the timing as well as the stimulation settings of NTBS. These novel, online and offline EEG/MEG-guided NTBS-approaches are tailored to specifically interact with the underlying brain activity. Online EEG/MEG has been used to guide the timing of NTBS (i.e., when to stimulate): by taking into account instantaneous phase or power of oscillatory brain activity, NTBS can be aligned to fluctuations in excitability states. Moreover, offline EEG/MEG recordings prior to interventions can inform researchers and clinicians how to stimulate: by frequency-tuning NTBS to the oscillation of interest, intrinsic brain oscillations can be up-or down-regulated. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing approaches and ideas of EEG/MEG-guided interventions, and their promises and caveats. We point out potential future lines of research to address challenges. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent improvements in acquisition and electrode technology have revealed that high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) within the 80-500 Hz frequency range provide the neurophysiologist with new information about the extent of the epileptogenic tissue in addition to ictal and interictal lower frequency events. Nevertheless, two decades after their discovery there remain questions about HFOs as biomarkers of epileptogenic brain and there use in clinical practice. Methods: In this review, we provide practical, technical guidance for epileptologists and clinical researchers on recording, evaluation, and interpretation of ripples, fast ripples, and very high-frequency oscillations. Results: We emphasize the importance of low noise recording to minimize artifacts. HFO analysis, either visual or with automatic detection methods, of high fidelity recordings can still be challenging because of various artifacts including muscle, movement, and filtering. Magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings are subject to the same artifacts. Significance: High-frequency oscillations are promising new biomarkers in epilepsy. This review provides interested researchers and clinicians with a review of current state of the art of recording and identification and potential challenges to clinical translation.

However, the accuracy of previous EEG-based method is still unsatisfactory. In order to improve the classification performance, we proposed an EEG-based automatic sleep stage classification method, which combined convolutional neural network (CNN) and time-frequency decomposition. The time-frequency image (TFI) of EEG signals is obtained by using the smoothed short-time Fourier transform. The features derived from the TFI have been used as an input feature of a CNN for sleep stage classification. The proposed method achieves the best accuracy of 88.83%. The experimental results demonstrate that deep learning method provides better classification performance compared to other methods.

The differentiation of physiological and epileptic HFO is an important challenge and is complicated by the fact that both types are generated in mesiotemporal structures. This study aimed to identify oscillation features that serve to distinguish physiological ripples associated with sleep spindles and epileptic ripples. We studied 19 patients with chronic intracranial EEG(iEEG) with mesiotemporal implantation and simultaneous scalp EEG. Sleep spindles, ripples and spikes were visually marked during nonrapid eye movement sleep stage 2. Ripples co-occurring with spikes and in seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels but outside of spindles were considered epileptic. The SOZ is defined by the origin of clinical seizures in iEEG. Ripples co-occurring with spindles were considered as models for physiological ripples. A correlation analysis showed a significant ripple amplitude peak - spindle trough - coupling, thus proving their physiological linkage. Epileptic ripples showed significantly higher values in all amplitude features than spindle ripples. All amplitude features and peaks per sample length showed a predictive value for the classification between model physiological ripples and epileptic ripples but indicate that the specificity is not sufficient for a reliable discrimination of single ripple events. The presented results suggest that a secure identification of epileptic ripples may be available to help identify the epileptic focus in the future.

The purpose of this thresholding is to reduce noise and low-energy cross-terms prior to detecting the number of components present in multicomponent EEG signals. However, preset time-frequency threshold value is often chosen empirically. In this paper, a performance analysis of the short-term Renyi entropy based method with regards to the chosen time-frequency threshold is rendered. The method was applied to both noise-free and noisy real-life EEG signals for left and right leg movements verifying the method's sensitivity to time-frequency distribution (TED) thresholding.

Demonstration of short-term plasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with theta burst stimulation: A TMS-EEG study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Theta burst stimulation (TBS); TMS-evoked potential (TEP); TMS-evoked oscillations; TMS-EEG; Cortical reactivity; Cortical inhibition	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; WORKING-MEMORY; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; HZ RTMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EXCITABILITY	Objectives: To examine the effects of intermittent TBS (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) on cortical reactivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Methods: 10 healthy participants were stimulated with either iTBS, cTBS or sham at F3 electrode. Single- and paired-pulse TMS and concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) were used to assess change in cortical reactivity and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) via TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and TMS-evoked oscillations. Results: Significant increases in N120 amplitudes (p < 0.01) were observed following iTBS over prefrontal cortex. Changes in TMS-evoked theta oscillations and LICI of theta oscillations were also observed following iTBS (increase) and cTBS (decrease). Change in LICI of theta oscillations correlated with change in N120 amplitude following TBS (r = - 0.670, p = 0.001). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that TBS produces direct changes in cortical reactivity in the prefrontal cortex. Combining TBS with TMS-EEG may be a useful approach to optimise stimulation paradigms prior to the conduct of clinical trials. Significance: TBS is able to modulate cortical reactivity and cortical inhibition in the prefrontal cortex. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Post-traumatic Epilepsy in rat's: An algorithm for detection of suspicious EEG activity	2017 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL-IMAGE TECHNOLOGY AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS (SITIS)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)	DEC 04-07, 2017	Jaipur, INDIA	IEEE Comp Soc, Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Univ Bourgogne, Univ Milan, Univ Bourgogne, Lab Electronique Image Informatique Res Grp, Natl Res Ctr Italy, Inst High Performance Comp & Networking, Govt Rajasthan, Dept Sci & Technol, IEEE Comp Soc, Special Interest Grp Semant Multimedia Management, ACM Special Interest Grp Appl Comp, French Chapter, IFIP, ACM		post-traumatic epilepsy; EEG; rat; wavelet transform; suspicious activity; ridge; detection	SEIZURE DETECTION; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; FEATURES; TERM	Due to the fact that there are problems in neurophysiological research on post-traumatic epilepsy in order to find sleep spindles and epileptiform discharges in long-term (day or more) recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) there is a need for algorithms for automatic detection of suspicious EEG activity (we call as suspicious activity any EEG activity that differs from the background activity). There are many methods of signal processing. The most common and straightforward are the methods of transition from the temporal representation of the signal to the time-frequency representation. One of them is the wavelet transform. For the wavelet spectrograms, the ridges of the wavelet spectrograms are calculated. Method of detecting the suspicious activity involves an analysis of points of the ridges. The spectrogram of ridge points are calculated, after which the points of the ridge are divided into two groups: those that relate to the background activities and those that relate to suspicious activity. Suspicious activity that does not meet the requirements of neuroscientists is eliminated.

Methods: We reviewed our prospective continuous EEG database to identify patients with CS, controls with non-cyclic status epilepticus (SE) and controls without seizure matched for age and etiology. EEG was reviewed with DC settings. Results: 39/260 (15%) patients with electrographic seizures presented with CS. These patients were older (62 vs. 54 years; p = 0.04) and more often had acute or progressive brain injury (77% vs. 52%; p = 0.03) than patients with non-cyclic SE and had a lower level of consciousness, were more severely ill, than matched controls. CS almost always had focal onset, often from posterior regions. Patients with CS trended towards worse prognosis. When available (12 patients), DC recordings showed an infraslow cyclic oscillation of EEG baseline synchronized to the seizures in all cases. Conclusions: CS occur mostly in older patients with acute or progressive brain injury, are more likely to be associated with poor outcome than patients with other forms of nonconvulsive SE, and are accompanied by synchronous oscillations of the EEG baseline on DC recordings. Significance: CS are a common form of non-convulsive status epilepticus in critically ill patients and provide further insights into the relationship between infraslow activity and seizures; further study on this relationship may shed light on the mechanisms of seizure initiation and termination.

Brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed not only as assistive technologies but also as rehabilitation tools for lost functions. However, due to the stochastic nature, poor spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio from electroencephalography (EEG), multidimensional decoding has been the main obstacle to implement non-invasive BCIs in real-live rehabilitation scenarios. This study explores the classification of several functional reaching movements from the same limb using EEG oscillations in order to create a more versatile BCI for rehabilitation. Approach. Nine healthy participants performed four 3D center-out reaching tasks in four different sessions while wearing a passive robotic exoskeleton at their right upper limb. Kinematics data were acquired from the robotic exoskeleton. Multiclass extensions of Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns (FBCSP) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier were used to classify the EEG activity into four forward reaching movements (from a starting position towards four target positions), a backward movement (from any of the targets to the starting position and rest). Recalibrating the classifier using data from previous or the same session was also investigated and compared. Main results. Average EEG decoding accuracy were significantly above chance with 67%, 62.75%, and 50.3% when decoding three, four and six tasks from the same limb, respectively. Furthermore, classification accuracy could be increased when using data from the beginning of each session as training data to recalibrate the classifier. Significance. Our results demonstrate that classification from several functional movements performed by the same limb is possible with acceptable accuracy using EEG oscillations, especially if data from the same session are used to recalibrate the classifier. Therefore, an ecologically valid decoding could be used to control assistive or rehabilitation mutli-degrees of freedom (DoF) robotic devices using EEG data. These results have important implications towards assistive and rehabilitative neuroprostheses control in paralyzed patients.

J	Chen, D; Wan, SR; Xiang, J; Bao, FS				Chen, Duo; Wan, Suiren; Xiang, Jing; Bao, Forrest Sheng			A high-performance seizure detection algorithm based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and EEG	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS; SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; INTRACRANIAL EEG; VECTOR MACHINES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; PATIENT	In the past decade, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a powerful time-frequency tool, has been widely used in computer-aided signal analysis of epileptic electroencephalography (EEG), such as the detection of seizures. One of the important hurdles in the applications of DWT is the settings of DWT, which are chosen empirically or arbitrarily in previous works. The objective of this study aimed to develop a framework for automatically searching the optimal DWT settings to improve accuracy and to reduce computational cost of seizure detection. To address this, we developed a method to decompose EEG data into 7 commonly used wavelet families, to the maximum theoretical level of each mother wavelet. Wavelets and decomposition levels providing the highest accuracy in each wavelet family were then searched in an exhaustive selection of frequency bands, which showed optimal accuracy and low computational cost. The selection of frequency bands and features removed approximately 40% of redundancies. The developed algorithm achieved promising performance on two well-tested EEG datasets (accuracy > 90% for both datasets). The experimental results of the developed method have demonstrated that the settings of DWT affect its performance on seizure detection substantially. Compared with existing seizure detection methods based on wavelet, the new approach is more accurate and transferable among datasets.

In most cases, the rhythmic structure of this path, such as specific sequences of strong and weak beats or recurring patterns, allows us to predict what and particularly when sounds are going to happen. Without this ability we would not be able to entrain body movements to music, like we do when we dance. By combining EEG and behavioral measures, the current study provides evidence illustrating the importance of ongoing neural oscillations at beat-related frequencies-i.e., neural entrainment-for tracking and predicting musical rhythms. Participants (13 musicians and 13 non-musicians) listened to drum rhythms that switched from a quadruple rhythm to a 3-over-4 polyrhythm. After a silent period of similar to 2-3s, participants had to decide whether a target stimulus was presented on time with the triple beat of the polyrhythm, too early, or too late. Results showed that neural oscillations reflected the rhythmic structure of both the simple quadruple rhythm and the more complex polyrhythm with no differences between musicians and non-musicians. During silent periods, the observation of time-frequency plots and more commonly used frequency spectra analyses suggest that beat-related neural oscillations were more pronounced in musicians compared to non-musicians. Neural oscillations during silent periods are not driven by an external input and therefore are thought to reflect top-down controlled endogenous neural entrainment. The functional relevance of endogenous neural entrainment was demonstrated by a positive correlation between the amplitude of task-relevant neural oscillations during silent periods and the number of correctly identified target stimuli. In sum, our findings add to the evidence supporting the neural resonance theory of pulse and meter. Furthermore, they indicate that beat-related top-down controlled neural oscillations can exist without external stimulation and suggest that those endogenous oscillations are strengthened by musical expertise. Finally, this study shows that the analysis of neural oscillations can be a useful tool to assess how we perceive and process complex auditory stimuli such as polyrhythms.

Gaussian statistical model is utilized in wavelet coefficients to summarize information in it and propose feature set using the modeling parameters of Gaussian probability density function (PDF). Empirical and Gaussian PDF have been plotted along with their cumulative distribution function (CDF) in probability-probability (p-p) plot and found Gaussian statistical model most effective to feed modeling parameters of Gaussian PDF in SVM and ANN classifier for normal, inter-ictal and ictal stages of seizure classification. Wide-ranging simulations are performed with an established dataset. The suggested scheme is found to be proficient of constructing greater values of specificity, sensitivity and accuracy in contrast to that making by a cutting edge method with the identical EEG dataset and classifier.

EMD decomposes the original signal into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). EEGs from 25 control subjects were registered in basal and motor activity (hand movements) using only one EEG channel. Over the basic signal, IMF signals are computed. Gamma-band activity is computed using power spectrum density in the 30-60 Hz range. Event-related synchronization (ERS) was defined as the ratio of motor and basal activity. To evaluate the performance of the new EMD based method, ERS was computed from the basic and IMF signals. The ERS obtained using IMFs improves, from 31.00% to 73.86%, on the original ERS for the right hand, and from 22.17% to 47.69% for the left hand. As EEG processing is improved, the clinical applications of gamma-band activity will expand.

Time-frequency analysis of EEG for improved classification of emotion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						emotion recognition; brain-computer interface; EEG; SVM; HHT	RECOGNITION; INTELLIGENCE; FEATURES	Emotion detection has crucial role in many domains especially in health and e-learning sector. This study aims to improve the accuracy in detecting emotions using brain activity. It addresses two primary problems associated with current emotion recognition systems. Firstly, these existing systems can classify only small classes of emotion. Secondly, analysis of the EEG is complex due to its non-stationary and non-linear characteristics. We conducted experiments to record EEG of subjects using 14 electrodes attached directly to the scalp based on International 10-20 system. To remove artefacts, raw signals are pre-processed. Emotional patterns associated with EEG are detected on time-frequency domain using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). Multiclass Support Vector Machine classifier (MC-SVM) is used to distinguish emotions from recorded data based on the instantaneous frequency obtained through HHT. The results revealed the effectiveness of the suggested time-frequency-based analysis method to detect wide range of emotions using EEG signals.

Yet, information on how potentially noxious stimuli are maintained in memory is limited in patients as well as in healthy people. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy volunteers during a modified delayed match-to-sample task where maintenance in memory of relevant attributes of nociceptive laser stimuli was essential for subsequent cued discrimination. Participants performed in high and low load conditions (i.e. three vs. two stimuli to keep in WM). Modulation of EEG oscillations in the beta band during the retention interval and in the alpha band during the pre-retention interval reflected performance in the WM task. Importantly, both a non-verbal and a verbal neuropsychological WM test predicted oscillatory modulations. Moreover, these two neuropsychological tests and self-reported personality measures predicted the performance in the nociceptive WM task. Results demonstrate (i) that beta and alpha EEG oscillations can represent WM for nociceptive stimuli; (ii) the association between neuropsychological measures of WM and the brain representation of phasic nociceptive painful stimuli; and (iii) that personality factors can predict memory for nociceptive stimuli at the behavioural level. Altogether, our findings offer a promising approach for investigating cortical correlates of nociceptive memory in clinical pain conditions.

Sleep disorders can cause personal health problems and life quality deterioration. Transient waveforms (k-complexes, sleep spindles, arousal, etc.) happens instantaneously in sleep, have distinctive structural features, amplitudes and frequencies, and are difficult to distinguish from the background of electroencephalography (EEG) which are called the microstructure of the EEG. Microstructure analysis is important for brain research, sleep studies, sleep stage scorings and assessment of sleep disorders. Detection of arousal, one of these structures, is performed by visual scoring of all night sleep records by an expert sleep physician. In particular, visual analysis of the microstructure is difficult and time-consuming task so it increases error rates in scoring. The aim of this study is automatic detection of arousals from EEG signals. A computer-aided diagnosis system that can detect arousal can give more objective results to the expert sleep experts for diagnosing. In this study, continuous wavelet transform analysis of scored EEG signals was performed and features were obtained As a result, a decision support system algorithm for arousal has been developed using the obtained features and support vector machines. The specificity of the algorithm is 100% and sensitivity is 95.45%.

Design: The inhibitory control (IC) ability of 80 low-proficient Chinese (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals was assessed by the Simon task. Half of these bilinguals were then subdivided into 20 high-and 20 low-IC participants to perform switching between L1 and L2 (L1-L2 switching), and the other half were subdivided into 20 high-and 20 low-IC participants to conduct switching between L1 and Lnew (L1-Lnew switching). All participants were required to name pictures (picture naming task) in their L1 and L2/Lnew in language switching task. Data and analysis: Both response latencies and EEG data were obtained, and then evoked and induced oscillations were calculated using time-frequency analysis. Findings: The results of language switching showed similar naming latencies for L1 and L2/Lnew switch trials in the high-IC group, whereas the low-IC group showed larger naming latencies for L1 switch trials than L2/Lnew switch trials. In contrast, the high-IC group exhibited larger theta evoked and induced power for L2/Lnew switch trials than L1 switch trials at the lexical selection level, whereas the low-IC group did not. These findings indicate that inhibition advantage helps the high-IC group to suppress effectively the non-target word via recruiting bottom-up (evoked oscillation) and top-down (induced oscillation) processes. Innovation: The present study was a first attempt to provide evidence that theta oscillation indicates cross-language interference at the lexical selection level. Significance: Inhibition plays a modulatory role in language switching, which is independent of the time spent on second language learning, and such role involves bottom-up (i.e., evoked oscillation) and top-down (i.e., induced oscillation) processes which were mainly evident at the lexical selection level.

CTXs are classified depending on their origin from the Pacific (P-CTXs), Indian Ocean (I-CTXs), and Caribbean (C-CTXs). P-CTX-1 is the most toxic CTX known and the major source of CFP causing an array of neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms in some CFP patients last for several months or years; however, the underlying electrophysiological properties of acute exposure to CTXs remain unknown. Here, we used CTX purified from ciguatera fish sourced in the Pacific Ocean (P-CTX-1). Delta and theta electroencephalography (EEG) activity was reduced remarkably in 2 h and returned to normal in 6 h after a single exposure. However, second exposure to P-CTX-1 induced not only a further reduction in EEG activities but also a 2-week delay in returning to baseline EEG values. Ciguatoxicity was detected in the brain hours after the first and second exposure by mouse neuroblastoma assay. The spontaneous firing rate of single motor cortex neuron was reduced significantly measured by single-unit recording with high spatial resolution. Expression profile study of neurotransmitters using targeted profiling approach based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the motor cortex. Our study provides a possible link between the brain oscillations and neurotransmitter release after acute exposure to P-CTX-1. Identification of EEG signatures and major metabolic pathways affected by P-CTX-1 provides new insight into potential biomarker development and therapeutic interventions.

Recently, complex network analysis has gained considerable attention in the time series analysis, but most of the analysis is devoted to investigating single time series or just the time domain statistical features. Herein, we propose a novel approach using the frequency domain features to construct connections between different EEG channels to generate a multi-channel network. First, we transform the EEG time series to a frequency domain feature using the spectrogram of three frequency bands. Next, we generate a multi-channel network using the space distance and the classification is based on the network structural features. The results indicate that the proposed method gets good performance and is more efficient than the deep learning method to some degrees.

Genetic influences on functional connectivity associated with feedback processing and prediction error: Phase coupling of theta-band oscillations in twins	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Feedback; EEG; Prediction error; Genetics; Brain oscillations; Neural synchrony; Connectivity; Phase coherence	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; RESEARCH DOMAIN CRITERIA; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS; EEG COHERENCE; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CORTICAL NETWORKS; COGNITIVE CONTROL	Detection and evaluation of the mismatch between the intended and actually obtained result of an action (reward prediction error) is an integral component of adaptive self-regulation of behavior. Extensive human and animal research has shown that evaluation of action outcome is supported by a distributed network of brain regions in which the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a central role, and the integration of distant brain regions into a unified feedback-processing network is enabled by long-range phase synchronization of cortical oscillations in the theta band. Neural correlates of feedback processing are associated with individual differences in normal and abnormal behavior, however, little is known about the role of genetic factors in the cerebral mechanisms of feedback processing. Here we examined genetic influences on functional cortical connectivity related to prediction error in young adult twins (age 18, n = 399) using event-related EEG phase coherence analysis in a monetary gambling task. To identify prediction error-specific connectivity pattern, we compared responses to loss and gain feedback. Monetary loss produced a significant increase of theta-band synchronization between the frontal midline region and widespread areas of the scalp, particularly parietal areas, whereas gain resulted in increased synchrony primarily within the posterior regions. Genetic analyses showed significant heritability of frontoparietal theta phase synchronization (24 to 46%), suggesting that individual differences in large-scale network dynamics are under substantial genetic control. We conclude that theta-band synchronization of brain oscillations related to negative feedback reflects genetically transmitted differences in the neural mechanisms of feedback processing. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for genetic influences on task-related functional brain connectivity assessed using direct real-time measures of neuronal synchronization.

This study aims to evaluate EEG features and channels for biometrics and to propose a methodology that selects the optimal features to discriminate individuals. Thirty healthy subjects participated in the study. While recording EEG signals from fourteen channels, subjects were asked to relax and keep eyes closed for two minutes. To evaluate intra-individual variability, we recorded EEG ten times for each subject across different days to reduce any within-day effect. From each channel, eight EEG features were calculated including alpha/beta power ratio, alpha/theta power ratio, beta/theta power ratio, median frequency, PSD entropy, permutation entropy, sample entropy, and maximum Lyapunov exponents. These features were evaluated by three feature selection algorithms based on Fisher score, reliefF, and information gain, respectively. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier along with a leave-one-out cross validation method discriminated self against others using the selected features. The best feature set was found to be composed of 23 features highly ranked on Fisher scores, which yielded a 18.56% half total error rate. In addition, EEG channels located on occipital and right temporal areas appeared to most contribute to authenticate individuals.

Recognizing of stereotypic patterns in epileptic EEG using empirical modes and wavelets	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Wavelet-analysis; Empirical mode decomposition; Patterns; Electroencephalogram	GENETIC ABSENCE EPILEPSY; SLEEP SPINDLES; WAG/RIJ RATS; DECOMPOSITION METHOD; TIME-SERIES; DISCHARGES; SPIKE; TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Epileptic activity in the form of spike-wave discharges (SWD) appears in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during absence seizures. This paper evaluates two approaches for detecting stereotypic rhythmic activities in EEG, i.e., the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The CWT is a well-known method of time-frequency analysis of EEG, whereas EMD is a relatively novel approach for extracting signal's waveforms. A new method for pattern recognition based on combination of CWT and EMD is proposed. It was found that this combined approach resulted to the sensitivity of 86.5% and specificity of 92.9% for sleep spindles and 97.6% and 93.2% for SWD, correspondingly. Considering strong within- and between-subjects variability of sleep spindles, the obtained efficiency in their detection was high in comparison with other methods based on CWT. It is concluded that the combination of a wavelet-based approach and empirical modes increases the quality of automatic detection of stereotypic patterns in rat's EEG. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Further studies have revealed constructional prototype effects, both at the word level as well as for phrases. The present speech production study investigates the time course of these effects for the production of prepositional phrases in English, using event related potentials (ERPs). For word frequency, oscillations in the theta range emerged. By contrast, phrase frequency showed a persistent effect over time. Furthermore, independent effects with different temporal and topographical signatures characterized phrasal prototypicality. In a simulation study we demonstrate that naive discrimination learning provides an alternative account of the data that is as least as powerful as a standard lexical predictor analysis. The implications of the current findings for models of language processing are discussed.

The recording of the brain activity helps us to understand the brain functions properly. The scalp Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings act as a fundamental tool to trace the pathological brain activity and so it is used widely to treat the patients affected with epilepsy. Since the recordings of the EEG are quite long and hectic to process, Linear Graph Embedding (LGE) is used to reduce the dimensions of the EEG data in this paper. It is then transmitted to the Space Time Trellis Coded Multiple Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (STTC MIMO OFDM) System. As the system suffers from a high PAPR, Principal Component Analysis Based Selective Mapping Technique (PCA-SLM) is used to reduce the PAPR. At the receiver the Gaussian Kernel Based Support Vector Machine (GK-SVM) is employed to act as a post classifier to classify the epilepsy risk levels from EEG signals.

A variety of factors could potentially affect the performance of BCI such as the health status of subjects or the environment. In this paper, we investigated the effects of soft drinks and regular coffee on EEG signals under resting state and on the performance of MI-based BCI. Twenty-six healthy human subjects participated in three or four BCI sessions with a resting period in each session. During each session, the subjects drank an unlabeled soft drink with either sugar (Caffeine Free Coca-Cola), caffeine (Diet Coke), neither ingredient (Caffeine Free Diet Coke), or a regular coffee if there was a fourth session. The resting state spectral power in each condition was compared; the analysis showed that power in alpha and beta band after caffeine consumption were decreased substantially compared with control and sugar condition. Although the attenuation of powers in the frequency range used for the online BCI control signal was shown, group averaged BCI online performance after consuming caffeine was similar to those of other conditions. This paper, for the first time, shows the effect of caffeine, sugar intake on the online BCI performance, and resting state brain signal.

Dynamic Coupling between fMRI Local Connectivity and Interictal EEG in Focal Epilepsy: AWavelet Analysis Approach	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; functional connectivity; wavelet coherence; DRePS; focal epilepsy	CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; NETWORKS; STATE; MRI; OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGES; ARTIFACT; SEIZURES	Simultaneous scalp EEG-fMRI recording is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique for combining electrophysiological and hemodynamic aspects of brain function. Despite the time-varying nature of both measurements, their relationship is usually considered as time-invariant. The aim of this study was to detect direct associations between scalp-recorded EEG and regional changes of hemodynamic brain connectivity in focal epilepsy through a time-frequency paradigm. To do so, we developed a voxel-wise framework that analyses wavelet coherence between dynamic regional phase synchrony (DRePS, calculated from fMRI) and band amplitude fluctuation (BAF) of a target EEG electrode with dominant interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). As a proof of concept, we applied this framework to seven patients with focal epilepsy. The analysis produced patient-specific spatial maps of DRePS-BAF coupling, which highlight regions with a strong link between EEG power and local fMRI connectivity. Although we observed DRePS-BAF coupling proximate to the suspected seizure onset zone in some patients, our results suggest that DRePS-BAF is more likely to identify wider 'epileptic networks'. We also compared DRePS-BAF with standard EEG-fMRI analysis based on general linear modelling (GLM). There was, in general, little overlap between the DRePS-BAF maps and GLM maps. However, in some subjects the spatial clusters revealed by these two analyses appeared to be adjacent, particularly in medial posterior cortices. Our findings suggest that (1) there is a strong time-varying relationship between local fMRI connectivity and interictal EEG power in focal epilepsy, and (2) that DRePS-BAF reflect different aspects of epileptic network activity than standard EEG-fMRI analysis. These two techniques, therefore, appear to be complementary. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Sixty-four-channel EEG signals were recorded from 33 depressed patients and 32 healthy controls during a visual n-back task. Alterations in functional connections in the patients were investigated using event-related phase coherence in terms of the phase synchronization index (PSI). Compared with the control subjects, the depressed patients showed a lower task-dependent increase in the PSI of delta, theta, and alpha oscillations in a frontoparietal network, but a higher task-dependent increase in the PSI of beta oscillations in the frontoparietal network. Additionally, depressed patients showed a lower task-dependent decrease in the PSI of delta, theta, alpha, and beta oscillations in centro-parieto-occipital sites. Insufficient phase synchronization and desynchronization during working memory processing reflects impairments in cortical inhibition, memory, and attention efficiency in major depression, while the abnormal increase in phase synchronization in beta oscillations in the frontoparietal network may indicate a new cortical circuit concerned with the repair of impaired ability in attention, memory retention, and working memory central executive processing. These findings present a compensatory mechanism for impaired cognitive function in major depression, and advance our understanding of functional aspect of beta oscillations.

J	Chu, H; Chung, CK; Jeong, W; Cho, KH				Chu, Hyunho; Chung, Chun Kee; Jeong, Woorim; Cho, Kwang-Hyun			Predicting epileptic seizures from scalp EEG based on attractor state analysis	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Epileptic seizure; Early-warning indicator; Attractor state; Spectral feature; prediction; Systems biology	DYNAMICAL DISEASES; BRAIN SYSTEMS; MODEL; FIELD; STATISTICS	Background and Objective: Epilepsy is the second most common disease of the brain. Epilepsy makes it difficult for patients to live a normal life because it is difficult to predict when seizures will occur. In this regard, if seizures could be predicted a reasonable period of time before their occurrence, epilepsy patients could take precautions against them and improve their safety and quality of life. In this paper, we investigate a novel seizure precursor based on attractor state analysis for seizure prediction. Methods: We analyze the transition process from normal to seizure attractor state and investigate a precursor phenomenon seen before reaching the seizure attractor state. From the result of an analysis, we define a quantified spectral measure in scalp EEG for seizure prediction. From scalp EEG recordings, the Fourier coefficients of six EEG frequency bands are extracted, and the defined spectral measure is computed based on the coefficients for each half-overlapped 20-second-long window. The computed spectral measure is applied to seizure prediction using a low-complexity methodology. Results: Within scalp EEG, we identified an early-warning indicator before an epileptic seizure occurs. Getting closer to the bifurcation point that triggers the transition from normal to seizure state, the power spectral density of low frequency bands of the perturbation of an attractor in the EEG, showed a relative ;increase. A low-complexity seizure prediction algorithm using this feature was evaluated, using similar to 583 h of scalp EEG in which 143 seizures in 16 patients were recorded. With the test dataset, the proposed method showed high sensitivity (86.67%) with a false prediction rate of 0.367 h(-1) and average prediction time of 45.3 min. Conclusions: A novel seizure prediction method using scalp EEG, based on attractor state analysis, shows potential for application with real epilepsy patients. This is the first study in which the seizure-precursor phenomenon of an epileptic seizure is investigated based on attractor-based analysis of the macroscopic dynamics of the brain. With the scalp EEG, we first propose use of a spectral feature identified for seizure prediction, in which the dynamics of an attractor are excluded, and only the perturbation dynamics from the attractor are considered.

Abnormal local and long-range brain connectivity have been widely reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the nature of these abnormalities and their functional relevance at distinct cortical rhythms remains unknown. Investigations of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) and their coherence across whole brain networks hold promise for determining whether patterns of functional connectivity abnormalities vary across frequencies and networks in ASD. In the present study, we aimed to probe atypical intrinsic brain connectivity networks in ASD from resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data via characterizing the whole brain network. Approach. Connectivity within individual ICNs (measured by spectral power) and between ICNs (measured by coherence) were examined at four canonical frequency bands via a time-frequency independent component analysis on high-density EEG, which were recorded from 20 ASD and 20 typical developing (TD) subjects during an eyes-closed resting state. Main results. Among twelve identified electrophysiological ICNs, individuals with ASD showed hyper-connectivity in individual ICNs and hypo-connectivity between ICNs. Functional connectivity alterations in ASD were more severe in the frontal lobe and the default mode network (DMN) and at low frequency bands. These functional connectivity measures also showed abnormal age-related associations in ICNs related to frontal, temporal and motor regions in ASD. Significance. Our findings suggest that ASD is characterized by the opposite directions of abnormalities (i.e. hypo-and hyper-connectivity) in the hierarchical structure of the whole brain network, with more impairments in the frontal lobe and the DMN at low frequency bands, which are critical for top-down control of sensory systems, as well as for both cognition and social skills.

The impulse response function of the model is used to predict the responses to impulses, which are compared with transient waveforms in sleep studies. Fits to empirical data then allow underlying brain physiology to be inferred and compared with other waves. Spontaneous K-complexes, spindles, and other transient waveforms can be reproduced using NFT by treating them as evoked responses to impulsive stimuli with brain parameters appropriate to spontaneous EEG in sleep stage 2. Using this approach, spontaneous K-complexes and sleep spindles can be analyzed using the same single theory as previously been used to account for waking ERPs and other EEG phenomena. As a result, NFT can explain a wide variety of transient waveforms that have only been phenomenologically classified to date. This enables noninvasive fitting to be used to infer underlying physiological parameters. This physiology-based model reproduces the time series of different transient EEG waveforms; it has previously reproduced experimental EEG spectra, and waking ERPs, and many other observations, thereby unifying transient sleep waveforms with these phenomena.

In the present study, we examined whether functional connectivity influences audiovisual integration during normal aging. Visual, auditory, and audiovisual stimuli were randomly presented peripherally; during this time, participants were asked to respond immediately to the target stimulus. Electroencephalography recordings captured visual, auditory, and audiovisual processing in 12 old (60-78 years) and 12 young (22-28 years) male adults. For non-target stimuli, we focused on alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) bands. We applied the Phase Lag Index to study the dynamics of functional connectivity. Then, the network topology parameters, which included the clustering coefficient, path length, small-worldness global efficiency, local efficiency and degree, were calculated for each condition. For the target stimulus, a race model was used to analyze the response time. Then, a Pearson correlation was used to test the relationship between each network topology parameters and response time. The results showed that old adults activated stronger connections during audiovisual processing in the beta band. The relationship between network topology parameters and the performance of audiovisual integration was detected only in old adults. Thus, we concluded that old adults who have a higher load during audiovisual integration need more cognitive resources. Furthermore, increased beta band functional connectivity influences the performance of audiovisual integration during normal aging.

J	Li, MA; Liu, HN; Zhu, W; Yang, JF				Li, Ming-ai; Liu, Hai-na; Zhu, Wei; Yang, Jin-fu			Applying Improved Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy for Feature Extraction of MI-EEG	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						motor imagery electroencephalography; feature extraction; multiscale fuzzy entropy; independent optimization of parameters; complexity; t-test	PERMUTATION ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; FILTERS; STATES	Electroencephalography (EEG) is considered the output of a brain and it is a bioelectrical signal with multiscale and nonlinear properties. Motor Imagery EEG (MI-EEG) not only has a close correlation with the human imagination and movement intention but also contains a large amount of physiological or disease information. As a result, it has been fully studied in the field of rehabilitation. To correctly interpret and accurately extract the features of MI-EEG signals, many nonlinear dynamic methods based on entropy, such as Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn), Fuzzy Entropy (FE), and Permutation Entropy (PE), have been proposed and exploited continuously in recent years. However, these entropy-based methods can only measure the complexity of MI-EEG based on a single scale and therefore fail to account for the multiscale property inherent in MI-EEG. To solve this problem, Multiscale Sample Entropy (MSE), Multiscale Permutation Entropy (MPE), and Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy (MFE) are developed by introducing scale factor. However, MFE has not been widely used in analysis of MI-EEG, and the same parameter values are employed when the MFE method is used to calculate the fuzzy entropy values on multiple scales. Actually, each coarse-grained MI-EEG carries the characteristic information of the original signal on different scale factors. It is necessary to optimize MFE parameters to discover more feature information. In this paper, the parameters of MFE are optimized independently for each scale factor, and the improved MFE (IMFE) is applied to the feature extraction of MI-EEG. Based on the event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) phenomenon, IMFE features from multi channels are fused organically to construct the feature vector. Experiments are conducted on a public dataset by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. The experiment results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed method yields relatively high classification accuracy compared with other entropy-based and classical time-frequency-space feature extraction methods. The t-test is used to prove the correctness of the improved MFE.

At the lower end of both the arousal and awareness scales is coma, defined as a state of unresponsiveness, in which a patient cannot be awaken. Recovery from coma following brain injury occurs through a sequence of disorders of consciousness (DOC) ranging from unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS)/vegetative state (VS) which shows no signs of awareness to minimally conscious states (MCS) from which consciousness can emerge. The graded consciousness recovery parallels scales of brain injury severity suggesting that consciousness recovers by "turning on" hierarchical services. This sequence resembles a computer "booting" process, which may "hang" at a specific "intermediate levels of consciousness" such as UWS/VS or MCS. The recovery sequence can be assessed by electroencephalography (EEG), a large-scale measure of fluctuations in electrical activity of the brain. Resting state EEG assesses the graded recovery of brain oscillations from isoelectric line to burst-suppression (BS) to EEG slowing to wakefulness alpha activity and faster rhythms. Given that some degree of "connectivity" is required for consciousness, the assessment of DOC can be improved by testing the EEG in controlled stimulation paradigms addressing either the event related potential (ERP) or the event related changes in background EEG rhythms referred to as reactivity, which can be evoked even in BS. This grading of EEG changes provides the rationale for developing EEG indexes for monitoring the "booting process" during coma recovery to improve the diagnosis and prognostication of DOC.

However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the subjective experience of perceiving univocal auditory patterns that can be listened to, despite hearing all sounds in a scene, are poorly understood. We hereby investigated the manner in which competing sound organizations are simultaneously represented by specific brain activity patterns and the way attention and task demands prime the internal model generating the current percept. Using a selective attention task on ambiguous auditory stimulation coupled with EEG recordings, we found that the phase of low-frequency oscillatory activity dynamically tracks multiple sound organizations concurrently. However, whereas the representation of ignored sound patterns is circumscribed to auditory regions, large-scale oscillatory entrainment in auditory, sensory-motor and executive-control network areas reflects the active perceptual organization, thereby giving rise to the subjective experience of a unitary percept.

In this paper, we efficiently recognize emotional states by analyzing the features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are generated from EEG sensors that noninvasively measure the electrical activity of neurons inside the human brain, and select the optimal combination of these features for recognition. In this paper, the scalp EEG data of 21 healthy subjects (12-14 years old) were recorded using a 14-channel EEG machine while the subjects watched images with four types of emotional stimuli (happy, calm, sad, or scared). After preprocessing, the Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity) were used to measure the signal activity of the time series data. We selected the optimal EEG features using a balanced one-way ANOVA after calculating the Hjorth parameters for different frequency ranges. Features selected by this statistical method outperformed univariate and multivariate features. The optimal features were further processed for emotion classification using support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, random forest, deep learning, and four ensembles methods (bagging, boosting, stacking, and voting). The results show that the proposed method substantially improves the emotion recognition rate with respect to the commonly used spectral power band method.

We here sought to delineate the neural and behavioural corollaries of highly implicit, probabilistic temporal predictability in an auditory foreperiod paradigm. To this end, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) and response times in two independent experiments (total N = 46). Unbeknownst to participants, we induced a probabilistic variation of cue-target delays (i.e., foreperiods) in a pitch-discrimination task on a noise embedded tone: The smaller the standard deviation of the underlying foreperiod distribution, the more predictable the time of target occurrence should be. Both experiments showed that more predictive foreperiods sped up listeners' responses. Crucially, neural signatures of temporal predictability emerged when comparing EEG activity between conditions of varying temporal predictability. First, cue-related P2 evoked responses were less pronounced for cues that implicitly signalled temporal predictability of target occurrence. Second, in both experiments, fronto-central delta (1-4 Hz) phase coherence was found relatively reduced during predictive foreperiods. Concomitantly, in Experiment II, the most predictive condition yielded a central alpha (7-12 Hz) power increase just before the most likely time point of tone onset, likely reflecting improved temporal orienting of attention. In sum, neural oscillations in anticipation of, and response times to a target show that humans are susceptible to even strictly implicit, probabilistic temporal regularities.

The role of gamma interbrain synchrony in social coordination when humans face territorial threats	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						threat; coordination; brain synchrony; EEG; hyperscanning; gamma	EEG; AMYGDALA; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; EMOTION; FEAR	Throughout history and into the modern era, human groups have been continually subjected to a wide range of societal threats, from natural disasters to pandemics to terrorism. Yet despite this fundamental aspect of human existence, there has been little research on how societal threat affects social coordination at both the neural and the behavioral level. Here, we show for the first time that individuals are better able to coordinate under high societal threat as compared to low or no threat (Experiment 1). Using a method of hyperscanning electroencephalography (EEG), which simultaneously measures brain activity among interacting subjects, we further illustrate that interbrain synchrony of gamma band oscillations is enhanced when people are under high threat, and increased gamma interbrain synchrony is associated with lower dyadic interpersonal time lag (i.e. higher coordination) (Experiment 2). To our knowledge, the current work provides some of the first empirical evidence that gamma interbrain synchrony is associated with social coordination when humans are under threat.

It is widely use among the researcher compared to other techniques since it is affordable, non-invasive, able to record the signal in short time and painless to the subject. The brain signal can be divided into five specific frequency that known as alpha, beta, theta, delta and gamma band. These frequency bands will determine the characteristics of the brain signal. In this present study, the effect of sound stimuli in memorizing process is analyzed based on the relative power of the brain rhythm. Besides that, in this proposed study it is also aim to determine the effective sound stimuli for improving memorization. About 60 adults participated in this study. They are required to memorize the visual memory task at three different conditions, which are silence condition, listening to Mozart music, and listening to white noise, each for 2 minutes. The brain signal was recorded using Neurofax 9200 of EEG machine during the memorizing process. The wavelet approach was used for EEG data processing and the relative power was calculated for each of the frequency band except delta rhythm from the clean EEG signal. The result showed that listening to sound stimuli during memorizing gave significant influence on gamma and beta activity. Based on paired t-test analysis it revealed that the gamma and beta showed more significant different at white noise (gamma: p = 0.001 < 0.050; beta: p = 0.000 < 0.050) compared to Mozart music relative (gamma: p = 0.014 < 0.050; beta: p = 0.004 < 0.050) to silent condition. It indicates that the white noise is more effective to be listened during memorizing since it able to increase the alertness level of the subject and sensory processing of the input information.

The paper addresses the relevant developments in behavioral sciences after Wundt established the science of psychology, and developments in the neurosciences after alpha and gamma oscillations were discovered by Berger and Adrian, respectively. Basic neuroscientific studies have led to a number of principles: (1) spontaneous EEG is composed of a set of oscillatory components, (2) the brain responds with oscillatory activity, (3) poststimulus oscillatory activity is a function of prestimulus activity, (4) the brain response results from a superposition of oscillatory components, (5) there are multiplicities with regard to oscillations and functions, and (6) oscillations are spatially integrated. Findings of clinical studies suggest that oscillatory responses can serve as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the field of psychology is still making limited use of neuro-oscillatory dynamics for a bio-behavioral understanding of cognitive-affective processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, previous work has demonstrated a coupling between the phase of low frequency oscillations and the amplitude (or power) of high frequency oscillations during certain tasks, termed phase amplitude coupling (PAC). For instance, during visual processing in humans, PAC has been reliably observed between ongoing alpha (8-13 Hz) and gamma-band (>40 Hz) activity. However, the application of PAC metrics to electrophysiological data can be challenging due to numerous methodological issues and lack of coherent approaches within the field. Therefore, in this article we outline the various analysis steps involved in detecting PAC, using an openly available MEG dataset from 16 participants performing an interactive visual task. Firstly, we localized gamma and alpha-band power using the Fieldtrip toolbox, and extracted time courses from area V1, defined using a multimodal parcelation scheme. These V1 responses were analyzed for changes in alpha-gamma PAC, using four common algorithms. Results showed an increase in alpha (7-13 Hz)-gamma (40-100 Hz) PAC in response to the visual grating stimulus, though specific patterns of coupling were somewhat dependent upon the algorithm employed. Additionally, post-hoc analyses showed that these results were not driven by the presence of non-sinusoidal oscillations, and that trial length was sufficient to obtain reliable PAC estimates. Finally, throughout the article, methodological issues and practical guidelines for ongoing PAC research will be discussed.

Here, we apply complementary biomarker algorithms to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to capture the brain's multi-faceted signature of disease or pharmacological intervention and use machine learning to improve classification performance. Using data from healthy subjects receiving scopolamine we developed an index of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (mAChR) consisting of 14 EEG biomarkers. This mAChR index yielded higher classification performance than any single EEG biomarker with cross-validated accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision ranging from 88-92%. The mAChR index also discriminated healthy elderly from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, an index optimized for AD pathophysiology provided a better classification. We conclude that integrating multiple EEG biomarkers can enhance the accuracy of identifying disease or drug interventions, which is essential for clinical trials.

Cortical and Subcortical Coordination of Visual Spatial Attention Revealed by Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Recording	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attentional control; EEG; fMRI; pulvinar; visual cortex	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PULVINAR; BRAIN; CORTEX; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; SUPPRESSION; INHIBITION; MODULATION	Visual spatial attention has been studied in humans with both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) individually. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of each of these methods used alone, our understanding of the systems-level mechanisms underlying attentional control remains limited. Here, we examined trial-to-trial covariations of concurrently recorded EEG and fMRI in a cued visual spatial attention task in humans, which allowed delineation of both the generators and modulators of the cue-triggered event-related oscillatory brain activity underlying attentional control function. The fMRI activity in visual cortical regions contralateral to the cued direction of attention covaried positively with occipital gamma-band EEG, consistent with activation of cortical regions representing attended locations in space. In contrast, fMRI activity in ipsilateral visual cortical regions covaried inversely with occipital alpha-band oscillations, consistent with attention-related suppression of the irrelevant hemispace. Moreover, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus covaried with both of these spatially specific, attention-related, oscillatory EEG modulations. Because the pulvinar's neuroanatomical geometry makes it unlikely to be a direct generator of the scalp-recorded EEG, these covariational patterns appear to reflect the pulvinar's role as a regulatory control structure, sending spatially specific signals to modulate visual cortex excitability proactively. Together, these combined EEG/fMRI results illuminate the dynamically interacting cortical and subcortical processes underlying spatial attention, providing important insight not realizable using either method alone.

The aim of our investigation was an estimation how well a passive Brain-Computer Interface (pBCI) can work in an autonomous driving scenario. The evaluation considered speed and accuracy of self-applicability by an untrained person, quality of recorded EEG data, shifts of electrode positions on the head after driving-related movements, usability, and complexity of the system as such and wearing comfort over time. An experiment was conducted inside and outside of a stationary vehicle with running engine, air-conditioning, and muted radio. Signal quality was sufficient for standard EEG analysis in the time and frequency domain as well as for the use in pBCIs. While the influence of vehicle-induced interferences to data quality was insignificant, driving-related movements led to strong shifts in electrode positions. In general, the EEG system used allowed for a fast self-applicability of cap and electrodes. The assessed usability of the system was still acceptable while the wearing comfort decreased strongly over time due to friction and pressure to the head. From these results we conclude that the evaluated system should provide the essential requirements for an application in an autonomous driving context. Nevertheless, further refinement is suggested to reduce shifts of the system due to body movements and increase the headset's usability and wearing comfort.

J	Awais, M; Badruddin, N; Drieberg, M				Awais, Muhammad; Badruddin, Nasreen; Drieberg, Micheal			A Hybrid Approach to Detect Driver Drowsiness Utilizing Physiological Signals to Improve System Performance and Wearability	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; ECG; HRV; SVM; driver drowsiness detection; channel reduction	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SLEEP; FATIGUE; BRAIN	Driver drowsiness is a major cause of fatal accidents, injury, and property damage, and has become an area of substantial research attention in recent years. The present study proposes a method to detect drowsiness in drivers which integrates features of electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to improve detection performance. The study measures differences between the alert and drowsy states from physiological data collected from 22 healthy subjects in a driving simulator-based study. A monotonous driving environment is used to induce drowsiness in the participants. Various time and frequency domain feature were extracted from EEG including time domain statistical descriptors, complexity measures and power spectral measures. Features extracted from the ECG signal included heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), including low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio. Furthermore, subjective sleepiness scale is also assessed to study its relationship with drowsiness. We used paired t-tests to select only statistically significant features (p < 0.05), that can differentiate between the alert and drowsy states effectively. Significant features of both modalities (EEG and ECG) are then combined to investigate the improvement in performance using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The other main contribution of this paper is the study on channel reduction and its impact to the performance of detection. The proposed method demonstrated that combining EEG and ECG has improved the system's performance in discriminating between alert and drowsy states, instead of using them alone. Our channel reduction analysis revealed that an acceptable level of accuracy (80%) could be achieved by combining just two electrodes (one EEG and one ECG), indicating the feasibility of a system with improved wearability compared with existing systems involving many electrodes.

Motor-and pain-related processes separately suppress beta oscillations over sensorimotor cortex leading to the prediction that ongoing pain should facilitate movement. In the current study, we used a paradigm in which voluntary movements were executed during an ongoing pain-eliciting stimulus to test the hypothesis that a pain-related suppression of beta oscillations would facilitate the initiation of a subsequent voluntary movement. Using kinematic measures, electromyography, and high-density electroencephalography, we demonstrate that ongoing pain leads to shorter reaction times without affecting the kinematics or accuracy of movement. Reaction time was positively correlated with beta power prior to movement in contralateral premotor areas. Our findings corroborate the view that beta-band oscillations are antikinetic and provide new evidence that pain primes the motor system for action. Our observations provide the first evidence that a pain-related suppression of beta oscillations over contralateral premotor areas leads to shorter reaction times for voluntary movement.

MEMD is a multivariate extension of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is an established method to perform the decomposition and time-frequency (T - F) analysis of non-stationary data sets. We select suitable feature sets based on the multiscale T - F representation of the EEG data via MEMD for the classification purposes. The classification is achieved using the artificial neural networks. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified on extensive publicly available EEG datasets.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are related to better understanding the neuronal functions in children with ADHD. Aims: The aim of this study was to examine resting-state EEG power and identify specific neural abnormalities through oscillatory patterns in ADHD children. Method: A total of 18 subjects between the age of 8 to 12 years participated with 9 children diagnosed with ADHD and 9 matched healthy participants (HP). Conner's Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) was administered to establish a behavioural profile for the ADHD group. Using 19 channels, EEG was recorded in eyes-closed conditions. EEG power spectral analysis was used. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare EEG signals of the ADHD and HP group. The critical value for significance was set at 0.05 and 0.01 levels. Result: The ADHD group had elevated absolute power in gamma1 band at the right hemispheric frontal and central channels. With relative power measures, children with ADHD had elevated levels of delta and gamma bands in the central and frontal regions. The ADHD group showed decreased relative power for alpha frequency in the occipital region, and decreased relative theta activity. Conclusion: Increased relative delta activity suggests cortical underarousal and decreased theta may related to cognitive impairment in ADHD children. Elevated gamma activity in ADHD children denotes their enhanced level of neuronal excitation with unspecific activation of processing resources. A distinct neural pattern distinguishes the ADHD group from the HP.

Nevertheless, the etiology of this phenomenon remains ambiguous. There is a disagreement whether ADHD is related to deviations in brain development or to a delay in brain maturation. The model of deviated brain development suggests that the ADHD brain matures in a fundamentally different way, and does not reach normal maturity at any developmental stage. On the contrary, the delayed brain maturation model assumes that the ADHD brain indeed matures in a different, delayed way in comparison to healthy age-matched controls, yet eventually reaches proper maturation. We investigated age-related changes in resting-state EEG activity to find evidence to support one of the alternative models. A total of 141 children and teenagers participated in the study; 67 diagnosed with ADHD and 74 healthy controls. The absolute power of delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands was analyzed. We observed a significant developmental pattern of decreasing absolute EEG power in both groups. Nonetheless, ADHD was characterized by consistently lower absolute EGG power, mostly in the theta frequency band, in comparison to healthy controls. Our results are in line with the deviant brain maturation theory of ADHD, as the observed effects of age-related changes in EEG power are parallel but different in the two groups.

Comparison of Wavelet Transform Symlets (2-10) and Daubechies (2-10) for an Electroencephalographic Signal Analysis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 IEEE XXIV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING (INTERCON)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 24th International Conference on Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computing (INTERCON)	AUG 15-18, 2017	Cusco, PERU	IEEE, IEEE Peru Sect			EEG; ENTROPY	The use of digital filters as the Wavelet Transform is widely recognized in signal processing; however, for the analysis of an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, the most optimal filter to be used has not been definitively determined. This work presents a comparison between the results obtained by filtering an EEG signal recorded during an 8 minute foreign language class on 69 asymptomatic volunteers using Wavelet Symlets (sym2 - sym10) and Daubechies (db2 - db10). The EEG signals were divided into four sub-bands and an energy, frequency and time analysis was performed. The results obtained show that the filters respond in a different but not significant way. For the identification of the appropriate mother Wavelet for each scope of analysis, its similarity was considered with the average value of Symlets (sym2 - sym10) and this process was replicated for db Wavelets. Considering the energy of the EEG signals, the db4 filter had a higher presence in 5 electrodes in the Alpha and Delta frequency bands. In the frequency domain, the db5 family has a presence in 12 electrodes in the Beta, Alpha and Delta frequency bands. Regarding time, the sym9 filter has a higher presence in 4 electrodes in the Beta, Theta and Delta frequency bands. The purpose of this work is to provide more information for the proper choice of a mother Wavelet in the EEG signal analysis in asymptomatic volunteers.

Epilepsy cannot be reduced to a hypersynchronous activation of neurons whose functioning is impaired, resulting on electroencephalogram (EEG) in epileptic seizures or IES. The complex pathophysiological mechanisms require a global approach to the interactions between neural synaptic and nonsynaptic, vascular, and metabolic systems. In the present study, we focused on the interaction between synaptic and nonsynaptic mechanisms through the simultaneous noninvasive multimodal multiscale recording of high-density EEG (HD-EEG; synaptic) and fast optical signal (FOS; nonsynaptic), which evaluate rapid changes in light scattering related to changes in membrane configuration occurring during neuronal activation of IES. Methods: To evaluate changes in light scattering occurring around IES, three children with frontal IES were simultaneously recorded with HD-EEG and FOS. To evaluate change in synchronization, time-frequency representation analysis of the HD-EEG was performed simultaneously around the IES. To independently evaluate our multimodal method, a control experiment with somatosensory stimuli was designed and applied to five healthy volunteers. Results: Alternating increase-decrease-increase in optical signals occurred 200 ms before to 180 ms after the IES peak. These changes started before any changes in EEG signal. In addition, time-frequency domain EEG analysis revealed alternating decrease-increase-decrease in the EEG spectral power concomitantly with changes in the optical signal during IES. These results suggest a relationship between (de) synchronization and neuronal volume changes in frontal lobe epilepsy during IES. Significance: These changes in the neuronal environment around IES in frontal lobe epilepsy observed in children, as they have been in rats, raise new questions about the synaptic/nonsynaptic mechanisms that propel the neurons to hypersynchronization, as occurs during IES. We further demonstrate that this noninvasive multiscale multimodal approach is suitable for studying the pathophysiology of the IES in patients.

Time-varying spectral power of resting-state fMRI networks reveal cross-frequency dependence in dynamic connectivity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; PHASE; EEG; SYNCHRONY; COHERENCE; MEMORY	Brain oscillations and synchronicity among brain regions (brain connectivity) have been studied in resting-state (RS) and task-induced settings. RS-connectivity which captures brain functional integration during an unconstrained state is shown to vary with the frequency of oscillations. Indeed, high temporal resolution modalities have demonstrated both between and cross-frequency connectivity spanning across frequency bands such as theta and gamma. Despite high spatial resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suffers from low temporal resolution due to modulation with slow-varying hemodynamic response function (HRF) and also relatively low sampling rate. This limits the range of detectable frequency bands in fMRI and consequently there has been no evidence of cross frequency dependence in fMRI data. In the present work we uncover recurring patterns of spectral power in network timecourses which provides new insight on the actual nature of frequency variation in fMRI network activations. Moreover, we introduce a new measure of dependence between pairs of rs-fMRI networks which reveals significant cross-frequency dependence between functional brain networks specifically default-mode, cerebellar and visual networks. This is the first strong evidence of cross-frequency dependence between functional networks in fMRI and our subject group analysis based on age and gender supports usefulness of this observation for future clinical applications.

Methods: We collected 231 EEG recordings from 67 infants between 24 and 45 weeks of postmenstrual age. Ten minute epochs of 8 channel polysomnography (N = 323) from active and quiet sleep were used as a training dataset. We extracted a set of 57 EEG features from the time, frequency, and spatial domains. A greedy algorithm was used to define a reduced feature set to be used in a support vector machine classifier. Results: Performance tests showed that our algorithm was able to classify quiet and active sleep epochs with 85% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, and 87% specificity. The performance was not substantially lowered by reducing the epoch length or EEG channel number. The classifier output was used to construct a novel trend, the sleep state probability index, that improves the visualisation of brain state fluctuations. Conclusions: A robust EEG-based sleep state classifier was developed. It performs consistently well across a large span of postmenstrual ages. Significance: This method enables the visualisation of sleep state in preterm infants which can assist clinical management in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Long-range temporal correlations in neural narrowband time-series arise due to critical dynamics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURONAL AVALANCHES; HUMAN BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; NOISE; NETWORKS; EEG	We show theoretically that the hypothesis of criticality as a theory of long-range fluctuation in the human brain may be distinguished from the theory of passive filtering on the basis of macroscopic neuronal signals such as the electroencephalogram, using novel theory of narrowband amplitude time-series at criticality. Our theory predicts the division of critical activity into meta-universality classes. As a consequence our analysis shows that experimental electroencephalography data favours the hypothesis of criticality in the human brain.	[Blythe, Duncan A.

This readings help in forecasting the status of the brain Activity. It is studied that oscillations in the brain activity have been known since long time, but many fundamental aspects of such brain frequencies, particularly their functional importance were unclear. Detecting the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta patterns in brain activity that are related to person's intention to initiate control can be so for known as Electroencephalography. Basing on this phenomenon, the work is carried out to detect the brain wave as delta representing deeply sleep and not dreaming, theta representing drowsy and drifting down into sleep and dreams, alpha represents very relaxed and deepening into meditation, beta waves represents attention and gamma represents hyper brain activity or concentration. To implement this system brain sensor (TGAM EEG sensor), Arduino Uno board, Arduino Sketch IDE, processing IDE software is used to produce the Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta, Gamma waves of brain graphically. This work can be initiative step for applications for the cognitive impaired people, especially in the cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (BD).

J	Ronconi, L; Oosterhof, NN; Bonmassar, C; Melcher, D				Ronconi, Luca; Oosterhof, Nikolaas N.; Bonmassar, Claudia; Melcher, David			Multiple oscillatory rhythms determine the temporal organization of perception	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						oscillations; vision; alpha; theta; MVPA	VISUAL-PERCEPTION; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; REACTION-TIME; EEG ALPHA; BAND OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; ATTENTION; PREDICTS; WINDOWS; BRAIN	Incoming sensory input is condensed by our perceptual system to optimally represent and store information. In the temporal domain, this process has been described in terms of temporal windows (TWs) of integration/segregation, in which the phase of ongoing neural oscillations determines whether two stimuli are integrated into a single percept or segregated into separate events. However, TWs can vary substantially, raising the question of whether different TWs map onto unique oscillations or, rather, reflect a single, general fluctuation in cortical excitability (e.g., in the alpha band). We used multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data to investigate perception of stimuli that either repeated in the same location (two-flash fusion) or moved in space (apparent motion). By manipulating the interstimulus interval (ISI), we created bistable stimuli that caused subjects to perceive either integration (fusion/apparent motion) or segregation (two unrelated flashes). Training a classifier searchlight on the whole channels/frequencies/times space, we found that the perceptual outcome (integration vs. segregation) could be reliably decoded from the phase of prestimulus oscillations in right parieto-occipital channels. The highest decoding accuracy for the two-flash fusion task (ISI = 40 ms) was evident in the phase of alpha oscillations (8-10 Hz), while the highest decoding accuracy for the apparent motion task (ISI = 120 ms) was evident in the phase of theta oscillations (6-7 Hz). These results reveal a precise relationship between specific TW durations and specific oscillations. Such oscillations at different frequencies may provide a hierarchical framework for the temporal organization of perception.

Neural oscillatory activity plays a key role in brain function and provides a high-resolution temporal marker of attention dynamics. Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity is associated with both selecting task-relevant stimuli and filtering task-irrelevant information. METHODS: The present study used electroencephalography to examine alpha-band oscillatory activity associated with attentional capture in 19 children with ASD and 21 age- and IQ-matched typically developing children. Participants completed a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm designed to investigate responses to behaviorally relevant targets and contingent attention capture by task-irrelevant distractors, which either did or did not share a behaviorally relevant feature. Participants also completed 6 minutes of eyes-open resting electroencephalography. RESULTS: In contrast to their typically developing peers, children with ASD did not evidence posterior alpha desynchronization to behaviorally relevant targets. Additionally, reduced target-related desynchronization and poorer target detection were associated with increased ASD symptomatology. Typically developing children also showed behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of contingent attention capture, whereas children with ASD showed no behavioral facilitation or alpha desynchronization to distractors that shared a task-relevant feature. Lastly, children with ASD had significantly decreased resting alpha power, and for all participants increased resting alpha levels were associated with greater task-related alpha desynchronization. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in ASD underresponsivity and impairments in orienting to salient events within their environment are reflected by atypical electroencephalography oscillatory neurodynamics, which may signify atypical arousal levels and/or an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance.

We have used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as imaging modalities with 17 healthy subjects performing the letter n-back task, a standard experimental paradigm related to working memory (WM). The level of MWL was parametrically changed by variation of n from 0 to 3. Nineteen EEG channels were covering the whole-head and 19 fNIRS channels were located on the forehead to cover the most dominant brain region involved in WM. Grand block averaging of recorded signals revealed specific behaviors of oxygenated-hemoglobin level during changes in the level of MWL. A machine learning approach has been utilized for detection of the level of MWL. We extracted different features from EEG, fNIRS, and EEG+fNIRS signals as the biomarkers of MWL and fed them to a linear support vector machine (SVM) as train and test sets. These features were selected based on their sensitivity to the changes in the level of MWL according to the literature. We introduced a new category of features within fNIRS and EEG+fNIRS systems. In addition, the performance level of each feature category was systematically assessed. We also assessed the effect of number of features and window size in classification performance. SVM classifier used in order to discriminate between different combinations of cognitive states from binary- and multi-class states. In addition to the cross-validated performance level of the classifier other metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated for a comprehensive assessment of the classification system. The Hybrid (EEG+fNIRS) system had an accuracy that was significantly higher than that of either EEG or fNIRS. Our results suggest that EEG+fNIRS features combined with a classifier are capable of robustly discriminating among various levels of MWL. Results suggest that EEG+fNIRS should be preferred to only EEG or fNIRS, in developing passive BCIs and other applications which need to monitor users' MWL.

Typical QoE assessment techniques, such as listening tests with self-report ratings, are useful but provide limited insight into these underlying processes. Recent advances in neuroimaging and physiological monitoring technologies, however, have opened new doors and allowed us to better understand and measure QoE perception. In this paper, we explore the use of two neuroimaging techniques, namely electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), to better understand neuronal and cerebral haemodynamic changes resultant from synthesized speech of varying quality. Neural correlates of several QoE dimensions were derived and validated on the publicly available PhySyQX database. Fusion of EEG, fNIRS, and fNIRS-derived physiological parameters, combined with conventional features extracted from the synthesized speech signal showed to accurately represent several QoE dimensions, including those related to listener affective states. It is hoped that these findings will help researchers build better instrumental QoE models that incorporate technological, contextual, and human influence factors.

Time-frequency localized three-band biorthogonal wavelet filter bank using semidefinite relaxation and nonlinear least squares with epileptic seizure EEG signal classification	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Three-band; Biorthogonal wavelet filter bank; Semidefinite programming; Perfect reconstruction filter banks; Time-frequency localization; Epileptic seizure classification	INFILTRATION PARAMETERS; ORTHONORMAL WAVELETS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DESIGN; CONSTRUCTION; ENTROPY; BASES	In this paper, we design time-frequency localized three-band biorthogonal linear phase wavelet filter bank for epileptic seizure electroencephalograph (EEG) signal classification. Time-frequency localized analysis and synthesis low-pass filters (LPF) are designed using convex semidefinite programming (SDP) by transforming a nonconvex problem into a convex SDP using semidefinite relaxation technique. Three band parameterized lattice biorthogonal linear phase perfect reconstruction filter bank (BOLPPRFB) is chosen and nonlinear least squares algorithm is used to determine its parameters values that generate the designed analysis and synthesis LPF such that the band-pass and high-pass filters are also well localized in time and frequency domain. The designed analysis and synthesis three-band wavelet filter banks are compared with the standard two-band filter banks like Daubechies maximally regular filter banks, Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF) biorthogonal filter banks and orthogonal time-frequency localized filter banks. Kruskal-Wallis statistical test is employed to measure the statistical significance of the subband features obtained from the various two and three-band filter banks for epileptic seizure EEG signal classification. The results show that the designed three-band analysis and synthesis filter banks both outperform two-band filter banks in the classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. The designed three-band filter banks and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) are further used together to implement a signal classifier that provides classification accuracy better than the recently reported results for epileptic seizure EEG signal classification.

In fact, the ongoing EEG phase directly reflects cortical excitability: it acts as a gating mechanism for information flow at the neuronal level. Consequently, the key phase modulating perception should be the one present in the brain when the stimulus is actually being processed. Most previous studies, however, reported phase modulation peaking 100 ms or more before target onset. To explain this discrepancy, we first use simulations showing that contamination of spontaneous oscillatory signals by target-evoked ERP and signal filtering (e. g., wavelet) can result in an apparent shift of the peak phase modulation towards earlier latencies, potentially reaching the prestimulus period. We then present a paradigm based on linear systems analysis which can uncover the true latency at which ongoing EEG phase influences perception. After measuring the impulse response function, we use it to reconstruct (rather than record) the brain activity of human observers during white noise sequences. We can then present targets in those sequences, and reliably estimate EEG phase around these targets without any influence of the target-evoked response. We find that in these reconstructed signals, the important phase for perception is that of fronto-occipital similar to 6 Hz background oscillations at about 75 ms after target onset. These results confirm the causal influence of phase on perception at the time the stimulus is effectively processed in the brain.

Increased WM load will increase the amount and difficulty of memory information. Several studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore load-dependent cognition processing according to the time courses of electrophysiological activity or the spatial pattern of blood oxygen metabolic activity. However, the relationships between these two activities and the underlying neural mechanism are still unclear. In this study, using simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI data under an n-back verbal WM task, we modeled the spectral perturbation of EEG oscillation and fMRI activation through joint independent component analysis (JICA). Multi-channel oscillation features were also introduced into the JICA model for further analysis. The results showed that time-locked activity of theta and beta were modulated by memory load in the early stimuli evaluation stage, corresponding to the enhanced activation in the frontal and parietal lobe, which were involved in stimulus discrimination, information encoding and delay-period activity. In the late response selection stage, alpha and gamma activity changes dependent on the load correspond to enhanced activation in the areas of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, which played important roles in attention, information extraction and memory retention. These findings suggest that the increases in memory load not only affect the intensity and time course of the EEG activities, but also lead to the enhanced activation of brain regions which plays different roles during different time periods of cognitive process of WM.

A suitable imaginative activity has to be designed, and suitable parameters have to be determined before neuro-based home appliance system is developed. This paper describes the time-frequency analysis of EEG signals to extract the executed and imagined hand grasping information from the signal for activating and controlling home appliance. The EEG signals were recorded using Open BCI and then processed and analysed using Short-time Fourier transform. It was found that Short-time Fourier transform could extract the executed and imagined hand grasping successfully. The amplitude of EEG signal in time domain and the amplitude of its spectrum have to be used as parameters to activate and control the neuro-based home appliance system.	[Zakaria, M. H.

It is suggested that phase-locked responses to acoustic features show consistent patterns across subjects. Previous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiment showed that subject-dependent template matching classification by theta phase patterns could discriminate three English spoken sentences. In this paper, we adopt electroencephalography (EEG) to the spoken sentence discrimination on Japanese language. and we investigate the performances in various different settings by using: (1) template matching and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers; (2) subject dependent and independent models; (3) multiple frequency bands including theta, alpha, beta, low gamma. and the combination of all frequency bands. The performances in almost settings were higher than the chance level. While performances of SVM and template matching did not differ, the performance with combination of multiple frequency bands outperformed the one that trained only on single frequency bands. Best accuracies in subject dependent and independent models achieved 55.2% by SVM on the combination of all frequency bands and 44.0% by template matching on the combination of all frequency bands, respectively.

Distinct roles of theta and alpha oscillations in the involuntary capture of goal-directed attention	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Goal-directed attention; Attentional capture; Neural oscillations; Alpha; Theta	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-SEARCH; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; UNATTENDED STIMULI; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CONTROL SETTINGS; EEG ALPHA	Mechanisms of attention assign priority to sensory inputs on the basis of current task goals. Previous studies have shown that lateralized neural oscillations within the alpha (8-14 Hz) range are associated with the voluntary allocation of attention to the contralateral visual field. It is currently unknown, however, whether similar oscillatory signatures instantiate the involuntary capture of spatial attention by goal-relevant stimulus properties. Here we investigated the roles of theta (4-8 Hz), alpha, and beta (14-30 Hz) oscillations in human goal-directed visual attention. Across two experiments, we had participants respond to a brief target of a particular color among heterogeneously colored distractors. Prior to target onset, we cued one location with a lateralized, non-predictive cue that was either target- or non-target-colored. During the behavioral task, we recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG), with the aim of analyzing cue-elicited oscillatory activity. We found that theta oscillations lateralized in response to all cues, and this lateralization was stronger if the cue matched the target color. Alpha oscillations lateralized relatively later, and only in response to target colored cues, consistent with the capture of spatial attention. Our findings suggest that stimulus induced changes in theta and alpha amplitude reflect task-based modulation of signals by feature-based and spatial attention, respectively.

In this study, we aimed at understanding the neural mechanisms of motor function recovery after stroke using neurophysiological markers by means of cortical excitability (transcranial magnetic stimulation-TMS) and brain oscillations (electroencephalography-EEG). In this cross-sectional study, 55 subjects with chronic stroke (62 +/- 14 yo, 17 women, 32 +/- 42 months post-stroke) were recruited in two sites. We analyzed TMS measures (i.e., motor threshold-MT-of the affected and unaffected sides) and EEG variables (i.e., power spectrum in different frequency bands and different brain regions of the affected and unaffected hemispheres) and their correlation with motor impairment as measured by Fugl-Meyer. Multiple univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify the predictors of good motor function. A significant interaction effect of MT in the affected hemisphere and power in beta bandwidth over the central region for both affected and unaffected hemispheres was found. We identified that motor function positively correlates with beta rhythm over the central region of the unaffected hemisphere, while it negatively correlates with beta rhythm in the affected hemisphere. Our results suggest that cortical activity in the affected and unaffected hemisphere measured by EEG provides new insights on the association between high-frequency rhythms and motor impairment, highlighting the role of an excess of beta in the affected central cortical region in poor motor function in stroke recovery.

J	Scharinger, M; Steinberg, J; Tavano, A				Scharinger, Mathias; Steinberg, Johanna; Tavano, Alessandro			Integrating speech in time depends on temporal expectancies and attention	CORTEX			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; Prediction; Omission; Speech; Temporal integration	AUDITORY INFORMATION; SENSORY MEMORY; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ENTRAINMENT; WINDOW; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; PREDICTION	Sensory information that unfolds in time, such as in speech perception, relies on efficient chunking mechanisms in order to yield optimally-sized units for further processing. Whether or not two successive acoustic events receive a one-unit or a two-unit interpretation seems to depend on the fit between their temporal extent and a stipulated temporal window of integration. However, there is ongoing debate on how flexible this temporal window of integration should be, especially for the processing of speech sounds. Furthermore, there is no direct evidence of whether attention may modulate the temporal constraints on the integration window. For this reason, we here examine how different word durations, which lead to different temporal separations of sound onsets, interact with attention. In an Electroencephalography (EEG) study, participants actively and passively listened to words where word-final consonants were occasionally omitted. Words had either a natural duration or were artificially prolonged in order to increase the separation of speech sound onsets. Omission responses to incomplete speech input, originating in left temporal cortex, decreased when the critical speech sound was separated from previous sounds by more than 250 msec, i.e., when the separation was larger than the stipulated temporal window of integration (125-150 msec). Attention, on the other hand, only increased omission responses for stimuli with natural durations. We complemented the event-related potential (ERP) analyses by a frequency-domain analysis on the stimulus presentation rate. Notably, the power of stimulation frequency showed the same duration and attention effects than the omission responses. We interpret these findings on the background of existing research on temporal integration windows and further suggest that our findings may be accounted for within the framework of predictive coding.

Examples of wave trains in EEG are alpha, beta, and sleep spindles. We analyze any kinds of wave train electrical activity of the brain in a wide frequency range. We have developed a new method for analyzing wave train electrical activity of the cerebral cortex based on wavelet analysis and ROC analysis that enables to study the detailed time-frequency features of EEG in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The idea of the method is to find local maxima in a wavelet spectrogram and to calculate various characteristics describing these maxima (called wave trains): the leading frequency, the duration (the full-width on the half-maximum of the peak in the spectrogram, FWHM), the bandwidth (FWHM), the number of wave trains per second. Then we conduct statistical analysis of these characteristics. In our previous papers, frequency ranges were found where the quantity of wave trains per second differs between a group of patients in early stage of PD and a group of healthy volunteers. In this paper, the specificity of these PD features is investigated in comparison with the patients with essential tremor (ET).

EEG responses to SSVEP stimuli flickering at different frequencies are recorded, and both mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and autoregressive (AR) reflection coefficients are used as discriminative features of the enrolled users. An analysis of the permanence across time of the brain response to SSVEP stimuli is also performed, by exploiting EEG data acquired in sessions disjoint in time. The employed database is composed by EEG recordings taken from 25 healthy subjects during two different sessions with 15 day average distance between them. The results show that good recognition performance and a high level of permanence can be reached exploiting the proposed method.

Usually, excessive sources produce outliers and potentially affect the actual event related sources. Besides, EEG manifests inherent inter-subject variability of the brain dynamics, at the resting state and/ or under the performance of task(s), caused probably due to the instantaneous fluctuation of psychophysiological states. A wavelet coherence (WC) analysis for optimally selecting associative inter-subject channels is proposed here and is being used to boost performances of motor imagery (MI)-based inter-subject brain computer interface (BCI). The underlying hypothesis is that optimally associative inter-subject channels can reduce the effects of outliers and, thus, eliminate dissimilar cortical patterns. The proposed approach has been tested on the dataset IVa from BCI competition III, including EEG data acquired from five healthy subjects who were given visual cues to perform 280 trials of MI for the right hand and right foot. Experimental results have shown increased classification accuracy (81.79%) using the WC-based selected 16 channels compared to the one (56.79%) achieved using all the available 118 channels. The associative channels lie mostly around the sensorimotor regions of the brain, reinforced by the previous literature, describing spatial brain dynamics during sensorimotor oscillations. Apparently, the proposed approach paves the way for optimised EEG channel selection that could boost further the efficiency and real-time performance of BCI systems.

The data were explained as default mode network (DMN) intrusion in goal-oriented activity. The present study investigates whether a pattern of recurrent lapses in attention can be detected in TBI patients and whether VLFO can be generalized to the sustained attention deficit, regardless of etiology. Methods: Groups of pediatric TBIs and healthy controls performed four attentional tasks. RT and theta/beta timeseries were subjected to wavelet analyses. Results: Significant high-power VLFOs were recorded in patient group performances but not in those of controls, both for RTs and theta/beta in all the tasks. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that central-midline theta/beta ratio could be considered a neurophysiological correlate of RT variability and that the general continuous goal-oriented activity can be cross-etiologically affected by recurrent lapses in attention regardless of the specific cognitive component involved.

A total of 57 iRBD patients confirmed by polysomnography (PSG) and 33 sex and age-matched healthy controls were included and their waking EEG was recorded from five cortical regions for 15 min. Power spectral analyses by fast Fourier transforms were performed on EEG data. In PSG data, the iRBD patients showed sleep disturbances of short total sleep time, decreased sleep efficiency, increased sleep latency and frequent awakening compared to controls. After adjusting for sleep parameters, the absolute alpha power in frontal region in iRBD patients was higher than that in controls (1.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.3, p = 0.037). Dominant occipital frequency (DOF) was lower in iRBD patients than in controls after adjusting for the sleep covariates (9.2 +/- 0.3 Hz vs. 9.5 +/- 0.4 Hz, F = 8, p = 0.006). iRBD patients without cognitive impairment also showed EEG alteration in frontal and occipital cortex at wakefulness, which could be an early marker of cerebral dysfunction in iRBD patients.

This article presents an analytical tool with visualization by exploiting the strengths of the MEG (magnetoencephalographic) neuroimaging technique. The tool automates MEG data import (in tSSS format), channel information extraction, time/frequency decomposition, and circular graph visualization (connectogram) for simple result inspection. For advanced users, the tool also provides magnitude squared coherence (MSC) values allowing personalized threshold levels, and the computation of default model from MEG data of control population. Default model obtained from healthy population data serves as a useful benchmark to diagnose and monitor neuronal recovery during treatment. The proposed tool further provides optional labels with international 10-10 system nomenclature in order to facilitate comparison studies with EEG (electroencephalography) sensor space. Potential applications in epilepsy and traumatic brain injury studies are also discussed.

Based on the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by deficits in functional integration within neuronal networks, this study aimed to explore whether psychotic patients exhibit differences in brain regions involved in integrative mechanisms. We report an electroencephalography (EEG)-informed functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis of eyes-open resting-state data collected from patients and healthy controls at two study sites. Global field synchronization (GFS) was chosen as an EEG measure indicating common-phase synchronization across electrodes. Several brain clusters appeared to be coupled to GFS differently in patients and controls. Activation in brain areas belonging to the default mode network was negatively associated to GFS delta (1-3.5 Hz) and positively to GFS beta (13-30 Hz) bands in patients, whereas controls showed an opposite pattern for both GFS frequency bands in those regions; activation in the extrastriate visual cortex was inversely related to GFS alphal (8.5-10.5 Hz) band in healthy controls, while patients had a tendency toward a positive relationship. Taken together, the GFS measure might be useful for detecting additional aspects of deficient functional network integration in psychosis.

Electroencephalography (EEG) of end stage ALS Otients has reportedly shown specific features based on neuronal network modulations, differing from EEG of other patients with cognitive failure and dementia. However, EEG of end-stage ALS patients during anaesthesia has not yet been reported. A 64-year-old male ALS patient with locked-in state (LIS), supported by tracheostomy positive-pressure ventilation (TPPV) and enteral nourishment for 9 years, underwent scheduled general anaesthesia for repair of a fractured mandible. He could blink and open his eyes, but seldom opened or closed his eyes on instruction. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was induced under continuous EEG monitoring with bispectral index (BIS), which is commonly used to examine the level of anaesthesia. Prominent alpha oscillations with lower peak frequency and high amplitude appeared during anaesthesia, differing from the characteristics of EEG seen in patients with general cognitive failure. Conversely, BIS reflected the sevoflurane concentration in this ALS patient, similar to healthy individuals, and BIS monitoring was useful for estimating the depth of anaesthesia. The prominent alpha oscillation revealed in this rare case report may suggest modulation of the functional neuronal network system during anaesthesia in patients with progressive ALS, in a manner quite different from typical dementia patients. EEG abnormalities in the present ALS patient did not influence the availability of BIS monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are so far unclear. We investigated whether carryover effects from a preceding musical cue to a speech stimulus result from a continuation of neural phase entrainment to periodicities that are present in both music and speech. Participants listened and memorized French metrical sentences that contained (quasi-)periodic recurrences of accents and syllables. Speech stimuli were preceded by a rhythmically regular or irregular musical cue. Our results show that the presence of a regular cue modulates neural response as estimated by EEG power spectral density, intertrial coherence, and source analyses at critical frequencies during speech processing compared with the irregular condition. Importantly, intertrial coherences for regular cues were indicative of the participants' success in memorizing the subsequent speech stimuli. These findings underscore the highly adaptive nature of neural phase entrainment across fundamentally different auditory stimuli. They also support current models of neural phase entrainment as a tool of predictive timing and attentional selection across cognitive domains.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a promising tool to support the diagnosis and evaluation of abnormalities in the human brain. The EEG sensors record the brain activity directly with excellent time resolution. In this study, EEG sensor with 19 electrodes were used to test the background activities of the brains of five vascular dementia (VaD), 15 stroke-related patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 15 healthy subjects during a working memory (WM) task. The objective of this study is twofold. First, it aims to enhance the recorded EEG signals using a novel technique that combines automatic independent component analysis (AICA) and wavelet transform (WT), that is, the AICA-WT technique; second, it aims to extract and investigate the spectral features that characterize the post-stroke dementia patients compared to the control subjects. The proposed AICA-WT technique is a four-stage approach. In the first stage, the independent components (ICs) were estimated. In the second stage, three-step artifact identification metrics were applied to detect the artifactual components. The components identified as artifacts were marked as critical and denoised through DWT in the third stage. In the fourth stage, the corrected ICs were reconstructed to obtain artifact-free EEG signals. The performance of the proposed AICA-WT technique was compared with those of two other techniques based on AICA andWT denoising methods using cross-correlation XCorr and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The AICA-WT technique exhibited the best artifact removal performance. The assumption that there would be a deceleration of EEG dominant frequencies in VaD and MCI patients compared with control subjects was assessed with AICA-WT (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Therefore, this study may provide information on post-stroke dementia particularly VaD and stroke-related MCI patients through spectral analysis of EEG background activities that can help to provide useful diagnostic indexes by using EEG signal processing.

Richard			Sure I'm Sure: Prefrontal Oscillations Support Metacognitive Monitoring of Decision Making	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; decision making; EEG; metacognition	SIGNAL-DETECTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; FALSE MEMORIES; CONFIDENCE; DYNAMICS; THETA; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COGNITION; CHOICE; TIME	Successful decision making critically involves metacognitive processes such as monitoring and control of our decision process. Metacognition enables agents to modify ongoing behavior adaptively and determine what to do next in situations in which external feedback is not (immediately) available. Despite the importance of metacognition for many aspects of life, little is known about how our metacognitive system operates or about what kind of information is used for metacognitive (second-order) judgments. In particular, it remains an open question whether metacognitive judgments are based on the same information as first-order decisions. Here, we investigated the relationship between metacognitive performance and first-order task performance by recording EEG signals while participants were asked to make a "diagnosis" after seeing a sample of fictitious patient data (a complex pattern of colored moving dots of different sizes). To assess metacognitive performance, participants provided an estimate about the quality of their diagnosis on each trial. Results demonstrate that the information that contributes to first-order decisions differs from the information that supports metacognitive judgments. Further, time-frequency analyses of EEG signals reveal that metacognitive performance is associated specifically with prefrontal theta-band activity. Together, our findings are consistent with a hierarchical model of metacognition and suggest a crucial role for prefrontal oscillations in metacognitive performance.

In the new parametric modelling framework, the time-dependent parameters of the TVAR model are locally represented by using a novel multi-scale wavelet decomposition scheme, which can allow the capability to capture the smooth trends as well as track the abrupt changes of time-varying parameters simultaneously. A forward orthogonal least square (FOLS) algorithm aided by mutual information criteria are then applied for sparse model term selection and parameter estimation. Two simulation examples illustrate that the performance of the proposed multi-scale wavelet basis functions outperforms the only single-scale wavelet basis functions or Kalman filter algorithm for many nonstationary processes. Furthermore, an application of the proposed method to a real EEG signal demonstrates the new approach can provide highly time-dependent spectral resolution capability.

Any lags are compatible with axonal conduction velocities and neural integration times. The important analysis of resting state networks is generally based on the assumption that these principles also hold for spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity. Previous observations using simultaneous EEG and fMRI indicate that slower processes, with delays in the seconds range, determine at least part of the relationship between spontaneous EEG and fMRI. To assess this relationship systematically, we used deconvolution analysis of EEG-fMRI during the resting state, assessing the relationship between EEG frequency bands and fMRI BOLD across the whole brain while allowing for time lags of up to 10.5 s. Cluster analysis, identifying similar BOLD time courses in relation to EEG band power peaks, showed a clear segregation of functional subsystems of the brain. Our analysis shows that fMRI BOLD increases commonly precede EEG power increases by seconds. Most zero-lag correlations, on the other hand, were negative. This indicates two main distinct neuromodulatory mechanisms: an "idling" mechanism of simultaneous electric and metabolic network anticorrelation and a "regulatory" mechanism in which metabolic network activity precedes increased EEG power by some seconds. This has to be taken into consideration in further studies which address the causal and functional relationship of metabolic and electric brain activity patterns.

Due to the synchronized activity of large group of neurons, epileptic seizures occur. These epileptic seizures cause numerous changes in the behaviour and perception of the patient. Even if the epileptic seizures are quite rare in a given patient, the fear of the occurrence of next seizure and helplessness feeling will have a very strong influence on the daily life of a patient. To improve the quality of life of these epileptic patients, a systematic method to predict the occurrence of seizures should be reliable. In biomedical science, EEG signals provide very valid contributions and hence the careful analysis of EEG recordings is required to understand the valuable information. To capture the brain signals of the epileptic patient, Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used. EEG has a good temporal resolution and is non invasive in nature with a low maintenance cost. Since the EEG recordings are too huge to process, certain form of dimensionality reduction technique is required to reduce the dimensions of the EEG data in order to process the data. In this paper, Power Spectral Density (PSD) is used a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the dimensions. It is then transmitted through the Space Time Trellis Coded Multiple Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (STTC MIMO-OFDM) System. As the system suffers from a high PAPR, Quadrature Mirror Filtering Based Partial Transmit Sequence (QMF-PTS) is proposed to reduce the PAPR. At the receiver, the classifier engaged here is Polynomial Kernel Based Support Vector Machine (PK-SVM) to classify the epilepsy from EEG signals. The performance metrics is analyzed in terms of performance index, sensitivity, specificity, time delay, quality value and accuracy.

The indicators of coherence of frequency components of electroencephalography in a quiet state and during solving tasks, involving verbal-logical type of thinking, were assessed. The study included two stages: at the first stage, the individual psycho-physiological features of the students were investigated, then, the students investigated were divided into two groups, those with low and those with medium levels of performing tests. Performance of tasks involving verbal-logical thinking, compared with the background state, was characterized by polyrhythmic EEG activity with dominating d-oscillations and prevailing delta-activity in the frontal area, which indicates their special role in regulation of complicated forms of cognitive activity. With development of ability of verbal-logical thinking, we established the increase in the spectral capacity in the frontal F-3, F-7,F- central.3,.4, parietal.3,.4 and temporal.5 leads and increasing of synchronization in a-range in the left frontal zone, in areas near the Vernike zone and in the contour area F-4-F-8-T-4-P-4 of the right hemisphere. In the process of solving logical problems, the students with the low level of development of this cognitive ability demonstrated an increase of SC of beta(1)oscillation in F-p2,.3,.2 leads, and the students with the medium level of development of logical thinking, on the contrary, demonstrated a reliable decrease in capacity of beta(1)-oscillations in the central.4 and parietal.4 leads. However, in the most productive students, a considerable number of significant functional connections and high values of coefficients of coherence between frontal F-3-F-4, F-4-C-4, central and parietal C-3-P-3, C-4-P-3, C-4-P-4 and occipital O-1-O-2 leads in the above mentioned EEG range were recorded. The spectral capacity of beta(2)-components of EEG in students with different levels of development of logical thinking varied within background values and decreased in certain sections. The students with the medium level of manifestation of verbal-logical thinking demonstrated synchronization of SC of beta(2)-range between frontal Fp(1)-Fp(2), Fp(2)-F-7, F-3-F-4 and other C-3-C-4, O-1-T-5, T-3-T-4 leads. While performing the tasks involving logical thinking, the students with low manifestation of this mental ability, did not demonstrate any considerable changes in indicators of SC of the.-range. However, a reliable increase was established in the Fp(1), Fp(2), F-7 and in o(2) leads in the students tested in the group with the medium manifestation of cognitive ability. It should also be noted that with the development of verbal-logical way of thinking, the brain transfers in a special functioning mode with the low functional connection in the area of.-oscillations, which indicates the preservation of the previously formed neural network. Therefore, in this work, we for the first-time distinguished special features and functional connections during performing verbal, rather than mathematical cognitive logical tasks: localization of loci of interaction at afrequencies in frontal and central leads of the right hemisphere; beta(1)-in frontal leads of the left and central right hemisphere, beta(2) -in frontal and occipital left and in occipital areas of the right hemisphere. It was established that in lowfrequency delta-and theta-ranges of EEG, both large cell ensembles, which embrace almost all right hemisphere, and separate sections in frontal, pariental, pariental-occipital locuses of the left hemisphere, are functionally integrated.

J	Xia, Z; Cao, XL; Hao, R; Min, W				Xia, Zhang; Cao, Xueli; Hao, Ren; Min, Wang			A novel unsupervised automated epileptic seizure detection methodology based on complex networks synchronous state with EEG signals.	BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						Complex networks; Epileptic seizure detection; EEG signals; Synchronous state	SYNCHRONIZATION	One of the most challenging tasks with Electroencephalography ( EEG) signals is the automated epileptic seizure detection. Traditional automated epileptic seizure detection approaches focus on time or frequency domain to analyse EEG signals. A novel technique for epileptic seizure detection is proposed in this paper, which is based on complex networks synchronous state. The concept of complex network synchronization states has been introduced firstly, and then a network varying with time has been defined by taking the measurement EEG signals as nodes. The dynamic mechanics of the EEG signals network has been quantitatively described by mathematical analysis method. Finally, the mathematical definition, the calculation method and the physical meaning of the EEG signal network synchronous state has been given in this paper. The above theoretical derivation had shown that synchronous state can be employed to assess the level of healthy state with EEG signals. The couple matrix A=(a(ij))(NxN) of complex network has been defined by the distance relevance of the measured data, and the left eigenvector (xi(1),xi(2),...,xi(N)), corresponding to the zero feature of the matrix, has been employed to character the local details of complex network nodes. Then, a node fault diagnosis algorithm has been derived based on network synchronous state. The public available EEG database of University of Bonn (UoB), Germany has been used to verify the effectiveness and validity of our proposed method, which has become a benchmark for developing the epilepsy seizure detection systems. Furthermore, the excellent performance of the proposed method has shown that this method can be employed to track the patient healthy state and monitor the moment of epilepsy seizure.

Discrete Wavelet Transform based statistical features for the Drowsiness detection from EEG	16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 07-10, 2016	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Engn, Biomed Engn Soc, AIP Publishing		Drowsiness; Relative Wavelet Packet Energy (RWPE); and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)	SLEEPINESS; EYE	Drowsiness is a major patron to road accidents. Detection of drowsiness while driving is a challenging objective in accidents avoidance systems. This study reports a new index to assess the drowsiness state of drivers using Joint Time-frequency analysis of Electroencephalography (EEG). Fifteen healthy male participants proffered in this study by performing a tedious driving task on a static simulator for 60 min. The subjects are deprived of sleep for at least 18 hrs and sleep music (Delta waves) played in the background, induces sleep during the task. Acquisition of EEG signals was implemented by eight channel Octal Bio-Amplifier (AD Instruments) at a sampling frequency of 1000Hz. The electrodes positioned at the four lobes of the brain namely Frontal, Temporal, Parietal, and Occipital lobes and further analysis has been carried out in MATLAB T 2007b (Math works, Inc., USA). The EEG signals are de-noised by Chebyshev filter (0.5-40 Hz) and subsequently decomposed into various rhythms of EEG such as Beta (CD5: 14-30 Hz), Alpha (CD6: 8-13 Hz), Theta (CD7: 4-7 Hz), and Delta (CA7: 0.5-3.5 Hz). Two parameters viz., Relative Wavelet Packet Energy (RWPE) and Power within the RMSD (PRMSD) are computed in this study to analyse the driving performance of the subjects against the subjective assessment inferred from the video recordings. The parameters RWPE, PRMSD within Beta and Alpha has reduced relatively in the Parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe as the subjects fall into the drowsy stage. This analysis is clinically correlated as the cortical activity reduces slowly during the onset of sleep. It is clearly evident that these features are significant (p< 0.05) in the detection of drowsiness with Confidence Interval of 14. This study also reports a significant correlation (p< 0.05) between PRMSD of Total mean with Active mean and Drowsy mean with R2 value of 0.82.	[Vamsi, Reddy; Nikhil, C.

Memory for Positive and Negative Political TV Ads: The Role of Partisanship and Gamma Power	POLITICAL COMMUNICATION			English	Article						political advertising; emotion; semantic processing; partisanship; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; EEG RESPONSES; KNOWLEDGE; BRAIN; NEWS; OSCILLATIONS; CONSERVATISM; COGNITION; MEDIA	Despite generating widespread contempt, political TV ads play an important informational role in the lives of citizens. This study examines effects of Ad Type (Positive, Negative, and Comparison) on recognition memory for candidate issue positions. Potential moderators (Ad Sponsor Partisanship X Viewer Partisanship, Ad Type X Viewer Ideology, Ad Type X Viewer Partisanship) of political ad memory are explored, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are used to examine whether semantic processing (indexed as brain activity in the gamma band frequency range) mediates main or moderated effects of Ad Type on Memory. Results reveal a significant interaction between Ad Type and Partisanship, with Republicans remembering more from positive relative to negative ads (significant), and Democrats remembering more from negative ads (marginally significant). A direct effect of Gamma on Memory highlights the considerable potential that EEG (in general) and the gamma frequency band (in particular) may hold for the study of message processing.

Brandon			Accuracy of Limited-Montage Electroencephalography in Monitoring Postanoxic Comatose Patients	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						continuous EEG; cardiac arrest; coma; cost-effectiveness; hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy	CARDIAC-ARREST PATIENTS; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; CONTINUOUS EEG; CARE; ERA	Background. Continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring may help to identify the small percentage of adults with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) who will regain consciousness if allowed sufficient time. However, the limited yield in this population has led some to question the cost-effectiveness cEEG monitoring in this population. We hypothesized that limited-montage cEEG could provide essentially the same neurophysiologic information at lower cost. In this proof of concept study, we aim to demonstrate the potentials of limited channel EEG in prognostication in postanoxic patients. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed cEEG data from cases monitored at our institution with conventional 21-channel EEG over a 6-month period. Twenty-eight cases were identified in which patients with HIE underwent cEEG for at least 24 hours. Gold-standard findings were determined by conventional visual analysis of the full cEEG, and 2 independent electroencephalographers scored the same data using only limited-montage (4-channel) views. The sensitivity and specificity of limited-montage cEEG review were compared with conventional analysis. We also compared the relative costs of conventional and limited-montage EEG. Results. Using 4-channel limited montage cEEG, reviewers were able to classify accurately background continuity (in 88%), background amplitude (in 81%), maximum background frequency (in 70%), periodic epileptiform discharges, including a seizure (in 92%) and sporadic discharges (in 91%). All epileptiform features were detected with greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity. Eye movement artifact seen over bifrontal electrodes gave false positive detections of periodic epileptiform discharges in 31% of cases. Conclusions. Limited-channel continuous EEG monitoring can provide meaningful electrophysiological data that can be used for prognostication in postanoxic comatose patients. Limited channel EEG can be a cost-effective alternative to conventional EEG monitoring in post-anoxic comatose patients.	[Pati, Sandipan; McClain, Lauren; Moura, Lidia; Fan, Yuan; Westover, M.

We examined EEGs of euthymic participants (who were free from the psychiaric symptoms) for the above two conditions at the resting state. A population of participants with healthy levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (n = 50) has been examined with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The powers of the alpha rhythm, interpreted as relaxation waves, were higher during eyes-closed compared to eyes-open condition (P = 0.0aEuro broken vertical bar) in all brain regions (32 EEG channels). The prefrontal cortex was characterized by higher delta, theta, and beta powers during eyes-open periods at the resting state, as compared with eyes-closed ones.	[Kan, D. P. X.; Lee, P.

POSITIVE EFFECTS OF NEUROFEEDBACK INTERVENTION ON RADIATION ONCOLOGY PHYSICIANS' WORKLOAD DURING GO/NO-GO PERFORMANCE TEST	TRAVAIL HUMAIN			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Workload; NASA-TLX; Performance; Patient Safety; Physicians	PROVIDER COGNITIVE WORKLOAD; SELF-REGULATION; EEG; IMPACT; ALPHA; EFFICIENCY; ATTENTION; QUALITY; SAFETY; CPOE	The purpose of this pilot study was to subjectively and objectively measure workload and performance levels among radiation oncologists performing a computerized performance test before and after introducing neurofeedback as a measurable intervention. The intervention consisted of eight neurofeedback sessions, each 28 minutes in length divided into four separate seven-minute training periods, targeting cortical alpha/theta/beta activity in both temporal lobes (C5 alpha/theta, C5 beta, C6 beta, and C6 alpha/theta). The inhibit frequencies for C5 and C6 alpha/theta were 2-4 Hz and 15-30 Hz while the reward frequencies were 5-7 Hz and 8-11 Hz. The inhibit frequencies for beta C5 and beta C6 were 1-12 Hz and 22-30 Hz while the reward frequency was 15-18 Hz. All sensors were referenced to linked ears. Eight subjects were recruited for this pilot study. Workload was assessed subjectively using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) instrument, and objectively using electroencephalography (EEG) data analysis. Performance was subjectively assessed using flow-state survey, and objectively assessed based on time-to-test completion and performance-based errors. Statistical differences in pre-vs. post-intervention scores of i) NASA-TLX, time-to-test completion, and performance-based errors were tested using matched pairs t-test; ii) perceived performance as quantified by the flow-state survey using Wilcoxon signed-rank test; and iii) and pre vs. post temporal lobes EEG changes that were acquired during a continuous performance test using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analysis indicated significant reductions in NASA-TLX (p =.01); significant increases in theta power (training reword; 4-7Hz; p <.01), and reduction in high-alpha/low-beta power (training reword; 13Hz, p <.01) suggesting improved information processing performance; and significant improvements in subjective performance (flowstate survey: p <.01). No significant differences were found in objective continuous performance test measures (time-to-test completion, and performance-based errors; p >.05). Future research is needed to further quantify the impact of neurofeedback on radiation oncology providers' workload and performance.	[Mazur, L. M.; Comitz, E.; Planting, D.; Mosaly, P. R.; Chera, B.

The MI task consisted in throwing a ball with the dominant upper limb while in a standing posture, within an ecological virtual reality (VR) environment (tennis court). The MI was triggered by the visual cues common to the control condition, during which the participant remained mentally passive. As previously developed, our paradigm considers the confounding problem that the reference condition allows two complementary analyses: one which uses the baseline before the occurrence of the visual cues in the MI and control resting conditions respectively; and the other which compares the analog periods between the MI and the control resting-state conditions. We demonstrate that MI activates specific, complex brain networks for the power and phase modulations of the EEG oscillations. An early (225 ms) delta phase-locking related to MI was generated in the thalamus and cerebellum and was followed (480 ms) by phase-locking in theta and alpha oscillations, generated in specific cortical areas and the cerebellum. Phase-locking preceded the power modulations (mainly alpha-beta ERD), whose cortical generators were situated in the frontal BA45, BA11, BA10, central BA6, lateral BA13, and posterior cortex BA2. Cerebellar-thalamic involvement through phase-locking is discussed as an underlying mechanism for recruiting at later stages the cortical areas involved in a cognitive role during MI.

Modern recording methods and advanced computational analyses of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have opened a possibility to study if comparable changes are also observed in the human neonatal brain. We recruited mothers using SRI during pregnancy (n = 22) and controls (n = 62). Mood and anxiety of mothers, newborn neurology, and newborn cortical function (EEG) were assessed. The EEG parameters were compared between newborns exposed to drugs versus controls, followed by comparisons of newborn EEG features with maternal psychiatric assessments. Neurological assessment showed subtle abnormalities in the SRI-exposed newborns. The computational EEG analyses disclosed a reduced interhemispheric connectivity, lower cross-frequency integration, as well as reduced frontal activity at low-frequency oscillations. These effects were not related to maternal depression or anxiety. Our results suggest that antenatal serotonergic treatment might change newborn brain function in a manner compatible with the recent experimental studies. The present EEG findings suggest links at the level of neuronal activity between human studies and animal experiments. These links will also enable bidirectional translation in future studies on the neuronal mechanisms and long-term neurodevelopmental effects of early SRI exposure.

GABA-B Agonist Baclofen Normalizes Auditory-Evoked Neural Oscillations and Behavioral Deficits in the Fmr1 Knockout Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome	ENEURO			English	Article						EEG; fragile X syndrome; GABA; gamma; racemic baclofen; working memory	RESTING-STATE EEG; SYNDROME PHENOTYPES; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; KO MICE; EXPRESSION; ABNORMALITIES; STRESS; RESCUE; HYPERACTIVITY; EXCITABILITY	Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition resulting from FMR1 gene mutation that leads to intellectual disability, autism-like symptoms, and sensory hypersensitivity. Arbaclofen, a GABA-B agonist, has shown efficacy in some individuals with FXS but has become unavailable after unsuccessful clinical trials, prompting interest in publicly available, racemic baclofen. The present study investigated whether racemic baclofen can remediate abnormalities of neural circuit function, sensory processing, and behavior in Fmr1 knockout mice, a rodent model of fragile X syndrome. Fmr1 knockout mice showed increased baseline and auditory-evoked high-frequency gamma (30-80 Hz) power relative to C57BL/6 controls, as measured by electroencephalography. These deficits were accompanied by decreased T maze spontaneous alternation, decreased social interactions, and increased open field center time, suggestive of diminished working memory, sociability, and anxiety-like behavior, respectively. Abnormal auditory-evoked gamma oscillations, working memory, and anxiety-related behavior were normalized by treatment with baclofen, but impaired sociability was not. Improvements in working memory were evident predominantly in mice whose auditory-evoked gamma oscillations were dampened by baclofen.

The unexpected and continous electrical disturbances in the brain can be very disturbing to the patient thereby affecting the overall quality and happiness of the patient's life. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals helps in the analysis and diagnosis of epilepsy by recording the activities in the cortical regions of the epileptic patient. Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal EEG signal flow. The recordings of the EEG signals are too huge to process and hence the necessity of dimensionality reduction is mandatory. The total number of epileptic patients analyzed in this work is twenty. Initially the dimensions of the EEG signal are reduced with the help of Fuzzy Mutual Information (FMI). The dimensionally reduced data is then transmitted with the help of a 2 x 2 Orthogonal Space Time Block Coded Multiple Input Multiple OutputOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OSTBC MIMO-OFDM) System. As the OSTBC MIMO-OFDM System suffers a high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR), a unique approach of Singular Value Decomposition Based Partial Transmit Scheme (SVD-PTS) is proposed to reduce the PAPR and Bit Error Rate (BER) at the receiver side. Also at the receiver side, Gaussian Kernel Based Support Vector Machine (G-SVM) with a Kernel value of 10 is utilized thoroughly in this work. The performance metrics such as Specificity, Sensitivity, Time Delay, Quality Value, Performance Index and Accuracy are analyzed here. Results show that an average accuracy of 95.38% is obtained, average perfect classification rate is 90.76%, time delay is 2.19 seconds and quality value is 20.53.

There is a critical need for real time surrogate markers of therapeutic success, to aid in patient selection and/or modification of interventions in neonatal encephalopathy (NE). This is a proof of concept study aiming to quantify neurovascular coupling (NVC) using wavelet analysis of the dynamic coherence between amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy in NE. NVC coupling is assessed by a wavelet metric estimation of percent time of coherence between NIRS SctO2 and aEEG for 78 hours after birth. An abnormal outcome was predefined by a Bayley III score < 85 by 18-24 m. We observed high coherence, intact NVC, between the oscillations of SctO2 and aEEG in the frequency range of 0.00025-0.001 Hz in the non-encephalopathic newborns. NVC coherence was significantly decreased in encephalopathic newborns who were cooled vs. non-encephalopathic controls (median IQR 3[2-9] vs. 36 [33-39]; p < 0.01), and was significantly lower in those with abnormal 24 months outcomes relative to those with normal outcomes (median IQR 2[1-3] vs 28[19-26], p = 0.04). Wavelet coherence analysis of neurovascular coupling in NE may identify infants at risk for abnormal outcomes.

Methods: We studied EEG activity in epilepsy patients with lesional epilepsy. Lesions were classified by type and by location (region and depth). We marked a maximum of 50 IEDs during deep non-rapid eye movement sleep. IEDs were identified as spikes or sharp waves with or without slow waves, or bursts of spikes or sharp waves with or without slow waves. We analyzed HFOs in the studies showing at least 50 IEDs. Results: In 192 scalp EEG studies, the differences in the percentage of studies showing IEDs in each depth-related group were not statistically significant, whereas HFOs (55 studies) predominated in patients exhibiting superficial lesions (p < 0.001). Sharp waves, as predominant pattern, were more prevalent in hippocampal abnormalities (p < 0.001), whereas bursts predominated in patients with malformations of cortical development (p < 0.001). Significance: The depth of the lesion does not influence the presence of IEDs, as one might expect, but it influences that of HFOs. This is explained as follows. HFOs are generated in the epileptogenic region, do not propagate, and hence are only visible on scalp EEG with superficial lesions. IEDs can result from a nearby focus or propagate from a deep generator and are therefore equally present with deep, intermediate, and superficial lesions. Additionally, IED morphology provides information in determining the lesion type.

In this study, results from algorithms used to remove artifacts in EEG measurements are presented. The study consists of three parts. In the first part, EEG signals were band-pass filtered to remove high frequency noise and low frequency drift. Next, the artifacts were removed by using traditional regression method and independent component analysis (ICA). Finally, the performances of the two artifact removal methods were compared. Although artifacts were suppressed better by ICA than regression, ICA caused decrease in root mean square (RMS) values of the non-artifactual parts of some channels.

Transient waveforms observed in sleep electroencephalography are structures with specific amplitude and frequency characteristics that can occur in some stages of sleep. The determination of the k-complex, which is one of these structures, is performed by visual scoring of all night sleep recordings by expert physicians. For this reason, a decision support system that allows automatic detection of the k-complex can give physicians more objective results in diagnosis. In this study, sleep EEG records scored by a physician were analyzed in different methods from the literature. Three features have been determined that express the k-complex presence and k-complexes were detected using these features and support vector machines. As a result, the performance of the algorithm was evaluated and sensitivity and specificity were determined as 70.83% and 85.29%, respectively.

The effect that produces those auditory stimuli is, however, not well understood yet. Furthermore, the conventional clinical protocol is based on a trial-error procedure, and there is not a formal and adequate treatment follow-up. At present, the only way to evaluate acoustic therapies is by means of subjective methods such as analog visual scale and ad-hoc questionnaires. Methods: This protocol seeks to establish an objective methodology to treat tinnitus with acoustic therapies based on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity evaluation. On the hypothesis that acoustic therapies should produce perceptual and cognitive changes at a cortical level, it is proposed to examine neural electrical activity of patients suffering from refractory and chronic tinnitus in four different stages: at the beginning of the experiment, at one week of treatment, at five weeks of treatment, and at eight weeks of treatment. Four of the most efficient acoustic therapies found at the moment are considered: retraining, auditory discrimination, enriched acoustic environment, and binaural. Discussion: EEG has become a standard brain imaging tool to quantify and qualify neural oscillations, which are basically spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns associated with particular perceptual, cognitive, motor and emotional processes. Neural oscillations have been traditionally studied on the basis of event-related experiments, where time-locked and phase-locked responses (i.e., event-related potentials) along with time-locked but not necessary phase-locked responses (i.e., event-related (de) synchronization) have been essentially estimated. Both potentials and levels of synchronization related to auditory stimuli are herein proposed to assess the effect of acoustic therapies.

Repetitive somatosensory electrical stimulation (SES) is a promising method to promote recovery of hand function. However, studies using SES have largely focused on gross motor function; it remains unclear if it can modulate distal hand functions such as finger individuation. Objective: The specific goal of this study was to monitor the effects of SES on individuation as well as on cortical oscillations measured using EEG, with the additional goal of identifying neurophysiological biomarkers. Methods: Eight participants with a history of acquired brain injury and distal upper limb motor impairments received a single two-hour session of SES using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Pre- and post-intervention assessments consisted of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), finger fractionation, pinch force, and the modified Ashworth scale (MAS), along with resting-state EEG monitoring. Results: SES was associated with significant improvements in ARAT, MAS and finger fractionation. Moreover, SES was associated with a decrease in low frequency (0.9-4 Hz delta) ipsilesional parietomotor EEG power. Interestingly, changes in ipsilesional motor theta (4.8-7.9 Hz) and alpha (8.8-11.7 Hz) power were significantly correlated with finger fractionation improvements when using a multivariate model. Conclusions: We show the positive effects of SES on finger individuation and identify cortical oscillations that may be important electrophysiological biomarkers of individual responsiveness to SES. These biomarkers can be potential targets when customizing SES parameters to individuals with hand dexterity deficits.

We propose a combination of symbolic and recurrence analysis in order to identify recurrence domains in the signal. This method allows to obtain a symbolic representation of the data. Recurrence analysis produces valid results for multidimensional data, however, in the case of univariate time series one should perform phase space reconstruction first. In this chapter, we propose a new method of phase space reconstruction based on the signal's time-frequency representation and compare it to the delay embedding method. We argue that the proposed method outperforms the delay embedding reconstruction in the case of oscillatory signals. We also propose to use recurrence complexity as a quantitative feature of a signal. We evaluate our method on synthetic data and show its application to experimental EEG signals.

Short Time Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform are commonly used time-frequency analysis methods. The limitations of these methods initiated the use of methods such as synchrosqueezing and multivariate synchrosqueezing methods. In our proposed method 88.9%, 77.8%, 80.6% accuracy rates were obtained respectively for the valence, activation and dominance parameters using and multivariate synchrosqueezing methods and support vector machines(SVM) which yields better results than most of the other methods mentioned in the literature.

Further, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals makes the task more difficult. Determination of epileptic focus is essential for the treatment of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. This requires accurate separation of focal and non-focal groups of EEG signals. Hence, an intelligent system that can detect and discriminate focal-class (FC) and non-focal-class (NFC) of EEG signals automatically can aid the clinicians in their diagnosis. In order to facilitate accurate analysis of non-stationary signals, joint time-frequency localized bases are highly desirable. The performance of wavelet bases is found to be effective in analyzing transient and abrupt behavior of EEG signals. Hence, we employ a novel class of orthogonal wavelet filter banks which are localized in time-frequency domain to detect FC and NFC EEG signals automatically. We classify EEG signals as FC and NFC using the proposed wavelet based system. We compute various entropies from the wavelet coefficients of the signals. These entropies are used as discriminating features for the classification of FC and NFC of EEG signals. The features are ranked using Student's t-test ranking algorithm and then fed to Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) to classify the signals. Our proposed method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 94.25%. We have obtained 91.95% sensitivity and 96.56% specificity, respectively, using this method. The classification of FC and NFC of EEG signals helps in localization of the affected brain area which needs to undergo surgery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SSVEP is used to interpret the EEG signal to detect the desired goal of the experiment. In this paper, we aim to investigate SSVE signal by means of magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) analysis between the red and green visual stimuli. In the experimental paradigm, we considered two parameters that are chromatic color and flickering frequency where an epoch interval was 10 seconds. The obtained results showed the statistically significant frequency-domain response and its maximum MSC coefficient in the theta and alpha bands for green and red flickers, respectively.

Although the neural underpinnings of divergent and convergent thinking are still poorly understood, several electroencephalography (EEG) studies point to differences in alpha band oscillations between these thinking modes. We reason that, because most previous studies employed typical block designs, these pioneering findings may mainly reflect the more sustained aspects of creative processes that extend over longer time periods, and that still much is unknown about the faster-acting neural mechanisms that dissociate divergent from convergent thinking during idea generation. To this end, we developed a new event related paradigm, in which we measured participants' tendency to implicitly follow a rule set by examples, versus breaking that rule, during the generation of novel names for specific categories (e.g., pasta, planets). This approach allowed us to compare the oscillatory dynamics of rule convergent and rule divergent idea generation and at the same time enabled us to measure spontaneous switching between these thinking modes on a trial-to-trial basis. We found that, relative to more systematic, rule convergent thinking, rule divergent thinking was associated with widespread decreases in delta band activity. Therefore, this study contributes to advancing our understanding of the neural underpinnings of creativity by addressing some methodological challenges that neuroscientific creativity research faces.

Time-frequency analysis methods have been widely used to analyse the EEG and identified characteristic oscillations for each vigilance state (VS), i.e., wakefulness, rapid-eye movement (REM) and non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep. However, other aspects such as change of patterns associated with brain dynamics may not be captured unless a non-linear-based analysis method is used. In this pilot study, Permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), a novel symbolic dynamics analysis method, was used to characterise the changes in the EEG in sleep and wakefulness during baseline and recovery from sleep deprivation (SD). The results obtained with PLZC were contrasted with a related non-linear method, Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). Both measure the emergence of new patterns. However, LZC is dependent on the absolute amplitude of the EEG, while PLZC is only dependent on the relative amplitude due to symbolisation procedure and thus, more resistant to noise. We showed that PLZC discriminates activated brain states associated with wakefulness and REM sleep, which both displayed higher complexity, compared to NREM sleep. Additionally, significantly lower PLZC values were measured in NREM sleep during the recovery period following SD compared to baseline, suggesting a reduced emergence of new activity patterns in the EEG. These findings were validated using PLZC on surrogate data. By contrast, LZC was merely reflecting changes in the spectral composition of the EEG. Overall, this study implies that PLZC is a robust non-linear complexity measure, which is not dependent on amplitude variations in the signal, and which may be useful to further assess EEG alterations induced by environmental or pharmacological manipulations.

After cerebral ischemia, disruption and subsequent reorganization of functional connections occur both locally and remote to the lesion. Recently, complexity of brain connectivity has been described using graph theory, a mathematical approach that depicts important properties of complex systems by quantifying topologies of network representations. Functional and dynamic changes of brain connectivity can be reliably analyzed via electroencephalography (EEG) recordings even when they are not yet reflected in structural changes of connections. Objective. We tested whether and how ischemic stroke in the acute stage may determine changes in small-worldness of cortical networks as measured by cortical sources of EEG. Methods. Graph characteristics of EEG of 30 consecutive stroke patients in acute stage (no more than 5 days after the event) were examined. Connectivity analysis was performed using eLORETA in both hemispheres. Results. Network rearrangements were mainly detected in delta, theta, and alpha bands when patients were compared with healthy subjects. In delta and alpha bands similar findings were observed in both hemispheres regardless of the side of ischemic lesion: bilaterally decreased small-worldness in the delta band and bilaterally increased small-worldness in the alpha2 band. In the theta band, bilaterally decreased small-worldness was observed only in patients with stroke in the left hemisphere. Conclusions. After an acute stroke, brain cortex rearranges its network connections diffusely, in a frequency-dependent modality probably in order to face the new anatomical and functional frame.

This study examined the relationship between the LRTC of broadband EEG oscillation and depression following cerebral infarction with different hemispheric lesions to provide a novel insight into such depressive disorders. Resting EEGs of 16 channels in 18 depressed (9 left and 9 right lesions) and 21 non-depressed (11 left and 10 right lesions) subjects following cerebral infarction and 19 healthy control subjects were analysed by means of detrended fluctuation analysis, a quantitative measurement of LRTC. The difference among groups and the correlation between the severity of depression and LRTC in EEG oscillation were investigated by statistical analysis. The results showed that LRTC of broadband EEG oscillations in depressive subjects was still preserved but attenuated in right hemispheric lesion subjects especially in left pre-frontal and right inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions. Moreover, an association between the severity of psychiatric symptoms and the attenuation of the LRTC was found in frontal, central and temporal regions for stroke subjects with right lesions. A high discriminating ability of the LRTC in the frontal and central regions to distinguish depressive from non-depressive subjects suggested potential feasibility for LRTC as an assessment indicator for depression following right hemispheric cerebral infarction. Different performance of temporal correlation in depressed subjects following the two hemispheric lesions implied complex association between depression and stroke lesion location.

The Relationship of Cognitive Performance and the Theta-Alpha Power Ratio Is Age-Dependent: An EEG Study of Short Term Memory and Reasoning during Task and Resting-State in Healthy Young and Old Adults	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognition; aging neuroscience; Theta Alpha Ratio; EEG; aging	WORKING-MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PEAK FREQUENCY; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; UNITED-STATES; IMPAIRMENT; OSCILLATIONS; DEMENTIA; FMRI; PREDICTION	Objective: The Theta-Alpha ratio (TAR) is known to differ based upon age and cognitive ability, with pathological electroencephalography (EEG) patterns routinely found within neurodegenerative disorders of older adults. We hypothesized that cognitive ability would predict EEG metrics differently within healthy young and old adults, and that healthy old adults not showing age-expected EEG activity may be more likely to demonstrate cognitive deficits relative to old adults showing these expected changes. Methods: In 216 EEG blocks collected in 16 young and 20 old adults during rest (eyes open, eyes closed) and cognitive tasks (short-term memory [STM]; matrix reasoning [RM; Raven's matrices1), models assessed the contributing roles of cognitive ability, age, and task in predicting the TAR. A general linear mixed-effects regression model was used to model this relationship, including interaction effects to test whether increased cognitive ability predicted TAR differently for young and old adults at rest and during cognitive tasks. Results: The relationship between cognitive ability and the TAR across all blocks showed age-dependency, and cognitive performance at the CZ midline location predicted the TAR measure when accounting for the effect of age (p < 0.05, chi-square test of nested models). Age significantly interacted with STM performance in predicting the TAR (p < 0.05); increases in STM were associated with increased TAR in young adults, but not in old adults. RM showed similar interaction effects with aging and TAR (p < 0.10). Conclusion: EEG correlates of cognitive ability are age-dependent. Adults who did not show age-related EEG changes were more likely to exhibit cognitive deficits than those who showed age-related changes. This suggests that healthy aging should produce moderate changes in Alpha and TAR measures, and the absence of such changes signals impaired cognitive functioning.

In the present research, we aim at identifying the neural networks and the autonomic responsiveness underlying the human ability to perceive and empathize with others' emotions when positive (cooperative) or negative (uncooperative) interactions are observed. A multimethodological approach was adopted to elucidate the reciprocal interplay of autonomic (peripheral) and central (cortical) activities in empathic behavior. Electroencephalography (EEG, frequency band analysis) and hemodynamic (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, fNIRS) activity were all recorded simultaneously with systemic skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) measurements as potential biological markers of emotional empathy. Subjects were required to empathize in interpersonal interactions. As shown by fNIRS/EEG measures, negative situations elicited increased brain responses within the right prefrontal cortex (RFC), whereas positive situations elicited greater responses within the left EEC. Therefore, a relevant lateralization effect was induced by the specific valence (mainly for negative conditions) of the emotional interactions. Also, SCR was modulated by positive/negative conditions. Finally, EEG activity (mainly low-frequency theta and delta bands) intrinsically correlated with the cortical hemodynamic responsiveness, and they both predicted autonomic activity. The integrated central and autonomic measures better elucidated the significance of empathic behavior in interpersonal interactions.

We investigate whether the power spectral density of the gamma frequency range can be used to classify the outcome of the object recognition task (i.e. seen, unseen, uncertain). The EEG signals were acquired and analyzed from 128 electrodes located on all parts of the brain. Power spectral density features in gamma frequency are extracted and used for classification in support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers. We tested the hypothesis that gamma EEG would be measurable and could contribute to the classification during the object recognition tasks.

J	Kim, JH; Kim, DW; Im, CH				Kim, Jung-Hoon; Kim, Do-Won; Im, Chang-Hwan			Brain Areas Responsible for Vigilance: An EEG Source Imaging Study	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Vigilance; Sustained attention; Electroencephalography; Source imaging; D2 test of attention	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL SYSTEMS; TOP-DOWN; PERFORMANCE; TASK; ALPHA; REFLECT; REPRESENTATION	Vigilance, sometimes referred to as sustained attention, is an important type of human attention as it is closely associated with cognitive activities required in various daily-life situations. Although many researchers have investigated which brain areas control the maintenance of vigilance, findings have been inconsistent. We hypothesized that this inconsistency might be due to the use of different experimental paradigms in the various studies. We found that most of the previous studies used paradigms that included specific cognitive tasks requiring a high cognitive load, which could complicate identification of brain areas associated only with vigilance. To minimize the influence of cognitive processes other than vigilance on the analysis results, we adopted the d2-test of attention, which is a well-known neuropsychological test of attention that does not require high cognitive load, and searched for brain areas at which EEG source activities were temporally correlated with fluctuation of vigilance over a prolonged period of time. EEG experiments conducted with 31 young adults showed that left prefrontal cortex activity was significantly correlated with vigilance variation in the delta, beta1, beta2, and gamma frequency bands, but not the theta and alpha frequency bands. Our study results suggest that the left prefrontal cortex plays a key role in vigilance modulation, and can therefore be used to monitor individual vigilance changes over time or serve as a potential target of noninvasive brain stimulation.

Since different brain waves correlate to different behavioral states, ECoG signals presents a novel strategy to detect complex behaviors. We developed a program, EEG Detection Analysis for Behavioral States (EEG-DABS) that advances Fast Fourier Transforms through ECoG signals time series, separating it into (user defined) frequency bands and normalizes them to reduce variability. EEG-DABS determines events if segments of an experimental ECoG record have significantly different power bands than a selected control pattern of EEG. Events are identified at every epoch and frequency band and then are displayed as output graphs by the program. Certain patterns of events correspond to specific behaviors. Once a predetermined pattern was selected for a behavioral state, EEG-DABS correctly identified the desired behavioral event. The selection of frequency band combinations for detection of the behavior affects accuracy of the method. All instances of certain behaviors, such as freezing, were correctly identified from the event patterns generated with EEG-DABS. Detecting behaviors is typically achieved by visually discerning unique animal phenotypes, a process that is time consuming, unreliable, and subjective. EEG-DABS removes variability by using defined parameters of EEG/ECoG for a desired behavior over chronic recordings. EEG-DABS presents a simple and automated approach to quantify different behavioral states from ECoG signals.	[Loris, Zachary B.; Dietrich, W.

Successful modulation has been shown to be related to cognitive benefits and wellbeing. The current paper addresses the specificity of three neurofeedback protocols in influencing first- (basic Stroop effect) and second-order (Gratton effect) measures of attentional control. The data come from two previously presented studies that included the Stroop task to assess attentional control. The three neurofeedback protocols were upregulation of frontal alpha, sensorimotor (SMR), and midfrontal theta oscillations. The results show specific effects of different EEG neurofeedback protocols on attentional control and are modulated by the cognitive effort needed in the Stroop task. To summarize, in less-demanding versions of the Stroop task, alpha training improves first- and second-order attentional control, whereas SMR and theta training had no effect. In the demanding version of the Stroop task, theta training improves first-order, but not second-order control and SMR training has no effect on either. Using a drift diffusion model-based analysis, it is shown that only alpha and theta training modulate the underlying cognitive processing, with theta upregulation enhancing evidence accumulation. Although the current results need to be interpreted with caution, they support the use of different neurofeedback protocols to augment specific aspects of the attentional system. Recommendations for future work are made.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based predictions of antidepressant's treatment outcome may help during antidepressant's selection and ultimately improve the quality of life for MDD patients. In this study, a machine learning (ML) method involving pretreatment EEG data was proposed to perform such predictions for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRIs). For this purpose, the acquisition of experimental data involved 34 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. Consequently, a feature matrix was constructed involving time-frequency decomposition of EEG data based on wavelet transform (WT) analysis, termed as EEG data matrix. However, the resultant EEG data matrix had high dimensionality. Therefore, dimension reduction was performed based on a rank-based feature selection method according to a criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC). As a result, the most significant features were identified and further be utilized during the training and testing of a classification model, i.e., the logistic regression (LR) classifier. Finally, the LR model was validated with 100 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV). The classification results were compared with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis, and empirical mode decompositions (EMD). The wavelet features extracted from frontal and temporal EEG data were found statistically significant. In comparison with other time-frequency approaches such as the STFT and EMD, the WT analysis has shown highest classification accuracy, i.e., accuracy = 87.5%, sensitivity = 95%, and specificity = 80%.

What neural mechanisms allow people to comprehend language across sensory modalities? When people listen to speech, electrophysiological oscillations in auditory cortex entrain to slow (<8 Hz) fluctuations in the acoustic envelope. Entrainment to the speech envelope may reflect mechanisms specialized for auditory perception. Alternatively, flexible entrainment may be a general-purpose cortical mechanism that optimizes sensitivity to rhythmic information regardless of modality. Here, we test these proposals by examining cortical coherence to visual information in sign language. First, we develop a metric to quantify visual change over time. We find quasiperiodic fluctuations in sign language, characterized by lower frequencies than fluctuations in speech. Next, we test for entrainment of neural oscillations to visual change in sign language, using electroencephalography (EEG) in fluent speakers of American Sign Language (ASL) as they watch videos in ASL. We find significant cortical entrainment to visual oscillations in sign language <5 Hz, peaking at similar to 1 Hz. Coherence to sign is strongest over occipital and parietal cortex, in contrast to speech, where coherence is strongest over the auditory cortex. Nonsigners also show coherence to sign language, but entrainment at frontal sites is reduced relative to fluent signers. These results demonstrate that flexible cortical entrainment to language does not depend on neural processes that are specific to auditory speech perception. Low-frequency oscillatory entrainment may reflect a general cortical mechanism that maximizes sensitivity to informational peaks in time-varying signals.

However, due to the ambiguity of human emotions and the complexity of EEG signals, the EEG-ER system which can recognize emotions with high accuracy is not easy to achieve. In this paper, by combining discrete wavelet transform, correlation analysis, and neural network methods, we propose an Emotional Recognition model based on rhythm synchronization patterns to distinguish the emotional stimulus responses to different emotional audio and video. In this model, the entire scalp conductance signal is analyzed from a joint time-frequency-space correlation, which is beneficial to the depth learning and expression of affective pattern, and then improve the accuracy of recognition. The accuracy of the proposed multi-layer EEG-ER system is compared with various feature extraction methods. For analysis results, average and maximum classification rates of 64% and 67.0% were obtained for arousal and 66.6% and 76.0% for valence.

A hybrid method based on time-frequency images for classification of alcohol and control EEG signals	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Time-frequency images; Texture image; Feature extraction; Classification; Alcoholism; Nonnegative least squares classifier	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; ETHANOL; NEUROTOXICITY; FEATURES	Classification of alcoholic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a challenging job in biomedical research for diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases of alcoholic people. The aim of this study was to introduce a robust method that can automatically identify alcoholic EEG signals based on time-frequency (T-F) image information as they convey key characteristics of EEG signals. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method to classify automatically the alcoholic and control EEG signals. The proposed scheme is based on time-frequency images, texture image feature extraction and nonnegative least squares classifier (NNLS). In T-F analysis, the spectrogram of the short-time Fourier transform is considered. The obtained T-F images are then converted into 8-bit grayscale images. Co-occurrence of the histograms of oriented gradients (CoHOG) and Eig(Hess)-CoHOG features are extracted from T-F images. Finally, obtained features are fed into NNLS classifier as input for classify alcoholic and control EEG signals. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we replace the NNLS classifier by artificial neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine classifier separately, with the same features. Experimental outcomes along with comparative evaluations with the state-of-theart algorithms manifest that the proposed method outperforms competing algorithms. The experimental outcomes are promising, and it can be anticipated that upon its implementation in clinical practice, the proposed scheme will alleviate the onus of the physicians and expedite neurological diseases diagnosis and research.

It is therefore worthwhile to study the interaction between intrinsic BOLD oscillations (0.1 Hz) and slow oscillations in heart rate interval (RRI) signals and differentiate between their neural and vascular origin. Methods: We studied the phase-coupling with a 3T scanner with high scanning rate between BOLD signals in 22 regions and simultaneously recorded RRI oscillations in 23 individuals in two resting states. Results: By applying a hierarchical cluster analysis, it was possible to separate two clusters of phasecoupling between slow BOLD and RRI oscillations in the midcingulum, one representative for neural and the other for vascular BOLD oscillations. About half of the participants revealed positive time delays characteristic for neural BOLD oscillations and neurally-driven RRI oscillations. Conclusions: The results suggest that slow vascular and neural BOLD oscillations can be differentiated and that intrinsic oscillations (0.1 Hz) originate in the cingulum or its close vicinity and contribute to heart rate variability (HRV). Significance: The study provides new insights into the dynamics of resting state activities, helps to explain HRV, and offers the possibility to investigate slow rhythmic neural activity changes in different brain regions without EEG recording.

Information-theoretical analysis of resting state EEG microstate sequences non-Markovianity, non-stationarity and periodicities	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Resting state; Microstates; Information theory; Non-Markov process; Stationarity; Periodicity	LONG-RANGE CORRELATIONS; ADAPTIVE SEGMENTATION; STOCHASTIC-MODEL; HURST EXPONENTS; MAP SERIES; NREM SLEEP; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; CHAINS	We present an information-theoretical analysis of temporal dependencies in EEG microstate sequences during wakeful rest. We interpret microstate sequences as discrete stochastic processes where each state corresponds to a representative scalp potential topography. Testing low-order Markovianity of these discrete sequences directly, we find that none of the recordings fulfils the Markov property of order 0, 1 or 2. Further analyses show that the microstate transition matrix is non-stationary over time in 80% (window size 10 s), 60% (window size 20 s) and 44% (window size 40 s) of the subjects, and that transition matrices are asymmetric in 14/20 (70%) subjects. To assess temporal dependencies globally, the time-lagged mutual information function (autoinformation function) of each sequence is compared to the first-order Markov model defined by the classical transition matrix approach. The autoinformation function for the Markovian case is derived analytically and numerically. For experimental data, we find non-Markovian behaviour in the range of the main EEG frequency bands where distinct periodicities related to the subject's EEG frequency spectrum appear. In particular, the microstate clustering algorithm induces frequency doubling with respect to the EEG power spectral density while the tail of the autoinformation function asymptotically reaches the first-order Markov confidence interval for time lags above 1000 ms. In summary, our results show that resting state microstate sequences are non-Markovian processes which inherit periodicities from the underlying EEG dynamics. Our results interpolate between two diverging models of microstate dynamics, memoryless Markov models on one side, and long-range correlated models on the other: microstate sequences display more complex temporal dependencies than captured by the transition matrix approach in the range of the main EEG frequency bands, but show finite memory content in the long run.

Resting-state theta/beta EEG ratio is associated with reward- and punishment-related reversal learning	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Beta oscillations; Punishment; Reversal learning; Reward; Theta oscillations	FRONTAL THETA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISM; DYNAMICS; STIMULATION; SENSITIVITY; NEGATIVITY	Prior research has shown that the ratio between resting-state theta (4-7 Hz)-beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is associated with reward- and punishment-related feedback learning and risky decision making. However, it remains unclear whether the theta/beta EEG ratio is also an electrophysiological index for poorer behavioral adaptation when reward and punishment contingencies change over time. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resting-state theta (4-7 Hz)-beta (13-30 Hz) EEG ratio correlated with reversal learning. A 4-min resting-state EEG was recorded and a gambling task with changing reward-punishment contingencies was administered in 128 healthy volunteers. Results showed an inverse relationship between theta/beta EEG ratio and reversal learning. Our findings replicate and extend previous findings by showing that higher midfrontal theta/beta EEG ratios are associated with poorer reversal learning and behavioral adaptive responses under changing environmental demands.

The perturbations induced by artifacts and random noise are particularly difficult to correct because of their high amplitude, wide spectral distribution, and variable topographical distribution. Therefore, de-noising of EEG is a very challenging pre-processing step prior to qualitative or quantitative EEG signal analysis. To address this issue, some de-noising approaches have been proposed for noise suppression. However, most of these methods are only available for multi-electrode EEG signal processing, besides, the co-channel interference are always left unprocessed. Aiming at the obstacles encountered by the conventional approaches in single electrode EEG signal co-channel interference suppression, a method based on time-frequency image dimensionality reduction is proposed in this paper. The innovative idea of the proposed method is that it is applicable for single electrode EEG signal enhancement and the background noise can be suppressed in entire time-frequency space. The proposed method is experimentally validated by a group of real EEG data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective in EEG single electrode co-channel interference suppression.

The subthalamic nucleus is thought to act as a behavioural go/no-go instance by means of oscillatory communication in the theta band with the prefrontal cortex. Because subthalamic alpha-theta frequency stimulation has been shown to exert beneficial effects on verbal fluency in Parkinson0s disease, we hypothesized that an alpha-theta oscillatory network involving the subthalamic nucleus underlies verbal generation task performance as a gating instance for speech execution. Postoperative subthalamic local field potential recordings were performed during a verbal generation compared to a control task. Time-frequency analysis revealed a significant alpha-theta power increase and enhanced alpha-theta coherence between the subthalamic nucleus and the frontal surface EEG during the verbal generation task. Beta and gamma oscillations were not significantly modulated by the task. Power increase significantly correlated with verbal generation performance. Our results provide experimental evidence for local alpha-theta oscillatory activity in the subthalamic nucleus and coherence to frontal associative areas as a neurophysiological mechanism underlying a verbal generation task. Thus, verbal fluency improvement during subthalamic alpha-theta stimulation in Parkinson0s disease is likely due to an enhancement of alpha-theta oscillatory network activity. Alpha-theta oscillations can be interpreted as the rhythmic gating signature in a speech executing subthalamic-prefrontal network.

Automated classification of pain perception using high-density electroencephalography data	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						pain; classification; medial prefrontal cortex; gamma; EEG	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTEX; BRAIN; MOTOR; FMRI; MODULATION; INTENSITY; OSCILLATIONS; SENSITIVITY; POTENTIALS	The translation of brief, millisecond-long pain-eliciting stimuli to the subjective perception of pain is associated with changes in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations over sensorimotor cortex. However, when a pain-eliciting stimulus continues for minutes, regions beyond the sensorimotor cortex, such as the prefrontal cortex, are also engaged. Abnormalities in prefrontal cortex have been associated with chronic pain states, but conventional, millisecond-long EEG paradigms do not engage prefrontal regions. In the current study, we collected high-density EEG data during an experimental paradigm in which subjects experienced a 4-s, low-or high-intensity pain-eliciting stimulus. EEG data were analyzed using independent component analyses, EEG source localization analyses, and measure projection analyses. We report three novel findings. First, an increase in pain perception was associated with an increase in gamma and theta power in a cortical region that included medial prefrontal cortex. Second, a decrease in lower beta power was associated with an increase in pain perception in a cortical region that included the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Third, we used machine learning for automated classification of EEG data into low-and high-pain classes. Theta and gamma power in the medial prefrontal region and lower beta power in the contralateral sensorimotor region served as features for classification. We found a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 89.58%. The development of biological markers for pain states continues to gain traction in the literature, and our findings provide new information that advances this body of work. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The development of a biological marker for pain continues to gain traction in literature. Our findings show that high- and low-pain perception in human subjects can be classified with 89% accuracy using high- density EEG data from prefrontal cortex and contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Our approach represents a novel neurophysiological paradigm that advances the literature on biological markers for pain.

EEG analysis of seizure patterns using visibility graphs for detection of generalized seizures	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Visibility graph (VG); Horizontal VG (HVG); Difference VG (DVG); EEG seizure pattern; Seizure detection; Intellectual disability	THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; COMPLEX NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; BRAIN	Background: The traditional EEG features in the time and frequency domain show limited seizure detection performance in the epileptic population with intellectual disability (ID). In addition, the influence of EEG seizure patterns on detection performance was less studied. New method: A single-channel EEG signal can be mapped into visibility graphs (VGS), including basic visibility graph (VG), horizontal VG (HVG), and difference VG (DVG). These graphs were used to characterize different EEG seizure patterns. To demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying EEG seizure patterns and detecting generalized seizures, EEG recordings of 615 h on one EEG channel from 29 epileptic patients with ID were analyzed. Results: A novel feature set with discriminative power for seizure detection was obtained by using the VGS method. The degree distributions (DDs) of DVG can clearly distinguish EEG of each seizure pattern. The degree entropy and power-law degree power in DVG were proposed here for the first time, and they show significant difference between seizure and non-seizure EEG. The connecting structure measured by HVG can better distinguish seizure EEG from background than those by VG and DVG. Comparison with existing method: A traditional EEG feature set based on frequency analysis was used here as a benchmark feature set. With a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the seizure detection performance of the benchmark feature set (sensitivity of 24%, FDt/h of 1.8s) can be improved by combining our proposed VGS features extracted from one EEG channel (sensitivity of 38%, FDt/h of 1.4s). Conclusions: The proposed VGS-based features can help improve seizure detection for ID patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wang, Lei; Long, Xi; Arends, Johan B. A.

In these studies, linear metrics, e.g., correlation, have been commonly used in identifying brain networks, especially on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, nonlinear mechanism is believed to exist in forming brain networks. In the present study, we investigated the performance of a nonlinear metric, i.e., phase coherence, in probing brain networks, as compared with a linear metric, i.e., power correlation. Specifically, individual IBNs were firstly obtained by a time-frequency independent component analysis (tfICA), and then the interaction among them were probed using either phase coherence (inter-component phase coherence, ICPC) or power correlation coefficient (PCC). We examined them using high-density resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data from a group of patients with a balance disorder who received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatments. The results indicated that the use of ICPC indicated more detections of significant connectivity crossing multiple brain regions in various frequency bands than PCC. Moreover, consistent treatment-related network changes, as compared with previous neuroimaging findings, in this brain disorder were more successfully detected with ICPC. Therefore, it is important to use nonlinear metric in characterizing interactions between different brain regions and IBNs.

To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying how rhythm is learned, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data during a rhythm-reproducing task that asked participants to memorize an auditory stimulus and reproduce it via tapping. Based on the behavioral results, we divided the participants into Learning and No-learning groups. EEG analysis showed that error-related negativity (ERN) in the Learning group was larger than in the No-learning group. Time-frequency analysis of the EEG data showed that the beta power in right and left temporal area at the late learning stage was smaller than at the early learning stage in the Learning group. Additionally, the beta power in the temporal and cerebellar areas in the Learning group when learning to reproduce the rhythm were larger than in the No Learning group. Moreover, phase synchronization between frontal and temporal regions and between temporal and cerebellar regions at late stages of learning were larger than at early stages. These results indicate that the frontal-temporal-cerebellar beta neural circuits might be related to auditory-motor rhythm learning.

Beta-band activity and connectivity in sensorimotor and parietal cortex are important for accurate motor performance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; REACHING MOVEMENTS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; VISUAL INFORMATION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; OSCILLATIONS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; EXCITABILITY	Accurate motor performance may depend on the scaling of distinct oscillatory activity within the motor cortex and effective neural communication between the motor cortex and other brain areas. Oscillatory activity within the beta-band (13-30 Hz) has been suggested to provide distinct functional roles for attention and sensorimotor control, yet it remains unclear how beta-band and other oscillatory activity within and between cortical regions is coordinated to enhance motor performance. We explore this open issue by simultaneously measuring high density cortical activity and elbow flexor and extensor neuromuscular activity during ballistic movements, and manipulating error using high and low visual gain across three target distances. Compared with low visual gain, high visual gain decreased movement errors at each distance. Group analyses in 3D source-space revealed increased theta-, alpha-, and beta-band desynchronization of the contralateral motor cortex and medial parietal cortex in high visual gain conditions and this corresponded to reduced movement error. Dynamic causal modeling was used to compute connectivity between motor cortex and parietal cortex. Analyses revealed that gain affected the directionally-specific connectivity across broadband frequencies from parietal to sensorimotor cortex but not from sensorimotor cortex to parietal cortex. These new findings provide support for the interpretation that broad-band oscillations in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands within sensorimotor and parietal cortex coordinate to facilitate accurate upper limb movement. Summary statement: Our findings establish a link between sensorimotor oscillations in the context of online motor performance in common source space across subjects. Specifically, the extent and distinct role of medial parietal cortex to sensorimotor beta connectivity and local domain broadband activity combine in a time and frequency manner to assist ballistic movements. These findings can serve as a model to examine whether similar source space EEG dynamics exhibit different time-frequency changes in individuals with neurological disorders that cause movement errors.

EEG Activities and the Sustained Attention Performance	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						conjunctive continuous performance task (CCPT); electroencephalography; frequency ranges; sustained attention	POSITIVE AFFECT; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; WORKING-MEMORY; NEUROFEEDBACK; INTELLIGENCE	We investigated the relations between EEG activity and sustained attention in humans. A visual version of the conjunctive continuous performance task (CCPT-V) was used as a measure of sustained attention. Twenty university students voluntarily participated in the study; they were divided into two groups, good and weak, according to their results in the CCPT-V. The spectral power of EEG recorded from Fz, Cz, and Pz was analyzed under three conditions (eyes open, eyes closed, and CCPT-V) in four frequency ranges, theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-60 Hz) in three channels. Results of repeatedmeasures MANOVA showed the significance of the effects of conditions and channels with respect to the alpha and theta but not to the beta and gamma powers. There was no significant effect of the group, but, when comparing the alpha power under three conditions, the good group showed lower spectral powers. It has been concluded that cerebral neuronal systems producing alpha and theta oscillations play a role in sustained attention, and this can be shown by EEG recording and in the respective test.

Rhythmic Modulation of Entrained Auditory Oscillations by Visual Inputs	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Multisensory; Audiovisual; Oscillation; Entrainment; Rhythm; Temporal	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY BANDS; SPEECH; PERCEPTION; PHASE; CORTEX; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Temporal structure is ubiquitous in sensory signals, and the brain has been shown to robustly represent information about temporal structure in the phase of low frequency neural oscillations. In a related construct, the integration of information across the different senses has been proposed to be at least partly due to the phase resetting of these low frequency oscillations. As a consequence, oscillations represent a potential contributor to the encoding of complex multisensory signals with informative temporal structures. Here we investigated these interactions using electroencephalography (EEG). We entrained low frequency (3 Hz) delta oscillations using a repetitive auditory stimulus-broadband amplitude modulated noise. Following entrainment, we presented auditory and audiovisual stimuli at variable delays. We examined whether the power of oscillations at the entrained frequency was dependent on the delay (and thus, potentially, phase) at which subsequent stimulation was delivered, and whether this relationship was different for subsequent multisensory (i.e., audiovisual) stimuli when compared with auditory stimuli alone. Our findings demonstrate that, when the subsequent stimuli are solely auditory, the power of oscillations at the entrained frequency is rhythmically modulated by when the stimulus was delivered. For audiovisual stimuli, however, no such dependency is present, yielding consistent power modulations. These effects indicate that reciprocal oscillatory mechanisms may be involved in the continuous encoding of complex temporally structured multisensory inputs such as speech.

Methods: Ten adult normal volunteers listened to a CD encouraging mindfulness for one hour and five minutes while their EEG was recorded on a 128 channel DC based ANT system. The software package BESA Research version 6.1 was used for data analysis. The data were subjected to topographic display, frequency as well as independent component analysis. Results: Near-DC activity that extended beyond one hour, as well as rhythmic wave durations ranging from about 10 to 35 min, was observed in all subjects. For this task the major topographic distribution was mainly in frontal near midline areas and the inferior portions of the hemispheres. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that rhythms below the infraslow band, as well as a near-DC component, exist in the normal human EEG. Their significance for health and disease now needs to be explored. Significance: Since DC-based EEG/MEG systems are already in use by some laboratories, investigators are encouraged to include the exploration of these ultra-slow waves in the review of their data.

Here, we compared "super-Nyquist" density EEG ("SND") with Nyquist density ("ND") arrays for assessing the spatiotemporal aspects of early visual processing. EEG was measured from 128 electrodes arranged over occipitotemporal brain regions (14 mm spacing) while participants viewed flickering checkerboard stimuli. Analyses compared SND with ND-equivalent subsets of the same electrodes. Frequency-tagged stimuli were classified more accurately with SND than ND arrays in both the time and the frequency domains. Representational similarity analysis revealed that a computational model of V1 correlated more highly with the SND than the ND array. Overall, SND EEG captured more neural information from visual cortex, arguing for increased development of this approach in basic and translational neuroscience.

However, the relationship of these parameters to brain activity remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of airflow on brain activity using electroencephalograms (EEG) of participants in a living environment under different airflow conditions. Before the recording, the room was set to a standardised air temperature and humidity. During the recording, each participant was required to perform a simple time-perception task that involved pressing buttons after estimating a 10-second interval. Cooling and heating experiments were conducted in summer and winter, respectively. A frequency analysis of the EEGs revealed that gamma and beta activities showed lower amplitudes under conditions without airflow than with airflow, regardless of the season (i.e., cooling or heating). Our results reveal new neurophysiological markers of the response to airflow sensation. Further, based on the literature linking gamma and beta waves to less anxious states in calm environments, we suggest that airflow may alter the feelings of the participants.

Here we hypothesized that in healthy volunteers this FV would increase excitability in the primary sensorimotor cortex (S1-M1) during an isometric contraction of the stimulated muscle. The design included an initial control condition with no FV stimulation (Baseline) as well as three short experimental sessions of FV and a Sham (fake) session in a pseudo-random order. In the Baseline condition and immediately after those sessions, electroen-cephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded during a mild isometric muscle contraction of the right arm. Alpha and beta motor-related EEG power desynchronization (MRPD) at C4 and C3 electrodes overlying Rolandic regions were used as an index of the cortical excitation in S1-M1. Results showed that, compared to the Baseline (no FV) or Sham stimulation, the first two FV sessions showed a cumulative increase in alpha (but not beta) MRPD at C3 electrode, suggesting a specific effect of vibration on the excitability of contralateral S1-M1 generating EEG "mu" rhythms. FV over limb muscles modulates neurophysiological oscillations enhancing excitability of contralateral S1-M1 in healthy volunteers. The proposed mechanism may explain the clinical effects of vibratory rehabilitation in neurological patients with motor deficits. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An model-based design approach is used to implement Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) and extract 20 frequency feature components for classification. These 20 features are divided into 5 groups corresponding to 5 different brainwaves bands. Each feature is defined as the average power spectrum of a number of adjacent frequency components. A hardware model is designed using Xilinx System Generator and implemented on FPGA. Fixed-point is used instead of floating-point to increase operating speed for meeting timing requirement of the real-time system. The design is implemented on a Xilinx Zedboard at 50MHz clock rate, and can be used for up to 128-channel EEG signals feature extraction at 250 Hz sample rate.

A group of four major soap brand advertisements i.e. Pears, Lux, Cinthol and Dove are considered for this research. The advertisement (video) of above these brands are used to stimulate the subjects (9 male and 9 female with age range of 22-30 years) The brain signal responses for the stimuli were collected using a 14 channel wireless headset with a sampling frequency of 128 Hz. The acquired signals are preprocessed using fourth order Butterworth band pass filter. Then feature extraction is done to extract desired features from the EEG signal. The mean value and then power of mean value of each soap brand is calculated.

EEG signals are a mixture of sustained oscillation and non-oscillatory transients that are difficult to deal with by linear methods. This paper proposes a new technique based on a tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) and statistical method (SM), denoted as TQWT-SM, to analyze epileptic EEG recordings. Firstly, EEG signals are decomposed into different sub-bands by the TWQT method, which is parameterized by its Q-factor and redundancy. This approach depends on the resonance of signals, instead of frequency or scales as the Fourier and wavelet transforms do. Secondly, each type of the sub-band vector is divided into n windows, and 10 statistical features from each window are extracted. Finally all the obtained statistical features are forwarded to a k nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to evaluate the performance of the proposed TQWT-SM method. The TQWT-SM features extraction method achieves good experimental results for the seven different epileptic EEG binary-categories by the k-NN classifier, in terms of accuracy (Acc), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and F score (F1). The outcomes of the proposed technique can assist the experts to detect epileptic seizures.

Neural synchronization deficits linked to cortical hyper-excitability and auditory hypersensitivity in fragile X syndrome	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Fragile X syndrome; EEG; Chirp; Gamma; Sensory	PSYCHOTIC BIPOLAR DISORDER; RESTING-STATE EEG; EVOKED POTENTIALS; MOUSE MODEL; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RESPONSES; CHILDREN; AUTISM	Background: Studies in the fmr1 KO mouse demonstrate hyper-excitability and increased high-frequency neuronal activity in sensory cortex. These abnormalities may contribute to prominent and distressing sensory hypersensitivities in patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS). The current study investigated functional properties of auditory cortex using a sensory entrainment task in FXS. Methods: EEG recordings were obtained from 17 adolescents and adults with FXS and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants heard an auditory chirp stimulus generated using a 1000-Hz tone that was amplitude modulated by a sinusoid linearly increasing in frequency from 0-100 Hz over 2 s. Results: Single trial time-frequency analyses revealed decreased gamma band phase-locking to the chirp stimulus in FXS, which was strongly coupled with broadband increases in gamma power. Abnormalities in gamma phase-locking and power were also associated with theta-gamma amplitude-amplitude coupling during the pre-stimulus period and with parent reports of heightened sensory sensitivities and social communication deficits. Conclusions: This represents the first demonstration of neural entrainment alterations in FXS patients and suggests that fast-spiking interneurons regulating synchronous high-frequency neural activity have reduced functionality. This reduced ability to synchronize high-frequency neural activity was related to the total power of background gamma band activity. These observations extend findings from fmr1 KO models of FXS, characterize a core pathophysiological aspect of FXS, and may provide a translational biomarker strategy for evaluating promising therapeutics.

However, studies that have examined this hypothesis with physiological data at realistic time scales are so far scarce. The current study employed a state-of-the-art approach using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to test alterations in large-scale phase synchronization in a sample of n = 16 chronic ScZ patients, 10 males and n = 19 healthy participants, 10 males, during a perceptual closure task. We identified large-scale networks from source reconstructed MEG data using data-driven analyses of neuronal synchronization. Oscillation amplitudes and interareal phase-synchronization in the 3-120 Hz frequency range were estimated for 400 cortical parcels and correlated with clinical symptoms and neuropsychological scores. ScZ patients were characterized by a reduction in gamma-band (30-120 Hz) oscillation amplitudes that was accompanied by a pronounced deficit in large-scale synchronization at gamma-band frequencies. Synchronization was reduced within visual regions as well as between visual and frontal cortex and the reduction of synchronization correlated with elevated clinical disorganization. Accordingly, these data highlight that ScZ is associated with a profound disruption of transient synchronization, providing critical support for the notion that core aspect of the pathophysiology arises from an impairment in coordination of distributed neural activity.

They blindly decompose the EEG spectrum into spatial-temporal-spectral patterns by taking into account inherent relationships among signals acquired at different frequencies and sensors. Our study evaluates the stability of spatial-temporal-spectral patterns derived by one particular method, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). We focused on patterns' stability over time and in population and divided the complete data set containing data from 50 healthy subjects into several subsets. Our results suggest that the patterns are highly stable in time, as well as among different subgroups of subjects. Further, we show with simultaneously acquired fMRI data that power fluctuations of some patterns have stable correspondence to hemodynamic fluctuations in large-scale brain networks. We did not find such correspondence for power fluctuations in standard frequency bands, the common way of dealing with EEG data. Altogether, our results suggest that PARAFAC is a suitable method for research in the field of large-scale brain networks and their manifestation in EEG signal.

Ordering Information in Working Memory and Modulation of Gamma by Theta Oscillations in Humans	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cross-frequency coupling; frontal lobes; n-back; neurophysiology	HIPPOCAMPUS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INHIBITION; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS; BRAIN; TASK	Ordering information is a critical process underlying several cognitive functions, especially working memory. Theta phasegammaamplitude coupling is regarded as a neurophysiological representation of ordering information during working memory performance. However, direct evidence has been lacking in humans. Seventy healthy subjects performed the N-back task, a working memory task that tests ordering information at 3 different levels of difficulties and with 3 different types of trials. Using electroencephalography (EEG) during N-back performance, theta-gamma coupling was assessed during response trials. Multivariate general linear model (GLM) and discriminant analysis were used to assess coupling and theta and gamma power across the N-back conditions and the trial types. During the N-back trials that required ordering of information, N-back condition had independent effects on coupling and on theta and gamma power, with equal contributions among these 3 variables. Theta-gamma coupling contribution declined significantly on the trials that did not require ordering and was intermediate on trials that favored but not necessarily required ordering. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the role of theta-gamma coupling as a mechanism that supports ordering information. They also highlight the potential of using theta-gamma coupling as a neurophysiological marker of brain function in health or disease states.

Evidence suggests a single session of aerobic exercise improves cognitive functions among healthy adults. Whether this holds true for stroke survivors is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine whether one session of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise improves the cognitive control and attention of stroke survivors. Methods: Nine people with chronic stroke (>= 6 months poststroke) performed a modified Eriksen Flanker task with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) before and immediately, 20 minutes, and 40 minutes after 20 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise and after 20 minutes of rest. The sessions were in randomized order. Accuracy and response time were recorded for congruent and incongruent stimuli. Differences in accuracy, response time, and event-related potentials (P300, reflective of decision making) were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Improvements in EEG measures were noted after exercise. P300 amplitude at Fz was greater 40 minutes after exercise compared with after rest (P = .007). P300 latency was also shorter at 20 minutes after exercise compared with after rest for both congruent (465.8 milliseconds versus 500.0 milliseconds; P = .02) and incongruent (468.0 milliseconds versus 532.0 milliseconds; P = .003) conditions at the central electrode on the lesional side. Differences in behavioral performance after exercise were not significant. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that aerobic exercise improves cortical processes underlying cognitive control and attention 20-40 minutes postexercise. Future research should confirm results in a larger sample and examine whether attention-demanding rehabilitation in this window has improved outcomes.

However, the optimal frequency band and time segment for extracting such features differ from subject to subject. In this work, we aim to improve the multi-class classification and to reduce the required EEG channel in motor imagery-based BCI by subject-specific time-frequency selection. Our method is based on a criterion namely Fisher discriminant analysis-type F-score to simultaneously select the optimal frequency band and time segment for multi-class classification. The proposed method uses only few Laplacian EEG channels (C3, Cz and C4) located around the sensorimotor area for classification. Applied to a standard multi-class BCI dataset (BCI competition III dataset Ilia), our method leads to better classification performance and smaller standard deviation across subjects compared to the state-of-art methods. Moreover, adding artifacts contaminated trials to the training dataset does not necessarily deteriorate our classification results, indicating that our method is tolerant to artifacts.

Phase-Locking Value (PLV), Phase-Lag Index (PLI) and Directed Transfer Function (DTF) were calculated for the original EEG data and following current source density (CSD) transformation, re-referencing using the average reference electrode (AVERAGE) and reference electrode standardization techniques (REST). The statistical analysis of adjacency matrices was carried out using indices based on graph theory. Both CSD and REST reduced the influence of volume conducted currents. The largest group differences in connectivity were observed for the alpha band. Schizophrenic patients showed reduced connectivity strength, as well as a lower clustering coefficient and shorter characteristic path length for both measures of phase synchronization following CSD transformation or REST re-referencing. Reduced synchronization was accompanied by increased directional flow from the occipital region for the alpha band. Following the REST re-referencing, the sources of alpha activity were located at parietal rather than occipital derivations. The results of PLV and DTF demonstrated group differences in fronto-posterior asymmetry following CSD transformation, while for PLI the differences were significant only using REST. The only analysis that identified group differences in inter-hemispheric asymmetry was DTF calculated for REST. Our results suggest that a comparison of different connectivity measures using graph-based indices for each frequency band, separately, may be a useful tool in the study of disconnectivity disorders such as schizophrenia.

A Marked Point Process Framework for Extracellular Electrical Potentials	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrocoticogram (ECoG); electroencephalogram (EEG); local field potentials (LFP); marked point process; robust processing; transient model; unsupervised learning	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; STATE TRANSITIONS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SYSTEM; HUMANS; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORKS; CORTEX	Neuromodulations are an important component of extracellular electrical potentials (EEP), such as the Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocorticogram (ECoG) and Local Field Potentials (LFP). This spatially temporal organized multi-frequency transient (phasic) activity reflects the multiscale spatiotemporal synchronization of neuronal populations in response to external stimuli or internal physiological processes. We propose a novel generative statistical model of a single EEP channel, where the collected signal is regarded as the noisy addition of reoccurring, multi-frequency phasic events over time. One of the main advantages of the proposed framework is the exceptional temporal resolution in the time location of the EEP phasic events, e.g., up to the sampling period utilized in the data collection. Therefore, this allows for the first time a description of neuromodulation in EEPs as a Marked Point Process (MPP), represented by their amplitude, center frequency, duration, and time of occurrence. The generative model for the multi-frequency phasic events exploits sparseness and involves a shift-invariant implementation of the clustering technique known as k-means. The cost function incorporates a robust estimation component based on correntropy to mitigate the outliers caused by the inherent noise in the EEP. Lastly, the background EEP activity is explicitly modeled as the non-sparse component of the collected signal to further improve the delineation of the multi-frequency phasic events in time. The framework is validated using two publicly available datasets: the DREAMS sleep spindles database and one of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) competition datasets. The results achieve benchmark performance and provide novel quantitative descriptions based on power, event rates and timing in order to assess behavioral correlates beyond the classical power spectrum-based analysis. This opens the possibility for a unifying point process framework of multiscale brain activity where simultaneous recordings of EEP and the underlying single neuron spike activity can be integrated and regarded as marked and simple point processes, respectively.

Neuroimaging studies have revealed face-specific activation in multiple brain regions, including the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and amygdala; it is often assumed that these regions constitute the neural network responsible for the processing of faces. However, it remains unknown whether and how these brain regions transmit information during face processing. This study investigated these questions by applying dynamic causal modeling of induced responses to human intracranial electroencephalography data recorded from the IOG and amygdala during the observation of faces, mosaics, and houses in upright and inverted orientations. Model comparisons assessing the experimental effects of upright faces versus upright houses and upright faces versus upright mosaics consistently indicated that the model having face-specific bidirectional modulatory effects between the IOG and amygdala was the most probable. The experimental effect between upright versus inverted faces also favored the model with bidirectional modulatory effects between the IOG and amygdala. The spectral profiles of modulatory effects revealed both same-frequency (e.g., gamma-gamma) and cross-frequency (e.g., theta-gamma) couplings. These results suggest that the IOG and amygdala communicate rapidly with each other using various types of oscillations for the efficient processing of faces. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Complex network (CN) analysis has been proved to be one of the efficient way in the EEG time series analysis, such as modeling the cognitive events of human beings. But most of the network analysis is just using the time domain statistical features and often has a fixed threshold for the network's connectivity. Herein, based on our previous work with an adaptive threshold, we propose a novel approach using a set of thresholds which fit to the data distribution to construct connections between different EEG channels to generate a multi-channel network. Inspired by the multi-frame method of video processing, we also divide the EEG data of one trial into several frames without overlap. The final classification is based on the multi-threshold and multi-frame network structural features. The results on the cognitive load classification dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach is more efficient than the deep learning method, and reduce the mean classification error to 8.1%.

Coherence of EEG frequency components during manual movements executed by the subdominant hand in women	REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS			Ukrainian	Article						individual alpha-frequency; successive movements; power load; grasping movements	PEAK ALPHA-FREQUENCY; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; RECEPTORS; CORTEX; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; CALCIUM; POWER	The academic community is paying more and more attention to the question of the individual characteristics of the brain processes which ensure the manual motor programming of movements performed not only by the leading, but also by the subdominant hand. Researchers do not exclude the existence of the particular parameters of the human brain correlating with manual motor activities. This study involved 136 women at the age of 19-21 years. The testees were divided into two groups according to high and low values of the EEG modal alpha-frequency determined individually and in a motionless state. We evaluated the coherence status of the EEG frequency components in the motionless state and during movements performed by fingers of the subdominant (left) hand in response to rhythmic sound signals. The testing stages involved the sequential execution of motor tasks including clamping and unclamping performed by the fingers of the subdominant hand (such as grasping movements) without effort. The testees also performed fingering (a manual response to each stimulus) at in different times and not by all the fingers of the hand simultaneously, but separately, one by one, in a given sequence). Clamping and unclamping was executed by the fingers subject to power loading the (additional load on the fingers being 10H). Execution of manual movements by means of the subdominant hand in response to the sensory signals was accompanied by an increase in coherence in the EEG frequency components, especially in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortexes of the central areas. Women with a low individual alpha-rate of such a regularity had significantly increased scores at the high (alpha 3-, beta-) frequencies of the EEG spectrum. At the same time, women in both groups mainly showed a decrease in the coherence coefficients of theta-, alpha 1- and alpha 3-activity in the frontal cortex leads in terms of the execution of the sequential finger movements and movements under power loading. The analysis of differences proved that women with a low I alpha F had relatively higher coherence of the EEG frequency components in the frontal lobes. However, relatively higher frequency components of EEG coherence in the central, posterior temporal and parietal leads were set in women with high I alpha F. Changes in cortical activity were established during different movements performed by fingers of the subdominant hand, namely, grasping movements of common occurrence, successive movements and movements under power loading. They differ from each other in their low specificity. Thus, the factor of motor performance of tests by means of the subdominant hand had obviously more decisive importance in the nature of the organization of brain activity than for the actual specifics of manual movements.

J	Henry, MJ; Herrmann, B; Grahn, JA				Henry, Molly J.; Herrmann, Bjorn; Grahn, Jessica A.			What can we learn about beat perception by comparing brain signals and stimulus envelopes?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RHYTHM; SYNCHRONIZATION; METER; SPEECH; MUSIC; COMPLEXITY	Entrainment of neural oscillations on multiple time scales is important for the perception of speech. Musical rhythms, and in particular the perception of a regular beat in musical rhythms, is also likely to rely on entrainment of neural oscillations. One recently proposed approach to studying beat perception in the context of neural entrainment and resonance (the "frequency-tagging" approach) has received an enthusiastic response from the scientific community. A specific version of the approach involves comparing frequency-domain representations of acoustic rhythm stimuli to the frequency-domain representations of neural responses to those rhythms (measured by electroencephalography, EEG). The relative amplitudes at specific EEG frequencies are compared to the relative amplitudes at the same stimulus frequencies, and enhancements at beat-related frequencies in the EEG signal are interpreted as reflecting an internal representation of the beat. Here, we show that frequency-domain representations of rhythms are sensitive to the acoustic features of the tones making up the rhythms (tone duration, onset/offset ramp duration); in fact, relative amplitudes at beat-related frequencies can be completely reversed by manipulating tone acoustics. Crucially, we show that changes to these acoustic tone features, and in turn changes to the frequency-domain representations of rhythms, do not affect beat perception. Instead, beat perception depends on the pattern of onsets (i.e., whether a rhythm has a simple or complex metrical structure). Moreover, we show that beat perception can differ for rhythms that have numerically identical frequency-domain representations. Thus, frequency-domain representations of rhythms are dissociable from beat perception. For this reason, we suggest caution in interpreting direct comparisons of rhythms and brain signals in the frequency domain. Instead, we suggest that combining EEG measurements of neural signals with creative behavioral paradigms is of more benefit to our understanding of beat perception.

Using highdensity EEG in mice, we studied how this pattern of global regulation is implemented in cortical regions with different functions and network architectures. We found that across all areas, slow oscillations repeated the behavioral pattern of persistent enhancement during CSR, whereas high-frequency oscillations showed progressive increases. This pattern followed a common rule despite marked topographic differences. The findings suggest that REM sleep slow oscillations may translate top-down homeostatic control to widely separated brain regions whereas fast oscillations synchronizing local neuronal ensembles escape this global command. These patterns of EEG oscillation changes are interpreted to reconcile two prevailing theories of the function of sleep, synaptic homeostasis and sleep dependent memory consolidation.

There is increasing interest in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis, but a better understanding of how to design and train ConvNets for end-to-end EEG decoding and how to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn is still needed. Here, we studied deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw EEG. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching at least as good performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1% FBCSP, 84.0% deep ConvNets). While FBCSP is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the learned features by revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to the decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train ConvNets to decode task-related information from the raw EEG without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.

However, the effects of rTMS-MT on cortical function using functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis remain unclear. Ten healthy subjects were recruited to receive rTMS immediately before application of MT. Low frequency rTMS was delivered to the dominant hemisphere and non-dominant hand performed MT over 14 days. The reaction time of Nine-Hole Peg Test and electroencephalography (EEG) in resting condition with eyes closed were recorded before and after rTMS-MT. Functional connectivity was assessed by phase synchronization index (PSI), and subsequently thresholded to construct undirected graphs in alpha frequency band (8-13Hz). We found a significant decrease in reaction time after rTMS-MT. The functional connectivity between the parietal and frontal cortex, and the graph theory statistics of node degree and efficiency in the parietal cortex increased. Besides the functional connectivity between premotor and frontal cortex, the degree and efficiency of premotor cortex showed opposite results. In addition, the number of connections significantly increased within inter-hemispheres and inter-regions. In conclusion, this study could be helpful in our understanding of how rTMS-MT modulates brain activity. The methods and results in this study could be taken as reference in future studies of the effects of rTMS-MT in stroke patients.

In electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for motor control tasks the conventional practice is to decode motor intentions by using scalp EEG. However, scalp EEG only reveals certain limited information about the complex tasks of movement with a higher degree of freedom. Therefore, our objective is to investigate the effectiveness of source-space EEG in extracting relevant features that discriminate arm movement in multiple directions. Approach. We have proposed a novel feature extraction algorithm based on supervised factor analysis that models the data from source-space EEG. To this end, we computed the features from the source dipoles confined to Brodmann areas of interest (BA4a, BA4p and BA6). Further, we embedded class-wise labels of multi-direction (multi-class) source-space EEG to an unsupervised factor analysis to make it into a supervised learning method. Main Results. Our approach provided an average decoding accuracy of 71% for the classification of hand movement in four orthogonal directions, that is significantly higher (> 10%) than the classification accuracy obtained using state-of-the-art spatial pattern features in sensor space. Also, the group analysis on the spectral characteristics of source-space EEG indicates that the slow cortical potentials from a set of cortical source dipoles reveal discriminative information regarding the movement parameter, direction. Significance. This study presents evidence that low-frequency components in the source space play an important role in movement kinematics, and thus it may lead to new strategies for BCI-based neurorehabilitation.

AMPLIFIED INDUCED NEURAL OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY PREDICTS MUSICIANS' BENEFITS IN CATEGORICAL SPEECH PERCEPTION	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha activity; categorical speech perception; experience-dependent plasticity; induced oscillations; gamma activity	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; BRAIN-STEM; LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE; CORTEX; GAMMA; ENHANCEMENT; PLASTICITY; EXPERTISE; DYNAMICS; CONTEXT	Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) reveal musical experience refines neural encoding and confers stronger categorical perception (CP) and neural organization for speech sounds. In addition to evoked brain activity, the human EEG can be decomposed into induced (non phase -locked) responses whose various frequency bands reflect different mechanisms of perceptual-cognitive processing. Here, we aimed to clarify which spectral properties of these neural oscillations are most prone to music-related neuroplasticity and which are linked to behavioral benefits in the categorization of speech. We recorded electrical brain activity while musicians and nonmusicians rapidly identified speech tokens from a sound continuum. Time-frequency analysis parsed evoked and induced EEG into alpha( similar to 10 Hz), beta- (similar to 20 Hz), and gamma- (>30 Hz) frequency bands. We found that musicians' enhanced behavioral CP was accompanied by improved evoked speech responses across the frequency spectrum, complementing previously observed enhancements in evoked potential studies (i.e., ERPs). Brain-behavior correlations implied differences in the underlying neural mechanisms supporting speech CP in each group: modulations in induced gamma power predicted the slope of musicians' speech identification functions whereas early evoked alpha activity predicted behavior in nonmusicians. Collectively, findings indicate that musical training tunes speech processing via two complementary mechanisms: (i) strengthening the formation of auditory object representations for speech signals (gamma-band) and (ii) improving network control and/or the matching of sounds to internalized memory templates (alpha/beta-band). Both neurobiological enhancements may be deployed behaviorally and account for musicians' benefits in the perceptual categorization of speech. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study decomposes intrinsic mode functions (IMPs) into amplitude envelope and frequency functions on a time-scale basis using the analytic function of Hilbert transform. IMFs results from the empirical mode decomposition of EEG signals. Features such as energy and entropy parameters were calculated from the amplitude contour of each IMF. Other features, such as interquartile range, mean absolute deviation and standard deviation are also computed for their instantaneous frequencies. Discriminative features were extracted using a large database to classify healthy and ictal EEG signals. Normal EEG segments were differentiated from the seizure attack in individual IMF features, multiple features with individual IMF, and individual features with multiple IMFs. Discriminating capability of three Cases was tested. (i) Artificial neural network and (ii) adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system classification were used to identify EEG segments with seizure attacks. ANOVA was used to analyze statistical performance. Energy and entropy-based features of instantaneous amplitude and standard deviation of instantaneous frequency of IMF2 and IMF1 have 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Good performance with a single feature that represents information of the whole data was obtained. The result involved less complicated computation than other time frequency analysis techniques.

However, the exact interaction between the cortex and the thalamus remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes of frequency-dependent neural networks during the initialization of absence seizures. Methods: Magnetoencephalography data from 14 patients with CAE were recorded during and between seizures at a sampling rate of 6000 Hz and analyzed in seven frequency bands. Neuromagnetic sources were volumetrically scanned with accumulated source imaging. Effective connectivity networks of the entire brain, including the cortico-thalamo-cortical network, were evaluated at the source level through Granger causality analysis. Results: The low-frequency (1-80 Hz) activities showed significant frontal cortical and parieto-occipito-temporal junction source localization around seizures. The high-frequency (80-250 Hz) oscillations showed predominant activities consistently localized in deep brain areas and medial frontal cortex. The increased cortico-thalamic effective connectivity was observed around seizures in both low-and high-frequency ranges. The direction was predominantly from the cortex to the thalamus at the early time, although the cortex that drove connectivity varied among subjects. Conclusions: The cerebral cortex plays a key role in driving the cortico-thalamic connections at the early portion of the initialization of absence seizures. The oscillatory activities in the thalamus could be triggered by networks from various regions in the cortex.

J	Singh, B; Wagatsuma, H				Singh, Balbir; Wagatsuma, Hiroaki			A Removal of Eye Movement and Blink Artifacts from EEG Data Using Morphological Component Analysis	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MULTICHANNEL MATCHING PURSUIT; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; AUTOMATIC REMOVAL; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSFORMS; SEPARATION; ALGORITHM	EEG signals contain a large amount of ocular artifacts with different time-frequency properties mixing together in EEGs of interest. The artifact removal has been substantially dealt with by existing decomposition methods known as PCA and ICA based on the orthogonality of signal vectors or statistical independence of signal components. We focused on the signal morphology and proposed a systematic decomposition method to identify the type of signal components on the basis of sparsity in the time-frequency domain based on Morphological Component Analysis (MCA), which provides a way of reconstruction that guarantees accuracy in reconstruction by using multiple bases in accordance with the concept of "dictionary." MCA was applied to decompose the real EEG signal and clarified the best combination of dictionaries for this purpose. In our proposed semirealistic biological signal analysis with iEEGs recorded from the brain intracranially, those signals were successfully decomposed into original types by a linear expansion of waveforms, such as redundant transforms: UDWT, DCT, LDCT, DST, and DIRAC. Our result demonstrated that the most suitable combination for EEG data analysis was UDWT, DST, and DIRAC to represent the baseline envelope, multifrequency wave-forms, and spiking activities individually as representative types of EEG morphologies.

Movement-related beta oscillations show high intra-individual reliability	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Test-retest reliability; Intraclass correlation coefficient; Beta oscillations; EEG; Sensorimotor cortex	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; EXCITABILITY; STABILITY; AMPLITUDE; STATE; (DE)SYNCHRONIZATION	Oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range (15-30 Hz) recorded from human sensorimotor cortex is of increasing interest as a putative biomarker of motor system function and dysfunction. Despite its increasing use in basic and clinical research, surprisingly little is known about the test-retest reliability of spectral power and peak frequency measures of beta oscillatory signals from sensorimotor cortex. Establishing that these beta measures are stable over time in healthy populations is a necessary precursor to their use in the clinic. Here, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate intra-individual reliability of beta-band oscillations over six sessions, focusing on changes in beta activity during movement (Movement-Related Beta Desynchronization, MRBD) and after movement termination (Post-Movement Beta Rebound, PMBR). Subjects performed visually-cued unimanual wrist flexion and extension. We assessed Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and between-session correlations for spectral power and peak frequency measures of movement-related and resting beta activity. Movement-related and resting beta power from both sensorimotor cortices was highly reliable across sessions. Resting beta power yielded highest reliability (average ICC=0.903), followed by MRBD (average ICC=0.886) and PMBR (average ICC=0.663). Notably, peak frequency measures yielded lower ICC values compared to the assessment of spectral power, particularly for movement-related beta activity (ICC=0.386-0.402). Our data highlight that power measures of movement-related beta oscillations are highly reliable, while corresponding peak frequency measures show greater intra-individual variability across sessions. Importantly, our finding that beta power estimates show high intra-individual reliability over time serves to validate the notion that these measures reflect meaningful individual differences that can be utilised in basic research and clinical studies.

J	Hsu, WY; Zanto, TP; van Schouwenburg, MR; Gazzaley, A				Hsu, Wan-Yu; Zanto, Theodore P.; van Schouwenburg, Martine R.; Gazzaley, Adam			Enhancement of multitasking performance and neural oscillations by transcranial alternating current stimulation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; BRAIN-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; MOTOR SYSTEM; OLDER-ADULTS	Multitasking is associated with the generation of stimulus-locked theta (4-7 Hz) oscillations arising from prefrontal cortex (PFC). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that influences endogenous brain oscillations. Here, we investigate whether applying alternating current stimulation within the theta frequency band would affect multitasking performance, and explore tACS effects on neurophysiological measures. Brief runs of bilateral PFC theta-tACS were applied while participants were engaged in a multitasking paradigm accompanied by electroencephalography (EEG) data collection. Unlike an active control group, a tACS stimulation group showed enhancement of multitasking performance after a 90-minute session (F-1,F-35 = 6.63, p = 0.01, eta p(2) = 0.16; effect size = 0.96), coupled with significant modulation of posterior beta (13-30 Hz) activities (F-1,F-32 =7.66, p = 0.009, eta p(2) = 0.19; effect size = 0.96). Across participant regression analyses indicated that those participants with greater increases in frontal theta, alpha and beta oscillations exhibited greater multitasking performance improvements. These results indicate frontal theta-tACS generates benefits on multitasking performance accompanied by widespread neuronal oscillatory changes, and suggests that future tACS studies with extended treatments are worth exploring as promising tools for cognitive enhancement.

Research on Brain Computer Interface (BCI) begins in 1970s at university of California, Los Angeles. BMI allows us to manipulate computer and other machinery with our thoughts. Motor Imagery (MI) basically involves imaginations of any body part that leads to the activation of sensorimotor cortex which modulates the oscillation in EEG. BCI can be done by both Invasive and Non-invasive methods. In invasive, BCI are implanted into the gray matter of individual's brain by neurosurgery. Invasive method produce highest quality signals as they are directly lie in the gray matter. But gradually its signal strength weakens as scare-tissue build ups and as body always react to the foreign object in the brain [1]. Non-invasive BCI is preferred as it is easy to wear and do not require surgery. EEG is most studied non-invasive BCI because of its high temporal resolution and ease to use and low coast set up. Individual difference is the major issue in MI based BCI. Algorithms that can successfully overcome individual differences is to create diverse ensemble classifiers which uses sub-band common spatial pattern method (SBCSP). To aggregate the output of this ensemble, we use fuzzy integral with particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. The combination of fuzzy with PSO produces robust performance for offline classification of EEG signal.

Several neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and near-infrared spectroscopy have been used to explore healthy and pathological aging by relying on hemodynamic or metabolic changes that occur in response to brain activity. Since electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are able to measure neural activity directly with a high temporal resolution of milliseconds, these neurophysiological techniques are particularly important to investigate the dynamics of brain activity underlying neurocognitive aging. It is well known that age is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that synaptic dysfunction represents an early sign of this disease associated with hallmark neuropathological findings. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying AD are not fully elucidated. This review addresses healthy and pathological brain aging from a neurophysiological perspective, focusing on oscillatory activity changes during the resting state, event-related potentials and stimulus-induced oscillatory responses during cognitive or motor tasks, functional connectivity between brain regions, and changes in signal complexity. We also highlight the accumulating evidence on age-related EEG/MEG changes and biological markers of brain neurodegeneration, including genetic factors, structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance images, and the biochemical changes associated with A beta deposition and tau pathology.

In contrast, simple span tasks conceptually mainly require WM storage. Thus, conceptually, an N-back task and a complex span task share more commonalities as compared to a simple span task. In the current study, we compared an N-back task, a complex operation span task (Ospan), and a simple digit span task (Dspan) by means of typical WM load-related measures of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) like the parietal alpha and beta frequency band power, the frontal theta frequency band power, and the P300 amplitude, to examine whether these tasks would show commonalities or differences in WM processing-load. We expected that increasing WM-load would generally lead to a decreased alpha and beta frequency band power, an increased theta frequency band power, and a decreased P300 amplitude. Yet, based on the conceptual considerations, we hypothesized that the outcomes of these measures would be more comparable between the N-back and the Ospan as compared to the Dspan. Our hypotheses were partly confirmed. The N-back and the Ospan showed timely more prolonged alpha frequency band power effects as compared to the Dspan. This might indicate higher demands on WM processing in the former two tasks. The theta frequency band power and the P300 amplitude were most pronounced in the N-back task as compared to both span tasks. This might indicate specific demands on cognitive control in the N-back task. Additionally, we observed that behavioral performance measures correlated with changes in EEG alpha power of the N-back and the Ospan, yet not of the Dspan. Taken together, the hypothesized conceptual commonalities between the N-back task and the Ospan (and, for the Dspan, differences) were only partly confirmed by the electrophysiological WM load-related measures, indicating a potential need for reconsidering the theoretical accounts on WM tasks and the value of a closer link to electrophysiological research herein.

In this study, multidomain feature extraction was investigated based on time domain analysis, nonlinear analysis, and frequency domain analysis. Unlike the traditional feature calculation in time domain, a sequence merging method was developed as a preprocessing procedure. The objective is to eliminate the clutter waveform and highlight the characteristic waveform for further analysis. The numbers of the characteristic activities were extracted as the features from time domain. The contributions of features from different domains to the sleep stages were compared. The effectiveness was further analyzed by automatic sleep stage classification and compared with the visual inspection. The overnight clinical sleep EEG recordings of 3 patients after the treatment of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) were tested. The obtained results showed that the developed method can highlight the characteristic activity which is useful for both automatic sleep staging and visual inspection. Furthermore, it can be a training tool for better understanding the appearance of characteristic waveforms from raw sleep EEG which is mixed and complex in time domain.

Detecting the effective channels in BCI systems is an important problem in reducing the complexity of these systems. In this research, Improved Binary Gravitation Search Algorithm (IBGSA) is used to automatically detect the effective electroencephalography (EEG) channels in left or right hand classification. To do this, at first, data is filtered with a bandpass filter in order to reduce the amount of different types of merged noise. Then, the electrooculography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) artifacts are corrected based on Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm. Data is epoched according to the left or right hand motor imageries and central beta frequency band is isolated for Event Related Synchronization (ERS) analysis. Feature extraction process is carried out by analyzing EEG signals in time and wavelet domains. The logarithmic power of each channel is computed in time domain and the features of mean, mode, median, variance, and standard deviation are calculated in wavelet domain. IBGSA is employed to detect the optimal channels to achieve better classification results. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the classifier. The maximum accuracy of 80% and average accuracy of 76.24% were obtained for eight subjects in BCI competition IV dataset. The results of this research confirm that automatically detecting effective channels can enhance the practical implementation of BCI based systems and reduce the complexity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we use the "wave train" term to denote a signal localized in time, frequency, and space. The wave train is a typical pattern in a background EEG and detecting/ analyzing such signals gives useful information about the brain activity. Alpha spindles, beta spindles, and sleep spindles are the best known examples of the wave trains in EEG. The preliminary results of the research give evidence that EEG analysis and visualization method based on the wave trains is useful for looking for group statistical regularities in early stages of Parkinson's disease and searching EEG features that are prospective for early stages of Parkinson's disease diagnostics. The novelty of this work is in developing a new method to search parameters of wave trains useful for evaluating the group statistical regularities in EEG data.

Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is a common way to capture brain abnormality for seizure onset detection. This paper presents a novel context-learning based approach using multi-feature fusion to compensate for incomplete description of single feature in epileptic EEG signals. First, EEG scalogram sequence is generated using wavelet transform to represent the time-frequency information. Second, three sets of EEG context features are unsupervisedly learned in parallel by using global principal component analysis (GPCA), stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs) and EEG embeddings, respectively. Finally, the multi-features are concatenated into a fixed-length feature vector for seizure classification. The experimental results conducted on two real EEG datasets demonstrate that the proposed cross-patient learning model is able to extract meaningful context features from different perspectives, and hence can detect the onset of epileptic seizure effectively.

The aim of this study was to compare spectral EEG values of infants born near term with those of infants born at extremely low gestational age (ELGA) but having attained near term age. We aimed also to evaluate whether spectral EEG features were related with neurological outcome. The ELGA group consisted of 12 neonates born between 23 + 2 and 27 + 6 weeks; the control group consisted of nine infants born 34-35 +2 weeks, tested within the first week of life. All neonates underwent multichannel EEG recordings at 35 weeks post-conception. None of the subjects had apparent neurological abnormalities or risk factors at the time of recording. EEG data were transformed into the frequency domain and divided into delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-20 Hz) frequency bands; relative EEG power values were calculated. ELGA group was compared with the control group using a mixed analysis of variance. Outcome was evaluated at one year of age by Griffiths' scales. A principal effect of frequency and an interaction effect of frequency * group was found. The total relative power of the delta band was significantly higher in ELGA than in control group, whereas in the remaining frequency bands total relative power was lower in ELGA than in control group. Higher values of delta and lower values of alpha and beta spectral power correlated with poor outcome. We provide preliminary results suggesting that, as early as 35 weeks post conception, infants born extremely preterm fail to develop the age specific pattern of EEG spectral activity, in the absence of neurological neonatal risk.

In this exploratory pilot study, we describe a distributional clustering framework for the modeling of multivariate time series and use it to predict the effects of brain surgery in epilepsy patients. By analyzing the intracranial EEG, we demonstrate how patients who became seizure free after surgery are clearly distinguished from those who did not. More specifically, for 5 out of 7 patients who obtained seizure freedom (= Engel class I) our method predicts the specific collection of brain areas that got actually resected during surgery to yield a markedly lower posterior probability for the seizure related clusters, when compared to the resection of random or empty collections. Conversely, for 4 out of 5 Engel class III/IV patients who still suffer from postsurgical seizures, performance of the actually resected collection is not significantly better than performances displayed by random or empty collections. As the number of possible collections ranges into billions and more, this is a substantial contribution to a problem that today is still solved by visual EEG inspection. Apart from epilepsy research, our clustering methodology is also of general interest for the analysis of multivariate time series and as a generative model for temporally evolving functional networks in the neurosciences and beyond.

In rats, we characterized changes in the extradural EEG and intracranial local field potentials (LFPs) within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), parietal cortex (PC), and central thalamus (CT) in response to progressively higher doses of the inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane. During induction with a low dose of sevoflurane, beta/low gamma (12-40 Hz) power increased in the frontal EEG and PFC, PC and CT LFPs, and PFC-CT and PFC-PFC LFP beta/low gamma coherence increased. Loss of movement (LOM) coincided with an abrupt decrease in beta/low gamma PFC-CT LFP coherence. Following LOM, cortically coherent slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations were observed in the frontal EEG and PFC, PC and CT LFPs. At higher doses of sevoflurane sufficient to induce loss of the righting reflex, coherent slow-delta oscillations were dominant in the frontal EEG and PFC, PC and CT LFPs. Dynamics similar to those observed during induction were observed as animals emerged from sevoflurane anesthesia. We conclude that the rat is a useful animal model for sevoflurane-induced EEG oscillations in humans, and that coherent slow-delta oscillations are a correlate of sevoflurane-induced behavioral arrest and loss of righting in rats.

Methods: Intra-operative electrocorticography (ECoG) of 54 patients with refractory focal epilepsy were recorded pre- and post-resection at 2048 Hz. The ARRm was calculated in one-minute epochs in which high-frequency oscillations (HFOs; fast ripples, 250-500 Hz; ripples, 80-250 Hz) and spikes were marked. We investigated the pre-resection fraction of HFOs and spikes explained by the ARRm (h(2)-index). A general ARRm threshold was set and used to compare the ARRm to surgical outcome in post-resection ECoG (Pearson X-2). Results: ARRm was associated strongest with the number of fast ripples in pre-resection ECoG (h(2) = 0.80, P < 0.01), but also with ripples and spikes. An ARRm threshold of 0.47 yielded high specificity (95%) with 52% sensitivity for channels with fast ripples. ARRm values > 0.47 were associated with poor outcome at channel and patient level (both P < 0.01) in post-resection ECoG. Conclusions: The ARRm algorithm might enable intra-operative delineation of epileptogenic tissue. Significance: ARRm is the first unsupervised real-time analysis that could provide an intra-operative, 'on demand' interpretation per electrode about the need to remove underlying tissue to optimize the chance of seizure freedom.

This is possibly because left and right DLPFC have differential roles in regulating both memory and stress response, which are both dysfunctional in PTSD. However, previous results are heterogeneous, and could be attributable to individual symptom clusters, traumatic or aggressive life events, early life stress, or the interaction of these factors. In a large sample of active combatants (N= 401), we regressed these factors on frontal electroencephalography (EEG) asymmetry across 5 frequency bands (delta: 2-4 Hz; theta: 4-8 Hz; alpha: 8-12 Hz; beta: 12-24 Hz; gamma: 24-48 Hz). Negative cognition and mood was associated with stronger relative left delta and theta band power. Traumatic life events showed stronger right alpha and beta band power. Traumatic life events in interaction with hyperarousal predicted stronger relative right left-right imbalance (theta, alpha, and beta bands), whereas childhood adversity, in interaction with negative cognition and mood, predicted stronger relative left left-right imbalance (delta, theta, alpha and beta bands). The contribution of lateralized DLPFC dysfunction to PTSD is thus dependent on the individual complexities of subsymptom clusters and life history, and future studies need to take these factors into account.

Objectives: By combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) we explored the effects of STN-DBS, either alone or in combination with L-Dopa (LD), on TMS-evoked cortical activity in a sample of implanted PD patients. Methods: PD patients were tested in three clinical conditions: i) LD therapy with STN-DBS turned on (ON/ON condition); ii) without LD therapy with STN-DBS turned on (OFF/ON condition); iii) without LD therapy with STN-DBS turned off (OFF/OFF condition). TMS pulses were delivered over left M1 while simultaneously acquiring EEG. Eight age-matched healthy volunteers (HC) were tested as a control group. Results: STN-DBS enhanced early global TMS-evoked activity (-45-80ms) and high-alpha TMS-evoked oscillations (11-13 Hz) as compared to OFF/OFF condition, independently from concomitant LD therapy. LD intake (ON/ON condition) produced a further increase of late TMS-evoked activity (-80-130ms) and beta TMS-evoked oscillations (13-30 Hz), as compared to OFF/OFF and OFF/ON conditions, that normalized reactivity as compared to HC range of values. Conclusions: Our data reveal that bilateral STN-DBS and LD therapy induce a modulation of specific cortical components and specific ranges of frequency. These findings demonstrate that STN-DBS and LD therapy may have synergistic effects on motor cortical activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EEG Error Prediction as a Solution for Combining the Advantages of Retrieval Practice and Errorless Learning	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aphasia; retrieval; errorless learning; EEG; predictive models	COMPUTER INTERFACE BCI; MEMORY FORMATION; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; REHABILITATION; REGULARIZATION; SELECTION; APHASIA; MODELS; BAND	Given the frequency of naming errors in aphasia, a common aim of speech and language rehabilitation is the improvement of naming. Based on evidence of significant word recall improvements in patients with memory impairments, errorless learning methods have been successfully applied to naming therapy in aphasia; however, other evidence suggests that although errorless learning can lead to better performance during treatment sessions, retrieval practice may be the key to lasting improvements. Task performance may vary with brain state (e. g., level of arousal, degree of task focus), and changes in brain state can be detected using EEG. With the ultimate goal of designing a system that monitors patient brain state in real time during therapy, we sought to determine whether errors could be predicted using spectral features obtained from an analysis of EEG. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the use of individual EEG responses to predict error production in aphasia. Eight participants with aphasia each completed 900 object-naming trials across three sessions while EEG was recorded and response accuracy scored for each trial. Analysis of the EEG response for seven of the eight participants showed significant correlations between EEG features and response accuracy (correct vs. incorrect) and error correction (correct, self-corrected, incorrect). Furthermore, upon combining the training data for the first two sessions, the model generalized to predict accuracy for performance in the third session for seven participants when accuracy was used as a predictor, and for five participants when error correction category was used as a predictor. With such ability to predict errors during therapy, it may be possible to use this information to intervene with errorless learning strategies only when necessary, thereby allowing patients to benefit from both the high within-session success of errorless learning as well as the longer-term improvements associated with retrieval practice.

The cortical responses to evoked clinical pain in patients with hip osteoarthritis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TONIC PAIN; EEG; PERCEPTION; POWER; OSCILLATIONS	Background Experimental models have been used extensively to evaluate pain using e.g., visual analogue scales or electroencephalography (EEG). Stimulation using tonic pain has been shown to better mimic the unpleasantness of chronic pain, but has mainly been evoked by non-clinical stimuli. This study aims to, evaluate the EEG during clinical pain in patients scheduled for total hip replacement with control and resting conditions. Methods The hip scheduled for replacement was moved by the examiner to evoke pain for 30 seconds while recording EEG. The control condition entailed movement of the opposite hip in a similar fashion and holding it for 30 seconds. In addition, EEG was recorded during the resting condition with open eyes. The relative spectral content was calculated from the EEG as well as functional connectivity using phase-lag index for frequency bands delta (1 -4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8 -12Hz) and beta (12 -32Hz). A mixed model was used for statistical comparison between the three recording conditions. Results Spectral content differed between conditions in all bands. Functional connectivity differed in delta and theta frequency bands. Post-hoc analysis revealed differences between the painful and control condition in delta, theta and beta for spectral content. Pain during the hip rotation was correlated to the theta (r = -0.24 P = 0.03) and beta (r = 0.25 P = 0.02) content in the EEG. Conclusion EEG differences during hip movements in the affected and unaffected hip appeared in the spectral beta and theta content. This was correlated to the reported pain perceived, pointing towards pain specific brain activity related to clinical pain.

Essential hypertension is associated with reduced pain sensitivity of unclear aetiology. This study explores this issue using the Cold Pressor Test (CPT), a reliable pain/stress model, comparing CPT-related EEG activity in first episode hypertensives and controls. Method. 22 untreated hypertensives and 18 matched normotensives underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). EEG recordings were taken before, during, and after CPT exposure. Results. Significant group differences in CPT-induced EEG oscillations were covaried with the most robust cardiovascular differentiators by means of a Canonical Analysis. Positive correlations were noted between ABPM variables and Delta (1-4Hz) oscillations during the tolerance phase; in high-alpha (10-12Hz) oscillations during the stress unit and posttest phase; and in low-alpha (8-10Hz) oscillations during CPT phases overall. Negative correlations were found between ABPM variables and Beta2 oscillations (16.5-20Hz) during the posttest phase and Gamma (28.5-45Hz) oscillations during the CPT phases overall. These relationships were localised at several sites across the cerebral hemispheres with predominance in the right hemisphere and left frontal lobe. Conclusions. These findings provide a starting point for increasing our understanding of the complex relationships between cerebral activation and cardiovascular functioning involved in regulating blood pressure changes.

Publicly available BCI competition III dataset IVa, a multichannel 2-class motor-imagery dataset, was used for this purpose. Multiscale Principal Component Analysis method was applied for the purpose of noise removal. In addition, different sets of features were formed to examine the effect of a particular group of features. The parameter selection process for signal decomposition methods was thoroughly explained as well. Our results show that the combination of Multiscale Principal Component Analysis de-noising and higher order statistics features extracted from wavelet packet decomposition sub-bands resulted in highest average classification accuracy of 92.8%. Our study is one among very few that provides a comprehensive comparison between signal decomposition methods in combination with higher order statistics in classification of BCI signals. In addition, we stressed the importance of higher frequency ranges in improving the classification task for EEG signals in Brain Computer Interface Systems. Obtained results indicate that the proposed model has the potential to obtain a reliable classification of motor imagery EEG signals, and can thus be used as a practical system for controlling a wheelchair. It can also further enhance the current rehabilitation therapies where appropriate feedback is delivered once the individual executes the correct movement. In that way, motor rehabilitation outcomes may improve over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of prefrontal bipolar and high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation on cortical reactivity and working memory in healthy adults	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; HD-tDCS; tDCS; TMS-EEG; Working memory	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX EXCITABILITY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; TMS-EEG; HD-TDCS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a well-recognised neuromodulatory technology which has been shown to induce short-lasting changes in motor-cortical excitability. The recent and rapid expansion of tDCS into the cognitive domain, however, necessitates deeper mechanistic understanding of its neurophysiological effects over non motor brain regions. The present study utilised transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to probe the immediate and longer-term effects of both a bipolar (BP-tDCS) and more focal 4x1 High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) montage applied over the left DLPFC on TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and oscillations in 19 healthy adult participants. 2-back working memory (WM) performance was also assessed as a marker of cognitive function. Region of interest (ROI) analyses taken from the F1 electrode directly adjacent to the stimulation site revealed increased P60 TEP amplitudes at this location 5 min following BP-tDCS and 30 min following HD-tDCS. Further global cluster based analyses of all scalp electrodes revealed widespread neuromodulatory changes following HD-tDCS, but not BP-tDCS, both five and 30 min after stimulation, with reductions also detected in both beta and gamma oscillatory power over parieto-occipital channels 30 min after stimulation. No significant changes in WM performance were observed following either HD-tDCS or BP-tDCS. This study highlights the capacity for single-session prefrontal anodal tDCS montages to modulate neurophysiological processes, as assessed with TMS-EEG.

J	Sharma, M; Pachori, RB				Sharma, Manish; Pachori, Ram Bilas			A NOVEL APPROACH TO DETECT EPILEPTIC SEIZURES USING A COMBINATION OF TUNABLE-Q WAVELET TRANSFORM AND FRACTAL DIMENSION	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; EEG; epilepsy; seizure; tunable-Q wavelet transforms; fractal dimension	AUTOMATED DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; LEAST-SQUARES; FILTER BANKS; TIME-SERIES; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; ENTROPY; DESIGN	The detection and quantification of seizures can be achieved through the analysis of nonstationary electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The detection of these intractable seizures involving human beings is a challenging and difficult task. The analysis of EEG through human inspection is prone to errors and may lead to false conclusions. The computer-aided systems have been developed to assist neurophysiologists in the identification of seizure activities accurately. We propose a new machine learning and signal processing-based automated system that can detect epileptic episodes accurately. The proposed algorithm employs a promising time-frequency tool called tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) to decompose EEG signals into various sub-bands (SBs). The fractal dimensions (FDs) of the SBs have been used as the discriminating features. The TQWT has many attractive features, such as tunable oscillatory attribute and time-invariance property, which are favorable for the analysis of nonstationary and transient signals. Fractal dimension is a nonlinear chaotic trait that has been proven to be very useful in the analysis and classifications of nonstationary signals including EEG. First, we decompose EEG signals into the desired SBs. Then, we compute FD for each SB. These FDs of the SBs have been applied to the least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. We have used 10-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance and avoid the possible over-fitting of the model. In the proposed study, we investigate the following four popular classification tasks (CTs) related to different classes of EEG signals: (i) normal versus seizure (ii) seizure-free versus seizure (iii) nonseizure versus Seizure (iv) normal versus seizure-free. The proposed model surpassed existing models in the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), average classification accuracy (ACA), and average classification sensitivity (ACS). The proposed system attained perfect 100% ACS for all CTs considered in this study. The method achieved the highest classification accuracy as well as the largest area under ROC curve (AUC) for all classes. The salient feature of our proposed model is that, though many models exist in the literature, which gave high ACA, however, their performance has not been evaluated using MCC and AUC along with ACA simultaneously. The evaluation of the performance in terms of only ACA which may be misleading. Hence, the performance of the proposed model has been assessed not only in terms of ACA but also in terms AUC and MCC. Moreover, the performance of the model has been found to be almost equivalent to a perfect model, and the performance of the proposed model surpasses the existing models for the CTs investigated by us. Therefore, the proposed model is expected to assist clinicians in analyzing seizures accurately in less time without any error.

Stimulus-related neural responses are increased for the attended stimulus. Does alpha-band activity mediate this effect and is it restricted to conscious sensory events (suprathreshold), or does it also extend to unconscious stimuli (subthreshold)? To address these questions, we recorded EEG in healthy male and female volunteers undergoing subthreshold and suprathreshold somatosensory electrical stimulation to the left or right index finger. The task was to detect stimulation at the randomly alternated cued index finger. Under attention, amplitudes of somatosensory evoked potentials increased 50-60 ms after stimulation (P1) for both suprathreshold and subthreshold events. Prestimulus amplitude of peri-Rolandic alpha, that is mu, showed an inverse relationship to P1 amplitude during attention compared to when the finger was unattended. Interestingly, intermediate and high amplitudes of mu rhythm were associated with the highest P1 amplitudes during attention and smallest P1 during lack of attention, that is, these levels of alpha rhythm seemed to optimally support the behavioral goal ("detect" stimuli at the cued finger while ignoring the other finger). Our results show that attention enhances neural processing for both suprathreshold and subthreshold stimuli and they highlight a rather complex interaction between attention, Rolandic alpha activity, and their effects on stimulus processing.

However, there is currently no 'gold standard' for identifying HFOs. Accordingly, we aimed to formally characterize the interrater reliability of HFO markings to validate the current practices. Methods: A morphology detector was implemented to detect events (candidate HFOs, lower-threshold events, and distractors) from the intracranial EEG (iEEG) of ten patients. Six electroencephalographers visually evaluated these events for the presence of HFOs and IEDs. Interrater reliability was calculated using pairwise Cohen's Kappa (kappa) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results: The HFO evaluation distributions were significantly different for most pairs of reviewers (p < 0.05; 11/15 pairs). Interrater reliability was poor for HFOs alone (kappa(mean) = 0.403; ICC = 0.401) and HFO + IEDs (kappa(mean) = 0.568; ICC = 0.570). Conclusions: The current practice of using two visual reviewers to identify HFOs is prone to bias arising from the poor agreement between reviewers, limiting the extrinsic validity of studies using these markers. Significance: The poor interrater reliability underlines the need for a framework to reconcile the important findings of existing studies. The present epoched design is an ideal candidate for the implementation of such a framework. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This random practice effect also known as contextual interference effect) is frequently investigated on the behavioral level and discussed in the context of mechanisms of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and increased cognitive efforts during movement planning. However, there is a lack of studies examining the random practice effect in motor adaptation tasks and, in general, the underlying neural processes of the random practice effect are not fully understood. We tested 24 right-handed human subjects performing a reaching task using a robotic manipulandum. Subjects learned to adapt either to a blocked or a random schedule of different force field perturbations while subjects' electroencephalography EEG) was recorded. The behavioral results showed a distinct random practice effect in terms of a more stabilized retest performance of the random compared to the blocked practicing group. Further analyses showed that this effect correlates with changes in the alpha band power in electrodes over parietal areas. We conclude that the random practice effect in this study is facilitated by mechanisms within the parietal cortex during movement execution which might reflect online feedback mechanisms.

Here we reported a case of refractory epilepsy characterized by aura of extreme fear and hypermotor seizures, in which the left (dominant hemisphere) anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) was determined to be the epileptogenic zone (EZ) through multiple modalities of presurgical evaluation including analysis of high frequency oscillation on intracranial EEG. Tailored resection of EZ was thus performed and pathological examination revealed focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type lib. The patient has been seizure free during an 18-month follow-up. The report has provided novel anatomical, electrophysiological and surgical evidences suggesting the critical role of ACG in ictal fear and possibility of surgical management of fear-manifesting refractory epilepsy.

In this paper, four categories of HFOs are considered: Gamma ([30-80 Hz]), high-gamma ([80-120 Hz]), ripples ([120-250 Hz]), and fast-ripples ([250-600 Hz]). A universal detector of the four types of HFOs is proposed. It has the advantages of 1) classifying HFOs, and thus, being robust to inter and intrasubject variability; 2) rejecting artefacts, thus being specific. Methods: Gabor atoms are tuned to cover the physiological bands. Gabor transform is then used to detect HFOs in intracerebral electroencephalography (iEEG) signals recorded in patients candidate to epilepsy surgery. To extract relevant features, energy ratios, along with event duration, are investigated. Discriminant ratios are optimized so as to maximize among the four types of HFOs and artefacts. A multiclass support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify detected events. Pseudoreal signals are simulated to measure the performance of the method when the ground truth is known. Results: Experiments are conducted on simulated and on human iEEG signals. The proposed method shows high performance in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate.

J	Keil, J; Senkowski, D				Keil, Julian; Senkowski, Daniel			Individual Alpha Frequency Relates to the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion	MULTISENSORY RESEARCH			English	Article						Oscillation; alpha; frequency; EEG; illusion; multisensory; audiovisual; perception	VISUAL-PERCEPTION; OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; TEMPORAL RESOLUTION; ILLUSORY PERCEPTION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; EEG; PHASE; POWER	Ongoing neural oscillations reflect fluctuations of cortical excitability. A growing body of research has underlined the role of neural oscillations for stimulus processing. Neural oscillations in the alpha band have gained special interest in electrophysiological research on perception. Recent studies proposed the idea that neural oscillations provide temporal windows in which sensory stimuli can be perceptually integrated. This also includes multisensory integration. In the current high-density EEG-study we examined the relationship between the individual alpha frequency (IAF) and crossmodal audiovisual integration in the sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI). In 26 human volunteers we found a negative correlation between the IAF and the SIFI illusion rate. Individuals with a lower IAF showed higher audiovisual illusions. Source analysis suggested an involvement of the visual cortex, especially the calcarine sulcus, for this relationship. Our findings corroborate the notion that the IAF affects the cross-modal integration of auditory on visual stimuli in the SIFI. We integrate our findings with recent observations on the relationship between audiovisual integration and neural oscillations and suggest a multifaceted influence of neural oscillations on multisensory processing.

This can be easily accomplished by thresholding in the TF domain with the preset TF threshold value, often chosen empirically. The paper investigates the sensitivity of the method based on the local Renyi entropy to the chosen threshold value. The study was performed on real-life left and right hand movements EEG signals. As shown in the paper, the number of the EEG components extracted using the short-term Renyi entropy is highly sensitive to the chosen TF threshold value, unlike the dominant IF which was shown to be highly robust to TF thresholding. Hence, characterization of the EEG signals using the short-term Renyi entropy should include both detecting the number of EEG components and the dominant component IF estimation.

Purpose: The purpose of this study in newborn piglets was to determine the effect of cerebral hypothermia (CH) on neural activity during pharmacologically induced NS. We hypothesized that the neuroprotective effects of CH would preserve higher frequencies observed in electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings. Methods: Power spectral density was employed to determine the levels of brain activity in ECoGs to quantitatively assess the power of each frequency observed in neurological brain states of delta, theta, alpha, and beta-gamma frequencies. Result: The most significant reduction of power occurs in the lower frequency band of delta-theta-alpha of CH cohorts, while t score probabilities imply that high-frequency brain activity in the beta-gamma range is preserved in the CH population. Conclusion: While the overall power density decreases over time in both groups, the decrease is to a lesser degree in the CH population. (C) 2017 S.

Impact of major and minor mode on EEG frequency range activities of music processing as a function of expertise	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Expressive music; Musical mode; Expertise; EEG; Frequency domain	LIMBIC STRUCTURES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND; PERCEPTION; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; HAPPY; SAD; SYNCHRONIZATION; MELODIES	Processing western tonal music may yield distinct brain responses depending on the mode of the musical compositions. Although subjective feelings in response to major and minor mode are well described, the underlying brain mechanisms and their development with increasing expertise have not been thoroughly examined. Using high-density electroencephalography, the present study investigated neuronal activities in the frequency domain in response to polyphone musical compositions in major and minor mode in non-musicians, amateurs and experts. During active listening decrease of theta- and gamma-frequency range activities occurred with increasing expertise in right posterior regions, possibly reflecting enhanced processing efficiency. Moreover, minor and major compositions distinctively modulated synchronization of neuronal activities in high frequency ranges (beta and gamma) in frontal regions, with increased activity in response to minor compositions in musicians and in experts in particular. These results suggest that high-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activities carry information about musical mode, showing gradual increase of processing efficiency and sensitivity with musical expertise.

Its use is motivated by the fact that EMD can give an effective and meaningful time-frequency information about the signal. The EMD decomposes the signal in intrinsic mode functions (IMF) that represent the signal in different frequency bands. In this paper, we propose a novel method for feature extraction of EEG signals based on multi-band brain mapping using EMD, where the EMD is applied to decompose an EEG signal into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The obtained multi-band brain mapping is used to reconstruct the neuronal activity of the brain. The impact of signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the EMD frequency bands separation is explored and the results shows the strength of the EMD in adaptively separating the noise. The neural reconstruction obtained based on EMD is compared to the case in which EMD pre-processing is not employed, verifying the effective noise separation with EMD.

Inter-trial coherence of medial frontal theta oscillations linked to differential feedback processing in youth and young adults with autism	RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorders (ASD); Reward processing; Theta oscillations; Event-related spectral analysis; Inter-trial phase coherence	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR; REWARD EXPECTATION; DECISION-MAKING; EEG DYNAMICS	Background: Impairment in prediction and appreciation for choice outcomes could contribute to several core symptoms of ASD. We examined electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations in 27 youth and young adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 22 IQ-matched neurotypical controls while they performed a chance-based reward prediction task. Method: We re-analyzed our previously published ERP data (Larson et al., 2011) and examined theta band oscillations (4-8 Hz) at frontal midline sites, within a timing window that overlaps with the feedback-related negativity (FRN). We focused on event-related changes after presentation of feedback for reward (WIN) and punitive (LOSE) outcomes, both for spectral power and inter-trial phase coherence. Results: In our reward prediction task, for both groups, medial frontal theta power and phase coherence were greater following LOSE compared to WIN feedback. However, compared to controls, inter-trial coherence of medial frontal theta was significantly lower overall (across both feedback types) for individuals with ASD. Our results indicate that while individuals with ASD are sensitive to the valence of reward feedback, comparable to their neurotypical peers, they have reduced synchronization of medial frontal theta activity during feedback processing. Conclusions: This finding is consistent with previous studies showing neural variability in ASD and suggest that the processes underlying decision-making and reinforcement learning may be atypical and less efficient in ASD.

Stockwell transform for epileptic seizure detection from EEG signals	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG classification; Epileptic seizure; Stockwell transform (ST); Amplitude distribution; Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA)	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; S-TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; SPECTRUM; ENTROPY; IMAGE	Epilepsy is the most common disorder of human brain. The goal of this paper is to present a new method for classification of epileptic phases based on the sub-bands of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals obtained from the Stockwell transform (ST). ST is a time-frequency analysis that not only covers the advantages of both short-time Fourier transform (FT) and wavelet transform (WT), but also overcomes their shortcomings. In the proposed method, at first, EEG signal is transformed into time-frequency domain using ST and all operations are performed in the new domain. Then, the amplitudes of ST in five sub-bands, namely delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha (alpha), beta (beta), and gamma (gamma), are computed. In order to classify EEG signal as healthy, interictal, and ictal, we obtain the distributions of amplitudes of ST in different sub-bands. In this way, for each EEG signal, five feature vectors, each for one sub-band are obtained. Next, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is used to extract the informative features from the feature vectors. Finally, the distances between the informative features of test and training samples in different sub-bands are calculated and the weighted linear combination of them is applied to the nearest neighbor classifier. We consider different distance measures. The test sample is assigned to the class of the training sample which has minimum distance from it. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency in comparison with the recently proposed algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: The empirical wavelet transform (EWT) has been explored for the multivariate signals in order to determine the joint instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies in signal adaptive frequency scales. The proposedmultivariate extension of EWT has been studied on multivariate multicomponent synthetic signal, as well as on multivariate EEG signals of Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) scalp EEG database. In a moving-window-based analysis, 2-s-duration multivariate EEG signal epochs containing five automatically selected channels have been decomposed and three features have been extracted from each 1-s part of the 2-s-duration joint instantaneous amplitudes of multivariate EEG signals. The extracted features from each oscillatory level have been processed using a proposed feature processing step and joint features have been computed in order to achieve better discrimination of seizure and seizure-free EEG signal epochs. Results: The proposed detection method has been evaluated over 177 h of EEG records using six classifiers. We have achieved average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values as 97.91%, 99.57%, and 99.41%, respectively, using tenfold cross-validationmethod, which are higher than the compared state of art methods studied on this database.

Technological advances in pediatric epilepsy surgery: implications for tuberous sclerosis complex	FUTURE NEUROLOGY			English	Review						epilepsy; epilepsy surgery; localization; outcome; tuberous sclerosis complex	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTOGENIC TUBER; CORTICAL TUBERS; MENTAL-RETARDATION; CHILDREN; SEIZURES; LOCALIZATION; BRAIN; EEG; IDENTIFICATION	In selected children with tuberous sclerosis complex, epilepsy surgery leads to seizure freedom or seizure reduction. The current standard involves a multimodal pre-surgical workup followed by invasive electrocorticographic monitoring and resective surgery. Recent insights in the disorder and novel technologies are changing the approach to pediatric epilepsy surgery in tuberous sclerosis complex. New evidence suggests tubers are poorly delineated, and epileptogenic activity may originate in the perituber tissue. Novel imaging modalities relevant to surgical planning include high-resolution MRI, a-methyl-l-tryptophan or fluorodeoxyglucose PET with diffusion tensor imaging. Advanced neurophysiological techniques have improved identification of the surgical target, including magnetoencephalography, electrical source imaging of high-density electroencephalograph data, and high-frequency oscillations in electrocorticography data. Simultaneously, novel surgical tools including stereo-electroencephalography and laser-induced thermal therapy have become available for children. This article reviews the literature in the light of these rapidly changing technologies.

Visualization of Brain Activation During Attention-Demanding Tasks Using Cognitive Signal Processing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE INFORMATICS AND NATURAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Cognitive Process; Electroencephalography; Event Related Desynchronization; Event Related Synchronization; Sustained Attention; Task Performance	ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS	Attention is the primary cognitive process to induce a response to a stimulus. The present study aims at evaluating the activation of different brain regions while performing an attention requiring task. The analysis is achieved with the help of electroencephalography (EEG) recorded simultaneously during the entire period of execution of task. The relative theta and gamma power were significantly higher (p=0.05) during task when compared to rest, whereas in alpha band the relative power was significantly higher (p=0.05) during rest when compared to task. Event related synchronization (ERS) and Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) in relative theta power and relative alpha power respectively was observed particularly in the parietal electrodes (associated with attention). Theta synchronisation and alpha desynchronization is associated with good performance further supported by the task performance with minimal errors. These event-related changes helped sustain attention and visualization of the activated brain regions was accomplished for a better depiction of the findings.

EEG-Based Quantification of Cortical Current Density and Dynamic Causal Connectivity Generalized across Subjects Performing BCI-Monitored Cognitive Tasks	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); causality analysis; source localization; LORETA; independent component analysis; motor activity; spatial reach and saccade	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; OPEN SOURCE TOOLBOX; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION-FLOW; NETWORKS; MODEL; RECOGNITION; MOVEMENTS	Quantification of dynamic causal interactions among brain regions constitutes an important component of conducting research and developing applications in experimental and translational neuroscience. Furthermore, cortical networks with dynamic causal connectivity in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications offer a more comprehensive view of brain states implicated in behavior than do individual brain regions. However, models of cortical network dynamics are difficult to generalize across subjects because current electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis techniques are limited in their ability to reliably localize sources across subjects. We propose an algorithmic and computational framework for identifying cortical networks across subjects in which dynamic causal connectivity is modeled among user-selected cortical regions of interest (ROIs). We demonstrate the strength of the proposed framework using a "reach/saccade to spatial target" cognitive task performed by 10 right-handed individuals. Modeling of causal cortical interactions was accomplished through measurement of cortical activity using (EEG), application of independent component clustering to identify cortical ROIs as network nodes, estimation of cortical current density using cortically constrained low resolution electromagnetic brain tomography (cLORETA), multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) modeling of representative cortical activity signals from each ROI, and quantification of the dynamic causal interaction among the identified ROIs using the Short-time direct Directed Transfer function (SdDTF). The resulting cortical network and the computed causal dynamics among its nodes exhibited physiologically plausible behavior, consistent with past results reported in the literature. This physiological plausibility of the results strengthens the framework's applicability in reliably capturing complex brain functionality, which is required by applications, such as diagnostics and BCI.

In order to use source connectivity analysis as a reliable research tool, there is a need for stability across a wider range of standard estimation routines. Using resting state EEG recordings of N=65 participants acquired within two studies, we present the first comprehensive assessment of the consistency of EEG source localization and functional/effective connectivity metrics across two anatomical templates (ICBM152 and Colin27), three electrical models (BEM, FEM and spherical harmonics expansions), three inverse methods (WMNE, eLORETA and LCMV), and three software implementations (Brainstorm, Fieldtrip and our own toolbox). Source localizations were found to be more stable across reconstruction pipelines than subsequent estimations of functional connectivity, while effective connectivity estimates where the least consistent. All results were relatively unaffected by the choice of the electrical head model, while the choice of the inverse method and source imaging package induced a considerable variability. In particular, a relatively strong difference was found between LCMV beamformer solutions on one hand and eLORETA/WMNE distributed inverse solutions on the other hand. We also observed a gradual decrease of consistency when results are compared between studies, within individual participants, and between individual participants. In order to provide reliable findings in the face of the observed variability, additional simulations involving interacting brain sources are required. Meanwhile, we encourage verification of the obtained results using more than one source imaging procedure.

The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between EEG High-alpha/Low-alpha (H-alpha/L-alpha) power ratio and cortical glucose metabolism. A total of 23 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent FDG-PET and EEG examinations. H-alpha/L-alpha power ratio was computed for each subject and 2 groups were obtained based on the increase of the power ratio. The subjects with higher H-alpha/ L-alpha power ratio showed a decrease in glucose metabolism in the hub brain areas previously identified as typically affected by AD pathology. In subjects with higher H-alpha/L-alpha ratio and lower metabolism, a "double alpha peak" was identified in the EEG spectrum and a U-shaped correlation between glucose metabolism and increase of H-alpha/L-alpha power ratio has been found. Moreover, in this group, a conversion rate of 62.5% at 24 months was detected, significantly different from the chance percentage expected. The neurophysiological meaning of the interplay between alpha oscillations and glucose metabolism and the possible interest of the H-alpha/L-alpha power ratio as a clinical biomarker in AD have been discussed.

Mining Time-Resolved Functional Brain Graphs to an EEG- Based Chronnectomic Brain Aged Index (CBAI)	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; time-varying network analysis; chronnectomics; dominant coupling modes; cross-frequency coupling; maturation index; signal processing; symbolic analysis	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; FMRI DATA; CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMICS; PREDICTION; MACHINES; PATTERNS; RECONFIGURATION; QUANTIZATION	The brain at rest consists of spatially and temporal distributed but functionally connected regions that called intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Resting state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) is a way to characterize brain networks without confounds associated with task EEG such as task difficulty and performance. A novel framework of how to study dynamic functional connectivity under the notion of functional connectivity microstates (FC mu states) and symbolic dynamics is further discussed. Furthermore, we introduced a way to construct a single integrated dynamic functional connectivity graph (IDFCG) that preserves both the strength of the connections between every pair of sensors but also the type of dominant intrinsic coupling modes (DICM). The whole methodology is demonstrated in a significant and unexplored task for EEG which is the definition of an objective Chronnectomic Brain Aged index (CBAI) extracted from resting-state data (N = 94 subjects) with both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Novel features have been defined based on symbolic dynamics and the notion of DICM and FC mu states. The transition rate of FC mu states, the symbolic dynamics based on the evolution of FC mu states (the Markovian Entropy, the complexity index), the probability distribution of DICM, the novel Flexibility Index that captures the dynamic reconfiguration of DICM per pair of EEG sensors and the relative signal power constitute a valuable pool of features that can build the proposed CBAI. Here we applied a feature selection technique and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier to discriminate young adults from middle-aged and a Support Vector Regressor to build a linear model of the actual age based on EEG-based spatio-temporal features. The most significant type of features for both prediction of age and discrimination of young vs. adults age groups was the dynamic reconfiguration of dominant coupling modes derived from a subset of EEG sensor pairs. Specifically, our results revealed a very high prediction of age for eyes-open (R-2 = 0.60; y = 0.79x + 8.03) and lower for eyes-closed (R-2 = 0.48; y = 0.71x + 10.91) while we succeeded to correctly classify young vs. middle-age group with 97.8% accuracy in eyes-open and 87.2% for eyes-closed. Our results were reproduced also in a second dataset for further external validation of the whole analysis. The proposed methodology proved valuable for the characterization of the intrinsic properties of dynamic functional connectivity through the age untangling developmental differences using EEG resting-state recordings.

Fluctuations in instantaneous frequency predict alpha amplitude during visual perception	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GAMMA OSCILLATION FREQUENCY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; INHIBITION; EXCITATION; CORTEX; BRAIN	Rhythmic neural activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) is thought to have an important role in the selective processing of visual information. Typically, modulations in alpha amplitude and instantaneous frequency are thought to reflect independent mechanisms impacting dissociable aspects of visual information processing. However, in complex systems with interacting oscillators such as the brain, amplitude and frequency are mathematically dependent. Here, we record electroencephalography in human subjects and show that both alpha amplitude and instantaneous frequency predict behavioral performance in the same visual discrimination task. Consistent with a model of coupled oscillators, we show that fluctuations in instantaneous frequency predict alpha amplitude on a single trial basis, empirically demonstrating that these metrics are not independent. This interdependence suggests that changes in amplitude and instantaneous frequency reflect a common change in the excitatory and inhibitory neural activity that regulates alpha oscillations and visual information processing.

Permanency Analysis on Human Electroencephalogram Signals for Pervasive Brain-Computer Interface Systems	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn			EEG SIGNALS	Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems use some permanent features of brain signals to recognize their corresponding cognitive states with high accuracy. However, these features are not perfectly permanent, and BCI system should be continuously trained over time, which is tedious and time consuming. Thus, analyzing the permanency of signal features is essential in determining how often to repeat training. In this paper, we monitor electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and analyze their behavior through continuous and relatively long period of time. In our experiment, we record EEG signals corresponding to rest state (eyes open and closed) from one subject everyday, for three and a half months. The results show that signal features such as auto-regression coefficients remain permanent through time, while others such as power spectral density specifically in 5-7 Hz frequency band are not permanent. In addition, eyes open EEG data shows more permanency than eyes closed data.	[Sadeghi, Koosha; Lee, Junghyo; Banerjee, Ayan; Sohankar, Javad; Gupta, Sandeep K.

Decoding of Self-paced Lower-Limb Movement Intention: A Case Study on the Influence Factors	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-machine interface (BMI); electroencephalography (EEG); lower-limb movement; onset detection; movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs); sensory motor rhythms (SMRs)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; PREDICTION; POTENTIALS; ANKLE	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have been applied as new rehabilitation tools for motor disabled individuals. Active involvement of cerebral activity has been shown to enhance neuroplasticity and thus to restore mobility. Various studies have focused on the detection of upper-limb movement intention, while the fewer study has investigated the lower-limb movement intention decoding. This study presents a BMI to decode the self-paced lower-limb movement intention, with 10 healthy subjects participating in the experiment. We varied four influence factors including the movement type (dorsiflexion or plantar flexion), the limb side (left or right leg), the processing method (time-series analysis based on MRCP, i.e., movement-related cortical potential or frequency-domain estimation based on SMR, i.e., sensory motor rhythm) and the frequency band (e.g., delta, theta, mu, beta and MRCP band at [0.1 1] Hz), to estimate both single-trial and sample-based performance. Feature analysis was then conducted to show the discriminant power (DP) and brain modulations. The average detection latency was 0.334 +/- 0.216 s in single-trial basis across all conditions. An average area under the curve (AUC) of 91.0 +/- 3.5% and 68.2 +/- 4.6% was obtained for the MRCP-based and SMR-based method in the classification, respectively. The best performance was yielded from plantar flexion with left leg using time-series analysis on the MRCP band. The feature analysis indicated a cross-subject consistency of DP with the MRCP-based method and subject-specific variance of DP with the SMR-based method. The results presented here might be further exploited in a rehabilitation scenario. The comprehensive factor analysis might be used to shed light on the design of an effective brain switch to trigger external robotic devices.

While this relationship has mainly been established in theoretical models and studies in younger subjects, the impact of structural declines of the dopaminergic system during healthy aging remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy young and elderly humans in a reward-learning paradigm. Specifically, scene images were initially encoded by combining them with cues predicting monetary reward (high vs. low reward). Subsequently, recognition memory for the scenes was tested. As a main finding, we can show that response times (RTs) during encoding were faster for high reward predicting images in the young but not elderly participants. This pattern was resembled in power changes in the theta-band (4-7 Hz). Importantly, analyses of structural MRI data revealed that individual reward-related differences in the elderlies response time could be predicted by the structural integrity of the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SN; as measured by magnetization transfer (MT)). These findings suggest a close relationship between reward-based invigoration, theta oscillations and age-dependent changes of the dopaminergic system.

However, multi-frequency band analysis of the brain network in WM in the cortical space remains largely unexplored. In this study, we employed a graph theoretical framework to characterize the topological properties of the brain functional network in the theta and alpha frequency bands during WM tasks. Twenty-eight subjects performed visual n-back tasks at two difficulty levels, i.e., 0-back (control task) and 2-back (WM task). After preprocessing, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were projected into the source space and 80 cortical brain regions were selected for further analysis. Subsequently, the theta- and alpha-band networks were constructed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients between the power series (obtained by concatenating the power values of all epochs in each session) of all pairs of brain regions. Graph theoretical approaches were then employed to estimate the topological properties of the brain networks at different WM tasks. We found higher functional integration in the theta band and lower functional segregation in the alpha band in the WM task compared with the control task. Moreover, compared to the 0-back task, altered regional centrality was revealed in the 2-back task in various brain regions that mainly resided in the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes, with distinct presentations in the theta and alpha bands. In addition, significant negative correlations were found between the reaction time with the average path length of the theta-band network and the local clustering of the alpha-band network, which demonstrates the potential for using the brain network metrics as biomarkers for predicting the task performance during WM tasks.

Network Efficiency and Posterior Alpha Patterns Are Markers of Recovery from General Anesthesia: A High-Density Electroencephalography Study in Healthy Volunteers	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; cognition; general anesthesia; electroencephalography; alpha rhythm; graph theory	PROPOFOL-INDUCED LOSS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; CONSCIOUSNESS; ORGANIZATION; SEVOFLURANE; EEG; RECONFIGURATION; DYNAMICS; INDEX	Recent studies have investigated local oscillations, long-range connectivity, and global network patterns to identify neural changes associated with anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. These studies typically employ anesthetic protocols that either just cross the threshold of unconsciousness, or induce deep unconsciousness for a brief period of time-neither of which models general anesthesia for major surgery. To study neural patterns of unconsciousness and recovery in a clinically-relevant context, we used a realistic anesthetic regimen to induce and maintain unconsciousness in eight healthy participants for 3 h. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired throughout and for another 3 h after emergence. Seven epochs of 5-min eyes-closed resting states were extracted from the data at baseline as well as 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180-min post-emergence. Additionally, 5-min epochs were extracted during induction, unconsciousness, and immediately prior to recovery of consciousness, for a total of 10 analysis epochs. The EEG data in each epoch were analyzed using source-localized spectral analysis, phase-lag index, and graph theoretical techniques. Posterior alpha power was significantly depressed during unconsciousness, and gradually approached baseline levels over the 3 h recovery period. Phase-lag index did not distinguish between states of consciousness or stages of recovery. Network efficiency was significantly depressed and network clustering coefficient was significantly increased during unconsciousness; these graph theoretical measures returned to baseline during the 3 h recovery period. Posterior alpha power may be a potential biomarker for normal recovery of functional brain networks after general anesthesia.

QoE is usually quantified by self-evaluated subjective scales. However, continuous improvement of signal acquisition, signal processing technologies and increase of computational efficiency enabled the use of physiological signals to evaluate users QoE. In this study the analysis of physiological signals (electroencephalography EEG) was investigated in order to explore a possibility to evaluate the QoE through the Sense of Presence (SoP). In order to obtain more information about objective QoE evaluation, a dataset of audiovisual stimuli under different SoP was investigated focusing on a relationship between collected subjective assessments and measured physiological signals. Statistical analysis suggests that there exists a relationship between spectral features of EEG and subjective assessment questionnaire results. During investigation, presented in this paper a significant changes in the theta band power was found in all investigated regions. In addition, alpha band activity was shown to change under different levels of the SoP of the frontal, central and occipital lobes. Beta low band activity showed significant changes in the parietal and temporal lobes, beta middle oscillations showed significant differences in the frontal lobe, beta high in temporal lobe. Results revealed that EEG signals can be used as one of the features objectively measuring change of SoP in the immersive audiovisual communications.

Materials and methods: The accuracy of linear, spectral asymmetry index (SASI), and nonlinear, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), methods for differentiating depressive and healthy subjects was compared. The eyes closed EEG was recorded from 18 common reference (Cz) channels for 34 subjects (17 depressive and 17 control). The signals were stored at 400 Hz sampling frequency and digitally filtered with cutoff frequencies at 0.5 Hz and at 40 Hz. The first 5 min of each recording was selected for further analysis. Results: The experiments indicated maximum difference for SASI values in channel Pz and for DFA values in channels Pz and O2. Therefore, channel Pz was selected for comparison of two methods. The results of statistical analysis show that SASI values are significantly higher for depressive than for control group (p =3.577e-05), while DFA values are significantly lower for depressive group (p =0.033). SASI has superior discrimination ability with classification accuracy of 76.5%, while the classification accuracy of DFA was 70.6%.

In order to reduce the possible chances of road disasters, it is essential to characterize the pre-requisites of driver distraction. While driving, the driver might get distracted by several ways such as talking on the cell phone, texting, and having a conversation with the passenger. There has been extensive research conducted to estimate driver states in recent years particularly on camera and EEG-based systems. However, camera-based systems face challenges such as privacy or latency in detection. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG) based detection can accomplish more reliable detection. However, this technology requires an intrusive implementation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a reliable signal which can characterize the physiological changes consistently, with minimal intrusiveness, and at low cost. In this paper, we propose an ECG signal processing recipe with the aim of predicting driver distraction in real-time. Six drivers actively participated in the naturalistic driving experiment where distraction was induced by: 1) making a phone call and 2) having an active conversation between the driver and the passenger. We present an effective frequency subBand analysis using Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). Due to high dimensionality of the original WPT features, we then applied Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for feature space dimensionality reduction. Based on our experimental results, WPT features demonstrated high information content and provided a significant statistical difference between normal vs. distracted driving scenarios.

Cognitive strategies in the mental rotation task revealed by EEG spectral power	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Mental rotation; Cognitive strategies; Mu; Electroencephalography; Event-related spectral perturbation; Independent component analysis	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY MAINTENANCE; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; MU-RHYTHM; ALPHA BAND; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; 3-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION	The classic mental rotation task (MRT; Shepard & Metzler, 1971) is commonly thought to measure mental rotation, a cognitive process involving covert simulation of motor rotation. Yet much research suggests that the MRT recruits both motor simulation and other analytic cognitive strategies that depend on visuospatial representation and visual working memory (WM). In the present study, we investigated cognitive strategies in the MRT using time-frequency analysis of EEG and independent component analysis. We scrutinized sensorimotor mu (mu) power reduction, associated with motor simulation, parietal alpha (pa) power reduction, associated with visuospatial representation, and frontal midline theta (fine) power enhancement, associated with WM maintenance and manipulation. power increased concomitant with increasing task difficulty, suggesting reduced use of motor simulation, while pa decreased and fine power increased, suggesting heightened use of visuospatial representation processing and WM, respectively. These findings suggest that MRT performance involves flexibly trading off between cognitive strategies, namely a motor simulation-based mental rotation strategy and WMintensive analytic strategies based on task difficulty. Flexible cognitive strategy use may be a domain-general cognitive principle that underlies aptitude and spatial intelligence in a variety of cognitive domains. We close with discussion of the present study's implications as well as future directions.

To be successful, epilepsy surgery requires a comprehensive preoperative evaluation to define the epileptogenic zone (EZ), the brain area that should be resected to achieve seizure freedom. Due to lack of tools and methods that measure the EZ directly, this area is defined indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude of presurgical non-invasive tests and intracranial recordings. However, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive. Thus, the presurgical evaluation of surgical candidates is frequently challenging or unsuccessful. To improve the efficacy of the surgical treatment, there is an overriding need for reliable biomarkers that can delineate the EZ. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have emerged over the last decade as new potential biomarkers for the delineation of the EZ. Multiple studies have shown that HFOs are spatially associated with the EZ. Despite the encouraging findings, there are still significant challenges for the translation of HFOs as epileptogenic biomarkers to the clinical practice. One of the major barriers is the difficulty to detect and localize them with non-invasive techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) or scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Although most literature has studied HFOs using invasive recordings, recent studies have reported the detection and localization of HFOs using MEG or scalp EEG. MEG seems to be particularly advantageous compared to scalp EEG due to its inherent advantages of being less affected by skull conductivity and less susceptible to contamination from muscular activity. The detection and localization of HFOs with MEG would largely expand the clinical utility of these new promising biomarkers to an earlier stage in the diagnostic process and to a wider range of patients with epilepsy. Here, we conduct a thorough critical review of the recent MEG literature that investigates HFOs in patients with epilepsy, summarizing the different methodological approaches and the main findings. Our goal is to highlight the emerging potential of MEG in the non- invasive detection and localization of HFOs for the presurgical evaluation of patients with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE).

The most common methods shown in the literature bet for classical learning techniques and statistics that are applied to a reduced number of features in order to tackle the computational load. Nowadays, the application of deep learning to the sleep stage classification problem seems very interesting and novel, therefore, this paper presents a first approximation using a single channel and information from the current epoch to perform the classification. The complete Physionet database has been used in the experiments. Deep learning has been applied to the time and frequency domains from the EEG signal obtaining a good performance and promising further work.

In an attempt to provide causal evidence for this assumption, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at theta frequency over fronto-parietal sites during a visuospatial match-to-sample (MtS) task. Depending on the stimulation protocol, i.e., in-phase, anti-phase or sham, we anticipated a differential impact of tACS on behavioral WM performance as well as on the EEG (electroencephalography) during resting state before and after stimulation. We hypothesized that in-phase tACS of the fronto-parietal theta network (stimulation frequency: 5 Hz; intensity: 1 mA peakto-peak) would result in performance enhancement, whereas anti-phase tACS would cause performance impairment. Eighteen participants (nine female) received in-phase, anti-phase, and sham stimulation in balanced order. While being stimulated, subjects performed the MtS task, which varied in executive demand (two levels: low and high). EEG analysis of power peaks within the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz) frequency bands was carried out. No significant differences were observed between in-phase and anti-phase stimulation regarding both behavioral and EEG measurements. Yet, with regard to the alpha frequency band, we observed a statistically significant drop of peak power from pre to post in the sham condition, whereas alpha power remained on a similar level in the actively stimulated conditions. Our results indicate a frequency-unspecific modulation of neuronal oscillations by tACS. However, the closer participants' individual theta peak frequencies were to the stimulation frequency of 5 Hz after anti-phase tACS, the faster they responded in the MtS task. This effect did not reach statistical significance during in-phase tACS and was not present during sham. A lack of statistically significant behavioral results in the MtS task and frequency-unspecific effects on the electrophysiological level question the effectiveness of tACS in modulating cortical oscillations in a frequency-specific manner.

To date there have been no studies investigating how BAP might correlate with measurements from the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG). Method: EEG resting-state data were collected in 20 young adults during both eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting states. Permutation modelling was used to assess correlations of the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) with source localised resting alpha activity. Results: Total scores on the BAPQ were strongly correlated with differences between oscillatory brain activity during EC and EO rest in a pattern that was classified as the mu rhythm. More mu activity during EC rest compared to EO rest was found to be associated with higher BAPQ scores (i.e. more prominent BAP symptoms). Conclusions: Mu is a known correlate of activity in the mirror neuron system (MNS), which has been implicated in the social deficits associated with autism. It is therefore suggested that this BAPQ-correlated mu activity could reflect the readying of the MNS for social input by visual stimulation. These findings offer novel insights into how the BAP is reflected in resting-state recordings of brain activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigated whether neural oscillations are related to violation and updating of temporal predictions. Human participants performed an experiment in which they had to generate a target at an expected time point, by pressing a button while taking into account a variable delay between the act and the stimulus occurrence. Our behavioral results showed that participants quickly adapted their temporal predictions in face of an error. Concurrent electrophysiological (EEG) data showed that temporal errors elicited markers that are classically related to error coding. Furthermore, intertrial phase coherence of frontal theta oscillations was modulated by error magnitude, possibly indexing the degree of surprise. Finally, we found that delta phase at stimulus onset was correlated with future behavioral adjustments. Together, our findings suggest that low frequency oscillations play a key role in monitoring and in updating temporal predictions.

Multimodal Fingerprints of Resting State Networks as assessed by Simultaneous Trimodal MR-PET-EEG Imaging	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN-FUNCTION; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; ENERGY-METABOLISM; VISUAL-CORTEX; GABA; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; FLUCTUATIONS	Simultaneous MR-PET-EEG (magnetic resonance imaging -positron emission tomography electroencephalography), a new tool for the investigation of neuronal networks in the human brain, is presented here for the first time. It enables the assessment of molecular metabolic information with high spatial and temporal resolution in a given brain simultaneously. Here, we characterize the brain's default mode network (DMN) in healthy male subjects using multimodal fingerprinting by quantifying energy metabolism via 2-[F-18] fluoro-2-desoxy-D-glucose PET (FDG-PET), the inhibition -excitation balance of neuronal activation via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), its functional connectivity via fMRI and its electrophysiological signature via EEG. The trimodal approach reveals a complementary fingerprint. Neuronal activation within the DMN as assessed with fMRI is positively correlated with the mean standard uptake value of FDG. Electrical source localization of EEG signals shows a significant difference between the dorsal DMN and sensorimotor network in the frequency range of delta,theta,alpha, and beta-1, but not with beta-2 and beta-3. In addition to basic neuroscience questions addressing neurovascularmetabolic coupling, this new methodology lays the foundation for individual physiological and pathological fingerprints for a wide research field addressing healthy aging, gender effects, plasticity and different psychiatric and neurological diseases.

Although ADHD was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century, its diagnosis is still confronted with many problems.& para;& para;Method: A novel classification approach that discriminates ADHD and nonADHD groups over the time-frequency domain features of event-related potential (ERP) recordings that are taken during Stroop task is presented. Time-Frequency Hermite-Atomizer (TFHA) technique is used for the extraction of high resolution time-frequency domain features that are highly localized in time-frequency domain. Based on an extensive investigation, Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) was used to obtain the best discriminating features.& para;& para;Results: When the best three features were used, the classification accuracy for the training dataset reached 98%, and the use of five features further improved the accuracy to 99.5%. The accuracy was 100% for the testing dataset. Based on extensive experiments, the delta band emerged as the most contributing frequency band and statistical parameters emerged as the most contributing feature group.& para;& para;Conclusion: The classification performance of this study suggests that TFHA can be employed as an auxiliary component of the diagnostic and prognostic procedures for ADHD.& para;& para;Significance: The features obtained in this study can potentially contribute to the neuroelectrical understanding and clinical diagnosis of ADHD.

The typical electroencephalographic (EEG) features in AD patients are increased delta or theta rhythm and decreased alpha or beta rhythm activities. However, considering the role of cross-frequency couplings in cognition, the alternation of cross-frequency couplings in AD patients is still obscure. This study aims to explore the interaction dynamics between different EEG oscillations in AD patients. We recorded the resting eye-closed EEG signals in 8 AD patients and 12 healthy volunteers. By analyzing the wavelet power spectrum and bicoherence of EEG, we found enhanced gamma rhythm power in AD patients in addition to the increased delta and decreased alpha power. Furthermore, an enhancement of the cross-frequency coupling strength between the beta/gamma and low-frequency bands was observed in AD patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). We propose that the pathological increase of ongoing gamma-band power might result from the disruption of the GABAergic interneuron network in AD patients. Furthermore, the cross-frequency overcouplings, which reflect the enhanced synchronization, might indicate the attenuated complexity of the neuronal network, and AD patients have to use more neural resources to maintain the resting brain state. Overall, our findings provide new evidence of the disturbance of the brain oscillation network in AD and further deepen our understanding of the central mechanisms of AD.

Furthermore, network approaches have emerged as a promising direction for studying the complex organization of the brain, enabling easier interpretation of various mental states. In this paper, using two mental tasks (N-back and mental arithmetic), we present a framework for cross-as well as within-task workload discrimination by utilizing multi-band electroencephalography (EEG) cortical brain connectivity. In detail, we constructed functional networks in EEG source space in different frequency bands and considering the individual functional connections as classification features, we identified salient feature subsets based on a sequential feature selection algorithm. These connectivity subsets were able to provide accuracy of 87% for cross-task, 88% for N-back task, and 86% for mental arithmetic task. In conclusion, our method achieved to detect a small number of discriminative interactions among brain areas, leading to high accuracy in both within-task and cross-task classifications. In addition, the identified functional connectivity features, the majority of which were detected in frontal areas in theta and beta frequency bands, helped delineate the shared as well as the distinct neural mechanisms of the two mental tasks.

The main ingredient of EEG dependent BCI are preprocessing of EEG signals, feature extraction of EEG signals and classification of EEG signals. Very rich and useful information about the electrical activities of the brain is provided by the EEG. The amplitude and frequency varies in the EEG signal when various mental tasks are executed. Due to the lengthy nature of the EEG data, computing it becomes quite hectic. Therefore in this paper, the dimensions of the lengthy EEG recorded data is reduced with the help of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Expectation Maximization Based Principal Component Analysis (EM-PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Power Spectral Density (PSD). After reducing the dimensions, the new obtained dimensionally reduced values are classified to get the epilepsy risk level from EEG signals with the help of a probabilistic model called Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The result analysis is performed with the benchmark terms like Performance Index, Accuracy, Quality Value and Time Delay. The most promising result in this study shows that when PSD is implemented as a dimensionality reduction technique and when classified with GMM, an average high accuracy of 97.46% is attained along with an average Performance Index of 94.69%.

J	Gulbinaite, R; Ilhan, B; VanRullen, R				Gulbinaite, Rasa; Ilhan, Barkin; VanRullen, Rufin			The Triple-Flash Illusion Reveals a Driving Role of Alpha-Band Reverberations in Visual Perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; EEG; individual alpha peak frequency; phase; power; triple-flash illusion	BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; EEG ALPHA; PRESTIMULUS OSCILLATIONS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; PREDICTS; POWER; ENTRAINMENT	The modulatory role of spontaneous brain oscillations on perception of threshold-level stimuli is well established. Here, we provide evidence that alpha-band (similar to 10 Hz) oscillations not only modulate perception of threshold-level sensory inputs but also can drive perception and generate percepts without a physical stimulus being present. Weused the "triple-flash" illusion: Occasional perception of three flashes when only two spatially coincident veridical ones, separated by similar to 100 ms, are presented. The illusion was proposed to result from superposition of two hypothetical oscillatory impulse response functions generated in response to each flash: When the delay between flashes matches the period of the oscillation, the superposition enhances a later part of the oscillation that is normally damped; when this enhancement crosses perceptual threshold, a third flash is erroneously perceived (Bowen, 1989). In Experiment 1, we varied stimulus onset asynchrony and validated Bowen's theory: The optimal stimulus onset asynchrony for illusion to occur was correlated, across human subjects (both genders), with the subject-specific impulse response function period determined from a separate EEG experiment. Experiment 2 revealed that prestimulus parietal, but no occipital, alpha EEG phase and power, as well as poststimulus alpha phase-locking, together determine the occurrence of the illusion on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, oscillatory reverberations create something out of nothing: A third flash where there are only two.

Evolutionary Algorithm Based Feature Optimization for Multi-Channel EEG Classification	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BCI; evolutionary algorithm; Fourier linear combiner; feature optimization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; CODED GENETIC ALGORITHMS; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; BAND IDENTIFICATION; ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; SPATIAL FILTERS; MOTOR IMAGERY	The most BCI systems that rely on EEG signals employ Fourier based methods for time-frequency decomposition for feature extraction. The band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner is well-suited for such band-limited signals due to its real-time applicability. Despite the improved performance of these techniques in two channel settings, its application in multiple-channel EEG is not straightforward and challenging. As more channels are available, a spatial filter will be required to eliminate the noise and preserve the required useful information. Moreover, multiple-channel EEG also adds the high dimensionality to the frequency feature space. Feature selection will be required to stabilize the performance of the classifier. In this paper, we develop a new method based on Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to solve these two problems simultaneously. The real-valued EA encodes both the spatial filter estimates and the feature selection into its solution and optimizes it with respect to the classification error. Three Fourier based designs are tested in this paper. Our results show that the combination of Fourier based method with covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) has the best overall performance.

Many research studies have been dedicated to detect, classify, simulate and understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for their generation. However, broadly classifying the HFOs into classes of wide frequency bands may negatively impact the quality of information carried by these electrophysiological biomarkers. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of various signal processing methods for estimating the dominant frequency of HFOs. The novelty is to make use of a physiologically-plausible computational model in which the HFO frequency can be tuned a priori. Results indicate that non-parametric methods best estimate the frequency of the low-amplitude fast oscillations characteristic of HFOs.

Multichannel interictal spike activity detection using time-frequency entropy measure	AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Epilepsy; Interictal spikes; Time-Frequency spectrum; Complex morlet wavelet; Wavelet transform; Epilepsy source localization; Entropy measure	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; SEIZURE DETECTION; FEATURE-SELECTION; EEG; EPILEPSY; CLASSIFICATION; MRI	Localization of interictal spikes is an important clinical step in the pre-surgical assessment of pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. The manual selection of interictal spike periods is cumbersome and involves a considerable amount of analysis workload for the physician. The primary focus of this paper is to automate the detection of interictal spikes for clinical applications in epilepsy localization. The epilepsy localization procedure involves detection of spikes in a multichannel EEG epoch. Therefore, a multichannel Time-Frequency (T-F) entropy measure is proposed to extract features related to the interictal spike activity. Least squares support vector machine is used to train the proposed feature to classify the EEG epochs as either normal or interictal spike period. The proposed T-F entropy measure, when validated with epilepsy dataset of 15 patients, shows an interictal spike classification accuracy of 91.20%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 84.23%. Moreover, the area under the curve of Receiver Operating Characteristics plot of 0.9339 shows the superior classification performance of the proposed T-F entropy measure. The results of this paper show a good spike detection accuracy without any prior information about the spike morphology.

Neural Oscillations and a Nascent Corticohippocampal Theory of Reference	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; WORKING-MEMORY RETRIEVAL; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; ANAPHORIC REFERENCE; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	The ability to use words to refer to the world is vital to the communicative power of human language. In particular, the anaphoric use of words to refer to previously mentioned concepts (antecedents) allows dialogue to be coherent and meaningful. Psycholinguistic theory posits that anaphor comprehension involves reactivating a memory representation of the antecedent. Whereas this implies the involvement of recognition memory or the mnemonic subroutines by which people distinguish old from new, the neural processes for reference resolution are largely unknown. Here, we report time-frequency analysis of four EEG experiments to reveal the increased coupling of functional neural systems associated with referentially coherent expressions compared with referentially problematic expressions. Despite varying in modality, language, and type of referential expression, all experiments showed larger gamma-band power for referentially coherent expressions compared with referentially problematic expressions. Beamformer analysis in high-density Experiment 4 localized the gamma-band increase to posterior parietal cortex around 400-600 msec after anaphor onset and to frontotemporal cortex around 500-1000 msec. We argue that the observed gamma-band power increases reflect successful referential binding and resolution, which links incoming information to antecedents through an interaction between the brain's recognition memory networks and frontotemporal language network. We integrate these findings with previous results from patient and neuroimaging studies, and we outline a nascent corticohippocampal theory of reference.

It is also unclear to what extent changes in cortical oscillations contribute to the pathophysiology of neglect, or its recovery. Utilizing EEG-NFB, we sought to causally manipulate alpha oscillations in 5 right-hemisphere stroke patients in order to explore their role in visuospatial neglect. Patients trained to reduce alpha oscillations from their right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) for 20 minutes daily, over 6 days. Patients demonstrated successful NFB learning between training sessions, denoted by improved regulation of alpha oscillations from rPPC. We observed a significant negative correlation between visuospatial search deficits (i.e., cancellation test) and reestablishment of spontaneous alpha-rhythm dynamic range (i.e., its amplitude variability). Our findings support the use of NFB as a tool for investigating neuroplastic recovery after stroke and suggest reinstatement of intact parietal alpha oscillations as a promising target for reversing attentional deficits. Specifically, we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of EEG-NFB in neglect patients and provide evidence that targeting alpha amplitude variability might constitute a valuable marker for clinical symptoms and self-regulation.

EEG-EEG phase synchronization indices in alpha and beta frequency bands were calculated for the pre- and postfatigue elbow extension contractions. The phase synchronization index in the beta frequency band was found significantly increased between EEG of FC3-C3. The increased phase synchronization index may reflect an enhanced intracortical communication or integration of the signals between contralateral motor cortices with antagonist muscle prefatigue, which may be related to the central modulation so as to compensate for the antagonist muscle prefatigue-induced joint instability.

Infraslow Electroencephalographic and Dynamic Resting State Network Activity	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						DC-EEG; functional connectivity; infraslow; resting state MRI; sliding window correlation		A number of studies have linked the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in traditional frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma), but the relationship between BOLD and its direct frequency correlates in the infraslow band (<1Hz) has been little studied. Previously, work in rodents showed that infraslow local field potentials play a role in functional connectivity, particularly in the dynamic organization of large-scale networks. To examine the relationship between infraslow activity and network dynamics in humans, direct current (DC) EEG and resting state magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired simultaneously. The DC EEG signals were correlated with the BOLD signal in patterns that resembled resting state networks. Subsequent dynamic analysis showed that the correlation between DC EEG and the BOLD signal varied substantially over time, even within individual subjects. The variation in DC EEG appears to reflect the time-varying contribution of different resting state networks. Furthermore, some of the patterns of DC EEG and BOLD correlation are consistent with previous work demonstrating quasiperiodic spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale network activity in resting state. These findings demonstrate that infraslow electrical activity is linked to BOLD fluctuations in humans and that it may provide a basis for large-scale organization comparable to that observed in animal studies.

Neurophysiologic models were created from submarine navigation teams that captured their dynamic responses to changing task environments during required simulation training. The teams were simultaneously rated for resilience by two expert observers using a team process rubric developed and adopted by the U.S. Navy. Symbolic neurodynamic representations of the power levels in the 1-40 Hz EEG frequency bands were created each second from each crew member. These symbols captured the EEG power of each team member in the context of the other team members and also in the context of the task. Quantitative estimates of the changes in the symbol distributions over time were constructed by a moving window of Shannon entropy. Periods of decreased entropy were observed when the distribution of symbols in this window became smaller, for example, when there were prolonged and restricted relationships between the EEG power levels among the crew members, that is, less neurodynamic flexibility. Team resilience was correlated with the neurodynamic entropy levels. The correlation sign, however, depended on the training segment with negative correlations during the presimulation briefing and positive correlations in the scenario training segment. These studies indicate that neurodynamic representations of teams can be generated that bridge the microscales of EEG measurement with macroscales of behavioral ratings. From a training perspective, the results suggest that neurodynamic rigidity (i.e., everybody on the same page) might be beneficial while teams are preparing for the simulation, but during the scenario, increased neurodynamic flexibility contributes more to team resilience.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the main tool used in monitoring and recording brain signals. In this study, we target two detection algorithms that are essential in the diagnosis of epileptic patients. These algorithms detect high frequency oscillations (HFO) and interictal spikes (IIS) in subdural EEG recordings respectively. This paper presents the efforts on porting both EEG processing algorithms into Intel's concept vehicle, the single-chip cloud computer (SCC), a fully programmable 48-core prototype provided with an on-chip network along with advanced power management technologies and support for message-passing. Several experiments are presented for different SCC configurations, where we vary the number of cores used and their respective voltage/frequency settings. The application was decomposed into two execution regions (i.e., load and execution). Results are presented in the form of performance, power, energy, and energy-delay product (EDP) metrics for each experiment.

EEG during motor imagery (MI) provides a non-muscular communication way to control external devices and has advantage of non-invasiveness and high time resolution. However the application is still limited by time-consuming training and poor classification rate with multiple categories etc. We recorded 64-channel scalp EEG from eight healthy subjects during imagery tasks of left, right hand movements and stop. EEG was analyzed in time-frequency distribution and spatial topographies were explored too. A one versus one common spatial pattern was applied to construct feature vector and then linear discriminant analysis was used for the classification. For the purpose of real time control in the future, small training size was used and we got discrimination among three types of motor imagery at the accuracy rate about 90%.

EEG might be an alternative approach to explore the effects of AEDs on the central nervous system. We performed a comparative analysis of background EEG activity during VPA treatment by using standardized, low-resolution, brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) to explore the effect of VPA in patients with CAE. In 17 children with CAE, non-parametric statistical analyses using sLORETA were performed to compare the current density distribution of four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) between the untreated and treated condition. Maximum differences in current density were found in the left inferior frontal gyrus for the delta frequency band (log-F-ratio = -1.390, P > 0.05), the left medial frontal gyrus for the theta frequency band (log-F-ratio = -0.940, P > 0.05), the left inferior frontal gyrus for the alpha frequency band (log-F-ratio = -0.590, P > 0.05), and the left anterior cingulate for the beta frequency band (log-F-ratio = -1.318, P > 0.05). However, none of these differences were significant (threshold log-F-ratio = +/- 1.888, P < 0.01; threshold log-F-ratio = +/- 1.722, P < 0.05). Because EEG background is accepted as normal in CAE, VPA would not be expected to significantly change abnormal thalamocortical oscillations on a normal EEG background. Therefore, our results agree with currently accepted concepts but are not consistent with findings in some previous studies.

This includes taking a step back from the removal of the tACS artifact and thoroughly characterizing the to-be removed artifact. A recent study by Noury et al. (2016) contributed importantly to this endeavour by showing the existence of nonlinear artefacts in the tACS signal as seen by MEG and EEG. Unfortunately however this paper conveys the message that current artifact removal attempts have failed altogether and that-based on these available tools-brain oscillations recorded during tACS cannot be analyzed using MEG and EEG. Here we want to balance this overly pessimistic conclusion: In-depth reanalyses of our own data and phantom-head measurements indicate that nonlinearities can occur, but only when technical limits of the stimulator are reached. As such they are part of the "real" stimulation and not a specific MEG analysis problem. Future tACS studies should consider these technical limits to avoid any nonlinear modulations of the tACS artifact. We conclude that even with current approaches, brain oscillations recorded during tACS can be meaningfully studied in many practical cases.

Physiological signals, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG), have shown promise in revealing the subject's emotion or attention in quality assessment and the correlation of this with media service quality. This paper investigated the relationships between changes in EEG features and subjective quality test scores (i.e. MOS) for High Dynamic Range (HDR) images viewed with a mobile device. Results show that changes in the gamma and beta bands correlated negatively with MOS, whereas positive correlations were observed in the alpha band. Coupling between activities in the delta and beta bands (i.e. positive correlation between power in the fast beta and slow delta frequency bands) is related to anxiety and dissatisfaction. Thus, the results suggest that increases in the degree of coupling are associated with decreases in HDR quality. This also suggests that in the HDR image QoE assessment, human emotions play a significant role. Potentially, these findings may be exploited in objective QoE perception modelling.

Emergence of early alterations in network oscillations and functional connectivity in a tau seeding mouse model of Alzheimer's disease pathology	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; AMYLOID-BETA; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; DEFINED SUBTYPES; EEG; SEIZURES; TAUOPATHY	Synaptic dysfunction and disconnectivity are core deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding clear changes in histopathology and cognitive functioning. Here, the early and late effects of tau pathology induction on functional network connectivity were investigated in P301L mice. Multichannel EEG oscillations were used to compute (1) coherent activity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) CA1-CA3 networks; (2) phase-amplitude cross frequency coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations, which is instrumental in adequate cognitive functioning; (3) information processing as assessed by auditory evoked potentials and oscillations in the passive oddball mismatch negativity-like (MMN) paradigm. At the end, the density of tau aggregation and GABA parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Early weakening of EEG theta oscillations and coherent activity were revealed between the PFC and HPC CA1 and drastic impairments in theta-gamma oscillations PAC from week 2 onwards, while PV+ interneurons count was not altered. Moreover, the tau pathology disrupted the MMN complex amplitude and evoked gamma oscillations to standard and deviant stimuli suggesting altered memory formation and recall. The induction of intracellular tau aggregation by tau seed injection results in early altered connectivity and strong thetagamma oscillations uncoupling, which may be exploited as an early electrophysiological signature of dysfunctional neuronal networks.

The drivers' electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from occipital electrodes. Seven EEG rhythms with different frequency bands as gamma, hbeta, beta, sigma, alpha, theta and delta waves were extracted. They were simultaneously assessed using relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves and grey relational analysis to select one as the fatigue feature. The research results showed that the performance of theta wave was the best one. Therefore, theta wave was used as fatigue feature in the following alarm device. The real-time alarm monitoring system based on the result has been developed, once the threshold was settled by using the data of the first ten minutes driving period. The developed system can detect driver fatigue and give alarm to indicate the onset of fatigue automatically.

Behaviorally, DCD showed poorer VSWM than TD, which coincided with the diminished ability of DCD in modulating neural oscillations. Furthermore, prestimulus oscillatory alpha activity was correlated with VSWM performance. The results suggest that children with DCD might have a reduced ability to encode and recognize new information, and in particular have difficulty in maintaining task-relevant information, resulting in poorer VSWM. This study thus concludes that changes in oscillatory EEG activity reflect some of the problems leading to cognitive deficits in DCD.

Sixteen controls underwent an experimental session where electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded at baseline (resting) and during a motor task (hand movements). GBA was obtained from the EEG data at baseline and during the task. Index of plasticity (IP) was defined as the relationship between GBA at the end of the motor task (GBA(M)_(FIN)), divided by GBA at the beginning of the task (GBA(M)_(INI)) for movements of both hands. There was a significant increase in GBA at the end of the task, compared to the initial GBA for the motor task (GBA(M)_(FIN) > GBA(M)_(INI)). No differences were found at baseline (GBA(B)_(FIN) approximate to GBA(B)_(INI)). Individual IP values had a positive (r = 0.624) and significant correlation with subject's handedness. Due to plastic changes, GBA could indirectly but objectively reveal changes in cerebral activity related to physical training. This method could be used as a future diagnostic test in the follow-up of patients undergoing rehabilitation. It could also have potential applications in the fields of sports medicine.

Electroencephalographic frontal synchrony and caudal asynchrony during painful hand immersion in cold water	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Cold pressor; Power; Synchrony; Connectivity	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; NEUROGENIC PAIN; EEG RESPONSES; TONIC PAIN; PERCEPTION; INTENSITY; FREQUENCY; MATRIX	Recent studies in our laboratory showed that cortical theta oscillations correlate with pain in rodent models. In this study, we sought to validate our pre-clinical data using EEG recordings in humans during immersion of the hand in ice cold water, a moderately noxious stimulus. Power spectral analysis shows that an increase in pain score is associated with an increase in power amplitude within a frequency range of 6-7 Hz at the frontal (Fz) electrode. These results are consistent with our previous pre-clinical animal studies and the clinical literature. We also report a novel reduction in power at the caudal (O1) electrode within a broader 3-30 Hz rand and decreased coherence between Fz and C3, C4 electrodes within the theta (4-8 Hz) and low beta (13-21 Hz) bands, while coherence (an indirect measure of functional connectivity) between Fz and O1 increased within the theta and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands. We argue that pain is associated with EEG frontal synchrony and caudal asynchrony, leading to the disruption of cortico-cortical connectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Low-frequency theta oscillations in the human hippocampus during real-world and virtual navigation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							RAT; STRATEGIES; MOVEMENT; LESIONS; BRAIN; CELLS	Low-Frequency Oscillations (LFO) in the range of 7-9 Hz, or theta rhythm, has been recorded in rodents ambulating in the real world. However, intra-hippocampus EEG recordings during virtual navigation in humans have consistently reported LFO that appear to predominate around 3-4 Hz. Here we report clear evidence of 7-9 Hz rhythmicity in raw intra-hippocampus EEG traces during real as well as virtual movement. Oscillations typically occur at a lower frequency in virtual than real world navigation. This study highlights the possibility that human and rodent hippocampal EEG activity are not as different as previously reported and this difference may arise, in part, due to the lack of actual movement in previous human navigation studies, which were virtual.

Previous researches show that alteration of body image induced by visuo-tactile integration is closely related to the activation of the parietal cortex, a sensory association area. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the parietal area of macaque monkeys is thought to modulate the activation of the parietal cortex and alter the extension of body image during tool-use learning. However, the relationship between parietal cortex activation related to body image alterations and BDNF levels in humans remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between human serum BDNF levels and electroencephalography responses during a visuo-tactile integration task involving a rubber hand. We found cortical oscillatory components in the high frequency (gamma) band in the left parietal cortex. Moreover, the power values of these oscillations were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with serum BDNF levels. Our results suggest that serum BDNF could play a role in modulating the cortical activity in response to visuo-tactile integration processes related to body image alteration in humans.

Moreover the psychological studies have suggested that bilinguals are inherently better at multitasking when compared with the performance of monolinguals owing to the fact that they are used to the act of switching between language conflicts. The present study aims to support this hypothesis with results from neurological study. Twenty healthy, right handed adults were employed while performing task and analysed using Electroencephalography (EEG). When the cognitive load on the brain is increased there is a surge in connectivity among different electrodes to execute the task and hence performance will be deprecated. However, since bilinguals are inherent multi taskers, they did not face much difficulty while performing the task and did not feel loaded. This suggests that the language centres in the brain are involved in cognitive processing and execution of information and concludes the hypothesis that bilinguals outperform monolinguals while multitasking.

Participants read groups of four sentences that could either form coherent stories or were semantically unrelated. For semantically coherent discourses compared to incoherent ones, the N400 was smaller at sentences 2-4, while the visual N1 was larger at the third and fourth sentences. Oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range (13-21Hz) was higher for coherent discourses. We relate the N400 effect to a disruption of local sentence-level semantic processing when sentences are unrelated. Our beta findings can be tentatively related to disruption of local sentence-level syntactic processing, but it cannot be fully ruled out that they are instead (or also) related to disrupted local sentence-level semantic processing. We conclude that manipulating discourse-level semantic coherence does have an effect on oscillatory power related to local sentence-level processing.

Automated epileptic seizure detection using improved correlation-based feature selection with random forest classifier	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Discrete Wavelet transformation (DWT); Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS); Improved Correlation-based Feature Selection (ICFS); Random Forest (RF)	EEG SIGNALS; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; TRANSFORM; SYSTEM	Analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is crucial due to its non-stationary characteristics, which could lead the way to proper detection method for the treatment of patients with neurological abnormalities, especially for epilepsy. The performance of EEG-based epileptic seizure detection relies largely on the quality of selected features from an EEG data that characterize seizure activity. This paper presents a novel analysis method for detecting epileptic seizure from EEG signal using Improved Correlation-based Feature Selection method (ICFS) with Random Forest classifier (RF). The analysis involves, first applying ICFS to select the most prominent features from the time domain, frequency domain, and entropy based features. An ensemble of Random Forest (RF) classifiers is then learned on the selected set of features. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows better performance compared to the conventional Correlation-based method and also outperforms some other state-of-the-art methods of epileptic seizure detection using the same benchmark EEG dataset.

A novel approach for time-frequency localization of scaling functions and design of three-band biorthogonal linear phase wavelet filter banks	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Time-frequency localization; Three-band wavelet filter bank; Discrete Fourier transform; Discrete time Fourier transform; Prolate spheroid sequence	INTRINSIC MODE FUNCTIONS; EEG SIGNALS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE; VANISHING MOMENTS; FOURIER-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; PATTERNS	Design of time-frequency localized filters and functions is a classical subject in the field of signal processing. Gabor's uncertainty principle states that a function cannot be localized in time and frequency domain simultaneously and there exists a nonzero lower bound of 0.25 on the product of its time variance and frequency variance called time-frequency product (TFP). Using arithmetic mean (AM) geometric mean (GM) inequality, product of variances and sum of variances can be related and it can be shown that sum of variances has lower bound of one. In this paper, we compute the frequency variance of the filter from its discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose an equivalent summation based discrete-time uncertainty principle which has the lower bound of one. We evaluate the performance of the proposed discrete-time time-frequency uncertainty measure in multiresolution setting and show that the proposed DFT based concentration measure generate sequences which are even more localized in time and frequency domain than that obtained from the Slepian, Ishii and Furukawa's concentration measures. The proposed design approach provides the flexibility in which the TFP can be made arbitrarily close to the lowest possible lower bound of 0.25 by increasing the length of the filter. In the other proposed approach, the sum of the time variance and frequency variance is used to formulate a positive definite matrix to measure the time-frequency joint localization of a bandlimited function from its samples. We design the time-frequency localized bandlimited low pass scaling and band pass wavelet functions using the eigenvectors of the formulated positive definite matrix. The samples of the time frequency localized bandlimited function are obtained from the eigenvector of the positive definite matrix corresponding to its minimum eigenvalue. The TFP of the designed bandlimited scaling and wavelet functions are close to the lowest possible lower bound of 0.25 and 2.25 respectively. We propose a design method for time-frequency localized three-band biorthogonal linear phase (BOLP) wavelet perfect reconstruction filter bank (PRFB) wherein the free parameters can be optimized for time-frequency localization of the synthesis basis functions for the specified frequency variance of the analysis scaling function. The performance of the designed filter bank is evaluated in classification of seizure and seizure free electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. It is found that the proposed filter bank outperforms other existing methods for the classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Non-stationarity; DWI; k-NN; ANN	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION; BCI; DEVICE	Brain Computer Interface (BCI) offers an effective medium of communication for physically disabled people who are partially or completely locked in their body. It also improves the performance level of healthy people by providing them a new input modality. Recently, BCI systems based on motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been focussed intensively. Extraction and classification of motor imagery features is the most crucial part of motor imagery based BCI system. The biggest challenge in processing motor imagery EEG signals is that these signals are non stationary. In the present investigation, left hand and foot motor imagery tasks have been classified. Time frequency features have been extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWI) to deal with the non stationarity of motor imagery EEG signals. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of data. The efficacy of DWT and LDA has been tested using state vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers. Overall, combining DWI with LDA and ANN achieved a promising average accuracy of 90% in 4.453 sees. The present study may prove to be helpful in developing intelligent devices to help people in locked-in state for controlling some application by imagination of the movement of their body parts.

It is not known how often alpha oscillations are absent in the clinical context, how sensitively alpha frequency and power respond to changes in anesthetic concentration, and what effect increased age has on alpha frequency. Bipolar EEG was recorded frontally from 305 patients undergoing surgery with sevoflurane or desflurane providing general anesthesia. A new method of detecting the presence of alpha oscillations based on the stability of the rate of change of the peak frequency in the alpha range was developed. Linear concentration-response curves were fitted to assess the sensitivity of alpha power and frequency measures to changing levels of anesthesia. Alpha oscillations were seen to be inexplicably absent in around 4% of patients. Maximal alpha power increased with increasing volatile anesthetic concentrations in half of the patients, and decreased in the remaining patients. Alpha frequency decreased with increasing anesthetic concentrations in near to 90% of patients. Increasing age was associated with decreased sensitivity to volatile anesthesia concentrations, and with decreased alpha frequency, which sometimes transitioned into the theta range (5-7 Hz). While peak alpha frequency shows a consistent slowing to increasing volatile concentrations, the peak power of the oscillation does not, suggesting that frequency might be more informative of depth of anesthesia than traditional power based measures during volatile-based anesthesia. The alpha oscillation becomes slower with increasing age, even when the decreased anesthetic needs of older patients were taken into account.

Traveling Slow Oscillations During Sleep: A Marker of Brain Connectivity in Childhood	SLEEP			English	Article						brain maturation; high-density EEG; mcDESPOT; traveling waves; white matter; myelination; neurodevelopment	WHITE-MATTER DEVELOPMENT; LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; MYELIN WATER; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; NETWORK MECHANISMS; WAVE ACTIVITY; IN-VIVO; EEG; MATURATION; SYNCHRONIZATION	Slow oscillations, a defining characteristic of the nonrapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), proliferate across the scalp in highly reproducible patterns. In adults, the propagation of slow oscillations is a recognized fingerprint of brain connectivity and excitability. In this study, we (1) describe for the first time maturational features of sleep slow oscillation propagation in children (n = 23; 2-13 years) using high-density (hd) EEG and (2) examine associations between sleep slow oscillatory propagation characteristics (ie, distance, traveling speed, cortical involvement) and white matter myelin microstructure as measured with multicomponent Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T1 and T2-magnetic resonance imaging (mcDESPOT-MRI). Results showed that with increasing age, slow oscillations propagated across longer distances (average growth of 0.2 cm per year; R(21) = 0.50, p <.05), while traveling speed and cortical involvement (ie, slow oscillation expanse) remained unchanged across childhood. Cortical involvement (R(20) = 0.44) and slow oscillation speed (R(20) = -0.47; both p <.05, corrected for age) were associated with myelin content in the superior longitudinal fascicle, the largest anterior-posterior, intrahemispheric white matter connectivity tract. Furthermore, slow oscillation distance was moderately associated with whole-brain (R(21) = 0.46, p < .05) and interhemispheric myelin content, the latter represented by callosal myelin water fraction (R(21) = 0.54, p < .01, uncorrected). Thus, we demonstrate age-related changes in slow oscillation propagation distance, as well as regional associations between brain activity during sleep and the anatomical connectivity of white matter microstructure. Our findings make an important contribution to knowledge of the brain connectome using a noninvasive and novel analytic approach.

Paper discusses the human brain signal activity linked with specific sleep disorders. Objective of the work is detection and classification of sleep disorders using time-frequency analysis of EEG signal. In this paper, seven different sleep disorders along with one healthy subject have been studied. Large amount of EEG records have been taken from PhysioNet database and analyzed with the help of discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The various statistical measures like maximum value, minimum value, mean value and standard deviation value of DWT sub-bands are used as extracted features for detection of different sleep disorders. For reducing the dimension of extracted features different feature reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are used. The results of these feature reduction techniques are used to classify different sleep disorders using knearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The performance of these classification processes is evaluated by using their accuracy to predict the sleep disorders.

Therefore, it is necessary to identify the occurrence of seizure in an epileptic patient and prevents patients from SUDEP (SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN EPILEPSY). Prediction of epileptic seizure through analysis of scalp EEG signal which is the measure of the brain's electrical activity avoid aggressive situation of epileptic patients during their seizure. This problem is challenging because the brain's electrical activity is composition of numerous classes with overlapping characteristics which vary significantly across patients. It is critical for separating seizure from other types of brain activity. In this proposed method, seizure detection process is implemented in FPGA using two main parameters of EEG signal such as frequency and amplitude which show variations during seizure. Input signal for this work was obtained from CHB-MIT database. The samples of input EEG signals were obtained in the form of. mat file for the duration of 10 seconds. This input file sample values of EEG signal are digitized which is in the form of sign magnitude representation for further processing in FPGA. Signals are used in text file format for Verilog programming. The first bit (MSB bit) represents sign of that particular sample. The frequency of the input signal was found using zero crossing counters. This count value was compared with general brain wave criteria. Similarly for amplitude level analysis, the remaining bits of input sample were compared with validation values. If there is any large deviation in any one of this comparisons found, then the signal abnormality can be predicted. After implementation, 82% of LUTs and 14% of registers were utilized. Timing summary for implementing this proposed work is obtained as 13.568ns.

In this paper, a new technique for automated classification of sleep stages based on iterative filtering of EEG signals is presented. In order to perform sleep stages classification, the EEG signals are decomposed using iterative filtering method. The modes obtained from iterative filtering of EEG signal can be considered as amplitude-modulated and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) components. The discrete energy separation algorithm (DESA) is applied to the modes to determine amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency functions. The extracted amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency functions have been used to compute Poincare' plot descriptors and statistical measures. The Poincare' plot descriptors and statistical measures are applied as input features for different classifiers in order to classify sleep stages. The classifiers namely, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, C4.5 decision tree, and random forest are applied in order to classify the EEG epochs corresponding to various sleep stages. The experimental study has been performed on online available Sleep-EDF database for two-class to six-class classification of sleep stages based on EEG signals. The two-class to six-class classification problems are formulated by taking different combinations of EEG signals corresponding to various sleep stages. The comparison of the results is presented for different multi-class classification problems with the other recently proposed methods. The results show that the proposed method has provided better tenfold crossvalidation classification accuracy than other existing methods.

Anaesthetic drugs affects mainly the central nervous system and therefore Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis during anaesthesia will help to quantify the Depth of Anaesthesia. This paper proposes a novel method to quantify DoA based on the analysis of EEG signals during anaesthesia. Dimensionality of EEG signals are reduced by extracting the time and frequency domain features Approximate entropy (ApEn), Spectral Entropy (SEN) and Wavelet Entropy (WE). A comparison is performed on extracted EEG feature variations during different phases of anaesthesia awake, induction, maintenance and recovery. Validation is succeeded by calculating the correlation of extracted EEG features with BIS index (commercially available DoA monitor). The transition from different phases of anaethesia shows characteristic changes on extracted features than with BIS. Finally, the extracted EEG features are fed to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the different anesthetic states as awake, light anaesthesia, moderate anaesthesia and deep anaesthesia. The classification accuracy attained through training and validation is 90.5 percentage.	[Benzy, V. K.; Jasmin, E. A.; Indiradevi, K.

It is clinical symptoms and/or signs due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the human brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) that measures the electrical activity of the brain generated by the cerebral cortex nerve cells, is the most utilized test to detect the seizure activities by visual scanning of EEG signal recordings. Many techniques and methods have been proposed and developed to help the neurophysiologists to automatically detect the seizure activities with high accuracy. This paper presents a review of EEG features that have been proposed to characterize the epileptic seizure activities for the purpose of EEG seizure detection and classification. The relevant and discriminate features are analyzed, and their performance are also compared and discussed.

The EEG microstate topography is predominantly determined by intracortical sources in the alpha band	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Microstates; LORETA; Source localization; Functional significance; Default mode network	MAP SERIES; STATE; SCHIZOPHRENICS; SEGMENTATION; MODALITIES; COMPONENTS; NETWORKS; NAIVE; MODEL	Human brain electric activity can be measured at high temporal and fairly good spatial resolution via electro-encephalography (EEG). The EEG microstate analysis is an increasingly popular method used to investigate this activity at a millisecond resolution by segmenting it into quasi-stable states of approximately 100 ms duration. These so-called EEG microstates were postulated to represent atoms of thoughts and emotions and can be classified into four classes of topographies A through D, which explain up to 90% of the variance of continuous EEG. The present study investigated whether these topographies are primarily driven by alpha activity originating from the posterior cingulate cortex (all topographies), left and right posterior cortices, and the anterior cingulate cortex (topographies A, B, and C, respectively). We analyzed two 64-channel resting state EEG datasets (N = 61 and N = 78) of healthy participants. Sources of head-surface signals were determined via exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). The Hilbert transformation was applied to identify instantaneous source strength of four EEG frequency bands (delta through beta). These source strength values were averaged for each participant across time periods belonging to a particular microstate. For each dataset, these averages of the different microstate classes were compared for each voxel. Consistent differences across datasets were identified via a conjunction analysis. The intracortical strength and spatial distribution of alpha band activity mainly determined whether a head-surface topography of EEG microstate class A, B, C, or D was induced. EEG microstate class C was characterized by stronger alpha activity compared to all other classes in large portions of the cortex. Class A was associated with stronger left posterior alpha activity than classes B and D, and class B was associated with stronger right posterior alpha activity than A and D. Previous results indicated that EEG microstate dynamics reflect a fundamental mechanism of the human brain that is altered in different mental states in health and disease. They are characterized by systematic transitions between four head-surface topographies, the EEG microstate classes. Our results show that intra-cortical alpha oscillations, which likely reflect decreased cortical excitability, primarily account for the emergence of these classes. We suggest that microstate class dynamics reflect transitions between four global attractor states that are characterized by selective inhibition of specific intra-cortical regions.

A recent cognitive model suggests that frontal-parietal and frontal-temporal interregional connectivity are related to attention/action selection and target-related memory updating during the P3, respectively, but empirical work testing this model is lacking. Other work suggests the importance of theta-and delta-band connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and distributed cortical regions during attention, stimulus detection, and response selection processes, and similar dynamics may underlie P3related network connectivity. The present study evaluated the functional connectivity elicited during a visual task, which combined oddball target and novelty stimuli, in a sample of 231 same-sex twins. It was hypothesized that both target and novel conditions would involve theta frontoparietal connectivity and medial frontal theta power, but that target stimuli would elicit the strongest frontotemporal connectivity. EEG time-frequency analysis revealed greater theta-band frontoparietal connectivity and medial frontal power during both target and novel conditions compared to standards, which may index conflict/uncertainty resolution processes. Theta-band frontotemporal connectivity was maximal during the target condition, potentially reflecting context updating or stimulus-response activation. Delta-band frontocentral-parietal connectivity was also strongest following targets, which may be sensitive to response-related demands. These results suggest the existence of functional networks related to P3 that are differentially engaged by target oddballs and novel distractors. Compared to simple P3 amplitude, network measures may provide a more nuanced view of the neural dynamics during target detection/novelty processing in normative and pathological populations.

Several parameters have been assessed independently to optimize the effects. Our aim was to explore the effects of tPCS using different montages on cortical brain oscillations indexed by power spectrum and interhemispheric coherence in different electroencephalography frequency bands. Twenty healthy individuals were randomized to receive either active tPCS or sham intervention using the following bilateral montages: ear clip (conventional), ear hook, or mastoid placement. Electroencephalography was recorded before and after the electroencephalography intervention to assess tPCS-induced after effects. Our results showed that active tPCS with bimastoid montage increased significantly alpha absolute power (P=0.0166) and low alpha (P=0.0014) in the frontal region, as well as in the low alpha power spectrum in the central (P=0.0001) and parieto-occipital regions (P=0.0068) compared with the other montages. For interhemispheric coherence analysis, the Kruskal-Wallistest showed a significant main effect of group for theta (P=0.0012) in the frontal region, mainly for ear-clip montage. Our findings evidenced that tPCS delivered through different electrode montages exert different effects on cortical brain oscillations and thus have a different neural signature. We discuss the implications of these findings as well as potential clinical explorations of this technique. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

We studied the task-dependency of this process in a combined visual search-change detection experiment. Participants viewed two (nearly) same displays in succession. First time they had to find and remember multiple targets among distractors, so the ongoing task involved memory encoding. Second time they had to determine if a target had changed in orientation, so the ongoing task involved memory retrieval. From multichannel EEG recorded during 200 ms intervals time-locked to fixation onsets, we estimated the functional connectivity using a weighted phase lag index at the frequencies of theta, alpha, and beta bands, and derived global and local measures of the functional connectivity graphs. We found differences between both memory task conditions for several network measures, such as mean path length, radius, diameter, closeness and eccentricity, mainly in the alpha band. Both the local and the global measures indicated that encoding involved a more segregated mode of operation than retrieval. These differences arose immediately after fixation onset and persisted for the entire duration of the lambda complex, an evoked potential commonly associated with early visual perception. We concluded that encoding and retrieval differentially shape network configurations involved in early visual perception, affecting the way the visual input is processed at each fixation. These findings demonstrate that task requirements dynamically control the functional connectivity networks involved in early visual perception.

This may contribute to recurrent seizures and behavioral problems that may be treated by agents that enhance GABAergic transmission by influencing chloride regulation. Case presentation: Here, we used the chloride transporter antagonist bumetanide to treat a female adolescent TSC patient with refractory seizures, sensory hyper-reactivity, and a variety of repetitive and compulsive behaviors. Methods: To evaluate the effect of bumetanide on behavior, auditory sensory processing, and hyperexcitability, we obtained questionnaire data, event-related potentials (ERP), and resting state EEG at baseline, after 3 and 6 months of treatment and after 1 month washout period. Discussion: Six months of treatment resulted in a marked improvement in all relevant behavioral domains, as was substantiated by the parent questionnaires. In addition, resting-state electroencephalography and ERP suggested a favorable effect of bumetanide on hyperexcitability and sensory processing. These findings encourage further studies of bumetanide on neuropsychiatric outcome in TSC.

Recent studies have suggested that this network might communicate through coherence in the alpha band. Here we aimed to test the effect of coherent alpha (8-12 Hz) stimulation on the frontoparietal network. To this end, we recorded behavioral performance and electroencephalography (EEG) data while participants were engaged in a spatial attention task. Furthermore, participants received transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the right frontal and parietal cortex, which oscillated coherently in-phase within the alpha band. Compared to a group of participants that received sham stimulation, we found that coherent frontoparietal alpha band stimulation altered a behavioral spatial attention bias. Neurally, the groups showed hemispheric specific differences in alpha coherence between the frontal and parietal-occipital cortex. These results provide preliminary evidence that alpha coherence in the frontoparietal network might play a role in top-down control of spatial attention.

However, to evaluate dynamic changes of brain functional connectivity, more sophisticated quantitative metrics characterizing temporal evolution of brain topological features are required. To simplify conversion of time-varying brain connectivity to a static graph representation is straightforward but the procedure loses temporal information that could be critical in understanding the brain functions. To extend the understandings of functional segregation and integration to a dynamic fashion, we recommend dynamic graph metrics to characterise temporal changes of topological features of brain networks. This study investigated functional segregation and integration of brain networks over time by dynamic graph metrics derived from EEG signals during an experimental protocol: performance of complex flight simulation tasks with multiple levels of difficulty. We modelled time-varying brain functional connectivity as multi-layer networks, in which each layer models brain connectivity at time window t + Delta t. Dynamic graphmetrics were calculated to quantify temporal and topological properties of the network. Results show that brain networks under the performance of complex tasks reveal a dynamic small-world architecture with a number of frequently connected nodes or hubs, which supports the balance of information segregation and integration in brain over time. The results also show that greater cognitive-workloads caused by more difficult tasks induced a more globally efficient but less clustered dynamic small-world functional network. Our study illustrates that task-related changes of functional brain network segregation and integration can be characterized by dynamic graph metrics.

Here, we utilize an approach that is based on physiological principles underlying recovery of consciousness and show correlation with clinical recovery after acute anoxic brain injury. Methods: A cohort study of 54 patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit after cardiac arrest who underwent standardized bedside behavioral testing (Coma Recovery Scale -Revised[ CRS-R]) during EEG monitoring. Blinded to all clinical variables, artifact-free EEG segments were selected around maximally aroused states and analyzed using a multi-taper method to assess frequency spectral content. EEG spectral features were assessed based on pre-defined categories that are linked to anterior forebrain corticothalamic integrity. Clinical outcomes were determined at the time of hospital discharge, using Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC). Results: Ten patients with ongoing seizures, myogenic artifacts or technical limitations obscuring recognition of underlying cortical dynamic activity were excluded from primary analysis. Of the 44 remaining patients with distinct EEG spectral features, 39 (88%) fit into our predefined categories. In these patients, spectral features corresponding to higher levels of anterior forebrain corticothalamic integrity correlated with higher levels of consciousness and favorable clinical outcome at the time of hospital discharge (P = 0.014). Interpretation: Predicted transitions of neocortical dynamics that indicate functional integrity of anterior forebrain corticothalamic circuitry correlate with clinical outcomes in postcardiac-arrest patients. Our results support a new biologically driven approach toward better understanding of neurological recovery after cardiac arrest.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can depict the state of brain. The EEG signals are ensemble of various neuronal activity recorded from different scalp regions having different characteristics and very low magnitude in microvolts. These factors make human interpretation difficult and time consuming to analyze these signals. Moreover, these highly varying EEG signals are susceptible to inter/intra variability errors. So, a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) can be used to identify the alcoholic and normal subjects accurately. However, these EEG signals exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary properties. Therefore, it needs much effort in deciphering the diagnostic evidence from them using linear time and frequency-domain methods. The nonlinear parameters together with time-frequency/scale domain methods can help to detect tiny changes in these signals. The correntropy is nonlinear indicator which characterizes the dynamic behavior of EEG signals in time-scale domain. In this paper, we present a new way for diagnosis of alcoholism using Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT) based features derived from EEG signals. The feature extraction is performed using TQWT based decomposition and extracted Centered Correntropy (CC) from the forth decomposed detail sub-band. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for feature reduction followed by Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) for classifying normal and alcoholic EEG signals. In order to make sure reliable classification performance, 10-fold cross-validation scheme is adopted. Our proposed system is able to diagnose the alcoholic and normal EEG signals, with an average accuracy of 97.02%, sensitivity of 96.53%, specificity of 97.50% and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9494 for Q-factor (Q) varying between 3 and 8 using Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel function. Also, we have established a novel Alcoholism Risk Index (ARI) using three clinically significant features to discriminate the given classes by means of a single number. This system can be used for automated diagnosis and monitoring of alcoholic subjects to evaluate the effect of treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This system is often assessed with EEG by measuring event-related changes in mu (8-13 Hz) sensorimotor oscillations. However, traditional channel-based analyses of this measure are flawed in that due to volume conduction effects mu and non-mu alpha activity can become mixed. This flaw means it is unclear the extent to which mu activity indexes the mirror system, as opposed to other processes such as attentional demand. As a solution to this problem, we use independent component analysis to separate out the underlying brain processes during a tennis-related action observation and anticipation task. We investigated expertise-related differences in independent component activity. Experienced tennis players (N=18) were significantly more accurate than unexperienced novices (N=21) on the anticipation task. EEG results found significant group differences in both the mu and beta (15-25 Hz) frequency bands in sensorimotor components, with earlier and greater desynchronisation in the experienced tennis players. In particular, only experienced players showed desynchronisation in the high mu (11-13 Hz) band. No group differences were found in posterior alpha components. These results show for the first time that expertise differences during action observation and anticipation are unique to sensorimotor sources, and that no expertise-related differences exist in attention modulated, posterior alpha sources. As such, this paper provides a much cleaner measure of the human mirror system during action observation, and its modulation by motor expertise, than has been possible in previous work.

Interictal ripples nested in epileptiform discharge help to identify the epileptogenic zone in neocortical epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epileptiform discharge; Epileptogenic zone; High-frequency oscillation; Neocortical epilepsy; Ripple	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; RESECTION; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; GENERATION	Objective: This study aimed to identify the subtype of interictal ripples that help delineate the epileptogenic zone in neocortical epilepsy. Methods: Totally 25 patients with focal neocortical epilepsy who had invasive electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation and subsequent surgery were included. They were followed up for at least 2 years. Interictal ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) during slow-wave sleep were identified. Neocortical ripples were defined as type I ripples when they were superimposed on epileptiform discharges, and as type II ripples when they occurred independently. Resection ratio was calculated to present the extent to which the cortical area showing an interictal event or the seizure onset zone (SOZ) was completely removed. Results: Fast ripples and types I and II ripples were found in 8, 19, and 21 patients, respectively. Only the higher resection ratio of interictal fast or type I ripples was correlated to the Engel 1a surgical outcome. Conclusions: Type I ripples could assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone in neocortical epilepsy. Significance: Type I and fast ripples both may be pathological high-frequency oscillations.

Although it has been studied for a long time, the EEG features for kinetic information of motor imagery are still less known. In this paper, we explored EEG patterns of hand force motor imagery. Six subjects participated in this study, who were required to imagine clenching their hands with two different levels of force during the experiment. Time-frequency analyses showed a significant decrease of EEG power at alpha and beta band when subjects performed the motor imagery task, compared to the rest state. Furthermore, the power decrease of the high force imagery was significantly larger than that of the low force imagery. Support vector machines were used to classify the three different EEG patterns ( rest vs. high force vs. low force) and achieved an accuracy of 71% on average. It suggests that the force level of motor imagery plays a critical role in the patterns of event-related desynchronization, and could be used to control BCIs.

EEG Characteristics in Cooled and Rewarmed Periods in Post-cardiac Arrest Therapeutic Hypothermia Patients	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cardiac arrest; Therapeutic hypothermia; cvEEG; Interictal epileptiform discharges; Prognosis	TARGETED TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT; POSTANOXIC COMA; CONTINUOUS ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; 36-DEGREES-C; 33-DEGREES-C; SURVIVORS; TRIAL	Purpose: Continuous video EEG is a tool to assess brain function in injuries, including cardiac arrest (CA). In post-CA therapeutic hypothermia (TH) studies, some EEG features are linked to poor prognosis, but the evolvement of EEG characteristics during two temperature phases and its significance is unclear. We systematically analyzed EEG characteristics in cooled and rewarmed phases of post-CA therapeutic hypothermia patients and investigated their correlation to patient outcome. Methods: This is a retrospective study of EEG analyses, from a single academic center, of 20 patients who underwent CA and therapeutic hypothermia. For each patient, three 30-minute EEG segments in cooled and rewarmed phases were analyzed for continuity, frequency, interictal epileptiform discharges, and seizures. Mortality at the time of discharge was used as outcome. Results: Rewarming was associated with the emergence of interictal epileptiform discharges, 2.6 times as likely compared with the cooled period (P = 0.03), and was not affected by systemic factors. Continuity, frequency, and discrete seizures were unaffected by temperature and did not show variance within each temperature phase. There was a trend toward the emergence of interictal epileptiform discharges upon rewarming and mortality, but it was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Increased interictal epileptiform discharges with rewarming in post-CA therapeutic hypothermia patients may suggest poor prognosis, but a larger scale prospective study is needed.

In specific, use of classification algorithms to highly multivariate non-stationary recordings like EEG is a challenging and promising task. This study investigated two substantial novelty of the topics, (1) Distinction between meditation (Kriya Yoga) and non-meditation state allied EEG, (2) Characterization of the underlying mechanism of cognitive process that is associated with meditation using topographical analysis. The topographic wavelet coherence based brain connectivity between two different groups is shown. Two groups of data, one with 23 meditators (meditator group) and other with ten non-meditators (controlled group) are analyzed. The spatial distribution between two groups can be well distinguished by the topographical approach. The quantification has been done by the colour intensity embedded in the topographical plots. The wavelet coherence is found to be a different parameter to represent the distinctiveness between two groups. The time-frequency quantification regarding wavelet coherence spectrum is shown the unique patterns among meditators and non-meditators. Thus time-frequency based wavelet coherence has found to be an unusual brain pattern in the distinction between meditators and non-meditators.

When this physiological status is dynamic, traditional HRV indices calculated frompower spectrum do not resolve the dynamic situation due to the issue of nonstationarity. Clinical anesthesia is a typically dynamic situation that calls for time-varying HRV analysis. Concentration of frequency and time (ConceFT) is a nonlinear time-frequency (TF) analysis generalizing the multitaper technique and the synchrosqueezing transform. The result is a sharp TF representation capturing the dynamics inside HRV. Companion indices of the commonly applied HRV indices, including time-varying low-frequency power (tvLF), time-varying high-frequency power, and time-varying low-high ratio, are considered as measures of noxious stimulation. Methods: To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed indices, we apply these indices to study two different types of noxious stimulation, the endotracheal intubation and surgical skin incision, under general anesthesia. The performance was compared with traditional HRV indices, the heart rate reading, and indices from electroencephalography. Results: The results indicate that the tvLF index performs best and outperforms not only the traditional HRV index, but also the commonly used heart rate reading. Conclusion: With the help of ConceFT, the proposed HRV indices are potential to provide a better quantification of the dynamic change of the autonomic nerve system. Significance: Our proposed scheme of time-varying HRV analysis could contribute to the clinical assessment of analgesia under general anesthesia.

Neurophysiologic Correlates of Headache Pain in Subjects With Major Depressive Disorder	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						headache; depression; electroencephalography; cordance; alpha asymmetry	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE; SUICIDAL IDEATION; PRECIPITATING FACTORS; AGGRAVATING FACTORS; CEREBRAL PERFUSION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; ALPHA-RHYTHM	Background. Headache pain is often comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) and is associated with greater symptom burden, disability, and suicidality. The biological correlates of headache pain in MDD, however, remain obscure. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between brain oscillatory activity and headache pain in MDD subjects. Methods. A total of 64 subjects with MDD who were free of psychoactive medications were evaluated for severity of headache pain in the past week. Brain function was assessed using resting-state quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). We derived cordance in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency bands at each electrode, and examined correlations with headache pain in regions of interest while controlling for depression severity. Frontal and posterior asymmetry in alpha power was calculated in regions of interest. Results. Headache pain severity was associated with depression severity (r = 0.447, P < .001). In bilateral frontal and right posterior regions, alpha cordance was significantly associated with headache intensity, including when controlling for depression severity. The direction of the correlation was positive anteriorly and negative posteriorly. Frontal left dominant alpha asymmetry correlated with severity of headache but not depression symptoms. Conclusion. Alterations in brain oscillations identified by alpha cordance and alpha asymmetry may be associated with the pathophysiology of headache pain in depression. These findings should be prospectively confirmed.

Detection of epileptic seizure onset on collected multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) has attracted lots of attention recently. Deep learning is a promising method to analyze large-scale unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a multi-view deep learning model to capture brain abnormality from multi-channel epileptic EEG signals for seizure detection. Specifically, we first generate EEG spectrograms using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to represent the time-frequency information after signal segmentation. Second, we adopt stacked sparse denoising autoencoders (SSDA) to unsupervisedly learn multiple features by considering both intra and inter correlation of EEG channels, denoted as intra-channel and cross-channel features, respectively. Third, we add an SSDA-based channel selection procedure using proposed response rate to reduce the dimension of intra-channel feature. Finally, we concatenate the learned multi-features and apply a fully-connected SSDA model with softmax classifier to jointly learn the cross-patient seizure detector in a supervised fashion. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we carry out experiments on a real world benchmark EEG dataset and compare it with six baselines. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning model is able to extract latent features with meaningful interpretation, and hence is effective in detecting epileptic seizure.

A Portable Platform to Collect and Review Behavioral Data Simultaneously with Neurophysiological Signals	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn				This paper presents a portable platform to collect and review behavioral data simultaneously with neurophysiological signals. The whole system is comprised of four parts: a sensor data acquisition interface, a socket server for real-time data streaming, a Simulink system for real-time processing and an offline data review and analysis toolbox. A low-cost microcontroller is used to acquire data from external sensors such as accelerometer and hand dynamometer. The microcontroller transfers the data either directly through USB or wirelessly through a bluetooth module to a data server written in C++ for MS Windows OS. The data server also interfaces with the digital glove and captures HD video from webcam. The acquired sensor data are streamed under User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to other applications such as Simulink/Matlab for real-time analysis and recording. Neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG) and local field potential (LFP) recordings can be collected simultaneously in Simulink and fused with behavioral data. In addition, we developed a customized Matlab Graphical User Interface (GUI) software to review, annotate and analyze the data offline.

However, impacts common in biological systems such as, noise, multiple signal generators, or filtering by transport function, result in multimodal scaling that cannot be reliably assessed by standard analytical tools that assume unimodal scaling. Here, we present two methods to identify breakpoints or crossovers in multimodal multifractal scaling functions. These methods incorporate the robust iterative fitting approach of the focus-basedmultifractal formalism(FMF). The first approach (moment-wise scaling range adaptivity) allows for a breakpoint-based adaptive treatment that analyzes segregated scale-invariant ranges. The second method (scaling function decomposition method, SFD) is a crossover-based design aimed at decomposing signal constituents from multimodal scaling functions resulting from signal addition or co-sampling, such as, contamination by uncorrelated fractals. We demonstrated that these methods could handle multimodal, mono-or multifractal, and exact or empirical signals alike. Their precision was numerically characterized on ideal signals, and a robust performance was demonstrated on exemplary empirical signals capturing resting-state brain dynamics by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), electroencephalography (EEG), and blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI-BOLD). The NIRS and fMRI-BOLD low-frequency fluctuations were dominated by amultifractal component over an underlying biologically relevant random noise, thus forming a bimodal signal. The crossover between the EEG signal components was found at the boundary between the d and " bands, suggesting an independent generator for the multifractal d rhythm. The robust implementation of the SFD method should be regarded as essential in the seamless processing of large volumes of bimodal fMRI-BOLD imaging data for the topology of multifractal metrics free of the masking effect of the underlying random noise.

As a first step toward developing such a method, we aimed to reconstruct the imagery of rhythm, which is one element of music. It has been reported that a periodic electroencephalogram (EEG) response is elicited while a human imagines a binary or ternary meter on a musical beat. However, it is not clear whether or not brain activity synchronizes with fully imagined beat and meter without auditory stimuli. To investigate neural entrainment to imagined rhythm during auditory imagery of beat and meter, we recorded EEG while nine participants (eight males and one female) imagined three types of rhythm without auditory stimuli but with visual timing, and then we analyzed the amplitude spectra of the EEG. We also recorded EEG while the participants only gazed at the visual timing as a control condition to confirm the visual effect. Furthermore, we derived features of the EEG using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and conducted an experiment to individually classify the three types of imagined rhythm from the EEG. The results showed that classification accuracies exceeded the chance level in all participants. These results suggest that auditory imagery of meter elicits a periodic EEG response that changes at the imagined beat and meter frequency even in the fully imagined conditions. This study represents the first step toward the realization of a method for reconstructing the imagined music from brain activity.

Evolution of motor function during the first months after stroke is stereotypically bifurcated, consisting of either recovery to about 70% of maximum possible improvement (proportional recovery, PROP") or in little to no improvement ("poor recovery, POOR"). There is currently no evidence that any rehabilitation treatment will prevent POOR and favor PROP. Objective. To perform a longitudinal and multimodal assessment of functional and structural changes in brain organization associated with PROP. Methods. Fugl-Meyer Assessments of the upper extremity and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) were obtained from 63 patients, diffusion tensor imaging from 46 patients, at 2 and 4 weeks (T0) and at 3 months (T1) after stroke onset. Results. We confirmed the presence of 2 distinct recovery patterns (PROP and POOR) in our sample. At T0, PROP patients had greater integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) and greater EEG functional connectivity (FC) between the affected hemisphere and rest of the brain, in particular between the ventral premotor and the primary motor cortex. POOR patients suffered from degradation of corticocortical and corticofugal fiber tracts in the affected hemisphere between T0 and T1, which was not observed in PROP patients. Better initial CST integrity correlated with greater initial global FC, which was in turn associated with less white matter degradation between T0 and T1. Conclusions. These findings suggest links between initial CST integrity, systems-level cortical network plasticity, reduction of white matter atrophy, and clinical motor recovery after stroke. This identifies candidate treatment targets.

Selection of optimal frequency bands of the electroencephalogram signal in eye-brain-computer interface	XII INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS 2016, (INTELS 2016)	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems (INTELS)	OCT 05-07, 2016	Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, RUSSIA	Minist Educ & Sci Russian Federat	Peoples Friendship Univ Russia	eye-brain-computer; hybrid interface; recognition of patterns		An eye-brain-computer interface (EBCI) is a hybrid system that combines properties of eye tracking systems and brain-computer interfaces, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG). In the hybrid interface the object of interest on a screen is determined by tracking the user's gaze direction. At the same time, the EEG signal is used to detect the user's intent to give a command. This article discusses the recognition of EEG patterns that correspond to spontaneous and control gaze fixations. We propose to extract the most informative features of the EEG signal by selecting optimal frequency bands of the signal. The method is based on solving one-criterion optimization task, in which variable parameters are the boundaries of frequency bands, and the quality of the class separation acts as an objective function. To find optimal values of variable parameters we suggest using the particle swarm optimization. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method on EEG recordings obtained at the Kurchatov Complex of NBICS Technologies for users working with a hybrid interface. It is shown that for all users our method improves classification accuracy in comparison with other methods of feature extraction. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Functionally different intrinsic alpha oscillations are found throughout the cortex. Yet it remains unclear whether tACS is capable of specifically modulating the somatosensory mu-rhythm in amplitude. Objectives: We used tACS to modulate mu-alpha oscillations in amplitude. When compared to sham stimulation we expected a modulation of mu-alpha oscillations but not visual alpha oscillations by tACS. Methods: Individual mu-alpha frequencies were determined in 25 participants. Subsequently, blocks of tACS with individual mu-alpha frequency and sham stimulation were applied over primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded before and after either stimulation or sham. Modulations of mu-alpha and, for control, visual alpha amplitudes were then compared between tACS and sham. Results: Somatosensory mu-alpha oscillations decreased in amplitude after tACS was applied at participants' individual mu-alpha frequency. No changes in amplitude were observed for sham stimulation. Furthermore, visual alpha oscillations were not affected by tACS or sham, respectively. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the capability of tACS to specifically modulate the targeted somatosensory mu-rhythm when the tACS frequency is tuned to the individual endogenous rhythm and applied over somatosensory areas. Our results are in contrast to previously reported amplitude increases of visual alpha oscillations induced by tACS applied over visual cortex. Our results may point to a specific interaction between our stimulation protocol and the functional architecture of the somatosensory system.

Conventional power analyses of electroencephalographic (EEG) and computational assessments of network dynamics have described an earlier synchronization of the centrofrontal areas rhythms and a spread of synchronizing signals from associative prefrontal to posterior areas. Here, we assess how "small world" characteristics of the brain networks, as reflected in the EEG rhythms, are modified in the wakefulness-sleep transition comparing the pre- and post-sleep onset epochs. The results show that sleep onset is characterized by a less ordered brain network (as reflected by the higher value of small world) in the sigma band for the frontal lobes indicating stronger connectivity, and a more ordered brain network in the low frequency delta and theta bands indicating disconnection on the remaining brain areas. Our results depict the timing and topography of the specific mechanisms for the maintenance of functional connectivity of frontal brain regions at the sleep onset, also providing a possible explanation for the prevalence of the frontal-to-posterior information flow directionality previously observed after sleep onset.

We aimed to identify ictal EEG patterns that represent the epileptogenic zone by using subdural electrodes placed over the MRI-visible FCD lesion. Methods: We selected seven patients with frontal lobe epilepsy caused by pathologically proven FCD type IIb who underwent preoperative intracranial EEG evaluation with subdural electrodes followed by resection surgery with seizure-free outcome. The characteristics of ictal EEG patterns, interictal/ictal high-frequency oscillations, and ictal direct current shifts from intracranial electrodes placed over the MRI-visible lesion were analyzed. Results: Two seizure-onset patterns (low voltage fast activity and fast spike activity) were identified. Low voltage fast activity was seen in all patients with a lateral frontal lesion, and it was always preceded by preictal spikes. Fast spike activity occurred only in patients with a mesial frontal lesion. Interictal/ ictal high-frequency oscillations and ictal direct current shifts were seen in all patients. Conclusions: The epileptogenic zone of frontal FCD type IIb may be characterized by EEG seizure-onset patterns consisting of low voltage fast activity and fast spike activity accompanied by ictal high-frequency oscillations and ictal direct current shifts. Further study is needed to determine whether other seizure-onset patterns exist in patients with FCD type IIb.

Modulation of Task Demands Suggests That Semantic Processing Interferes With the Formation of Episodic Associations	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						episodic; semantic; free recall; electroencephalography	HIGH-FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; FREE-RECALL; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY	Although episodic and semantic memory share overlapping neural mechanisms, it remains unclear how our pre-existing semantic associations modulate the formation of new, episodic associations. When freely recalling recently studied words, people rely on both episodic and semantic associations, shown through temporal and semantic clustering of responses. We asked whether orienting participants toward semantic associations interferes with or facilitates the formation of episodic associations. We compared electro-encephalographic (EEG) activity recorded during the encoding of subsequently recalled words that were either temporally or semantically clustered. Participants studied words with or without a concurrent semantic orienting task. We identified a neural signature of successful episodic association formation whereby high-frequency EEG activity (HFA, 44-100 Hz) overlying left prefrontal regions increased for subsequently temporally clustered words, but only for those words studied without a concurrent semantic orienting task. To confirm that this disruption in the formation of episodic associations was driven by increased semantic processing, we measured the neural correlates of subsequent semantic clustering. We found that HFA increased for subsequently semantically clustered words only for lists with a concurrent semantic orienting task. This dissociation suggests that increased semantic processing of studied items interferes with the neural processes that support the formation of novel episodic associations.

Performance Comparison of IST and Multi Scale Principal Component Analysis in the EEG Signal Processing	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING METHODOLOGIES AND COMMUNICATION (ICCMC)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC)	JUL 18-19, 2017	Surya Engn Coll, INDIA	IEEE	Surya Engn Coll	EEG; EOG; Wavelets; Denoising; Thresholding; PCA; Multi scale PCA(MSPCA); Ocular artifacts and Wavelet transform; Iterative Soft Thresholding	ARTIFACTS	The removal of Ocular Artifacts (OA) in Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is one of the key challenges in the analysis of brain recordings. Brain activity produces electroencephalogram signals, which consists of some of vital signs of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, tumor cerebrovascular lesions and the problems associated with the trauma. These signals can be acquired by placing the electrodes on the scalp at specified positions and exists in order of 1-5 mu v, whose frequency range is DC-64 Hz. Acquisition of these signals mainly suffers from different unwanted signals (artifacts or noise) resulting in less signal information for identification. In this paper, two algorithms are proposed namely, Multi Scale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA) and Iterative Soft Thresholding (IST) using wavelets in removing the Ocular Artifacts (OA) present in the EEG signals. This paper discusses not only the performance comparison of two algorithms on statistical parameters of EEG signals such as Signal to Noise Ratio, (SNR), SNRI or Noise Figure (NF) and Absolute Average Error (AAE) but also estimated the run time of each algorithm i.e., computational time of each algorithm.

Proper opening of the blood-brain barrier is crucial for the treatment, yet there are no means available for its real-time monitoring. The intact blood-brain barrier maintains a mV-level electrical potential difference between blood and brain tissue, giving rise to a measurable electrical signal at the scalp. Therefore, we used direct-current electroencephalography ( DC-EEG) to characterize the spatiotemporal behavior of scalp-recorded slow electrical signals during blood-brain barrier opening. Nine anesthetized patients receiving chemotherapy were monitored continuously during 47 blood-brain barrier openings induced by carotid or vertebral artery mannitol infusion. Left or right carotid artery mannitol infusion generated a strongly lateralized DC-EEG response that began with a 2 min negative shift of up to 2000 mu V followed by a positive shift lasting up to 20 min above the infused carotid artery territory, whereas contralateral responses were of opposite polarity. Vertebral artery mannitol infusion gave rise to a minimally lateralized and more uniformly distributed slow negative response with a posterior-frontal gradient. Simultaneously performed near-infrared spectroscopy detected a multiphasic response beginning with mannitol-bolus induced dilution of blood and ending in a prolonged increase in the oxy/deoxyhemoglobin ratio. The pronounced DC-EEG shifts are readily accounted for by opening and sealing of the blood-brain barrier. These data show that DC-EEG is a promising real-time monitoring tool for bloodbrain barrier disruption augmented drug delivery.

J	Ravan, M				Ravan, Maryam			Investigating the correlation between short-term effectiveness of VNS Therapy in reducing the severity of seizures and long-term responsiveness	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Vagus nerve stimulation therapy; EEG; Feature extraction; Seizure severity evaluation; Long term responsiveness	VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; ICTAL TACHYCARDIA; VAGAL-STIMULATION; EEG; BRAIN; PREDICTORS	VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation) Therapy is an adjunctive therapy for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The primary metric used to assess response to any treatment for epilepsy is seizure frequency reduction as measured using seizure diaries. In addition to seizure frequency, reduction in seizure severity is clinically meaningful to patients and can be measured objectively. Analysis of electro-encephalographic (EEG) signals has revealed that seizures are accompanied by spatial synchronization of EEG electrodes that may persist for several minutes after the seizure. A quantitative feature was obtained from EEG data around ictal events collected during a 3-5 day epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) visit prior to VNS implantation and following one month after VNS implant. This feature was obtained from 15 patients who underwent implantation of the closed-loop AspireSR (R) VNS Therapy System. We used this feature to first evaluate if automated delivery of VNS at the time of seizure onset reduces the severity of seizures in patients by reducing EEG spatial synchronization. We then explored the correlation between the effectiveness of VNS in reducing the severity of seizures and long-term (12 month follow-up) responsiveness using clinical metrics of seizure frequency reduction. Results of application of this methodology to 103 pre-VNS and 102 post-VNS seizures revealed that automatic delivery of VNS Therapy reduces ictal spatial synchronization (EEG-based quantitative feature) in patients who responded (>= 50% reduction in seizure frequency) to VNS Therapy. This feature may be used as potential biomarker for predicting long-term response to VNS Therapy.

Correlative evidence has revealed the anatomical and electrophysiological players in the working memory network, but understanding of the effective role of their connectivity remains elusive. Objective: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study we aimed to identify the causal role of theta phase connectivity in visual-spatial working memory. Methods: The frontoparietal network was over-or de-synchronized in the anterior-posterior direction by multi-electrode, 6Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Results: A decrease in memory performance and increase in reaction time was caused by frontoparietal intrahemispheric desynchronization. According to the diffusion drift model, this originated in a lower signal-to-noise ratio, known as the drift rate index, in the memory system. The EEG analysis revealed a corresponding decrease in phase connectivity between prefrontal and parietal areas after tACS-driven desynchronization. The over-synchronization did not result in any changes in either the behavioral or electrophysiological levels in healthy participants. Conclusion: Taken together, we demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating multi-site large-scale networks in humans, and the disruptive effect of frontoparietal desynchronization on theta phase connectivity and visual-spatial working memory.

In schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (BD), these oscillations are markedly reduced, in terms of amplitude and frequency. However, it still remains unclear whether these abnormalities can be modulated over time, or if they can be still observed after treatment. Here, we employed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with EEG to assess the frontal oscillatory activity in eighteen BD patients before/after antidepressant treatments (sleep deprivation and light therapy), relative to nine healthy controls. In order to detect dominant frequencies, event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) were computed for each TMS/EEG session in all participants, using wavelet decomposition. The natural frequency at which the cortical circuit oscillates was calculated as the frequency value with the largest power across 300 ms post-stimulus time interval. Severity of depression markedly decreased after treatment with 12 patients achieving response and nine patients achieving remission. TMS/EEG resulted in a significant activation of the beta/gamma band response (2150 Hz) in healthy controls. In patients, the main frequencies of premotor EEG responses to TMS did not significantly change before/after treatment and were always significantly lower than those of controls (11-27 Hz) and comparable in patients achieving remission and in those not responding to treatment. These results suggest that the reduction of natural frequencies is a trait marker of BD, independent from the clinical status of the patients. The present findings shed light on the neurobiological underpinning of severe psychiatric disorders and demonstrate that TMS/EEG represents a unique tool to develop biomarkers in psychiatry.

Among the alternative methods, multivariate synchronization index (MSI) is a potential one to achieve robust performance for SSVEP-based BCI. This study further presents an extension to MSI (termed as EMSI) for frequency recognition, which leverage the method of time delay embedding. The new method incorporates the first-order time delayed version of the EEG data during calculation the synchronization index. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing it with the standard MSI on the actual SSVEP datasets collected from eleven subjects. The experimental results indicate that the EMSI significantly outperforms the MSI at four time windows. It suggests that the EMSI is a promising methodology for frequency recognition and could further improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCI system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Twenty MO patients and twenty healthy volunteers (HVs) underwent an electroencephalographic (EEG) recording during electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. We used the functional source separation algorithm to extract four functionally constrained nodes (brainstem, thalamus, primary sensory radial, and primary sensory motor tangential parietal sources) along the somatosensory pathway. Two digital filters (1-400 Hz and 450-750 Hz) were applied in order to extract low-(LFO) and high-frequency (HFO) oscillatory activity from the broadband signal. Results: Compared to HVs, patients presented significantly lower brainstem (BS) and thalamic (Th) HFO activation bilaterally. No difference between the two cortical HFO as well as in LFO peak activations between the two groups was seen. The age of onset of the headache was positively correlated with HFO power in the right brainstem and thalamus. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for complex dysfunction of brainstem and thalamocortical networks under the control of genetic factors that might act by modulating the severity of migraine phenotype.

But, in the present study, the approach of constructing functional connectivity is often biased by the choice of the threshold. Besides, more attention was paid to the number and length of links in brain networks, and the clustering partitioning of nodes was unclear. Therefore, minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis and the hierarchical clustering were first used for the depression disease in this study. Resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) sources were assessed from 15 healthy and 23 major depressive subjects. Then the coherence, MST, and the hierarchical clustering were obtained. In the theta band, coherence analysis showed that the EEG coherence of the MDD patients was significantly higher than that of the healthy controls especially in the left temporal region. The MST results indicated the higher leaf fraction in the depressed group. Compared with the normal group, the major depressive patients lost clustering in frontal regions. Our findings suggested that there was a stronger brain interaction in the MDD group and a left-right functional imbalance in the frontal regions for MDD controls.

Sleep Neurophysiological Dynamics Through the Lens of Multitaper Spectral Analysis	PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; PIG THALAMIC NEURONS; HUMAN REM-SLEEP; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; DROWSINESS PERIOD; EEG; RHYTHM; SPINDLES	During sleep, cortical and subcortical structures within the brain engage in highly structured oscillatory dynamics that can be observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The ability to accurately describe changes in sleep state from these oscillations has thus been a major goal of sleep medicine. While numerous studies over the past 50 years have shown sleep to be a continuous, multifocal, dynamic process, long-standing clinical practice categorizes sleep EEG into discrete stages through visual inspection of 30-s epochs. By representing sleep as a coarsely discretized progression of stages, vital neurophysiological information on the dynamic interplay between sleep and arousal is lost. However, by using principled timefrequency spectral analysis methods, the rich dynamics of the sleep EEG are immediately visible-elegantly depicted and quantified at time scales ranging from a full night down to individual microevents. In this paper, we review the neurophysiology of sleep through this lens of dynamic spectral analysis. We begin by reviewing spectral estimation techniques traditionally used in sleep EEG analysis and introduce multitaper spectral analysis, a method that makes EEG spectral estimates clearer and more accurate than traditional approaches. Through the lens of the multitaper spectrogram, we review the oscillations and mechanisms underlying the traditional sleep stages. In doing so, we will demonstrate how multitaper spectral analysis makes the oscillatory structure of traditional sleep states instantaneously visible, closely paralleling the traditional hypnogram, but with a richness of information that suggests novel insights into the neural mechanisms of sleep, as well as novel clinical and research applications.

Seizure pattern-specific epileptic epoch detection in patients with intellectual disability	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Seizure detection; Seizure patterns; Classifiers; Feature importance; Intellectual disability	DETECTION ALGORITHM; MENTAL-RETARDATION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; SYNCHRONIZATION; DEFINITIONS; COMPLEXITY; PREDICTION; CHILDREN	Electroencephalogram (EEG) features are crucial for the seizure detection performance. Traditional algorithms are designed for a population with normal brain development. However, for patients with an intellectual disability the seizure detection performance is still largely unknown. In addition, distinct EEG activities/patterns occur during the evolution of seizure events. However, few studies distinguished what EEG activities contribute to accurate seizure detections. To evaluate the effect of different seizure patterns on the seizure detection, we start from the four predefined seizure patterns: wave, fast spike, spike-wave complex, and seizure-related EMG artifacts. A wide range of promising EEG features in the time, frequency, time frequency, and spatio-temporal domains, as well as synchronization-based features were extracted to characterize these patterns. The performance of seizure detection was evaluated in an epoch-based way. EEG recordings of 615 h from 29 epilepsy patients with intellectual disability were used in this study for validation. Results show that the seizure patterns of wave, and seizure-related EMG were easier to detect than the fast spike, spike-wave patterns, with sensitivities of 0.76, 0.74, 0.42, and 0.51, respectively (when specificity approximately equal to 1). We achieved the overall epoch-based detection performance with sensitivity of 68%, positive predictive value (PPV) 81%, and average duration of false detection 0.76 s per hour. Feature importance analysis indicated that the classification performance of traditional EEG features can be improved when combined with our newly-proposed features from the spatio-temporal domain and the synchronization-based methods.

Selective Entrainment of Theta Oscillations in the Dorsal Stream Causally Enhances Auditory Working Memory Performance	NEURON			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; ALPHA FREQUENCY; BRAIN; EEG; CORTEX; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION	The implication of the dorsal stream in manipulating auditory information in working memory has been recently established. However, the oscillatory dynamics within this network and its causal relationship with behavior remain undefined. Using simultaneous MEG/ EEG, we show that theta oscillations in the dorsal stream predict participants' manipulation abilities during memory retention in a task requiring the comparison of two patterns differing in temporal order. We investigated the causal relationship between brain oscillations and behavior by applying thetarhythmic TMS combined with EEG over the MEGidentified target (left intraparietal sulcus) during the silent interval between the two stimuli. Rhythmic TMS entrained theta oscillation and boosted participants' accuracy. TMS-induced oscillatory entrainment scaled with behavioral enhancement, and both gains varied with participants' baseline abilities. These effects were not seen for a melody-comparison control task and were not observed for arrhythmic TMS. These data establish theta activity in the dorsal stream as causally related to memory manipulation.

AUD is considered a serious health issue which may hamper physical health and social life of a patient if not detected and treated timely. The screening of AUD patients using physiological characteristics is very difficult task for the doctors. Therefore, brain electroencephalograms (EEGs) signal analysis is popularly used to accurately detect the AUD disorder (or the person is alcoholic or normal). Manual analyses of EEG signals are complicated and time-consuming as it is recorded in microvolt (mu v). Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is used by a neurologist to analyze the EEG signals from their frequency sub-bands. The EEG signals recording obtained from the subject are nonlinear and unstable with respect to time. In this paper, support vector machine techniques are used with nonlinear parametric signals in time frequency domain on features extracted from EEG signals. The features are extracted with the help of continuous wavelet transform, Tuned Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is used for decomposition of the signals. The decomposed subband, Centered Correntropy (CC) features are extracted and used to find out the minute changes in the nonlinear signal with lag time delay, which is very similar to the autocorrelation of the signal. Then these features are reduced by applying principal component analysis (PCA), which is then passed to least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) for classification between alcoholic and normal EEG signals. Training of the data is done with ten-fold cross-validation to increase the accuracy. Our proposed work is with three different types of kernel functions like linear, RBF and Polynomial kernel. Comparing the result, we found that the RBF kernel gives the highest performance having accuracy is 97.06%, sensitivity is 97.45% specificity is 97.666%, and Matthews's correlation coefficient is 0.94 by varying the Q parameter of wavelet transform from 3 to 8	[Anuragi, Arti] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Sisodia, Dilip Singh] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India		Anuragi, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India.

We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess the sensorimotor cortex activation during illusory kinesthesia by vibratory tendon stimulation in patients who were in pain. We investigated the relationship between the sensorimotor cortex and postoperative pain to clarify the analgesia mechanism. Patients who had undergone distal radius fracture surgery were studied. A hand massager provided the vibration stimulus for the illusory kinesthesia on the extensor digitorum muscle at the nonaffected hand's wrist joint on 7 consecutive days starting 1 day after surgery. The main outcomes were pain intensity and EEG activity. EEG activity was recorded during illusory kinesthesia. We also analyzed the high a rhythm (10-12 Hz) event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization. The pain intensity was reduced. Attenuation of the high a wave was observed in the bilateral sensorimotor cortex (C3ch, C4ch) areas during illusory kinesthesia. A significant negative correlation was also observed in the C3 and the C4 of event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization% values and the variation of pain amelioration at rest. Activation of the sensorimotor cortex by illusory kinesthesia might have influenced parts of the descending pain-inhibitory system. The postoperative pain in the patients might have been alleviated by the descending pain-inhibitory system. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

To endorse prosthetic organs there is a need to establish a strong relation between predetermined movements and BCI feedback, therefore, a robust technique for motor intention detection is required. The prosthetic muscles performance and efficiency depend critically upon the techniques being used to detect intended motion from EEG. Maximum efficiency for BCI applications can be achieved using detection techniques with limited latency and high accuracy. In this study, a robust motion detection technique using movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs) with improved accuracy is proposed. MRCP is extracted from multi-channel scalp EEG and it is a sluggish brain negative potential that is existing in EEG about 2 sec earlier than the execution and imagination of signaled and self-paced intended actions. Muscle movement can be detected by the earlier negative segment of MRCPs. In this technique after implementation of spatial filtering, short time Fourier transform (STFT) followed by threshold is used to detect movement intention using MRCPs from EEG. STFT provide us time frequency analysis of EEG signals and by it we detect a particular frequency associated with MRCPs and its corresponding time gives us information about the instant of muscle movement intention occurring. On the basis of statistical analysis, the proposed technique's results are better than the classic match filter technique. The True Positive Rate (TPR) of proposed algorithm is 75.81% and False Positive rate (FPR) is 45.46 % while TPR is 61.95% and FPR is 35.38% in the match filter technique. These statistical parameters exhibit the superiority of proposed algorithm. The results proved that the suggested algorithm detect the intention of motor movement more accurately. Due to its high performance it can be used in a closed-loop BCI systems for different applications.

The increment of these organic acids inhibits glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and consequently lowers the caminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis. Untreated patients exhibit severe neurologic deficits during development, including epilepsy, especially following an acute encephalopathy outbreak. In this work, we evaluated the role of the GABAergic system on epileptogenesis in GA-I using the Gcdh(-/-) mice exposed to a high lysine diet (Gcdh(-/-)-Lys). Methods: Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), seizure susceptibility, and changes in brain oscillations were evaluated by video-electroencephalography (EEG). Cortical GABAergic synaptic transmission was evaluated using electrophysiologic and neurochemical approaches. Results: SRS were observed in 72% of Gcdh(-/-)-Lys mice, whereas no seizures were detected in age-matched controls (Gcdh(+/+) or Gcdh(-/-) receiving normal diet). The severity and number of PTZ-induced seizures were higher in Gcdh(-/-)-Lys mice. EEG spectral analysis showed a significant decrease in theta and gamma oscillations and predominant delta waves in Gcdh(-/-)-Lys mice, associated with increased EEG left index. Analysis of cortical synaptosomes revealed a significantly increased percentage of glutamate release and decreased GABA release in Gcdh(-/-)-Lys mice that were associated with a decrease in cortical GAD immunocontent and activity and confirmed by reduced frequency of inhibitory events in cortical pyramidal cells. Significance: Using an experimental model with a phenotype similar to that of GA-I in humans-the Gcdh(-/-) mice under high lysine diet (Gcdh(-/-)-Lys)-we provide evidence that a reduction in cortical inhibition of Gcdh(-/-)-Lys mice, probably induced by GAD dysfunction, leads to hyperexcitability and increased slow oscillations associated with neurologic abnormalities in GA-I. Our findings offer a new perspective on the pathophysiology of brain damage in GA-I.

ALCOHOLIC INDEX USING NON-LINEAR FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM DIFFERENT FREQUENCY BANDS	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; alcohol; entropies; non-linear methods; SVM classifier; Bhattacharyya ranking	COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; FATTY LIVER-DISEASE; AUTOMATED DETECTION; RECURRENCE PLOTS; EMPIRICAL MODE; EEG SIGNALS; ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Alcoholism is a complex condition that mainly disturbs the neuronal networks in Central Nervous System (CNS). This disorder not only disturbs the brain, but also affects the behavior, emotions, and cognitive judgements. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable tool to examine the neuropsychiatric disorders like alcoholism. The EEG is a well-established modality to diagnose the electrical activity produced by the populations of neurons in cerebral cortex. However, EEG signals are non-linear in nature; hence very challenging to interpret the valuable information from them using linear methods. Thus, using non-linear methods to analyze EEG signals can be beneficial in order to predict the brain signals condition. This paper presents a computer-aided diagnostic method for the detection of alcoholic EEG signals from normal by employing the non-linear techniques. First, the EEG signals are subjected to six levels of Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) to obtain seven wavebands (delta (d), theta (t), lower alpha (la), upper alpha (ua), lower beta (lb), upper beta (ub), lower gamma (1g)). From each wavebands (activity bands), 19 non-linear features such as Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) (R-y(x)), Approximate Entropy (E-ap(x)), Energy (Omega(x)), Fractal Dimension (FD) (F-D(x)), Permutation Entropy (E-p(x)), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (alpha(x)(y)), Hurst Exponent (E-H(x)), Largest Lyapunov Exponent (E-LLE(x)), Sample Entropy (E-s(x)), Shannon's Entropy (E-sh(x)), Renyi's entropy (E-T(x)), Tsalli's entropy (E-ts(x)), Fuzzy entropy (E-j(x)), Wavelet entropy (E-w(x)), Kolmogorov Sinai entropy (E-ks(x)), Modified Multiscale Entropy (E-mmsy(x)), Hjorth's parameters (activity (S-a(x)), mobility (H-m(x)), and complexity (H-c(x))) are extracted. The extracted features are then ranked using Bhattacharyya, Entropy, Fuzzy entropy-based Max-Relevancy and Min-Redundancy (mRMR), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), t-test, and Wilcoxon. These ranked features are given to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM classifier with radial basis function (RBF) achieved 95.41% accuracy, 93.33% sensitivity and 97.50% specificity using four non-linear features ranked by Wilcoxon method. In addition, an integrated index called Alcoholic Index (AL COHOLI) is developed using highly ranked two features for identification of normal and alcoholic EEG signals using a single number. This system is rapid, efficient, and inexpensive and can be employed as an EEG analysis assisting system by clinicians in the detection of alcoholism. In addition, the proposed system can be used in rehabilitation centers to evaluate person with alcoholism over time and observe the outcome of treatment provided for reducing or reversing the impact of the condition on the brain.

For this study, 92 adult males were categorized into three groups: IGD (n = 30), AUD (n = 30), and HC (n = 32). The IGD group exhibited increased intrahemispheric gamma (30-40 Hz) coherence compared to the AUD and HC groups regardless of psychological features (e.g., depression, anxiety, and impulsivity) and right fronto-central gamma coherence positively predicted the scores of the Internet addiction test in all groups. In contrast, the AUD group showed marginal tendency of increased intrahemispheric theta (4-8 Hz) coherence relative to the HC group and this was dependent on the psychological features. The present findings indicate that patients with IGD and AUD exhibit different neurophysiological patterns of brain connectivity and that an increase in the fast phasic synchrony of gamma coherence might be a core neurophysiological feature of IGD.

There is a recent attraction to wireless EEG devices as they are cheaper and easily available in the market. The devices use dry electrodes and send signals via wireless, thus are easier to use and more comfortable to wear. Such technology can be used in psychology, neuro therapy, and for real-time patients monitoring. One such off-the-shelf device is Neurosky MindWave headset. In this paper, it is utilized to measure electrical activity of user's forehead. The collected data in voltage is wirelessly transmitted to a computer for further processing. After processing the EEG data, signals were categorized to requisite frequency bands of brain waves for feature extraction. The collected signal can be used to differentiate between meditation and attention activities. Examples of attention activities are reading, problem solving, etc. Meditation level obtained directly from MindWave was not observed to be a good feature for classification of different brain activities. The two psycho-physiological states, attention and meditation are of interest to psychological therapies. This paper shows that meditation and other activities related to attention can be detected and differentiated better with frequency and frequencytime analysis of the EEG signal. The EEG signal recorded from MindWave can be effectively used to plot visual feedback of brain activity.	[Anwar, Dilnashin; Naik, Vinayak; Gupta, Anubha] IIIT Delhi, New Delhi, India; [Sharma, S.

Evidence suggests that positive AM retrieval tasks are correlated with synchronisation of frontal Theta rhythms (4-8Hz). The present study has developed the Electroencephalography (EEG) based Neurofeedback (NF) protocols to promote voluntary elevation or up-regulation of positive AM retrieval related Theta rhythms over F3, Fz, F4 electrode sites (10-20 System). The protocols were evaluated with a human participant in 10-day NF training. It observed that the average amplitude of observed Theta rhythms in each NF regulation block gradually increased over days of training and most was prominent at Fz electrode site. Furthermore, a larger peak at 6Hz was present in the spectrum of the observed Theta with later trial day suggesting up-regulation of Frontal Midline Theta (FmT) rhythms.	[Shoji, Y.; Patti, C.

In particular, the Hilbert-based Empirical Mode Decomposition and Wavelet-based Discrete Wavelet Transform have found applications in emotional state analysis. In this study, a model of emotional elicitation is proposed in which the classification is made by using the features of the wavelet coefficients obtained after applying the Discrete Wavelet Transform to IMFs achieved by using Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition. Accordingly, EEG data available in the DEAP database were classified as low / high for valence, activation, and dominance dimensions, and 4 different classifiers were used in the classification phase. The best ratios of valence, activation and dominance were obtained ideally 70.1%, 58.8%, 60.3% respectively.

In contrast, measures of coherence and dynamic source synchronization allow for the study of functional and effective connectivity, respectively. Yet, these measures have rarely been assessed in parallel in the context of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and furthermore it has not been examined if they are related to risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as amyloid deposition and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (ApoE) allele occurrence. Here, we investigated functional and directed connectivities with Renormalized Partial Directed Coherence (RPDC) in 17 healthy controls (HC) and 17 participants with MCI. Participants underwent ApoE-genotyping and Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) to assess amyloid deposition. We observed lower spectral source power in MCI in the alpha and beta bands. Coherence was stronger in HC than MCI across different neuronal sources in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. The directed coherence analysis indicated lower information flow between fronto-temporal (including the hippocampus) sources and unidirectional connectivity in MCI. In MCI, alpha and beta RPDC showed an inverse correlation to age and gender; global amyloid deposition was inversely correlated to alpha coherence, RPDC and beta and gamma coherence. Furthermore, the ApoE status was negatively correlated to alpha coherence and RPDC, beta RPDC and gamma coherence. A classification analysis of cognitive state revealed the highest accuracy using EEG power, coherence and RPDC as input. For this small but statistically robust (Bayesian power analyses) sample, our results suggest that resting EEG related functional and directed connectivities are sensitive to the cognitive state and are linked to ApoE and amyloid burden.

Directed Motor-Auditory EEG Connectivity Is Modulated by Music Tempo	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						coherence analysis; imaginary coherency; electroencephalography (EEG); music tempo; brain connectivity analysis	SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BEAT PERCEPTION; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; BRAIN; RESPONSES; RHYTHM; PREMOTOR; AREAS; OSCILLATIONS	Beat perception is fundamental to how we experience music, and yet the mechanism behind this spontaneous building of the internal beat representation is largely unknown. Existing findings support links between the tempo (speed) of the beat and enhancement of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity at tempo-related frequencies, but there are no studies looking at how tempo may affect the underlying long-range interactions between EEG activity at different electrodes. The present study investigates these long-range interactions using EEG activity recorded from 21 volunteers listening to music stimuli played at 4 different tempi (50, 100, 150 and 200 beats per minute). The music stimuli consisted of piano excerpts designed to convey the emotion of "peacefulness". Noise stimuli with an identical acoustic content to the music excerpts were also presented for comparison purposes. The brain activity interactions were characterized with the imaginary part of coherence (iCOH) in the frequency range 1.5-18 Hz (delta, theta, alpha and lower beta) between all pairs of EEG electrodes for the four tempi and the music/noise conditions, as well as a baseline resting state (RS) condition obtained at the start of the experimental task. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (a) there was an ongoing long-range interaction in the RS engaging fronto-posterior areas; (b) this interaction was maintained in both music and noise, but its strength and directionality were modulated as a result of acoustic stimulation; (c) the topological patterns of iCOH were similar for music, noise and RS, however statistically significant differences in strength and direction of iCOH were identified; and (d) tempo had an effect on the direction and strength of motor-auditory interactions. Our findings are in line with existing literature and illustrate a part of the mechanism by which musical stimuli with different tempi can entrain changes in cortical activity.

Based on wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and SE-isomap, an adaptive feature extraction method is proposed in this paper. The MI-EEG is preprocessed to determine a more effective time interval through average power spectrum analysis. WPD is then applied to the selected segment of MI-EEG, and the subject-based optimal wavelet packets (OWPs) with top mean variance difference are obtained autonomously. The OWP coefficients are further used to calculate the time-frequency features statistically and acquire the nonlinear manifold structure features, as well as the explicit nonlinear mapping, through SE-isomap. The hybrid features are obtained in a serial fusion way and evaluated by a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The extensive experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset, and the experiment results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed method yields relatively higher classification accuracy and computation efficiency simultaneously compared with the commonly-used linear and nonlinear approaches.

The aim of this work is to understand the neural network responsible for touch processing during a prolonged tactile stimulation, delivered by means of a mechatronic platform by passively sliding a ridged surface under the subject's fingertip while recording the electroencephalogram (EEG). We then analyzed: (i) the temporal features of the Somatosensory Evoked Potentials and their topographical distribution bilaterally across the cortex; (ii) the associated temporal modulation of the EEG frequency bands. Long-latency SEP were identified with the following physiological sequence P100-N140-P240. P100 and N140 were bilateral potentials with higher amplitude in the contralateral hemisphere and with delayed latency in the ipsilateral side. Moreover, we found a late potential elicited around 200 ms after the stimulation was stopped, which likely encoded the end of tactile input. The analysis of cortical oscillations indicated an initial increase in the power of theta band (4-7 Hz) for 500 ms after the stimulus onset followed a decrease in the power of the alpha band (8-15 Hz) that lasted for the remainder of stimulation. This decrease was prominent in the somatosensory cortex and equally distributed in both contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. This study shows that prolonged stimulation of the human fingertip engages the cortex in widespread bilateral processing of tactile information, with different modulations of the theta and alpha bands across time.

The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in functional connectivity of the parietal frontal network resulting from nitrous oxide induced sedation, and to determine the neural correlates of cognitive impairment during consciousness transition states. Electroencephalography was acquired from healthy adult patients who underwent nitrous oxide inhalation to induce cognitive impairment, and was analyzed using Granger causality (GC). Periods of awake, sedation and recovery for GC between frontal and parietal areas in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma and total frequency bands were obtained. The Friedman test with post hoc analysis was conducted for GC values of each period for comparison. As a sedated state was induced by nitrous oxide inhalation, power in the low frequency band showed increased activity in frontal regions that was reversed with discontinuation of nitrous oxide. Feedback and feedforward connections analyzed in spectral GC were changed differently in accordance with EEG frequency bands in the sedated state by nitrous oxide administration. Calculated spectral GC of the theta, alpha, and beta frequency regions in the parietal to frontal direction was significantly decreased in the sedated state while spectral GC in the reverse direction did not show significant change. Frontal parietal functional connectivity is significantly affected by nitrous oxide inhalation. Significantly decreased parietal to frontal interaction may induce a sedated state.

Considered as one of the most common neurological disorders, Epilepsy affects people of all ages. Around 65 Million people across the world suffer from this disease. Manual diagnosis of EEG signals of long duration may be a source of error as well as a cumbersome task. Hence automation in Seizure Detection is essential for diagnosis of Epilepsy. Therefore, in this paper, an expert system for EEG signal classification has been proposed. The proposed system aims at classifying EEG signals into 3 classes- Normal, inter-ictal (EEG recordings of epileptic patients during non-seizure period) and ictal (EEG recordings of epileptic patients during seizure period). Discrete Wavelet Transform, a technique for analyzing signals in time-frequency domain has been quite successful in this respect for extraction of features from EEG signals. Further Envelope Analysis has been used on the DWT coefficients before feature extraction in order to elevate the performance of the system. Finally several Machine Learning techniques (E.g: MLP and Random Forest) have been used for classification of the EEG signals and the relative accuracy of these Classifiers with regard to this problem have been compared. The results from the experiments show that the Random Forest Classifier is the most effective classifier for this problem delivering an accuracy of 98%. The data that has been used for this work has been taken from the publicly available EEG database of University of Bonn which presents 100 single channel EEG records for each of the above classes.

Theta and high-beta networks for feedback processing: a simultaneous EEG-fMRI study in healthy male subjects	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; BARRATT IMPULSIVENESS SCALE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PREDICTION ERRORS; REWARD; DOPAMINE; RESPONSES; BRAIN	The reward system is important in assessing outcomes to guide behavior. To achieve these purposes, its core components interact with several brain areas involved in cognitive and emotional processing. A key mechanism suggested to subserve these interactions is oscillatory activity, with a prominent role of theta and high-beta oscillations. The present study used single-trial coupling of simultaneously recorded electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging data to investigate networks associated with oscillatory responses to feedback during a two-choice gambling task in healthy male participants (n = 19). Differential associations of theta and high-beta oscillations with non-overlapping brain networks were observed: Increase of high-beta power in response to positive feedback was associated with activations in a largely subcortical network encompassing core areas of the reward network. In contrast, theta-band power increase upon loss was associated with activations in a frontoparietal network that included the anterior cingulate cortex. Trait impulsivity correlated significantly with activations in areas of the theta-associated network. Our results suggest that positive and negative feedback is processed by separate brain networks associated with different cognitive functions. Communication within these networks is mediated by oscillations of different frequency, possibly reflecting different modes of dopaminergic signaling.

Most of the studies focused on short clips and were designed with specific tasks. This paper investigated the emotional states from electroencephalogram (EEG) activities during music appreciation. An emotion evoked experiment paradigm was designed during music appreciation. The EEG signals were recorded in 15 healthy adults during the entire process of music listening. The band power change (BPC) and higher order crossing (HOC) features were extracted from the EEG signals. A correlation-based feature analysis approach was proposed to find the most relevant features in time, frequency and channel space domains. From the results, this method achieved the average accuracy of 67.2% for the classification of high and low valence in the combination of BPC and HOC features. A deeper understanding of the brain emotional patterns could be helpful in building an intelligent and friendly affective application.

Participants read ambiguous idiom strings embedded in highly predictable, literal, and idiomatic contexts while their EEG was recorded. Control sentences only contained the idiom-final word whose cloze values were as high as in literal and idiomatic contexts. Event-related potentials data showed that differences in the amplitude of a frontal positivity (PNP) emerged at the beginning and at the end of the idiom strings, with the idiomatic context condition associated with more positive voltages. The time frequency analysis of the EEG showed an increase in power of the middle gamma frequency band only in the literal context condition. These findings suggest that sentence revision mechanisms, associated with the frontal PNP, are involved in idiom meaning integration, and that the literal semantic composition of the idiomatic constituents, associated with changes in gamma frequency, is not carried out after idiom recognition.

Non-linear Relationship between BOLD Activation and Amplitude of Beta Oscillations in the Supplementary Motor Area during Rhythmic Finger Tapping and Internal Timing	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; predictive timing; internal time; supplementary motor area (SMA); premotor cortex	TEMPORAL PREDICTION; HUMAN BRAIN; FMRI COREGISTRATION; BEAT PERCEPTION; POWER INCREASES; CORTICAL AREAS; BASAL GANGLIA; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT	Functional imaging studies using BOLD contrasts have consistently reported activation of the supplementary motor area (SMA) both during motor and internal timing tasks. Opposing findings, however, have been shown for the modulation of beta oscillations in the SMA. While movement suppresses beta oscillations in the SMA, motor and non-motor tasks that rely on internal timing increase the amplitude of beta oscillations in the SMA. These independent observations suggest that the relationship between beta oscillations and BOLD activation is more complex than previously thought. Here we set out to investigate this rapport by examining beta oscillations in the SMA during movement with varying degrees of internal timing demands. In a simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment, 20 healthy right-handed subjects performed an auditory-paced finger-tapping task. Internal timing was operationalized by including conditions with taps on every fourth auditory beat, which necessitates generation of a slow internal rhythm, while tapping to every auditory beat reflected simple auditory-motor synchronization. In the SMA, BOLD activity increased and power in both the low and the high beta band decreased expectedly during each condition compared to baseline. Internal timing was associated with a reduced desynchronization of low beta oscillations compared to conditions without internal timing demands. In parallel with this relative beta power increase, internal timing activated the SMA more strongly in terms of BOLD. This documents a task-dependent non-linear relationship between BOLD and beta-oscillations in the SMA. We discuss different roles of beta synchronization and desynchronization in active processing within the same cortical region.

Executive attention deficits after traumatic brain injury reflect impaired recruitment of resources	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						EEG; Traumatic brain injury; Attention network test; Executive attention; Frontal lobe; Medial frontal theta	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; STATISTICAL IMAGE-ANALYSIS; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; AROUSAL REGULATION; REACTION-TIME	Deficits in attention are a common and devastating consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI), leading to functional impairments, rehabilitation barriers, and long-term disability. While such deficits are well documented, little is known about their underlying pathophysiology hindering development of effective and targeted interventions. Here we evaluate the integrity of brain systems specific to attentional functions using quantitative assessments of electroencephalography recorded during performance of the Attention Network Test (ANT), a behavioral paradigm that separates alerting, orienting, and executive components of attention. We studied 13 patients, at least 6months post-TBI with cognitive impairments, and 24 control subjects. Based on performance on the ANT, TBI subjects showed selective impairment in executive attention. In TBI subjects, principal component analysis combined with spectral analysis of the EEG after target appearance extracted a pattern of increased frontal midline theta power (2.5-7.5 Hz) and suppression of frontal beta power ( 12.5-22.5 Hz). Individual expression of this pattern correlated (r=-0.67, p < 0.001) with executive attention impairment. The grading of this pattern of spatiotemporal dynamics with executive attention deficits reflects impaired recruitment of anterior forebrain resources following TBI; specifically, deafferentation and variable disfacilitation of medial frontal neuronal populations is proposed as the basis of our findings.

Materials & methods A total of 78 volunteers participated. The study was composed of three parts where olfactory stimuli were presented using a custom-built olfactometer. Part I was designed to optimize the stimulus as well as the recording conditions. In part II EEG-power changes after olfactory/trigeminal stimulation were compared between healthy participants and patients with olfactory impairment. In Part III the test-retest reliability of the method was evaluated in healthy subjects. Results Part I indicated that the most effective paradigm for stimulus presentation was cued stimulus, with an interstimulus interval of 18-20s at a stimulus duration of 1000ms with each stimulus quality presented 60 times in blocks of 20 stimuli each. In Part II we found that central processing of olfactory stimuli analyzed by TFA differed significantly between healthy controls and patients even when controlling for age. It was possible to reliably distinguish patients with olfactory impairment from healthy individuals at a high degree of accuracy (healthy controls vs anosmic patients: sensitivity 75%; specificity 89%). In addition we could show a good test-retest reliability of TFA of chemosensory induced EEG-power changes in Part III. Conclusions Central processing of olfactory stimuli analyzed by TFA reliably distinguishes patients with olfactory impairment from healthy individuals at a high degree of accuracy.

It was shown that motor imagery involving distal muscles, e.g. finger movements, results in contralateral ERD correlating with increased excitability of the contralateral corticospinal tract (c-CST). Following the rationale that purposefully increasing c-CST excitability might facilitate motor recovery after stroke, ERD recently became an attractive target for brain-computer interface (BCI)-based neurorehabilitation training. It was unclear, however, whether ERD would also reflect excitability of the ipsilateral corticospinal tract (i-CST) that mainly innervates proximal muscles involved in e.g. shoulder movements. Such knowledge would be important to optimize and extend ERD-based BCI neurorehabilitation protocols, e.g. to restore shoulder movements after stroke. Here we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting the ipsilateral primary motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the trapezius muscle. To assess whether ERD reflects excitability of the i-CST, a correlation analysis between between MEP amplitudes and ipsilateral ERD was performed. Methods: Experiment 1 consisted of a motor execution task during which 10 healthy volunteers performed elevations of the shoulder girdle or finger pinching while a 128-channel EEG was recorded. Experiment 2 consisted of a motor imagery task during which 16 healthy volunteers imagined shoulder girdle elevations or finger pinching while an EEG was recorded; the participants simultaneously received randomly timed, single-pulse TMS to the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. The spatial pattern and amplitude of ERD and the amplitude of the agonist muscle's TMS-induced MEPs were analyzed. Results: ERDs occurred bilaterally during both execution and imagery of shoulder girdle elevations, but were lateralized to the contralateral hemisphere during finger pinching. We found that trapezius MEPs increased during motor imagery of shoulder elevations and correlated with ipsilateral ERD amplitudes. Conclusions: Ipsilateral ERD during execution and imagery of shoulder girdle elevations appears to reflect the excitability of uncrossed pathways projecting to the shoulder muscles. As such, ipsilateral ERD could be used for neurofeedback training of shoulder movement, aiming at reanimation of the i-CST.

The proposed model of excitation by low-level microwave radiation bases on the influence of water polarization on hydrogen bonding forces between water molecules, caused by this the enhancement of diffusion and consequences on neurotransmitters transit time and neuron resting potential. Modulated microwave radiation causes periodic alteration of the neurophysiologic parameters and parametric excitation of brain bioelectric oscillations. The experiments to detect logical outcome of the mechanism on physiological level were carried out on 15 human volunteers. The 450-MHz microwave radiation modulated at 7, 40 and 1000 Hz frequencies was applied at the field power density of 0.16 mW/cm(2). A relative change in the EEG power with and without radiation during 10 cycles was used as a quantitative measure. Experimental data demonstrated that modulated at 40 Hz microwave radiation enhanced EEG power in EEG alpha and beta frequency bands. No significant alterations were detected at 7 and 1000 Hz modulation frequencies. These results are in good agreement with the theory of parametric excitation of the brain bioelectric oscillations caused by the periodic alteration of neurophysiologic parameters and support the proposed mechanism. The proposed theoretical framework has been shown to predict the results of experimental study. The suggested mechanism, free of the restrictions related to field strength or time constant, is the first one providing explanation of low-level microwave radiation effects.

However, it is unclear how the strengthened S-R associations are represented and applied in the brain. We investigated with a between-subjects PC paradigm of the Hedge and Marsh task using electroencephalography (EEG). The behavioral results showed the reversal of the conflict effects, suggesting that task-irrelevant S-R associations were strengthened and used to prepare responses. The EEG results revealed the PC-related reversal of the conflict effects in the frontocentral N2 and parietal P3b amplitudes. Time-frequency analyses showed more pronounced PC-related reversal of the conflict effects in theta band (4-8 Hz) activity in frontocentral sites. These results suggest that the strengthened S-R associations due to PC manipulation modulated cognitive control. Importantly, the amplitude of lateralized readiness potential was higher in the high-PC condition than in the low-PC condition, suggesting that the strengthened short-term-memory spatial S-R associations that modulated cognitive control were applied similarly to long-term-memory spatial S-R associations.

The effects of binge drinking, the most common pattern of excessive alcohol consumption during adolescence and youth, on brain activity at rest is still poorly known. In this study, we sought to assess the pattern of resting-state EEG oscillations in college-aged binge drinkers (BDs). Methods: Resting-state brain activity during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions was recorded from 60 channels in 80 first-year undergraduate students (40 controls and 40 BDs). Cortical sources activity of EEG rhythms was estimated using exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA) analysis. Results: EEG-source localization analysis revealed that BDs showed, in comparison with controls, significantly higher intracranial current density in the beta frequency band over the right temporal lobe (parahippocampal and fusiform gyri) during eyes-open resting state as well as higher intracranial current density in the theta band over the bilateral occipital cortex (cuneus and lingual gyrus) during eyes-closed resting condition. Conclusions: These findings are in line with previous results observing increased beta and/or theta power following chronic or heavy alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent subjects and BDs. Increased tonic beta and theta oscillations are suggestive of an augmented cortical excitability and of potential difficulties in the information processing capacity in young BDs. Furthermore, enhanced EEG power in these frequency bands may respond to a neuromaturational delay as a result of excessive alcohol consumption during this critical brain developmental period.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) was utilized to objectively measure memory impairment for memory formation correlates of EEG oscillatory activities. We aimed to construct an object-location memory paradigm and explore EEG signs of it. Two groups of 20 probable mild AD patients and 19 healthy older adults were included in a cross-sectional analysis. All subjects took an object-location memory task. EEG recordings performed during object-location memory tasks were compared between the two groups in the two EEG parameters (spectral parameters and phase synchronization). The memory performance of AD patients was worse than that of healthy elderly adults The power of object-location memory of the AD group was significantly higher than the NC group (healthy elderly adults) in the alpha band in the encoding session, and alpha and theta bands in the retrieval session. The channels-pairs the phase lag index value of object-location memory in the AD group was clearly higher than the NC group in the delta, theta, and alpha bands in encoding sessions and delta and theta bands in retrieval sessions. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the AD patients may use compensation mechanisms to remember the items and episode.

Automated detection of epileptic ripples in MEG using beamformer-based virtual sensors	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						high frequency oscillations; epilepsy; MEG; ripples; beamformer	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SCALP-FAST OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE ONSET ZONES; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; 80-500 HZ; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; SPIKES; EEG; MACROELECTRODES	Objective. In epilepsy, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are expressively linked to the seizure onset zone (SOZ). The detection of HFOs in the noninvasive signals from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is still a challenging task. The aim of this study was to automate the detection of ripples in MEG signals by reducing the high-frequency noise using beamformer-based virtual sensors (VSs) and applying an automatic procedure for exploring the time-frequency content of the detected events. Approach. Two-hundred seconds of MEG signal and simultaneous iEEG were selected from nine patients with refractory epilepsy. A two-stage algorithm was implemented. Firstly, beamforming was applied to the whole head to delimitate the region of interest (ROI) within a coarse grid of MEG-VS. Secondly, a beamformer using a finer grid in the ROI was computed. The automatic detection of ripples was performed using the time-frequency response provided by the Stockwell transform. Performance was evaluated through comparisons with simultaneous iEEG signals. Main results. ROIs were located within the seizure-generating lobes in the nine subjects. Precision and sensitivity values were 79.18% and 68.88%, respectively, by considering iEEG-detected events as benchmarks. A higher number of ripples were detected inside the ROI compared to the same region in the contralateral lobe. Significance. The evaluation of interictal ripples using noninvasive techniques can help in the delimitation of the epileptogenic zone and guide placement of intracranial electrodes. This is the first study that automatically detects ripples in MEG in the time domain located within the clinically expected epileptic area taking into account the time-frequency characteristics of the events through the whole signal spectrum. The algorithm was tested against intracranial recordings, the current gold standard. Further studies should explore this approach to enable the localization of noninvasively recorded HFOs to help during pre-surgical planning and to reduce the need for invasive diagnostics.

We investigate the ability of early QEEG assessment to inform such prediction, using binary logistic regression. Thirty-five patients (12 female, ages 18-87) suffering middle cerebral artery, ischemic stroke were studied. Resting-state EEG was recorded 48-239 h after symptom onset. Relative power for delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands, delta:alpha ratio, and peak alpha frequency were analyzed. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered, where possible, on day of EEG and at median 99 days (range 69-138) poststroke. Eight patients could not complete the baseline MoCA, and four the follow-up MoCA, for varying reasons (most commonly, stroke symptoms). Fifteen patients (48%) had cognitive impairment (MoCA score 25) at follow-up. One QEEG index was able to correctly predict presence/absence of cognitive impairment in 24/31 patients (77.4%), whereas predischarge MoCA did so in 23 patients. This index, relative theta frequency (4-7.5 Hz) power, was computed from only three posterior electrodes over the stroke-affected hemisphere. Its predictive accuracy (three electrodes) was higher than that of any global QEEG measure (averaged over 19 electrodes). These results may signify association between poststroke alpha slowing and cognitive impairment, which may be mediated by attentional (dys)function, which warrants further investigation. Pending further studies, QEEG measure(s)from a few electrodescould inform early prognostication of poststroke cognitive outcomes (and clinical decisions), particularly when cognitive function cannot be adequately assessed (due to symptoms, language, or other issues) or when assessment is equivocal.

J	Antony, JW; Paller, KA				Antony, James W.; Paller, Ken A.			Using Oscillating Sounds to Manipulate Sleep Spindles	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep spindles; oscillations; memory consolidation.	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; THALAMOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL SPINDLES; HUMAN CORTEX; BRAIN; DENSITY; FREQUENCY	Introduction: EEG oscillations known as sleep spindles have been linked with various aspects of cognition, but the specific functions they signal remain controversial. Two types of EEG sleep spindles have been distinguished: slow spindles at 11-13.5 Hz and fast spindles at 13.5-16 Hz. Slow spindles exhibit a frontal scalp topography, whereas fast spindles exhibit a posterior scalp topography and have been preferentially linked with memory consolidation during sleep. To advance understanding beyond that provided from correlative studies of spindles, we aimed to develop a new method to systematically manipulate spindles. Aims and Methods: We presented repeating bursts of oscillating white noise to people during a 90-min afternoon nap. During stage 2 and slow-wave sleep, oscillations were embedded within contiguous 10-s stimulation intervals, each comprising 2 s of white noise amplitude modulated at 12 Hz (targeting slow spindles), 15 Hz (targeting fast spindles), or 50 Hz followed by 8 s of constant white noise. Results: During oscillating stimulation compared to constant stimulation, parietal EEG recordings showed more slow spindles in the 12-Hz condition, more fast spindles in the 15-Hz condition, and no change in the 50-Hz control condition. These effects were topographically selective, and were absent in frontopolar EEG recordings, where slow spindle density was highest. Spindles during stimulation were similar to spontaneous spindles in standard physiological features, including duration and scalp distribution. Conclusions: These results define a new method to selectively and noninvasively manipulate spindles through acoustic resonance, while also providing new evidence for functional distinctions between the 2 types of EEG spindles.

However, in the conventional method, the frequency resolution is low due to the dependence of the short-time Fourier transform on the analysis window length. Therefore, it is not possible to analyze a non-integer multiple signal, as a side-lobe will occur. We verified the precision of non-harmonics analysis, and proposed and attempted to analyze the change and stimulus of SSVEP. We found the frequency resolution to be improved exponentially.

It provides a unified framework for simultaneous assessment of frequency and latency of a coupled time-series. The analysis is demonstrated on resting-state functional MRI data of 34 healthy subjects. Interactions between fMRI time-series are represented by cross-correlation (with time-lag) functions. A general linear model is used on the cross-correlation functions to obtain the frequencies and phase-differences of the original time-series. We define symmetric, antisymmetric and asymmetric cross-correlation functions that correspond respectively to in-phase, 90 degrees out-of-phase and any phase difference between a pair of time-series, where the last two were never introduced before. Seed maps of the motor system were calculated to demonstrate the strength and capabilities of the analysis. Unique types of functional connections, their dominant frequencies and phase-differences have been identified. The relation between phase-differences and time-delays is shown. The phase-differences are speculated to inform transfer-time and/or to reflect a difference in the hemodynamic response between regions that are modulated by neurotransmitters concentration. The analysis can be used with any coupled functions in many disciplines including electrophysiology, EEG or MEG in neuroscience.

In this research, visual search task was chosen to stress subjects, and the brain activity was measured by using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and an electroencephalograph (EEG) was measured. Advantages of using these in combination are that it is relatively simple and less burdensome to the subject and it can be measured from the two viewpoints of neural activity and hemodynamics for the same brain region. As prior research, there are studies investigating the presence of stress by using brain activity, but there are no researches measuring the change in brain activity under continuous stress. The aim of this research is to extract features of active sites of brain function and electroencephalograms in stress accumulation. This research conducted experiments and analysis focusing on the two poles of Fp1 and Fp2 in international 10-20 method. In NIRS, when every time stress was accumulated, the difference was confirmed between right and left in brain activity. In EEG, there was no common feature between data in frequency and phase. From the above, it is possible to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the degree of stress accumulation by combining near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalograph by extracting a feature amount that changes every time stress accumulates in the EEG signal. As future tasks, the number of subjects should be increased. Also, different types of EEG analysis and the number of measurement points should be considered.

The EEG data of signal can be used as a source of analysis for human brain function. The purpose of this study was to design a portable multichannel EEG based on embedded system and ADS1299. The ADS1299 is an analog front-end to be used as an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) to convert analog signal of electrical activity of brain, a filter of electrical signal to reduce the noise on low-frequency band and a data communication to the microcontroller. The system has been tested to capture brain signal within a range of 1-20 Hz using the NETECH EEG simulator 330. The developed system was relatively high accuracy of more than 82.5%. The EEG Instrument has been successfully implemented to acquire the brain signal activity using a PC (Personal Computer) connection for displaying the recorded data. The final result of data acquisition has been processed using OpenBCI GUI (Graphical User Interface) based through real-time process for 8-channel signal acquisition, brain-mapping and power spectral decomposition signal using the standard FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm.

Method Data was collected from 20 AIDS patients receiving anti retroviral treatment for an average duration of five years and 20 healthy individuals matched for age/sex. Participants were presented with auditory stimuli consisting of pure sound tones with 1000 Hz (non-target) and 2000 Hz (target) frequency. Frontal EEG and EDA recordings were taken using a biopotential amplifier system. Results P1, N1, P2, N2 (p<0.001) responses obtained from the frontal region to target stimuli were higher in HIV group; while the P3 response was higher in control group. The latencies of all responses to target stimuli were significantly delayed in HIV group compared to control group. In HIV group, amplitudes of P1, N2 and P3 responses to target stimuli were found to be higher than to non-target stimuli; N1 and P2 responses to non-target stimuli had higher amplitude. Conclusion The findings of this study demonstrate the effects of HIV on both the peripheral (EDA) and central nervous system (EEG). The differences in neuroelectrical activity found between HIV patients and healthy individuals can be concluded to be due to the direct or indirect effects of the virus and antiretroviral medication on neurons. The method of simultaneous monitoring of auditory ERP and EDA may contribute to the detection of subclinical neural deterioration in HIV patients.

J	Poch, C; Carretie, L; Campo, P				Poch, Claudia; Carretie, Luis; Campo, Pablo			A dual mechanism underlying alpha lateralization in attentional orienting to mental representation	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Working memory; Retro-cue; Selective attention; Magnetoencephalography; Oscillations	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; MAINTENANCE; EEG; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION	Numerous electrophysiological findings support the notion that selective attention modulates alpha oscillatory activity. Specifically, alpha enhancement and suppression can be dissociated in time and space. It is now accepted that selective attention operates in either the perceptual or the representational environments. Lateralized alpha activity resulting from directing attention to mental representations, might arise from a transient alpha desynchronization, as recent proposals hypothesized. However, the contribution of enhancement vs suppression, as well as their neural correlates to the lateralized alpha modulation remain unstudied. To investigate these questions, we recorded magnetoencephalography while participants performed a retrospective cueing paradigm. Time-frequency analysis revealed a larger transient alpha desynchronization for the sensors contralateral to the relevant items which originated from the ventral lateral occipital cortex. Additionally, greater ipsilateral alpha enhancement in the medial occipital cortex occurred later and was maintained until probe presentation. Based on these differences we reasoned that the former would reflect the allocation of selective attention to relevant items, while the later might signal the inhibition of the irrelevant external hemifield instead of irrelevant WM items. Altogether, our results suggest that alpha lateralization does not arise from a unitary phenomenon. Dissociated anatomical and temporal alpha activity might be signaling different functional roles.

This condition is commonly found in critically ill patients from intensive care units and constitutes a medical emergency. This paper proposes a method to detect nonconvulsive epileptic seizures (NCES). To perform the NCES detection the electroencephalogram (EEG) is represented as a third order tensor with axes frequency x time x channels using Wavelet or Hilbert-Huang transform. The signatures obtained from the tensor decomposition are used to train five classifiers to separate between the normal and seizure EEG. Classification is performed in two ways: (1) with each signature of the different modes separately, (2) with all signatures assembled. The algorithm is tested on a database containing 139 nonconvulsive seizures. From all performed analysis, Hilbert-Huang Tensors Space and assembled signatures demonstrate to be the best features to classify between seizure and non-seizure EEG.

New Method: We introduced Dynamic Cross-Entropy (DCE) a novel multidimensional complexity measure that quantifies the degree of regularity of EEG signals in selected frequency bands. Time series generated by discrete logistic equations with varying control parameter r are used to test DCE measures. Results: Sliding window DCE analyses are able to reveal specific period doubling bifurcations that lead to chaos. A similar behavior can be observed in seizures triggered by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Sample entropy data show the level of signal complexity in different phases of the ictal Ea. The transition to irregular activity is preceded by the occurrence of cyclic regular behavior. A significant increase of DCE values in successive order from high frequencies in gamma to low frequencies in delta band reveals several phase transitions into less ordered states, possible chaos in the human brain. Comparison with Existing Method: To our knowledge there are no reliable techniques able to reveal the transition to chaos in case of multidimensional times series. In addition, DCE based on sample entropy appears to be robust to EEG artifacts compared to DCE based on Shannon entropy. Conclusions: The applied technique may offer new approaches to better understand nonlinear brain activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dynamic cortical representations of perceptual filling-in for missing acoustic rhythm	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; HEARING ILLUSORY SOUNDS; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; AMPLITUDE-MODULATION; CONTINUITY ILLUSION; NOISE SUPPRESSION; MEG EVIDENCE; EEG POWER	In the phenomenon of perceptual filling-in, missing sensory information can be reconstructed via interpolation or extrapolation from adjacent contextual cues by what is necessarily an endogenous, not yet well understood, neural process. In this investigation, sound stimuli were chosen to allow observation of fixed cortical oscillations driven by contextual (but missing) sensory input, thus entirely reflecting endogenous neural activity. The stimulus employed was a 5 Hz frequency-modulated tone, with brief masker probes (noise bursts) occasionally added. For half the probes, the rhythmic frequency modulation was moreover removed. Listeners reported whether the tone masked by each probe was perceived as being rhythmic or not. Time-frequency analysis of neural responses obtained by magnetoencephalography (MEG) shows that for maskers without the underlying acoustic rhythm, trials where rhythm was nonetheless perceived show higher evoked sustained rhythmic power than trials for which no rhythm was reported. The results support a model in which perceptual filling-in is aided by differential co-modulations of cortical activity at rates directly relevant to human speech communication. We propose that the presence of rhythmically-modulated neural dynamics predicts the subjective experience of a rhythmically modulated sound in real time, even when the perceptual experience is not supported by corresponding sensory data.

The method is a time consuming and error prone as it involves errors due to fatigue in continuous monitoring of nonlinear and nonstationary EEG signals. Out of approximate 1% of the world's epilepsy patients more than 25% cannot be treated correctly due to erroneous diagnosis. The automated seizure detection system can prove efficient by making the process reliable and faster. This paper reviews multi-domain feature extraction and machine learning classification techniques used in automated seizure detection systems. To analyse subtle variations in EEG, signal decomposition algorithms have been used in time, frequency, joint time-frequency, and nonlinear domain. The statistical and entropy parameters are the key features to discern normal from the seizure EEG signals. Machine learning plays a critical role in extracting meaningful information out of the extracted features. The paper also evaluates the performance of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, naive Bayes, Least Square Support Vector Machine, k nearest neighbour, and random forest classifiers using sensitivity, specificity and accuracy metrics. A seizure detection technique is developed by decomposing the EEG signals by means of Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT). To quantify the complexity of the individual multivariate sub-bands of the biomedical signals TQWT proves effective with varied values of Q factor suitable for analyzing signals with oscillatory and non-oscillatory nature. The highest accuracy of 97.3% is obtained using random forest classifier for the combination of spectral, Shannon and Kraskov entropy features. The paper compares the performance of feature extraction and classification techniques for the implemented system. The comparison explores possibility of hardware implementation of real time seizure detection scheme.

Analysis has been done for fourteen patients with epilepsy. Firstly, 26 features are extracted from time domain, frequency domain and power spectrum. The feature set dimensionality has been reduced from 26 to 8 using Principal Component Analysis. Finally, five classifiers have been employed to classify EEG signals into normal, ictal and preictal stages. The classification is performed for patient-specific. We emphasized the importance of the analysis of preictal stage for seizure prediction. According to classification results and ROC analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines have better performances than others. LDA achieved the highest average sensitivity with 88.06% in the preictal stage detection process. The results are very promising and contributing to possible guide for future seizure detection and prediction studies.

Enhancing early consolidation of human episodic memory by theta EEG neurofeedback	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Memory; Consolidation; EEG; Neurofeedback; Theta; Recall	RETRIEVAL; NETWORK; OSCILLATIONS; PLASTICITY; ENGRAM; SLOW; ADHD	Consolidation of newly formed memories is readily disrupted, but can it be enhanced? Given the prominent role of hippocampal theta oscillations in memory formation and retrieval, we hypothesized that upregulating theta power during early stages of consolidation might benefit memory stability and persistence. We used EEG neurofeedback to enable participants to selectively increase theta power in their EEG spectra following episodic memory encoding, while other participants engaged in low beta-focused neurofeedback or passively viewed a neutral nature movie. Free recall assessments immediately following the interventions, 24 h later and 7 d later all indicated benefit to memory of theta neurofeedback, relative to low beta neurofeedback or passive movie viewing control conditions. The degree of benefit to memory was correlated with the extent of theta power modulation, but not with other spectral changes. Theta enhancement may provide optimal conditions for stabilization of new hippocampus-dependent memories.

Forty-three patients were included in this retrospective study. Five to sixteen (median = 12) multilead electrodes were implanted per patient, and, for each patient, a sub-set of between 10 and 32 (median = 22) bipolar derivations was selected for analysis. The leads were classified into the onset leads (OLs), the early propagation leads (EPLs), and the rest of the leads (RLs). The results showed that a significantly different dynamic trend of the out/in ratio (more obvious in the gamma band) distinguishes the OLs from RLs in the 23 patients who were seizure-free not only during the ictal event (significant elevation), but also during the inter-, pre-, late-ictal periods, and especially in the post-ictal (sharp decline) state. However, in the 20 patients who were not-seizure-free, the differences between the OLs and RLs during the post-ictal period were not found in any frequency band.

HALF-WAVE SEGMENT FEATURE EXTRACTION OF EEG SIGNALS OF PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIERS	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Depression; electroencephalogram (EEG); feedforward neural network (FFNN); probabilistic neural network (PNN); relative wavelet energy (RWE); wavelet entropy	SLEEP EEG; NONLINEAR FEATURES; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM; POWER	A detailed understanding of key signal characteristics has enabled the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for feature detection and classification of EEG signals in clinical research. The present study is performed to classify EEG signals of normal and depression patients with wavelet parameters as key input features. The characteristics of depression cannot be made out by visual inspection of EEG records unlike epilepsy which is well characterized by sudden recurrent and transient waveforms. In this study, a comparison is made between the performance of feedforward neural network (FFNN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) while classifying the EEG signals of normal and depression patients. Classification capabilities of both the methods are validated with the EEG recordings from 30 normal controls and 30 depression patients. One-way ANOVA provided a statistical significant difference between the two classes of EEG signals recorded. Preprocessing for feature extraction is done using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The time domain and relative wavelet energy (RWE) features calculated from the sub-bands are given as a set of input to the neural network. Another set of feature used independently for training the network is the wavelet entropy (WE). The FFNN achieved a classification accuracy of 100% and PNN gave an accuracy of 58.75% with time domain and wavelet energy as the input features. With wavelet entropy as the input feature, FFNN further showed 98.75% classification accuracy while PNN gave an accuracy of only 46.5%. The results indicate that FFNN with the given input features is more suitable for the classification of EEG signals with mood changing depressive disorders.

Different Effects of Sleep Deprivation and Torpor on EEG Slow-Wave Characteristics in Djungarian Hamsters	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						Djungarian hamsters; EEG; sleep; slow waves; torpor	EUROPEAN GROUND-SQUIRRELS; BRAIN TEMPERATURE; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; PHODOPUS-SUNGORUS; FIELD POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATION; HOMEOSTASIS; HIBERNATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	It has been shown previously in Djungarian hamsters that the initial electroencephalography (EEG) slow-wave activity (power in the 0.5-4.0Hz band; SWA) in non-rapid eyemovement (NREM) sleep following an episode of daily torpor is consistently enhanced, similar to the SWA increase after sleep deprivation (SD). However, it is unknown whether the networkmechanisms underlying the SWA increase after torpor and SD are similar. EEG slow waves recorded in the neocortex during sleep reflect synchronized transitions between periods of activity and silence among large neuronal populations. We therefore set out to investigate characteristics of individual cortical EEG slow waves recorded during NREM sleep after 4 h SD and during sleep after emergence froman episode of daily torpor in adultmale Djungarian hamsters. We found that during the first hour after both SD and torpor, the SWA increase was associated with an increase in slow-wave incidence and amplitude. However, the slopes of single slow waves during NREMsleep were steeper in the first hour after SD but not after torpor, and, in contrast to sleep after SD, themagnitude of change in slopes after torpor was unrelated to the changes in SWA. Furthermore, slow-wave slopes decreased progressively within the first 2 h after SD, while a progressive increase in slow-wave slopes was apparent during the first 2 h after torpor. The data suggest that prolonged waking and torpor have different effects on cortical network activity underlying slow-wave characteristics, while resulting in a similar homeostatic sleep response of SWA. We suggest that sleep plays an important role in network homeostasis after both waking and torpor, consistent with a recovery function for both states.	[Vyazovskiy, V.

While these studies show the importance of the spectral feature of sleep, their approaches have "Staging" or "Categorizing" process that make the analysis subjective or arbitrary. It is also unsatisfactory that physiological interpretation of the entropies estimated by their methods has not yet been established. In this study, we provide an alternative way to estimate the spectral feature of sleep state, without using sleep staging or categorizing. The method consists of three parts: calculation of the C-2 (the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop strength) time series from sleep electroencephalography (EEG), Fourier transform of the C-2 time series, and estimation of spectral entropy based on the Fourier power spectrum. Correlation analysis between the newly defined spectral entropy (CSE) and the previously defined Walsh spectral entropies (WSEs) shows that correlation between CSE and WSEs are relatively high when the direct current (DC), that is, the zero-frequency component of each spectrum, is excluded. By including the DC component, however, the correlation becomes even negative in some cases. These findings not only confirm the availability of the newly defined spectral entropy based on the cortico-thalamo-cortical model, but also cultivate a better understanding for sleep-state dynamics, especially in terms of "entropy," which tends to be interpreted as an "irregularity" or "complexity" naively.

Linguistic Bias Modulates Interpretation of Speech via Neural Delta-Band Oscillations	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						delta band; electroencephalography; language; neural oscillations; speech comprehension	WORKING-MEMORY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; PROSODIC BOUNDARIES; SENTENCE; ATTACHMENT; RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; IMPLICIT	Language comprehension requires that single words be grouped into syntactic phrases, as words in sentences are too many to memorize individually. In speech, acoustic and syntactic grouping patterns mostly align. However, when ambiguous sentences allow for alternative grouping patterns, comprehenders may form phrases that contradict speech prosody. While delta-band oscillations are known to track prosody, we hypothesized that linguistic grouping bias can modulate the interpretational impact of speech prosody in ambiguous situations, which should surface in delta-band oscillations when grouping patterns chosen by comprehenders differ from those indicated by prosody. In our auditory electroencephalography study, the interpretation of ambiguous sentences depended on whether an identical word was either followed by a prosodic boundary or not, thereby signaling the ending or continuation of the current phrase. Delta-band oscillatory phase at the critical word should reflect whether participants terminate a phrase despite a lack of acoustic boundary cues. Crossing speech prosody with participants' grouping choice, we observed a main effect of grouping choice-independent of prosody. An internal linguistic bias for grouping words into phrases can thus modulate the interpretational impact of speech prosody via delta-band oscillatory phase.

Practical goals of NF systems include treatment of neurological disorders, and even augmentation of normal brain function. Attention deficits are a class of disorders to which NF-based therapy is applicable. Here we review the challenges of NF implementations for the control and treatment of visual attention. These implementations generate close-loop feedback using electroencephalographic (EEG) and other recording methods that sample brain signals related to different aspects of attention. Despite the progress achieved in the studies of neural mechanisms of attention, extraction of information representing attention from brain activity is still a difficult problem because of the presence of other overlapping neural signals. Therefore, it is important that attentional NF systems employ behavioral tasks and computational algorithms that dissociate signals of interest from the interfering signals. Notwithstanding recent advancements in this field, fundamental challenges still exist for the development of efficient clinical applications.

Temporal orienting (TO) characterizes directing attention to a specific moment in time. Previously, studies indicated that these two processes could have opposite effects on early evoked brain activity. The exact time-course and processing stages of both processes are still unknown. In this human electroencephalography study, we investigated the effects of IA and TO on visuo-tactile stimulus processing within one paradigm. IA was manipulated by presenting auditory cues to indicate whether participants should detect visual or tactile targets in visuo-tactile stimuli. TO was manipulated by presenting stimuli block -wise at fixed or variable inter-stimulus intervals. We observed that TO affects evoked activity to visuo-tactile stimuli prior to IA. Moreover, we found that TO reduces the amplitude of early evoked brain activity, whereas IA enhances it. Using beamformer source localization, we observed that IA increases neural responses in sensory areas of the attended modality whereas TO reduces brain activity in widespread cortical areas. Based on these findings we derive an updated working model for the effects of temporal and intersensory attention on early evoked brain activity.

Although frontal-posterior global theta synchronization appears in modality-specific WM, local theta synchronization in frontal regions has been found in modality-independent WM. How frontal theta oscillations separately synchronize with task-relevant sensory brain areas remains an open question. Here, we focused on theta-alpha phase relationships in frontal areas using EEG, and then verified their functional roles with mathematical models. EEG data showed that the relationship between theta (6 Hz) and alpha (12 Hz) phases in the frontal areas was about 1: 2 during both auditory and visual WM, and that the phase distributions between auditory and visual WM were different. Next, we used the differences in phase distributions to construct FitzHugh-Nagumo type mathematical models. The results replicated the modality-specific branching by orthogonally of the trigonometric functions for theta and alpha oscillations. Furthermore, mathematical and experimental results were consistent with regards to the phase relationships and amplitudes observed in frontal and sensory areas. These results indicate the important role that different phase distributions of theta and alpha oscillations have in modality-specific dissociation in the brain.

This contrasts with the principle of simple and controlled designs in experimental and behavioral economics. We use a frequency domain variant of the stationary subspace analysis (SSA) technique, denoted as DSSA, to filter out the noise (nonstationary sources) in EEG brain signals. The nonstationary sources in the brain signal are associated with variations in the mental state that are unrelated to the experimental task. DSSA is a powerful tool for reducing the number of trials needed from each participant in neuroeconomic experiments and also for improving the prediction performance of an economic choice task. For a single trial, when DSSA is used as a noise reduction technique, the prediction model in a food snack choice experiment has an increase in overall accuracy by around 10% and in sensitivity and specificity by around 20% and in AUC by around 30%, respectively.

Our objective is to propose SP indicators of healthy brains (control groups) based on the default mode and their modifications by habituation and visual-motor association (VM-asso), to support diagnostic and rehabilitation processes. However, important differences seem to exist between men and women. Therefore, we aim to analyze EEG characteristics in a female sample. Subjects and Methods: In the current study, EEG was recorded at rest with closed eyes before and during repeated photostimulations (RPh) and before (pre) and during association of RPh with switch pressing (VM-asso) in 70 female adults. EEG was analyzed using UAM/INR software, which removes artifacts, identifies corresponding signals, selects 20 samples (2-s) from each condition, applies Welch's periodogrann to calculate and average the absolute power (AP; AAPs) of 3, theta, alpha, and beta, before and during learning, and emits data to a spreadsheet. Differences in each condition were evaluated using non-parametric tests. Results: The AAPs were different; in habituation, 3 and theta increased significantly in fronto-frontal (FF) and frontocentral and decreased in the other leads. During association, they increased in FE and decreased in the other three regions. alpha AAP decreased in all leads except in FE during habituation, and the decrement was lower in the association. beta AAP increased in all leads during both learning conditions. Conclusion: The SP and the topographic distribution are descriptive parameters of habituation and VM-asso; we propose them as EEG indicators.

J	Chen, YF; Atal, K; Xie, SQ; Liu, Q				Chen, Yi-Feng; Atal, Kiran; Xie, Sheng-Quan; Liu, Quan			A new multivariate empirical mode decomposition method for improving the performance of SSVEP-based brain-computer interface	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; canonical correlation analysis; electroencephalogram; multivariate empirical mode decomposition; steady-state visual evoked potentials	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; HYBRID BCI SYSTEM; FREQUENCY RECOGNITION; DIFFERENT REFERENCES; EEG	Objective. Accurate and efficient detection of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) in electroencephalogram (EEG) is essential for the related brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. Although the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been applied extensively and successfully to SSVEP recognition, the spontaneous EEG activities and artifacts that often occur during data recording can deteriorate the recognition performance. Therefore, it is meaningful to extract a few frequency sub-bands of interest to avoid or reduce the influence of unrelated brain activity and artifacts. This paper presents an improved method to detect the frequency component associated with SSVEP using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and CCA (MEMD-CCA). EEG signals from nine healthy volunteers were recorded to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for SSVEP recognition. Main results. We compared our method with CCA and temporally local multivariate synchronization index (TMSI). The results suggest that the MEMD-CCA achieved significantly higher accuracy in contrast to standard CCA and TMSI. It gave the improvements of 1.34%, 3.11%, 3.33%, 10.45%, 15.78%, 18.45%, 15.00% and 14.22% on average over CCA at time windows from 0.5 s to 5 s and 0.55%, 1.56%, 7.78%, 14.67%, 13.67%, 7.33% and 7.78% over TMSI from 0.75 s to 5 s. The method outperformed the filter-based decomposition (FB), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet decomposition (WT) based CCA for SSVEP recognition. Significance. The results demonstrate the ability of our proposed MEMD-CCA to improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCI.

J	Steinmetzger, K; Rosen, S				Steinmetzger, Kurt; Rosen, Stuart			Effects of acoustic periodicity and intelligibility on the neural oscillations in response to speech	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Speech; Delta; Theta; Intelligibility; Periodicity	ADVERSE LISTENING CONDITIONS; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; PHONETIC CHARACTERISTICS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; GAMMA; INFORMATION	Although several studies have investigated neural oscillations in response to acoustically degraded speech, it is still a matter of debate which neural frequencies reflect speech intelligibility. Part of the problem is that effects of acoustics and intelligibility have so far not been considered independently. In the current electroencephalo-graphy (EEG) study the amount of acoustic periodicity (i.e. the amount of time the stimulus sentences were voiced) was manipulated, while using the listeners' spoken responses to control for differences in intelligibility. Firstly, the total EEG power changes in response to completely aperiodic (noise-vocoded) speech and speech with a natural mix of periodicity and aperiodicity were almost identical, while an increase in theta power (5-6.3 Hz) and a trend for less beta power (11-18 Hz) were observed in response to completely periodic speech. These two effects are taken to indicate an information processing conflict caused by the unnatural acoustic properties of the stimuli, and that the subjects may have internally rehearsed the sentences as a result of this. Secondly, we separately investigated effects of intelligibility by sorting the trials in the periodic condition according to the listeners' spoken responses. The comparison of intelligible and largely unintelligible trials revealed that the total EEG power in the delta band (1.7-2.7 Hz) was markedly increased during the second half of the intelligible trials, which suggests that delta oscillations are an indicator of successful speech understanding.

The effect of therapeutic hypothermia on heart rate variability	JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY			English	Article							HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; WHOLE-BODY HYPOTHERMIA; CARDIAC-ARREST; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; OUTCOMES; MODEL	OBJECTIVE: Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects integrity of the autonomic nervous system. However, no study has investigated the impact of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) on HRV measures in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). In this study, we evaluate the influence of temperature on measures of HRV for a group of infants with favorable outcomes, as compared with a control group of infants with unfavorable outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Term-born infants with moderate-severe HIE underwent standard TH treatment and prospective electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Infants with favorable outcome (no seizures, normal/mild EEG scores at 96 h, no magnetic resonance imaging brain injury and normal neurodevelopmental scores at 18 to 24 months) were matched on gestational age, sex and worst encephalopathy score to a group of infants with unfavorable outcomes. Time- and frequency-domain HRV measures were calculated from 60 min of ECG data obtained at three time points: 24 h (hypothermia), 48 h (hypothermia) and 96 h (normothermia). The effect of time and temperature were evaluated using repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Sixteen infants were included (8 favorable, 8 unfavorable). For both groups of infants, an increase in the HR, RR and HF power was associated with an increase in temperature, but was not associated with any other HRV measure. In contrast, measures of HRV increased over time, as encephalopathy decreased, for infants with favorable outcomes (reflecting increased cortical-autonomic integration), but not for those with unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the effect of hypothermia on measures of HRV is limited to changes in heart rate (bradycardia) and respiratory rate, as opposed to changes in true variability. This supports the hypothesis that persistent changes in HRV are driven by the underlying brain injury and not by the process of TH.	[Vesoulis, Z. A.; Rao, R.; Trivedi, S. B.; Mathur, A.

Rajendra			Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform Based Multivariate Sub-Band Fuzzy Entropy with Application to Focal EEG Signal Analysis	ENTROPY			English	Article						Tunable-Q wavelet transform; complexity; multivariate fuzzy entropy; bivariate focal EEG signals; statistical analysis; classifiers	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIAC SOUND SIGNALS; EPILEPTOGENIC FOCUS; DIAGNOSIS; SEIZURE; LOCALIZATION; FEATURES; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; EPILEPSY	This paper analyses the complexity of multivariate electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in different frequency scales for the analysis and classification of focal and non-focal EEG signals. The proposed multivariate sub-band entropy measure has been built based on tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT). In the field of multivariate entropy analysis, recent studies have performed analysis of biomedical signals with a multi-level filtering approach. This approach has become a useful tool for measuring inherent complexity of the biomedical signals. However, these methods may not be well suited for quantifying the complexity of the individual multivariate sub-bands of the analysed signal. In this present study, we have tried to resolve this difficulty by employing TQWT for analysing the sub-band signals of the analysed multivariate signal. It should be noted that higher value of Q factor is suitable for analysing signals with oscillatory nature, whereas the lower value of Q factor is suitable for analysing signals with non-oscillatory transients in nature. Moreover, with an increased number of sub-bands and a higher value of Q-factor, a reasonably good resolution can be achieved simultaneously in high and low frequency regions of the considered signals. Finally, we have employed multivariate fuzzy entropy (mvFE) to the multivariate sub-band signals obtained from the analysed signal. The proposed Q-based multivariate sub-band entropy has been studied on the publicly available bivariate Bern Barcelona focal and non-focal EEG signals database to investigate the statistical significance of the proposed features in different time segmented signals. Finally, the features are fed to random forest and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers to select the best classifier. Our method has achieved the highest classification accuracy of 84.67% in classifying focal and non-focal EEG signals with LS-SVM classifier. The proposed multivariate sub-band fuzzy entropy can also be applied to measure complexity of other multivariate biomedical signals.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80-500 Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and postresection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches. Methods: We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs; 250-500 Hz) and ripples (80-250 Hz), and spikes in pre- and postresection ECoG sampled at 2,048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of electroencephalography (EEG) event occurrence: pre+post- (+/-), pre+post+ (+/+), pre-post+ (-/+) and pre-post- (-/-). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement; lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement; and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG events, time to recurrence, and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free vs recurrence). Results: We included 54 patients (median age, 15.5 years; 25 months of follow-up; 30 seizure free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples, or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/-, +/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio, 3.13; confidence interval = 1.22-6.25; p = 0.01). Seven of 8 patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches. Interpretation: FRs that persist before and after resection predict poor postsurgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intraoperative ECoG measurements.	[van 't Klooster, Maryse A.; van Klink, Nicole E. C.; Zweiphenning, Willemiek J. E.

For instance, movement preparation or cognitive processing were linked to delta band (1-5 Hz) oscillations. Such link could be exploited in brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms translating modulations of brain activity into control signals of external devices or computers. However, current BCIS are often driven by fast rhythmic brain activity, e.g. in the alpha (9-15 Hz) or beta band (15-30 Hz). Introducing slower oscillations, such as delta or theta (4-8 Hz) band activity, might extent the spectrum of BCI applications, particularly in the context of BCI-related restoration of movements. To detect voluntary modulations of motor cortical activity in such paradign, an active interval during which users are instructed to e.g. imagine hand movements becomes compared to a task-free interval during which users are instructed to relax. We report that cortical oscillations of eeg in delta and theta frequencies clearly synchronize at the onset and at the end of a BCI task, what might be a physiological marker for task switching that could be useful for improving BCI control. We also found that inter-trial-phase coherence (ITPC) significantly increased at the end of reference intervals during which participants were instructed to relax. This may indicate that during initial phases of BCI learning, users are actively relaxing, a finding with important implications for monitoring BCI learning and control.

Previous studies were inconclusive about the temporal dynamics of involved neurocognitive processes during proactive and reactive motor control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the time-course of proactive and reactive inhibition, measuring event-related oscillations and event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants performed in a cued go/nogo paradigm with cues indicating whether the motor response might or might not have to be inhibited. Based on the dual mechanisms of control (DMC) framework by Braver, we investigated the role of attentional effects, motor preparation in the sensorimotor cortex and prefrontal cognitive control mechanisms, separating effects before and after target onset. In the cue-target interval, proactive motor inhibition was associated with increased attention, reflected in reduced visual alpha power and an increased contingent negative variation (CNV). At the same time, motor inhibition was modulated by reduced sensorimotor beta power. After target onset, proactive inhibition resulted in an increased N1, indicating allocation of attention towards relevant stimuli, increased prefrontal beta power and a modulation of sensorimotor mu activity. As in previous studies, reactive stopping of motor actions was associated with increased prefrontal beta power and increased sensorimotor beta activity. The results stress the relevance of attentional mechanisms for proactive inhibition and speak for different neurocognitive mechanisms being involved in the early preparation for and in later implementation of motor inhibition.

This, in turn, provides a target substrate for therapeutic brain self-regulation and neurofeedback. Objective: Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate brain oscillations during and after stimulation, and may thus facilitate brain self-regulation during neurofeedback interventions. Methods: Twenty severely impaired, chronic stroke patients performed kinesthetic motor-imagery while a brain-robot interface transformed beta-ERD (17-23 Hz) of the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex into opening of the paralyzed hand by a robotic orthosis. In a parallel group design, beta-tACS (20 Hz, 1.1 mA peak-to-peak amplitude) was applied to the lesioned motor cortex either continuously (c-tACS) before or intermittently (i-tACS) during the intervention. Physiological effects of beta-tACS were studied using electroencephalography. The patients' ability for brain self-regulation was captured by neurofeedback performance metrics. Results: i-tACS - but not c-tACS- improved the classification accuracy of the neurofeedback intervention in comparison to baseline. This effect was mediated via the increased specificity of the classification, i.e., reduced variance of resting oscillations. Neither i-tACS nor c-tACS had aftereffects following the stimulation period. Conclusion: beta-tACS may constitute an adjunct neuromodulation technique during neurofeedback-based interventions for stroke rehabilitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such evidence is typically derived from studies in the context of reactive (stimulus-driven) control processes. However, little research has explored the role of theta oscillations in preparatory control processes. In the current study, we explored the extent of theta oscillations during proactive cognitive control and determined if these oscillations were associated with behavior. Results supported a general role of theta oscillations during proactive cognitive control, with increased power and phase coherence during the preparatory cue interval. Further, theta oscillations across frontoparietal electrodes were also modulated by proactive control demands, with increased theta phase synchrony and power for cues signaling the need for goal updating. Finally, we present novel evidence of negative associations between behavioral variability and both power and phase synchrony across many of these frontoparietal electrodes that were associated with the need for goal updating. In particular, greater consistency in frontoparietal theta oscillations, indicated by increased theta phase and power during mixed-task blocks, resulted in more consistent task-switching performance. Together, these findings provide new insight into the temporal dynamics and functional relevance of theta oscillations during proactive cognitive control.	[Cooper, Patrick S.; Wong, Aaron S.

However, no previous study has examined whether sleep spindles would differ by circadian preference. Here, we explore if spindle amplitude, density, duration or intensity differ by circadian preference and whether these associations are moderated by spindle location, frequency, and time distribution across the night. The participants (N = 170, 59% girls; mean age = 16.9, SD = 0.1 years) filled in the shortened 6-item Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. We performed an overnight sleep EEG at the homes of the participants. In linear mixed model analyses, we found statistically significant lower spindle amplitude and intensity in the morning as compared to intermediate (P < 0.001) and evening preference groups (P < 0.01; P > 0.06 for spindle duration and density). Spindle frequency moderated the associations (P < 0.003 for slow (< 13 Hz); P > 0.2 for fast (> 13 Hz)). Growth curve analyses revealed a distinct time distribution of spindles across the night by the circadian preference: both spindle amplitude and intensity decreased more towards morning in the morning preference group than in other groups. Our results indicate that circadian preference is not only affecting the sleep timing, but also associates with sleep microstructure regarding sleep spindle phenotypes.

Characterization of Glutamatergic and GABA(A)-Mediated Neurotransmission in Motor and Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Using Paired-Pulse TMS-EEG	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; INTRACORTICAL FACILITATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; STIMULUS-INTENSITY; EXCITABILITY; LORAZEPAM; RESPONSES; HUMANS; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) are noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition and glutamatergic excitatory transmission, respectively. Conventionally these measures have been restricted to the motor cortex. We investigated whether SICI and ICF could be recorded from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using combined TMS and electroencephalography (TMS EEG). We first characterized the neural signature of SICI and ICF in MI in terms of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and spectral power modulation. Subsequently, these paradigms were applied in the DLPFC to determine whether similar neural signatures were evident With TMS at MI, SICI and ICF led to bidirectional modulation (inhibition and facilitation, respectively) of P30 and P60 TEP amplitude, which correlated with MEP amplitude changes. With DLPFC stimulation, P60 was bidirectionally modulated by SICI and ICF in the same manner as for M I stimulation, whereas P30 was absent The sole modulation of early TEP components is in contradistinction to other measures such as long-interval intracortical inhibition and may reflect modulation of short latency excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs). Overall, the data suggest that SICI and ICF can be recorded using TMS EEG in DLPFC providing noninvasive measures of glutamatergic and GABA(A) receptor-mediated neurotransmission. This may facilitate future research attempting to ascertain the role of these neurotransmitters in the pathophysiology and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.	[Cash, Robin F.

A great effort has been dedicated in the last two decades to investigate functional connectivity (FC), i.e. the functional interplay between different regions of the brain, which was for a long time assumed to have stationary nature. Only recently was the dynamic behaviour of FC revealed, showing that on top of correlational patterns of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions exhibits meaningful variations within a typical resting-state fMRI experiment. As a consequence, a considerable amount of work has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic FC (dFC), and several different approaches were explored to identify relevant FC fluctuations. At the same time, several questions were raised about the nature of dFC, which would be of interest only if brought back to a neural origin. In support of this, correlations with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, demographic and behavioural data were established, and various clinical applications were explored, where the potential of dFC could be preliminarily demonstrated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive description of the dFC approaches proposed so far, and point at the directions that we see as most promising for the future developments of the field. Advantages and pitfalls of dFC analyses are addressed, helping the readers to orient themselves through the complex web of available methodologies and tools.	[Preti, Maria Giulia; Bolton, Thomas A.

However, reliable and high quality acquisition of these signals in the home environment is difficult. Instead, electrocardiogram (ECG) and Respiratory (Res) signals are easier to record and may offer a practical alternative for home monitoring of sleep. Therefore, automatic sleep staging was performed using ECG, Res (thoracic excursion) and EEG signals from 31 nocturnal recordings of the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) polysomnography Database. Feature vectors were extracted from 0.5 min (standard) epochs of sleep data by time-domain, frequency domain, time-frequency and nonlinear methods and optimized by using the Support Vector Machine -Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) method. These features were then classified by using a SVM. Classification based upon EEG features produced a Correct Classification Ratio CCR = 0.92. In comparison, features derived from ECG signals alone, that is the combination of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and ECG-Derived Respiration (EDR) signals produced a CCR = 0.54, while those features based on the combination of HRV and (thoracic) Res signals resulted in a CCR = 0.57. Overall comparison of the results based on standard epochs of EEG signals with those obtained from 5-minute (long) epochs of cardiorespiratory signals, revealed that acceptable CCR = 0.81 and discriminative capacity (Accuracy = 89.32 %, Specificity = 92.88 % and Sensitivity = 78.64 %) were also achievable when using optimal feature sets derived from long epochs of the latter signals in sleep staging. In addition, it was observed that the presence of some artifacts (like bigeminy) in the cardiorespiratory signals reduced the accuracy of automatic sleep staging more than the artifacts that contaminated the EEG signals.

Spontaneous Blinks Activate the Precuneus: Characterizing Blink-Related Oscillations Using Magnetoencephalography	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						blink; blink-related oscillations; precuneus; environmental monitoring; awareness; magnetoencephalography	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; EYE BLINKING; RESTING-STATE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL SUPPRESSION; CINGULATE CORTEX; EYEBLINKS	Spontaneous blinking occurs 15-20 times per minute. Although blinking has often been associated with its physiological role of corneal lubrication, there is now increasing behavioral evidence suggesting that blinks are also modulated by cognitive processes such as attention and information processing. Recent low-density electroencephalography (EEG) studies have reported so-called blink-related oscillations (BROs) associated with spontaneous blinking at rest. Delta-band (0.5-4Hz) BROs are thought to originate from the precuneus region involved in environmental monitoring and awareness, with potential clinical utility in evaluation of disorders of consciousness. However, the neural mechanisms of BROs have not been elucidated. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we characterized delta-band BROs in 36 healthy individuals while controlling for background brain activity. Results showed that, compared to pre-blink baseline, delta-band BROs resulted in increased global field power (p < 0.001) and time-frequency spectral power (p < 0.05) at the sensor level, peaking at similar to 250ms post-blink maximum. Source localization showed that spontaneous blinks activated the bilateral precuneus (p < 0.05 FWE), and source activity within the precuneus was also consistent with sensor-space results. Crucially, these effects were only observed in the blink condition and were absent in the control condition, demonstrating that results were due to spontaneous blinks rather than as part of the inherent brain activity. The current study represents the first MEG examination of BROs. Our findings suggest that spontaneous blinks activate the precuneus regions consistent with environmental monitoring and awareness, and provide important neuroimaging support for the cognitive role of spontaneous blinks.

Multiscale entropy, an entropy-based method to measure dynamic complexity at multiple temporal scales, is helpful to disclose the information of brain connectivity. This preliminary study investigated the complexity of resting-state electroencephalogram signals using multiscale entropy in children with Tourette syndrome. Method: Resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were analyzed by sample entropy and multiscale entropy methods in 10 children with Tourette syndrome and 10 healthy gender-and age-matched controls. Results: Except for the Fp2 channel, the complexity index values in all channels were reduced in children with Tourette syndrome compared with those in normal controls. A statistically significant reduction in EEG complexity was found in the bilateral central, parietal, occipital, and left temporal regions, indicating disturbed brain connectivity in Tourette syndrome. Although there was no difference of complexity in the higher frequency spectra, there was a statistically significant difference of complexity in lower frequency in F3 channel, pointing to the importance of examining a range of time scales in exploring EEG signals. Conclusions: Our preliminary study demonstrated that EEG complexity was significantly lower in children with Tourette syndrome than in normal controls. This difference may serve as a marker of disturbed brain connectivity in such individuals and suggests that further clinical studies are warranted.

Because spatial filters are often used to enhance the amplitude (square root of band power (BP)) feature and attenuate volume conduction, they are frequently applied as pre-processing methods when computing PLV. However, the effects of spatial filtering on PLV are ambiguous. Therefore, this article aims to explore whether zero-phase PLV is meaningful and how this is influenced by spatial filtering. Based on archival EEG data of left and right hand movement tasks for 32 subjects, we compared BP and PLV feature using data with and without pre-processing by a large Laplacian. Results showed that using ear-referenced data, zero-phase PLV provided unique information independent of BP for task prediction which was not explained by volume conduction and was significantly decreased when a large Laplacian was applied. In other words, the large Laplacian eliminated the useful information in zero-phase PLV for task prediction suggesting that it contains effects of both amplitude and phase. Therefore, zero-phase PLV may have functional significance beyond volume conduction. The interpretation of spatial filtering may be complicated by effects of phase. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, time-varying coefficients in the TVAR model is firstly approximated by the MRBF which has a better performance of tracking the time-varying parameters in nonstationary signals. Thus, the time-varying modeling problem is simplified to the selection of optimal centers and scales of MRBF, which a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method aided by a FOR algorithm are resolved. Secondly, recursive least squares (RLS), Legendre polynomials expansion method and single scale radial basis function approach (SSRBF) are used to compare with the proposed method to evaluate the performance. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms competing techniques in terms of mean absolute error and root mean squared error, and show the effectiveness of the proposed method for extracting the nonstationary signals. abstract environment.

Effects of new neurotensin analogue on brain activity in rat Parkinson's disease model	BULGARIAN CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th Bulgarian Peptide Symposium	JUN 10-12, 2016	S W Univ Bachinovo, Educ Ctr, Blagoevgrad, BULGARIA	European Peptide Soc, Bulgarian Peptide Soc, FOT OOD, Sigma Aldrich, Corning, Chromservis OOD, Bio Compounds, Waters, Globaltest	S W Univ Bachinovo, Educ Ctr	Neurotensin; Parkinson's disease; 6-hydroxydopamine; Neuropeptides; EEG	OSCILLATIONS; PATHWAY	Parkinson's disease (PD) results in progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons and leads to motor disturbances. The close connection between DA-ergic neurotransmitter system and Neurotensin (NT) mediation was established which suggests that NT is associated with PD. It was reported that NT can modulate the activity of DA neurons. Our previous data demonstrated significant CNS-activity in rodents of some new NT-analogues. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential modulating effect of new NT-analogue on the behavior and brain activity in rats with model of PD which was induced in male Wistar rats via unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and verified by apomorphine test. Animals were treated 5 days with new NT analogue in effective doses after the induction of PD. Standard test was used for evaluation of neuro-muscular coordination (Rot-a-Rod). Electroencephalography (EEG) was used also to measure the brain activity in inactive condition. Experimental data were processed by Student-Fisher, or Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test. Rot-a-rod test showed gradual improvement in the motor performance of NT-treated animals compared to control PD-rats with saline. In the same time EEG showed differences in spectral composition and patterns above the lesioned areas and their hemispheric counterparts in the PD-animals treated with NT-analogue compared to saline treated PD-rats and similarities with the healthy ones. In conclusion the new NT-analogue is promising anti-PD agent and deserves further investigations.

However, the temporal structure of natural stimuli is hardly ever fully rhythmic but possesses certain spectral bandwidths (e.g. lip movements in speech, gestures). Examining periodic brain responses elicited by strictly rhythmic stimulation might thus represent ideal, yet isolated cases. Here, we tested how the visual system reflects quasi-rhythmic stimulation with frequencies continuously varying within ranges of classical theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta bands (14-20 Hz) using EEG. Our findings substantiate a systematic and sustained neural phase-locking to stimulation in all three frequency ranges. Further, we found that allocation of spatial attention enhances EEG-stimulus locking to theta and alpha-band stimulation. Our results bridge recent findings regarding phase locking("entrainment")to quasi-rhythmic visual input and "frequency-tagging" experiments employing strictly rhythmic stimulation. We propose that sustained EEG-stimulus locking can be considered as a continuous neural signature of processing dynamic sensory input in early visual cortices. Accordingly, EEG-stimulus locking serves to trace the temporal evolution of rhythmic as well as quasi-rhythmic visual input and is subject to attentional bias.

We introduce the use of dynamical Bayesian inference for estimation of the coupling functions of neural oscillations in the presence of noise. By grouping the partial functional contributions, the coupling is decomposed into its functional components and its most important characteristics-strength and form-are quantified. The method is applied to characterize the delta-to-alpha phase-to-phase neural coupling functions from electroencephalographic (EEG) data of the human resting state, and the differences that arise when the eyes are either open (EO) or closed (EC) are evaluated. The delta-to-alpha phase-to-phase coupling functions were reconstructed, quantified, compared, and followed as they evolved in time. Using phase-shuffled surrogates to test for significance, we show how the strength of the direct coupling, and the similarity and variability of the coupling functions, characterize the EO and EC states for different regions of the brain. We confirm an earlier observation that the direct coupling is stronger during EC, and we show for the first time that the coupling function is significantly less variable. Given the current understanding of the effects of e.g., aging and dementia on delta-waves, as well as the effect of cognitive and emotional tasks on alpha-waves, one may expect that new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying certain diseases will be obtained from studies of coupling functions. In principle, any pair of coupled oscillations could be studied in the same way as those shown here.	[Stankovski, Tomislav; Ticcinelli, Valentina; McClintock, Peter V.

However, the electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics underlying these ERPs remain largely unexplored in ADHD. Methods: We investigate the event-related spectral perturbation and inter-trial coherence linked to the ERP triggered by visual Cue-Go/NoGo stimuli, in 14 children (7 ADHD and 7 TDC) aged 8 to 12 years. Results: Compared to TDC, the EEG dynamics of children with ADHD showed a lower theta-alpha ITC concomitant to lower occipito-parietal P1-N2 and frontal N1-P2 potentials in response to Cue, Go and Nogo stimuli; an upper alpha power preceding lower central Go-P3; a lower theta-alpha power and ITC were coupled to a lower frontal Nogo-N3; a lower low-gamma power overall scalp at 300 ms after Go and Nogo stimuli. Conclusion: These findings suggest impaired ability in children with ADHD to conserve the brain oscillations phase associated with stimulus processing. This physiological trait might serve as a target for therapeutic intervention or be used as monitoring of their effects.

Nevertheless, prior feature engineering based approaches require extracting various domain knowledge related features at a high time cost. Moreover, traditional fusion method cannot fully utilise correlation information between different channels and frequency components. In this paper, we design a hybrid deep learning model, in which the 'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)' is utilised for extracting task-related features, as well as mining inter-channel and inter-frequency correlation, besides, the 'Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)' is concatenated for integrating contextual information from the frame cube sequence. Experiments are carried out in a trial-level emotion recognition task, on the DEAP benchmarking dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the classical methods, with regard to both of the emotional dimensions of Valence and Arousal.

Acupuncture analgesia involves modulation of pain-induced gamma oscillations and cortical network connectivity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; EEG/MEG DATA; TOP-DOWN; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISM; COHERENCE	Recent studies support the view that cortical sensory, limbic and executive networks and the autonomic nervous system might interact in distinct manners under the influence of acupuncture to modulate pain. We performed a double-blind crossover design study to investigate subjective ratings, EEG and ECG following experimental laser pain under the influence of sham and verum acupuncture in 26 healthy volunteers. We analyzed neuronal oscillations and inter-regional coherence in the gamma band of 128-channel-EEG recordings as well as heart rate variability (HRV) on two experimental days. Pain ratings and pain-induced gamma oscillations together with vagally-mediated power in the high-frequency bandwidth (vmHF) of HRV decreased significantly stronger during verum than sham acupuncture. Gamma oscillations were localized in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), primary somatosensory cortex and insula. Reductions of pain ratings and vmHF-power were significantly correlated with increase of connectivity between the insula and MCC. In contrast, connectivity between left and right PFC and between PFC and insula correlated positively with vmHF-power without a relationship to acupuncture analgesia. Overall, these findings highlight the influence of the insula in integrating activity in limbic-saliency networks with vagally mediated homeostatic control to mediate antinociception under the influence of acupuncture.

The sound and the fury: Late positive potential is sensitive to sound affect	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						emotion; emotional pictures; emotional sounds; LPP; multimodal; oscillation; time frequency analyses	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; COGNITIVE-CONTROL; EMOTION REGULATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; MUSIC; STIMULI; ERP	Emotion is an emergent construct of multiple distinct neural processes. EEG is uniquely sensitive to real-time neural computations, and thus is a promising tool to study the construction of emotion. This series of studies aimed to probe the mechanistic contribution of the late positive potential (LPP) to multimodal emotion perception. Experiment 1 revealed that LPP amplitudes for visual images, sounds, and visual images paired with sounds were larger for negatively rated stimuli than for neutrally rated stimuli. Experiment 2 manipulated this audiovisual enhancement by altering the valence pairings with congruent (e.g., positive audio+positive visual) or conflicting emotional pairs (e.g., positive audio+negative visual). Negative visual stimuli evoked larger early LPP amplitudes than positive visual stimuli, regardless of sound pairing. However, time frequency analyses revealed significant midfrontal theta-band power differences for conflicting over congruent stimuli pairs, suggesting very early (approximate to 500 ms) realization of thematic fidelity violations. Interestingly, late LPP modulations were reflective of the opposite pattern of congruency, whereby congruent over conflicting pairs had larger LPP amplitudes. Together, these findings suggest that enhanced parietal activity for affective valence is modality independent and sensitive to complex affective processes. Furthermore, these findings suggest that altered neural activities for affective visual stimuli are enhanced by concurrent affective sounds, paving the way toward an understanding of the construction of multimodal affective experience.

J	Yuan-Pin, L; Jao, PK; Yang, YH				Lin, Yuan-Pin; Jao, Ping-Keng; Yang, Yi-Hsuan			Improving Cross-Day EEG-Based Emotion Classification Using Robust Principal Component Analysis	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						inter-day EEG variability; emotion classification; affective brain-computer interface; EEG oscillation; robust principal component analysis	RECOGNITION; FUSION; STATE; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Constructing a robust emotion-aware analytical framework using non-invasively recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has gained intensive attentions nowadays. However, as deploying a laboratory-oriented proof-of-concept study toward real-world applications, researchers are now facing an ecological challenge that the EEG patterns recorded in real life substantially change across days (i.e., day-to-day variability), arguably making the pre-defined predictive model vulnerable to the given EEG signals of a separate day. The present work addressed how to mitigate the inter-day EEG variability of emotional responses with an attempt to facilitate cross-day emotion classification, which was less concerned in the literature. This study proposed a robust principal component analysis (RPCA)-based signal filtering strategy and validated its neurophysiological validity and machine-learning practicability on a binary emotion classification task (happiness vs. sadness) using a five-day EEG dataset of 12 subjects when participated in a music-listening task. The empirical results showed that the RPCA-decomposed sparse signals (RPCA-S) enabled filtering off the background EEG activity that contributed more to the inter-day variability, and predominately captured the EEG oscillations of emotional responses that behaved relatively consistent along days. Through applying a realistic add-day-in classification validation scheme, the RPCA-S progressively exploited more informative features (from 12.67 +/- 5.99 to 20.83 +/- 7.18) and improved the cross-day binary emotion-classification accuracy (from 58.31 +/- 12.33% to 64.03 +/- 8.40%) as trained the EEG signals from one to four recording days and tested against one unseen subsequent day. The original EEG features (prior to RPCA processing) neither achieved the cross-day classification (the accuracy was around chance level) nor replicated the encouraging improvement due to the inter -day EEG variability. This result demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and may shed some light on developing a realistic emotion classification analytical framework alleviating day-to-day variability.

J	Fine, JM; Moore, D; Santello, M				Fine, Justin M.; Moore, Dalton; Santello, Marco			Neural oscillations reflect latent learning states underlying dual-context sensorimotor adaptation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Learning; Sensorimotor adaptation; Neural oscillations; EEG; Computational modeling	FRONTAL THETA; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; CONSOLIDATION; MEMORY; REVEALS; ERRORS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; INTERFERENCE; MANIPULATION	Recent studies have suggested that individuals can form multiple motor memories when simultaneously adapting to multiple, but oppositely-oriented perturbations. These findings predict that individuals detect the change in learning context, allowing the selective initialization and update of motor memories. However, previous electrophysiological studies of sensorimotor adaptation have not identified a neural mechanism supporting the detection of a context switch and adaptation to separate contexts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that such a mechanism is identifiable through neural oscillations measured through EEG. Human participants learned to manipulate an object in two opposite contexts (mass distribution). This task was designed based on previous work showing that people can adapt to both contexts. We found that sensorimotor alpha and beta, and medial frontal theta frequency bands all exhibited different response patterns with respect to the error in each context. To determine whether any frequency's responses to error were distinctly related to a switch in context, we predicted single-trial EEG data from a computational learning model that can adapt to multiple contexts simultaneously based on a switching mechanism. This analysis revealed that only medial frontal theta was predicted by a component of the model state that adapts to errors based on a context switch. In contrast, alpha and beta were predicted by a model state that was updated from performance errors independent of the context. These findings provide novel evidence showing that sensorimotor and medial frontal oscillations are predicted by different adaptation processes, and that changes in medial frontal activity may indicate the formation of motor memories by responding to changes in learning context.

Generalizability of Frequency Weighting Curve for Extraction of Spectral Drowsy Component From the EEG Signals Recorded in Eyes-Closed Condition	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alertness; electroencephalogram (EEG); EEG spectrum; sleep latency; frequency weighting curve	SLEEP LATENCY TEST; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SPECTRUM; OBJECTIVE ALERTNESS; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION	One of the critical barriers to reducing the threats of sleep loss to public health, safety, and productivity is a lack of practical tools for quick identification of objective level of sleepiness. We examined a novel sleepiness measure named spectral drowsy component score to provide evidence for generalizability of a frequency weighting curve required for calculation of this measure. Each spectral drowsy component score is a sum of 16 weighted ln-transformed single-Hz power densities (1-16 Hz) obtained by the fast Fourier transformation of an electroencephalographic signal recorded during the first minute after closing the eyes. A set of 16 weights (frequency weighting curve) is derived empirically. One type of such curve is a correlation spectrum. It consists of 16 coefficients of correlation of a group-averaged experimental time course of sleepiness with16 time courses of single-Hz power densities. Sleepiness is determined either subjectively (by self-scoring on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) or objectively (as sleep latency). Another type is a differential spectrum reflecting difference between 2 sets of 16 power densities obtained for either distant phases of sleep deprivation experiment or distinct alertness-sleepiness substates. Analysis of 3 datasets collected in sleep deprivation experiments with, in total, 160 participants showed that, despite differences in the protocols of these experiments and ages of their participants, the forms of frequency weighting curves always resembled one another. Such resemblance led to practical identity of scoring results. We concluded that spectral drowsy component scoring might be implemented into quick, simple, direct, transparent, and objective test of sleepiness.

However, preliminary evidence suggests that flicker may also entrain endogenous brain oscillations, thereby modulating cognitive processes supported by those brain rhythms. Here we tested the interaction between 10 Hz flicker and endogenous alpha-band (similar to 10 Hz) oscillations during a selective visuospatial attention task. We recorded EEG from human participants (both genders) while they performed a modified Eriksen flanker task in which distractors and targets flickered within (10 Hz) or outside (7.5 or 15 Hz) the alpha band. By using a combination of EEG source separation, time-frequency, and single-trial linear mixed-effects modeling, we demonstrate that 10 Hz flicker interfered with stimulus processing more on incongruent than congruent trials (high vs low selective attention demands). Crucially, the effect of 10 Hz flicker on task performance was predicted by the distance between 10 Hz and individual alpha peak frequency (estimated during the task). Finally, the flicker effect on task performance was more strongly predicted by EEG flicker responses during stimulus processing than during preparation for the upcoming stimulus, suggesting that 10 Hz flicker interfered more with reactive than proactive selective attention. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that visual flicker entrained endogenous alpha-band networks, which in turn impaired task performance. Our findings also provide novel evidence for frequency-dependent exogenous modulation of cognition that is determined by the correspondence between the exogenous flicker frequency and the endogenous brain rhythms.

Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulating (tACS) Enhances Mental Rotation Performance during and after Stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); transcranial electrical stimulation (TES); aftereffect; EEG; alpha oscillations; event-related-desynchronization (ERD); mental rotation	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ALPHA POWER; EEG ALPHA; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; SPATIAL ABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been repeatedly demonstrated to modulate endogenous brain oscillations in a frequency specific manner. Thus, it is a promising tool to uncover causal relationships between brain oscillations and behavior or perception. While tACS has been shown to elicit a physiological aftereffect for up to 70 min, it remains unclear whether the effect can still be elicited if subjects perform a complex task interacting with the stimulated frequency band. In addition, it has not yet been investigated whether the aftereffect is behaviorally relevant. In the current experiment, participants performed a Shepard-like mental rotation task for 80 min. After 10 min of baseline measurement, participants received either 20 min of tACS at their individual alpha frequency (IAF) or sham stimulation (30 s tACS in the beginning of the stimulation period). Afterwards another 50 min of post-stimulation EEG were recorded. Task performance and EEG were acquired during the whole experiment. While there were no effects of tACS on reaction times or event-related-potentials (ERPs), results revealed an increase in mental rotation performance in the stimulation group as compared to sham both during and after stimulation. This was accompanied by increased ongoing alpha power and coherence as well as event-related-desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha band in the stimulation group. The current study demonstrates a behavioral and physiological aftereffect of tACS in parallel. This indicates that it is possible to elicit aftereffects of tACS during tasks interacting with the alpha band. Therefore, the tACS aftereffect is suitable to achieve an experimental manipulation.

We propose a method to evaluate significance on the level of sensors whilst retaining full temporal or spectral resolution. Input data are multiple realizations of sensor data. In this context, multiple realizations may be the individual epochs obtained in an evoked-response experiment, or group study data, possibly averaged within subject and event type, or spontaneous events such as spikes of different types. In this contribution, we apply Statistical non-Parametric Mapping (SnPM) to MEG sensor data. SnPM is a non-parametric permutation or randomization test that is assumption-free regarding distributional properties of the underlying data. The method, referred to as Maps SnPM, is demonstrated using MEG data from an auditory mismatch negativity paradigm with one frequent and two rare stimuli and validated by comparison with Topographic Analysis of Variance (TANOVA). The result is a time-or frequency-resolved breakdown of sensors that show consistent activity within and/or differ significantly between event or spike types. TANOVA and Maps SnPM were applied to the individual epochs obtained in an evoked-response experiment. The TANOVA analysis established data plausibility and identified latencies-of-interest for further analysis. Maps SnPM, in addition to the above, identified sensors of significantly different activity between stimulus types.

Using the somatosensory evoked HFO, we quantify how HFO detectability can benefit from a custom-made low-noise amplifier (LNA).& para;& para;Methods: In 9 patients undergoing tumor surgery in the central region, subdural strip electrodes were placed for intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. We recorded the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) simultaneously by custom-made LNA and by a commercial device (CD). We varied the stimulation rate between 1.3 and 12.7 Hz to tune the SNR of the N20 component and the evoked HFO and quantified HFO detectability at the single trial level. In three patients we compared Propofol (R) and Sevoflurane (R) anesthesia.& para;& para;Results: In the average, amplitude decreased in both in N20 and evoked HFO amplitude with increasing stimulation rate (p < 0.05). We detected a higher percentage of single trial evoked HFO with the LNA (p < 0.001) for recordings with low impedance (<5 k Omega). Average amplitudes were indistinguishable between anesthesia compounds.& para;& para;Conclusion: Low-noise amplification improves the detection of the evoked HFO in recordings with subdural electrodes with low impedance.& para;& para;Significance: Low-noise EEG might critically improve the detectability of interictal spontaneous HFO in subdural and possibly in scalp recordings.

The Cortical Processing of Sensorimotor Sequences is Disrupted in Writer's Cramp	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						EEG coherency; fMRI; nonwriting task; sensorimotor integration; writer's cramp	FOCAL HAND DYSTONIA; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; VIBRATION-INDUCED ILLUSION; BASAL GANGLIA; MOTOR CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PARIETAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; CERVICAL DYSTONIA	Evidence for pre-existing abnormalities in the sensory and motor systems has been previously reported in writer's cramp (WC). However, the processing of somatosensory information during motor planning has received little attention. We hypothesized that sensorimotor integration processes might be impaired partly due to a disruption in the parieto-premotor network. To test this assumption, we designed 2 nonwriting motor tasks in which subjects had to perform a 4-finger motor sequence either on the basis of sensory stimuli previously memorized (SM task) or freely generated (SG task). Brain activity was measured by combining event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and coherency electroencephalography in 15 WC patients and 15 normal controls. The bold signal was decreased in patients in both tasks during sensory stimulation but not during movement execution. However, the EEG study showed that coherency was decreased in patients compared with controls, during the delay of the SM task and during the execution of the SG task, on both the whole network and for specific couples of electrodes. Overall, these results demonstrate an endophenotypic impairment in the synchronization of cortical areas within the parieto-premotor network during somatosensory processing and motor planning in WC patients.

The focused attention on breathing is taught to 11 healthy subjects as a simple meditation technique. EEG signals have been recorded at the beginning of meditation and after four weeks of regular meditation (daily 20 minutes) using EMOTIV device. The higher order crossings (HOC) features are derived from EEG signals for analysis of seven cognitive loads. The pre and post-experiment results are compared based on reaction time and effect on brain lobe. The K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier is used for classification of seven loads and achieved 83.57% accuracy in the post and 89.61 % accuracy in pre-experiment. The EEG-based cognitive load analysis is an important tool for continuous memory load measurement application.

Recently, we obtained corresponding findings from human oscillatory electroencephalography (EEG) activity in the form of choice-selective modulations of upper beta band amplitude in medial premotor areas. However, the research in non-human primates as well as its human counterpart was so far limited to decisions reported by button presses. Thus, here we investigated whether the observed human beta band modulation is specific to the response modality. We recorded EEG activity from participants who compared two sequentially presented vibrotactile frequencies (f1 and f2), and decided whether f2 > f1 or f2 < f1, by performing a horizontal saccade to either side of a computer screen. Contrasting time-frequency transformed EEG data between both choices revealed that upper beta band amplitude (similar to 24-32 Hz) was modulated by participants' choices before actual responses were given. In particular, "f2 > f1" choices were always associated with higher beta band amplitude than "f2 < f1" choices, irrespective of whether the choice was correct or not, and independent of the specific association between saccade direction and choice. The observed pattern of beta band modulation was virtually identical to our previous results when participants responded with button presses. In line with an intentional framework of decision making, the most likely sources of the beta band modulation were now, however, located in lateral as compared to medial premotor areas including the frontal eye fields. Hence, we could show that the choice-selective modulation of upper beta band amplitude is on the one hand consistent across different response modalities (i.e., same modulation pattern in similar frequency band), and on the other hand effector specific (i.e., modulation originating from areas involved in planning and executing saccades).

Previously, the windowed Fourier transform had been adopted for signals on graphs and has been shown to be very useful for extracting vertex-frequency information from graphs. However, high computational complexity makes these algorithms impractical. We sought to develop a fast windowed graph Fourier transform and a fast graph S-transform requiring significantly shorter computation time. The proposed schemes have been tested with synthetic test graph signals and real graph signals derived from electroencephalography recordings made during swallowing. The results showed that the proposed schemes provide significantly lower computation time in comparison with the standard windowed graph Fourier transform and the fast graph S-transform. Also, the results showed that noise has no effect on the results of the algorithm for the fast windowed graph Fourier transform or on the graph S-transform. Finally, we showed that graphs can be reconstructed from the vertex-frequency representations obtained with the proposed algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Music training is associated with cortical synchronization reflected in EEG coherence during verbal memory encoding	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CENTRAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVATION; CHILDREN; PERFORMANCE; LESSONS; CORTEX; ALPHA	Music training can improve cognitive functions. Previous studies have shown that children and adults with music training demonstrate better verbal learning and memory performance than those without such training. Although prior studies have shown an association between music training and changes in the structural and functional organization of the brain, there is no concrete evidence of the underlying neural correlates of the verbal memory encoding phase involved in such enhanced memory performance. Therefore, we carried out an electroencephalography (EEG) study to investigate how music training was associated with brain activity during the verbal memory encoding phase. Sixty participants were recruited, 30 of whom had received music training for at least one year (the MT group) and 30 of whom had never received music training (the NMT group). The participants in the two groups were matched for age, education, gender distribution, and cognitive capability. Their verbal and visual memory functions were assessed using standardized neuropsychological tests and EEG was used to record their brain activity during the verbal memory encoding phase. Consistent with previous studies, the MT group demonstrated better verbal memory than the NMT group during both the learning and the delayed recall trials in the paper-and-pencil tests. The MT group also exhibited greater learning capacity during the learning trials. Compared with the NMT group, the MT group showed an increase in long-range left and right intrahemispheric EEG coherence in the theta frequency band during the verbal memory encoding phase. In addition, their event related left intrahemispheric theta coherence was positively associated with subsequent verbal memory performance as measured by discrimination scores. These results suggest that music training may modulate the cortical synchronization of the neural networks involved in verbal memory formation.

Hippocampal spindles showed dynamic intrinsic properties, the 11.5-16 Hz frequency band being mainly dominant, whereas the 9-11.5 Hz frequency band heightening during the beginning and the end of the transient. For N3 and REM sleep stages, the power of the hippocampal signal was significantly decreased between the first and the second sleep cycle.& para;& para;Conclusion: Distinct N2 sleep, fast spindles and homeostatic profile are all common properties shared by hippocampus and cortex during sleep.& para;& para;Significance: The close functional link between hippocampus and cortex may have various sleep-related substrates.

Correlational studies have generally found that egocentric perspective induces greater neurophysiological responses and larger behavioral effects compared to an allocentric perspective. However, recent studies question previous findings by reporting greater (mu) suppression and greater transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS)-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) during observation of allocentric compared to egocentric movements. Furthermore, self-other differentiation has been generally related to activity within the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), but direct evidence for a causal and functional role of IPL in self-other differentiation is lacking. The current study was therefore designed to investigate the influence that IPL exerts on self-other differentiation. To this aim, we measured the impact of individually adjusted alpha-tuned transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied over IPL on it-suppression during hands movement observation from an egocentric and allocentric perspective. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during movement observation before and immediately after tACS. Results demonstrated that tACS decreased it-reactivity over sensorimotor (but not visual) regions for egocentric (but not allocentric) movement observation providing direct evidence for a causal involvement of IPL in the observation of self- but not other-related hand movement.

Epileptic patients are subject to epileptic seizures caused by abnormal electrical discharges that lead to uncountable movements, convulsions and the loss of consciousness. Approximately 50 million people around the world are diagnosed with epilepsy, children and adults in the age range of 65-70 years old are effected the most. Although the main cause of this disease is unknown, however, most of the symptoms of the epilepsy seizure can be medically treated. Epileptic patients are subject to seizures that cause uncontrollable movements and loss of consciousness which can lead to serious injuries, and sometimes death. As a result, computerized seizure detection techniques are vital solutions for epileptic patients to protect them from dangers at the time of a seizure. In this paper, we propose an epilepsy seizures detecting method that can be implemented in a hardware device to help epileptic patients. The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely recognized for diagnosing and assessing brain activities and disorder. Our study utilized an EEG datasets that is used in various research regarding epilepsy detection. We processed the EEG signal in both time and frequency domains and applied a Chebyschev filter for preprocessing the signal, then, by using Wavelet Analysis, we decomposed the filtered signal into five sub-bands in both time and frequency domain. However, we only used the Delta sub-band for further processing. Discrete Wavelet Transform was used for feature extraction, then thresholding was implemented in order to determine the noisy part of the signal. Moreover, we applied some widely used classifiers for epilepsy seizure detection, and compared our results with other approches.	[Lasefr, Zakareya; Ayyalasomayajula, Sai Shiva V. N.

Evaluating and Improving Automatic Sleep Spindle Detection by Using Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep spindles; automatic detection; Hilbert-Huang transform; performance assessment; multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; Pareto front	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; EEG; BENCHMARKING; ABILITY	Sleep spindles are brief bursts of brain activity in the sigma frequency range (11-16 Hz) measured by electroencephalography (EEG) mostly during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep. These oscillations are of great biological and clinical interests because they potentially play an important role in identifying and characterizing the processes of various neurological disorders. Conventionally, sleep spindles are identified by expert sleep clinicians via visual inspection of EEG signals. The process is laborious and the results are inconsistent among different experts. To resolve the problem, numerous computerized methods have been developed to automate the process of sleep spindle identification. Still, the performance of these automated sleep spindle detection methods varies inconsistently from study to study. There are two reasons: (1) the lack of common benchmark databases, and (2) the lack of commonly accepted evaluation metrics. In this study, we focus on tackling the second problem by proposing to evaluate the performance of a spindle detector in amulti-objective optimization context and hypothesize that using the resultant Pareto fronts for deriving evaluation metrics will improve automatic sleep spindle detection. We use a popularmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2), to optimize six existing frequency-based sleep spindle detection algorithms. They include three Fourier, one continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and two Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) based algorithms. We also explore three hybrid approaches. Trained and tested on open-access DREAMS andMASS databases, two new hybridmethods of combining Fourier with HHT algorithms show significant performance improvement with F-1-scores of 0.726-0.737.

It is a particularly crucial issue in paediatric anesthesia, in the context of the recent controversies about the potential neurological consequences of the main anaesthetic drugs on the developing brain. The electroencephalogram signal reflects the electrical activity of the neurons in the cerebral cortex. The gabaergic anesthetics induce dose-dependent slow and regular EEG oscillations. The EEG based monitors give a number which decreases when EEG slows down and synchronizes. These monitors are poorly sensitive to anesthetic agents which are not associated with slowing down of EEG oscillations, such as ketamine, nitrous oxide or opioids. Besides the EEG monitoring which gives mainly information on cortical anaesthetic effects, it would be relevant to have also a subcortical feedback allowing an assessment of nociception. Up to now, the assessment of the analgesia-nociception balance is mainly based on the assessment of the autonomic response to noxious stimulation. Among the emerging clinical devices, we can mention those which assess peripheral sympathetic response (skin conductance), cardiac and vascular sympathetic response (surgical pleth index), parasympathetic cardiac response (analgesia nociception index), and finally the pupillometry which is based on the assessment of the pupillary reflex dilatation induced by nociceptive stimulations.

At the cortical level, the superior frontal gyrus, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and inferior frontal areas, is important. There is an ongoing debate about the functional roles of these structures during response inhibition as it is unclear whether these structures process different codes or contents of information during response inhibition. In the current study, we examined this question with a focus on theta frequency oscillations during response inhibition processes. We used a standard Go/Nogo task in a sample of human participants and combined different EEG signal decomposition methods with EEG beamforming approaches. The results suggest that stimulus coding during inhibitory control is attained by oscillations in the upper theta frequency band (similar to 7 Hz). In contrast, response selection codes during inhibitory control appear to be attained by the lower theta frequency band (similar to 4 Hz). Importantly, these different codes seem to be processed in distinct functional neuroanatomical structures. Although the SMA may process stimulus codes and response selection codes, the inferior frontal cortex may selectively process response selection codes during inhibitory control. Taken together, the results suggest that different entities within the functional neuroanatomical network associated with response inhibition mechanisms process different kinds of codes during inhibitory control. These codes seem to be reflected by different oscillations within the theta frequency band. (C) 2017 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Patients with dyslexia have varying degrees of difficulties in reading comprehension, including texts and words, resulting in poor academic performance and seriously affecting their learning achievements. This study attempted to explore the phenomenon of inferior ability in reciting and writing Chinese characters for dyslexic students through the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis. The study recruited eight dyslexic and eight normal children, aged around 10 years old. The results showed that children with dyslexia present significantly lower EEG power of theta, alpha, low-alpha and high-alpha oscillations than normal students in both recitation and writing. For the EEG power of beta oscillation, however, no significant difference was present in both recitation and writing activities. In perspective cerebral cortex regions, the EEG power of most bands in frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes for dyslexic students were significantly lower than normal students in both recitation and writing activities. These findings can indirectly reflect the inferior performance of dyslexic students in their learning. Thus, the current results in the study can be utilized as references for policy setting to improve the student learning achievement.

In this paper, we introduce the offline seizure detection algorithms using single-channel and one-second-length of short-time EEG signals based on time domain and novel frequency-sequency features and also novel feature reduction scenarios. After preprocessing stages, the EEG signals are decomposed to five brain rhythms using uniform discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based filter bank. Then, transform-based features by the DFT and discrete Walsh-Hadamard transform are defined. With computing spectral correlation model (SCM) using Fourier and Walsh patterns of the rhythms, the Walsh power is computed as a modulus maximum feature that is called spectral correlation power. By segmenting the SCM, the histogram-based statistical features namely; kurtosis, skewness and negentropy as non-Gaussianity measures of probability density function for each epoch of the SCM are calculated. These extracted features are fused in multi-level structures with four different arrangements of kernel-principle component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and kernel matrix. These feature reduction methods are called multi-level dimensionality reduction (MLDR) algorithms. Ultimately, the reduced features with a hybrid model of particle swarm optimization and probabilistic neural network are applied to select the optimal features. To classify the EEG signals into the seizure and non-seizure classes, an optimized non-linear support vector machine classifier with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel is employed. The proposed methods are evaluated on selected 104-hour of EEG records from 23 pediatric patients and the sensitivity rates of 86.38%, 86.05%, 84.71% and 84.65%, precision rates of 95.33%, 96.97%, 95.33% and 95.57% and false detection rates of 0.0853, 0.0805, 0.0926 and 0.0921 per hour are obtained for different MLDRs algorithms, respectively. With regard to utilize the short-time EEG single-channel signal processing scenarios for different patients with different seizures foci, our proposed algorithms obtain the acceptable performances.

Positive and negative emotions are the states classified and the Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma frequency bands are selected for the signal processing. It is found that, by using a combination of Power Spectral Density (PSD), Signal Power (SP) and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as the features, the highest subject-dependent accuracy (86.83%) and independent accuracy (64.73%) is achieved, when using Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) as the classification algorithm. The standard deviation of the results is 5.03. The electrode locations were then improved for the detection of emotion, by moving them from Fl, F2, T3 and T4 to Al, F2, F7 and F8. The subject-dependent accuracy, using the improved locations, increased to 91.75% from 86.83% and 75% of participants achieved a classification accuracy higher than 90%, compared with only 16% of participants before improving the electrode arrangement.

Previous research has demonstrated aberrant LRTC in depressed patients; however, it is unknown whether the neuronal dynamics normalize after psychological treatment. In this study, we recorded EEG during eyes-closed rest in depressed patients (N = 71) and healthy controls (N = 25), and investigated the temporal dynamics in depressed patients at baseline, and after attending either a brief mindfulness training or a stress reduction training. Compared to the healthy controls, depressed patients showed stronger LRTC in theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) at baseline. Following the psychological interventions both groups of patients demonstrated reduced LRTC in the theta band. The reduction of theta LRTC differed marginally between the groups, and explorative analyses of separate groups revealed noteworthy topographic differences. A positive relationship between the changes in LRTC, and changes in depressive symptoms was observed in the mindfulness group. In summary, our data show that aberrant temporal dynamics of ongoing oscillations in depressive patients are attenuated after treatment, and thus may help uncover the mechanisms with which psychotherapeutic interventions affect the brain.

However, the dynamics of the underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. In particular, whether AI is on the receiving or driving end of the error-monitoring network is unresolved. Here, we recorded intracerebral electroencephalography signals simultaneously from AI and dmPFC in epileptic patients while they performed a stop-signal task. We found that errors selectively modulated broadband neural activity in human AI. Granger causality estimates revealed that errors were immediately followed by a feedforward influence from AI onto anterior cingulate cortex and, subsequently, onto presupplementary motor area. The reverse pattern of information flow was observed on correct responses. Our findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence indicating that the anterior insula rapidly detects and conveys error signals to dmPFC, while the latter might use this input to adapt behavior following inappropriate actions.

The different image contents and their rhythmic presentation imply specific bottom-up and top-down processing. Because these processes already occur during passive observation we studied the brain responses evoked by the presentation of specific 3D virtual tunnels with respect to 2D checkerboard. For this, we characterized electroencephalograhy dynamics (EEG), the evoked potentials and related neural generators involved in various visual paradigms. Time-frequency analysis showed modulation of alpha-beta oscillations indicating the presence of stronger prediction and after-effects of the 3D-tunnel with respect to the checkerboard. Whatever the presented image, the generators of the P100 were situated bilaterally in the occipital cortex (BA18, BA19) and in the right inferior temporal cortex (BA20). In checkerboard but not 3D-tunnel presentation, the left fusiform gyrus (BA37) was additionally recruited. P200 generators were situated in the temporal cortex (BA21) and the cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) specifically for the checkerboard while the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA36) and the cerebellum (lobule IV/V and IX/X) were involved only during the 3D-tunnel presentation. For both type of image, P300 generators were localized in BA37 but also in BA19, the right BA21 and the cerebellar lobule VI for only the checkerboard and the left BA20-BA21 for only the 3D-tunnel. Stronger P300 delta-theta oscillations recorded in this later situation point to a prevalence of the effect of changing direction over the proper visual content of the 3D-tunnel. The parahippocampal gyrus (BA36) implicated in navigation was also identified when the 3D-tunnel was compared to their scrambled versions, highlighting an action-oriented effect linked to navigational content.

During jerks, EEG has always been described as normal. The aim of this study was to describe EEG changes associated with the myoclonic jerks. Methods: Polygraphic video-EEG recordings of four full-term neonates presenting benign neonatal sleep myoclonus were studied. Myoclonic jerks were analyzed regarding their topography, frequency, propagation pattern, and reflex component. EEG averaging time-locked to myoclonic jerks and to somatosensory stimuli (realized by tapping on palms and feet) was performed to study eventual EEG correlates of myoclonus and to asses somatosensory evoked responses-for the latter, two control newborns were added. Results: Visual analysis of the EEG disclosed theta band slow waves on central and vertex electrodes concomitant to myoclonic jerks and jerk-locked back-averaging disclosed a sequence of deflections, not preceding, but following the myoclonus. This response predominated on the vertex electrode (CZ) and consisted of five components (N1, P1, N2, P2, and N3), with only the three later components being constantly present (at 110, 200, and 350-500 ms, respectively). Back-averaging locked to the tactile stimuli in four subjects and two control newborns showed similar components and were comparable to those described in the literature as late somatosensory evoked responses in fullterm newborns. Conclusions: Myoclonic jerks in benign neonatal sleep myoclonus can evoke visually identifiable EEG potentials on vertex electrodes corresponding to somatosensory responses. This EEG aspect may be misleading and could give rise to an antiseizure treatment that mostly worsens the condition.

In the brain the experience of pain is associated with neuronal oscillations and synchrony at different frequencies. However, an overarching framework for the significance of oscillations for pain remains lacking. Recent concepts relate oscillations at different frequencies to the routing of information flow in the brain and the signaling of predictions and prediction errors. The application of these concepts to pain promises insights into how flexible routing of information flow coordinates diverse processes that merge into the experience of pain. Such insights might have implications for the understanding and treatment of chronic pain.

Two main issues are addressed in this work: the first one consists of an adaptive filter design to increase the classification accuracy for motor imagery. The second issue deals with the design of an efficient hardware/software embedded architeclture integrating the entire EEG signal processing chain. In this embedded system organization, the pre-processing techniques, which are time consuming, are integrated as hardware accelerators. The remaining blocks (Intellectual Properties - IP) are developed as embedded-software running on an embedded soft-core processor. The pre-processing step is designed to be self-adjusted according to the intrinsic characteristics of each subject. The feature extraction process uses the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as a filter due to its effectiveness to extract the ERD/ERS (Event-Related Desynchronization/Synchronization) effect, where the classifier is based on the Mahalanobis distance. The advantage of the proposed system lies in its simplicity and short processing time while maintaining a high performance in term of classification accuracy. A prototype of the embedded system has been implemented on an Altera FPGA-based platform (Stratix-IV). It is shown that the proposed architecture can effectively extract discriminative features for motor imagery with a maximum frequency of 150 MHz. The proposed system was validated on EEG data of twelve subjects from the BCI competition data sets. The prototype performs a fast classification within time delay of 0.399 second per trial, an accuracy average of 94.47 %, an average transfer rate over all subjects of 20.74 bits/min. The estimated power consumption of the proposed system is around 1.067 Watt (based on an integrated tool-power analysis of Altera corporation).

J	Zhang, T; Chen, WZ				Zhang, Tao; Chen, Wanzhong			LMD Based Features for the Automatic Seizure Detection of EEG Signals Using SVM	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; local mean decomposition (LMD); product functions (PFs); seizure detection	WAVELET TRANSFORM; FRACTAL DIMENSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY; EMD	Achieving the goal of detecting seizure activity automatically using electroencephalogram(EEG) signals is of great importance and significance for the treatment of epileptic seizures. To realize this aim, a newly-developed time-frequency analytical algorithm, namely local mean decomposition (LMD), is employed in the presented study. LMD is able to decompose an arbitrary signal into a series of product functions (PFs). Primarily, the raw EEG signal is decomposed into several PFs, and then the temporal statistical and non-linear features of the first five PFs are calculated. The features of each PF are fed into five classifiers, including back propagation neural network (BPNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), un-optimized support vector machine (SVM) and SVM optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-SVM), for five classification cases, respectively. Confluent features of all PFs and raw EEG are further passed into the high-performance GA-SVM for the same classification tasks. Experimental results on the international public Bonn epilepsy EEG dataset show that the average classification accuracy of the presented approach are equal to or higher than 98.10% in all the five cases, and this indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach for automated seizure detection.

Analysis and design of a highly linear CMOS OTA for portable biomedical applications in 90 nm CMOS	MICROELECTRONICS JOURNAL			English	Article						DPOTA; Low pass filter; CDN; EEG; ECG; EMG	CONTINUOUS-TIME FILTER; SOURCE DEGENERATION; TRANSCONDUCTOR; SIGNAL	This paper presents the analysis and design of a new CMOS highly linear digitally programmable operational transconductance amplifier (DPOTA). The proposed DPOTA is used to design a fourth-order low pass filter for a portable Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electromyography (EMG) detection systems. The performance of the proposed DPOTA and the low pass filter is validated through simulation results using 90 nm CMOS technology under a balanced 1.2 V supply voltage. The transconductance value of the proposed DPOTA can be controlled, from 25 nA/V to 400 nA/V, by a 4-bit digital word. The IM3 of the proposed DPOTA is 45 dB with two single tones at frequency 60 Hz and 80 Hz and an amplitude of 20 mV(p-p) each. The low pass filter cutoff frequency can be adjusted to 107 Hz, 257 Hz, and 537 Hz. The third-order harmonic distortion (HD3) of the filter is 51 dB for 20 mV(p-p) at 100 Hz sinusoidal input signal.

Slow waves synchronize high-frequency oscillations: physiological activity from the theta through the gamma band usually appears during scalp-positive upstates while epileptiform activity occurs at transitory phases and the scalp-negative downstate. It has been proposed that interictal discharges (IlDs) are facilitated by the high degree of neuronal firing synchrony during slow wave transitory and downstates. This would suggest that their occurrence increases as a function of slow wave synchronization, indicated by greater amplitude, steeper slopes and higher EEG signal synchronization. We investigated the occurrence of IlDs during NREM sleep slow waves in epileptic patients undergoing presurgical electrophysiological monitoring. Intracranially registered IIDs preferentially occurred during the scalp-negative downstates of frontal scalp slow waves in all subjects. IID occurrence was more frequent during larger slow waves in the pooled sample and a subset of subjects. However, slow wave slope steepness and EEG signal synchronization between two frontal scalp channels was not significantly associated with HD occurrence. Our results indicate that IlDs indeed do not occur at the same slow wave phase as physiological rhythms, but contrary to previous hypotheses their occurrence is not strongly affected by EEG synchronization.

Oscillatory dynamics and functional connectivity during gating of primary somatosensory responses	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						cortical oscillations; development; MEG; phase coherence	SPACE SEPARATION METHOD; INTERSTIMULUS-INTERVAL; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; CORTEX; MEG; STIMULATION; SIGNAL; SUPPRESSION; EEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Sensory gating (SG) is a phenomenon in which neuronal responses to subsequent similar stimuli are weaker, and is considered to be an important mechanism for preventing excessive environmental stimulation from overloading shared neural resources. Although gating has been demonstrated in multiple sensory systems, the neural dynamics and developmental trajectory underlying SG remain poorly understood. In the present study, we adopt a data-driven approach to map the spectrotemporal amplitude and functional connectivity (FC) dynamics that support gating in the somatosensory system (somato-SG) in healthy children and adolescents using magnetoencephalography (MEG). These data underwent time-frequency decomposition and the significant signal changes were imaged using a beamformer. Voxel time series were then extracted from the peak voxels and these signals were examined in the time and time-frequency domains, and then subjected to dynamic FC analysis. The results obtained indicate a significant decrease in the amplitude of the neural response following the second stimulation relative to the first in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). A significant decrease in response latency was also found between stimulations, and each stimulation induced a sharp decrease in FC between somatosensory cortical areas. Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between somato-SG metrics and age. We conclude that somato-SG can be observed in SI in both the time and oscillatory domains, with rich dynamics and alterations in inter-hemispheric FC, and that this phenomenon has already matured by early childhood. A better understanding of these dynamics may provide insight to the numerous psychiatric and neurologic conditions that have been associated with aberrant SG across multiple modalities.

However these predictors are limited to inter-subjects changes. To overcome this limitation and evaluate intra-subjects performance, we tried to combine two groups of these measures: psychological and neurophysiological. As neurophysiological variables tonic changes in resting EEG theta and alpha sub-bands were considered. As psychological parameter we analyzed internalized attention and its correlates in lower alpha. We found that when internalized attention doesn't decrease, Motor Imagery performance outcome can be correctly predicted by resting EEG tonic variations.	[Nascimben, M.; Wang, Y. K.; Singh, A.

We determined the spatio-temporal dynamics of such short-term maintenance and subsequent scanning of verbal information, by intracranially measuring high-gamma activity at 70-110 Hz during a working memory task. Methods: Patients listened to a stimulus set of two or four spoken letters and were instructed to remember those letters over a two-second interval, following which they were asked to determine if a subsequent target letter had been presented earlier in that trial's stimulus set. Results: Auditory presentation of letter stimuli sequentially elicited high-gamma augmentation bilaterally in the superior-temporal and pre-central gyri. During the two-second maintenance period, high-gamma activity was augmented in the left pre-central gyrus, and this effect was larger during the maintenance of stimulus sets consisting of four compared to two letters. During the scanning period following target presentation, high-gamma augmentation involved the left inferior-frontal and supra-marginal gyri. Conclusions: Short-term maintenance of verbal information is, at least in part, supported by the left precentral gyrus, whereas scanning by the left inferior-frontal and supra-marginal gyri. Significance: The cortical structures involved in short-term maintenance and scanning of speech stimuli were segregated with an excellent temporal resolution.

The stimulus properties such as frequency, color and shape can greatly affect the performance, comfort and safety of the brain computer interfaces. Despite this fact, stimulation properties have received fairly little attention. This study aims to investigate the influence of stimulus color on SSVEPs. We tested 10 colors and did evaluation by using three different methods: the power amplitude, multivariate synchronization index, and canonical correlation analysis. The results showed that violet color had the least influence to SSVEPs while red color tended to have stronger impact.

In literature, diverse approaches based on signal processing, data mining, statistic models, and others compile information from multiple electrodes to build filters for artifact removal in the time, frequency or space domains. For almost one century, EEG acquisitions have required strict experimental conditions that included an isolated room, clinical acquisition systems, rigorous experimental protocols and very precise stimulation control. Under these steady experimental conditions, artifact removal techniques have not significantly evolved since then. However, in the last decade technological advances in brain-computer interfaces permit EEG acquisition by means of wireless, mobile, dry, wearable, and low-cost EEG headsets, with new potential daily-life applications, such as in entertainment or industry. New aspects not considered before, such as massive muscular and electrical artifacts, reduced number of electrodes, uncontrolled concomitant stimulus or the need for online processing are now essential. In this paper, we present a critical review of EEG artifact removal approaches, discuss their applicability to daily-life EEG-BCI applications, and give some directions and guidelines for upcoming research in this topic. Based on the results of the review, existing artifact removal techniques need further evolution to be applied in daily-life EEG-BCI. The use of multiple-step procedures is recommended, combining source decomposition with blind source separation and adaptive filtering, rather than using them separately. It is also recommendable to define and characterize most of artifacts evoked in daily-life EEG-BCI for a more effective removal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A resting EEG study of neocortical hyperexcitability and altered functional connectivity in fragile X syndrome	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Fragile X syndrome; EEG; Hyperexcitability; Gamma; Cross-frequency coupling; Top-down modulation	MENTAL-RETARDATION PROTEIN; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MOUSE MODEL; PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; GAMMA-FREQUENCY; ALPHA; RHYTHMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; EXCITABILITY	Background: Cortical hyperexcitability due to abnormal fast-spiking inhibitory interneuron function has been documented in fmr1 KO mice, a mouse model of the fragile X syndrome which is the most common single gene cause of autism and intellectual disability. Methods: We collected resting state dense-array electroencephalography data from 21 fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients and 21 age-matched healthy participants. Results: FXS patients exhibited greater gamma frequency band power, which was correlated with social and sensory processing difficulties. Second, FXS patients showed increased spatial spreading of phase-synchronized high frequency neural activity in the gamma band. Third, we observed increased negative theta-to-gamma but decreased alpha-to-gamma band amplitude coupling, and the level of increased theta power was inversely related to the level of resting gamma power in FXS. Conclusions: Increased theta band power and coupling from frontal sources may represent a mechanism providing compensatory inhibition of high-frequency gamma band activity, potentially contributing to the widely varying level of neurophysiological and behavioral abnormalities and treatment response seen in full-mutation FXS patients. These findings extend preclinical observations and provide new mechanistic insights into brain alterations and their variability across FXS patients. Electrophysiological measures may provide useful translational biomarkers for advancing drug development and individualizing treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders with associated neuronal hyperexcitability.

In humans, spindles can be classified as either slow or fast, but large individual differences in spindle frequency as well as methodological difficulties have hindered progress towards understanding their function. Using two nights of high-density electroencephalography recordings from 28 healthy individuals, we first characterize the individual variability of NREM spectra and demonstrate the difficulty of determining subject-specific spindle frequencies. We then introduce a novel spatial filtering approach that can reliably separate subject-specific spindle activity into slow and fast components that are stable across nights and across N2 and N3 sleep. We then proceed to provide detailed analyses of the topographical expression of individualized slow and fast spindle activity. Group-level analyses conform to known spatial properties of spindles, but also uncover novel differences between sleep stages and spindle classes. Moreover, subject-specific examinations reveal that individual topographies show considerable variability that is stable across nights. Finally, we demonstrate that topographical maps depend nontrivially on the spindle metric employed. In sum, our findings indicate that group-level approaches mask substantial individual variability of spindle dynamics, in both the spectral and spatial domains. We suggest that leveraging, rather than ignoring, such differences may prove useful to further our understanding of the physiology and functional role of sleep spindles.

Neurofeedback Tunes Scale-Free Dynamics in Spontaneous Brain Activity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						alpha rhythm; criticality; EEG; Hurst exponent; long-range temporal correlations; neurofeedback; PTSD; scale-free dynamics	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; AVALANCHE DYNAMICS; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; SLEEP EEG; MODULATION; HOMEOSTASIS; DISORDER	Brain oscillations exhibit long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), which reflect the regularity of their fluctuations: low values representing more random (decorrelated) while high values more persistent (correlated) dynamics. LRTCs constitute supporting evidence that the brain operates near criticality, a state where neuronal activities are balanced between order and randomness. Here, healthy adults used closed-loop brain training (neurofeedback, NFB) to reduce the amplitude of alpha oscillations, producing a significant increase in spontaneous LRTCs post-training. This effect was reproduced in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, where abnormally random dynamics were reversed by NFB, correlating with significant improvements in hyperarousal. Notably, regions manifesting abnormally low LRTCs (i.e., excessive randomness) normalized toward healthy population levels, consistent with theoretical predictions about self-organized criticality. Hence, when exposed to appropriate training, spontaneous cortical activity reveals a residual capacity for "self-tuning" its own temporal complexity, despite manifesting the abnormal dynamics seen in individuals with psychiatric disorder. Lastly, we observed an inverse-U relationship between strength of LRTC and oscillation amplitude, suggesting a breakdown of long-range dependence at high/low synchronization extremes, in line with recent computational models. Together, our findings offer a broader mechanistic framework for motivating research and clinical applications of NFB, encompassing disorders with perturbed LRTCs.

Acute low-level alcohol consumption reduces phase locking of event-related oscillations in rodents	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG phase synchrony; Event-related oscillations; Ethanol; Voluntary consumption; Rat	BRAIN; RATS	Event-related oscillations (EROS) are rhythmic changes that are evoked by a sensory and/or cognitive stimulus that can influence the dynamics of the EEG. EROs are defined by the decomposition of the EEG signal into magnitude (energy) and phase information and can be elicited in both humans and animals. EROs have been linked to several relevant genes associated with ethanol dependence phenotypes in humans and are altered in selectively bred alcohol-preferring rats. However, pharmacological studies are only beginning to emerge investigating the impact low intoxicating doses of ethanol can have on event-related neural oscillations. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effects of low levels of voluntary consumption of ethanol, in rats, on phase locking of EROs in order to give further insight into the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol on the brain. To this end, we allow rats to self-administer unsweetened 20% ethanol over 15 intermittent sessions. This method results in a stable low-dose consumption of ethanol. Using an auditory event-related potential "oddball" paradigm, we investigated the effects of alcohol on the phase variability of EROs from electrodes implanted into the frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and amygdala. We found that intermittent ethanol self-administration was sufficient to produce a significant reduction in overall intraregional synchrony across all targeted regions. These data suggest that phase locking of EROs within brain regions known to be impacted by alcohol may represent a sensitive biomarker of low levels of alcohol intoxication.

However, its benefits come at the cost of mental load and fatigue occurring in the concentration on the visual stimuli. Noise, as a ubiquitous random perturbation with the power of randomness, may be exploited by the human visual system to enhance higher-level brain functions. In this study, a novel steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP, i.e., one kind of SSVEP)-based BCI paradigm with spatiotemporal visual noise was used to investigate the influence of noise on the compensation of mental load and fatigue deterioration during prolonged attention tasks. Changes in alpha, theta, theta + alpha powers, theta/alpha ratio, and electroencephalography (EEG) properties of amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and online accuracy, were used to evaluate mental load and fatigue. We showed that presenting a moderate visual noise to participants could reliably alleviate the mental load and fatigue during online operation of visual BCI that places demands on the attentional processes. This demonstrated that noise could provide a superior solution to the implementation of visual attention controlling-based BCI applications.

The main aim of the current work is to introduce an innovative algorithm for acquiring reliable discriminating features from EEG signals to improve classification performances and to reduce the time complexity. Methods: This study develops a robust feature extraction method combining the principal component analysis (PCA) and the cross-covariance technique (CCOV) for the extraction of discriminatory information from the mental states based on EEG signals in BCI applications. We apply the correlation based variable selection method with the best first search on the extracted features to identify the best feature set for characterizing the distribution of mental state signals. To verify the robustness of the proposed feature extraction method, three machine learning techniques: multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP), least square support vector machine (LS-SVM), and logistic regression (LR) are employed on the obtained features. The proposed methods are evaluated on two publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by comparing it with some recently reported algorithms. Results: The experimental results show that all three classifiers achieve high performance (above 99% overall classification accuracy) for the proposed feature set. Among these classifiers, the MLP and LSSVM methods yield the best performance for the obtained feature. The average sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy for these two classifiers are same, which are 99.32%, 100%, and 99.66%, respectively for the BCI competition dataset IVa and 100%, 100%, and 100%, for the BCI competition dataset IVb. The results also indicate the proposed methods outperform the most recently reported methods by at least 0.25% average accuracy improvement in dataset IVa. The execution time results show that the proposed method has less time complexity after feature selection. Conclusions: The proposed feature extraction method is very effective for getting representatives information from mental states EEG signals in BCI applications and reducing the computational complexity of classifiers by reducing the number of extracted features.

Interictal epileptiform activity outside the seizure onset zone impacts cognition	BRAIN			English	Article						intracranial EEG; interictal spikes; epileptiform discharges; memory; cognition	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; VERBAL MEMORY; BRAIN; IMPAIRMENT; EPILEPSY; SPIKES; RECOGNITION; LANGUAGE; THETA	Cognitive deficits are common among epilepsy patients. In these patients, interictal epileptiform discharges, also termed spikes, are seen routinely on electroencephalography and believed to be associated with transient cognitive impairments. In this study, we investigated the effect of spikes on memory encoding and retrieval, taking into account the spatial distribution of spikes in relation to the seizure onset zone as well as anatomical regions of the brain. Sixty-seven patients with medication refractory epilepsy undergoing continuous intracranial electroencephalography monitoring engaged in a delayed free recall task to test short-term memory. In this task, subjects were asked to memorize and recall lists of common nouns. We quantified the effect of each spike on the probability of successful recall using a generalized logistic mixed model. We found that in patients with left lateralized seizure onset zones, spikes outside the seizure onset zone impacted memory encoding, whereas those within the seizure onset zone did not. In addition, spikes in the left inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus during memory encoding reduced odds of recall by as much as 15% per spike. Spikes also reduced the odds of word retrieval, an effect that was stronger with spikes outside of the seizure onset zone. These results suggest that seizure onset regions are dysfunctional at baseline, and support the idea that interictal spikes disrupt cognitive processes related to the underlying tissue.

Depressive symptoms and autobiographical memory: A pilot electroencephalography (EEG) study	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Autobiographical memory; Depression; Electroencephalography; Functional connectivity; sLORETA	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INVENTORY-II; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING POSTERIOR; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE MODEL; HUMAN BRAIN; EXTROVERSION; OSCILLATIONS	Introduction: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown changes in the activity of medial prefrontal, medial temporal, and occipital regions in major depressive disorder patients during recall of autobiographical memories. Electrophysiological underpinning of these changes is not known. It is also not clear whether they are a part of the clinical picture or appear at preclinical stages in individuals predisposed to depression. Method: In this study, the effect of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), on oscillatory dynamics accompanying retrieval of emotionally positive and negative autobiographical memories was investigated in a non-clinical sample using electroencephalographic event-related spectral power and connectivity measures. Results: Psychometric results showed that BDI scores correlated positively with the strength of negative emotion, vividness of negative memories, and their importance for participant's life. In high BDI scorers, low-frequency synchronization, which is frequently used as a marker of emotional arousal, prevailed in negative episodes, whereas in low BDI scorers it prevailed in positive episodes. sLORETA localized sources of this synchronization in the medial prefrontal cortex. In negative episodes, depressive symptoms were associated with a diminished event-related connectivity in the alpha band in posterior regions and increased connectivity in beta and gamma bands in frontal regions. Conclusions: Overall, these results show that even at preclinical stages, depressive symptoms are associated with changes in electrophysiological processes accompanying retrieval of autobiographical memories.

Bimodal coupling of ripples and slower oscillations during sleep in patients with focal epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Ripples; Sleep oscillations; Phase-event amplitude coupling; Intracranial electroencephalography	FRONTAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; GABAERGIC INHIBITION; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; NATURAL SLEEP; WAKE CYCLE; 80-200 HZ; SPINDLES; SEIZURES	Objective: Differentiating pathologic and physiologic high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) is challenging. In patients with focal epilepsy, HFOs occur during the transitional periods between the up and down state of slow waves. The preferred phase angles of this form of phase-event amplitude coupling are bimodally distributed, and the ripples (80-150 Hz) that occur during the up-down transition more often occur in the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). We investigated if bimodal ripple coupling was also evident for faster sleep oscillations, and could identify the SOZ. Methods: Using an automated ripple detector, we identified ripple events in 40-60 min intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 23 patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe or neocortical epilepsy. The detector quantified epochs of sleep oscillations and computed instantaneous phase. We utilized a ripple phasor transform, ripple-triggered averaging, and circular statistics to investigate phase event-amplitude coupling. Results: We found that at some individual recording sites, ripple event amplitude was coupled with the sleep oscillatory phase and the preferred phase angles exhibited two distinct clusters (p < 0.05). The distribution of the pooled mean preferred phase angle, defined by combining the means from each cluster at each individual recording site, also exhibited two distinct clusters (p < 0.05). Based on the range of preferred phase angles defined by these two clusters, we partitioned each ripple event at each recording site into two groups: depth iEEG peak-trough and trough-peak. The mean ripple rates of the two groups in the SOZ and non-SOZ (NSOZ) were compared. We found that in the frontal (spindle, p = 0.009; theta, p = 0.006, slow, p = 0.004) and parietal lobe (theta, p = 0.007, delta, p = 0.002, slow, p = 0.001) the SOZ incidence rate for the ripples occurring during the trough-peak transition was significantly increased. Significance: Phase-event amplitude coupling between ripples and sleep oscillations may be useful to distinguish pathologic and physiologic events in patients with frontal and parietal SOZ.

It has been reported previously that TRPC3 channels are effectors of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/trkB signaling pathway. Given the long postulated role of BDNF in epileptogenesis, TRPC3 channels may be a critical component in the underlying pathophysiology of seizure and epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the precise role of TRPC3 channels in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Methods: The role of TRPC3 channels was investigated using TRPC3 knockout (KO) mice and TRPC3-selective inhibitor Pyr3. Video and electroencephalography (EEG) recording of pilocarpine-induced seizures were performed. Results: We found that genetic ablation of TRPC3 channels reduces behavioral manifestations of seizures and the root-mean-square (RMS) power of SE, indicating a significant contribution of TRPC3 channels to pilocarpine-induced SE. Furthermore, the reduction in SE in TRPC3KO mice is caused by a selective attenuation of pilocarpine-induced theta activity, which dominates both the preictal phase and SE phase. Pyr3 also caused a reduction in the overall RMS power of pilocarpine-induced SE and a selective reduction in the theta activity during SE. Significance: Our results demonstrate that TRPC3 channels unequivocally contribute to pilocarpine-induced SE and could be a novel molecular target for new anticonvulsive drugs.

However, less attention was given to the phenomenon of internal distracting information being solely inherent to the stimuli content. Human memory may be prone to internal distractions caused by semantic relatedness between the meaning of words (e.g., atom, neutron, nucleus, etc.) to be encoded, i.e., semantic interference. Our study investigates the brain oscillatory dynamics behind the semantic interference phenomenon, whose possible outcome is known as false memories. In this direction, Deese-Roediger-McDermott word lists were appropriated for a modified Sternberg paradigm in auditory modality. Participants received semantically related and unrelated word lists via headphones while EEG data were acquired. Semantic interference triggered the false memory rates to be higher than those of other types of memory errors. Analysis demonstrated that the upper part of alpha band (-10-12 Hz) power decreases on parieto-occipital channels in the retention interval, prior to the probe item for semantically related condition. Our study elucidates the oscillatory mechanisms behind semantic interference by relying on alpha functional inhibition theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Delta rhythmicity is a reliable EEG biomarker in Angelman syndrome: a parallel mouse and human analysis	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Angelman syndrome; Biomarker; Delta; EEG; Mouse model; Outcome measure; UBE3A	CEREBRAL PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; SPECTRUM DISORDER; AUTISM; SEIZURE; MODEL; DIAGNOSIS; SLEEP; DEFICITS; UBE3A	Background: Clinicians have qualitatively described rhythmic delta activity as a prominent EEG abnormality in individuals with Angelman syndrome, but this phenotype has yet to be rigorously quantified in the clinical population or validated in a preclinical model. Here, we sought to quantitatively measure delta rhythmicity and evaluate its fidelity as a biomarker. Methods: We quantified delta oscillations in mouse and human using parallel spectral analysis methods and measured regional, state-specific, and developmental changes in delta rhythms in a patient population. Results: Delta power was broadly increased and more dynamic in both the Angelman syndrome mouse model, relative to wild-type littermates, and in children with Angelman syndrome, relative to age-matched neurotypical controls. Enhanced delta oscillations in children with Angelman syndrome were present during wakefulness and sleep, were generalized across the neocortex, and were more pronounced at earlier ages. Conclusions: Delta rhythmicity phenotypes can serve as reliable biomarkers for Angelman syndrome in both preclinical and clinical settings.

Systems neuroscience studies are currently being used to investigate the neural circuit mechanisms of anesthesia-induced altered arousal states. These studies suggest that by disrupting the oscillatory dynamics that are associated with arousal states, anesthesia-induced oscillations are a putative mechanism through which anesthetic drugs produce altered states of arousal. However, an empirical clinical observation is that even at relatively stable anesthetic doses, patients are sometimes intermittently responsive to verbal commands during states of light sedation. During these periods, prominent anesthesia-induced neural oscillations such as slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations are notably absent. Neural correlates of intermittent responsiveness during light sedation have been insufficiently investigated. A principled understanding of the neural correlates of intermittent responsiveness may fundamentally advance our understanding of neural dynamics that are essential for maintaining arousal states, and how they are disrupted by anesthetics. Therefore, we performed a high-density (128 channels) electroencephalogram (EEG) study (n = 8) of sevoflurane-induced altered arousal in healthy volunteers. We administered temporally precise behavioral stimuli every 5 s to assess responsiveness. Here, we show that decreased eyes-closed, awake-alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillation power is associated with lack of responsiveness during sevoflurane effect-onset and -offset. We also show that anteriorization-the transition from occipitally dominant awake-alpha oscillations to frontally dominant anesthesia induced-alpha oscillations-is not a binary phenomenon. Rather, we suggest that periods, which were defined by lack of responsiveness, represent an intermediate brain state. We conclude that awake-alpha oscillation, previously thought to be an idling rhythm, is associated with responsiveness to behavioral stimuli.

Spontaneous Neural Oscillations Bias Perception by Modulating Baseline Excitability	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha rhythm; excitability; neural oscillations; perception; signal detection theory; spontaneous activity	SIGNAL-DETECTION-THEORY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; PRESTIMULUS OSCILLATIONS; DISCRIMINATION PERFORMANCE; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG; PHASE; POWER; PREDICT; BAND	The brain exhibits organized fluctuations of neural activity, even in the absence of tasks or sensory input. A prominent type of such spontaneous activity is the alpha rhythm, which influences perception and interacts with other ongoing neural activity. It is currently hypothesized that states of decreased prestimulus alpha oscillations indicate enhanced neural excitability, resulting in improved perceptual acuity. Nevertheless, it remains debated how changes in excitability manifest at the behavioral level in perceptual tasks. We addressed this issue by comparing two alternative models describing the effect of spontaneous alpha power on signal detection. The first model assumes that decreased alpha power increases baseline excitability, amplifying the response to both signal and noise, predicting a liberal detection criterion with no effect on sensitivity. The second model predicts that decreased alpha power increases the trial-by-trial precision of the sensory response, resulting in improved sensitivity. We tested these models in two EEG experiments in humans where we analyzed the effects of prestimulus alpha power on visual detection and discrimination using a signal detection framework. Both experiments provide strong evidence that decreased alpha power reflects a more liberal detection criterion, rather than improved sensitivity, consistent with the baseline model. In other words, when the task requires detecting stimulus presence versus absence, reduced alpha oscillations make observers more likely to report the stimulus regardless of actual stimulus presence. Contrary to previous interpretations, these results suggest that states of decreased alpha oscillations increase the global baseline excitability of sensory systems without affecting perceptual acuity.

This study presents a computational model of ultra-slow oscillatory activity based on the interaction between neurons and astrocytes. We predict that the frequency of these oscillations closely depends on activation of astrocytes in the network, which is reflected by oscillations of their intracellular calcium concentrations with periods between tens of seconds and minutes. An increase of intracellular calcium in astrocytes triggers the release of adenosine triphosphate from these cells which may alter transmission at nearby synapses by increasing or decreasing neurotransmitter release. These results provide theoretical support for the emerging awareness of astrocytes as active players in the regulation of neural activity and identify neuron-astrocyte interactions as a potential primary mechanism for the emergence of ultra-slow cortical oscillations.

Measuring the Severity of Neonatal Seizures: Temporal-Spatial Burden	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Neonatal seizures; Seizure burden; Neonatal EEG; Epilepsy monitoring; EEG interpretation agreement	CRITICALLY-ILL CHILDREN; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; CARDIAC-SURGERY; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ENCEPHALOPATHY; EEG; RELIABILITY; HYPOTHERMIA; TRIAL; AGE	Purpose:The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society recommends measuring neonatal seizures' severity by their frequency (number of seizures-anywhere per hour), burden (percentage of time with seizures-anywhere), or on a region-by-region, temporal-spatial basis. This study compares two reduced-channel montages for temporal-spatial seizure burden analyses and examines the agreement of seizures' quantification among these three methodologies.Methods:A convenience sample of 10 neonatal electroencephalograms was annotated for the beginnings and ends of seizures, which appeared anywhere in the full neonatal montage, then repeated on a more precise, region-by-region basis using 2 reduced-channel montages A and B. Seizure severity was measured by seizures-anywhere frequency, seizures-anywhere burden, and temporal-spatial seizure burdens using montages A and B. The results were compared by measuring their correlation and by linear regression modeling.Results:Seizures-anywhere frequency was correlated with seizures-anywhere burden ( = 0.77). However, a narrow range of seizures-anywhere frequencies corresponded with a broad range of seizures-anywhere burdens. Although there was high correlation between seizures-anywhere burdens and temporal-spatial seizure burdens ( = 0.92 montage A, = 0.90 montage B), seizures-anywhere burdens were insensitive to variations in the spatial aspects of seizures, which were highly prevalent even in this small sample set. After adjusting for intrareader variability, the temporal-spatial seizure burdens measured by montages A and B were not significantly different (P = 0.56).Conclusions:The severity of neonatal seizures is poorly represented by simple measures such as seizures-anywhere frequencies or burdens. The use of temporal-spatial seizure burden measurements is supported in work where great precision in quantifying neonatal seizures is required.

BrainCycles: Experimental Setup for the Combined Measurement of Cortical and Subcortical Activity in Parkinson's Disease Patients during Cycling	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						DBS; LFPs; EEG; cycling; ergometer; freezing of gait; Parkinson's disease	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; WALKING; MOTOR; GAIT; EEG; TREADMILL; TREMOR	Recently, it has been demonstrated that bicycling ability remains surprisingly preserved in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who suffer from freezing of gait. Cycling has been also proposed as a therapeutic means of treating PD symptoms, with some preliminary success. The neural mechanisms behind these phenomena are however not yet understood. One of the reasons is that the investigations of neuronal activity during pedaling have been up to now limited to PET and fMRI studies, which restrict the temporal resolution of analysis, and to scalp EEG focused on cortical activation. However, deeper brain structures like the basal ganglia are also associated with control of voluntary motor movements like cycling and are affected by PD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted for therapy in PD patients provide rare and unique access to directly record basal ganglia activity with a very high temporal resolution. In this paper we present an experimental setup allowing combined investigation of basal ganglia local field potentials (LFPs) and scalp EEG underlying bicycling in PD patients. The main part of the setup is a bike simulator consisting of a classic Dutch-style bicycle frame mounted on a commercially available ergometer. The pedal resistance is controllable in real-time by custom software and the pedal position is continuously tracked by custom Arduino-based electronics using optical and magnetic sensors. A portable bioamplifier records the pedal position signal, the angle of the knee, and the foot pressure together with EEG, EMG, and basal ganglia LFPs. A handlebar-mounted display provides additional information for patients riding the bike simulator, including the current and target pedaling rate. In order to demonstrate the utility of the setup, example data from pilot recordings are shown. The presented experimental setup provides means to directly record basal ganglia activity not only during cycling but also during other movement tasks in patients who have undergone DBS treatment. Thus, it can facilitate studies comparing bicycling and walking, to elucidate why PD patients often retain the ability to bicycle despite severe freezing of gait. Moreover it can help clarifying the mechanism through which cycling may have therapeutic benefits.

Such protective responses rely on autonomic responses that allocate energy resources to protective functions. However, the precise relationship between objective stimulus intensity, subjective pain intensity, autonomic responses, and brain activity is not fully clear yet. Here, we addressed this question by continuously recording pain ratings, skin conductance, heart rate, and electroencephalography during tonic noxious heat stimulation of the hand in 39 healthy human subjects. The results confirmed that pain intensity dissociates from stimulus intensity during 10 minutes of noxious stimulation. Furthermore, skin conductance measures were significantly related to stimulus intensity but not to pain intensity. Correspondingly, skin conductance measures were significantly related to alpha and beta oscillations in contralateral sensorimotor cortex, which have been shown to encode stimulus intensity rather than pain intensity. No significant relationships were found between heart rate and stimulus intensity or pain intensity. The findings were consistent for stimulation of the left and the right hands. These results suggest that sympathetic autonomic responses to noxious stimuli in part directly result from nociceptive rather than from perceptual processes. Beyond, these observations support concepts of pain and emotions in which sensory, motor, and autonomic components are partially independent processes that together shape emotional and painful experiences.

They have mostly been recorded invasively, but pathological ripples (80-250 Hz) can also be found in scalp EEGs with frequent epileptiform spikes. Physiological HFOs also exist. They have been recorded invasively in hippocampus and neocortex. There are no reports of spontaneously occurring physiological HFOs recorded with scalp EEG. We aimed to study ripples in spike-free scalp EEGs. We included 23 children (6 with, 17 without epilepsy) who had an EEG without interictal epileptiform spikes recorded during sleep. We differentiated true ripples from spurious ripples such as filtering effects of sharp artifacts and high frequency components of muscle artifacts by viewing ripples simultaneously in bipolar and average montage and double-checking the unfiltered signal. We calculated mean frequency, duration and root mean square amplitude of the ripples, and studied their shape and distribution. We found ripples in EEGs of 20 out of 23 children (4 with, 16 without epilepsy). Ripples had a regular shape and occurred mostly on central and midline channels. Mean frequency was 102 Hz, mean duration 70 ms, mean root mean square amplitude 0.95 A mu V. Ripples occurring in normal EEGs of children without epilepsy were considered physiological; the similarity in appearance suggested that the ripples occurring in normal EEGs of children with epilepsy were also physiological. The finding that it is possible to study physiological neocortical ripples in scalp EEG paves the way for investigating their occurrence during brain development and their relation with cognitive functioning.

Cortical dendritic activity correlates with spindle-rich oscillations during sleep in rodents	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							REM-SLEEP; PLASTICITY; EEG; CORTEX; INTEGRATION; RECORDINGS; TRANSITION; FREQUENCY; HUMANS; INPUT	How sleep influences brain plasticity is not known. In particular, why certain electro-encephalographic (EEG) rhythms are linked to memory consolidation is poorly understood. Calcium activity in dendrites is known to be necessary for structural plasticity changes, but this has never been carefully examined during sleep. Here, we report that calcium activity in populations of neocortical dendrites is increased and synchronised during oscillations in the spindle range in naturally sleeping rodents. Remarkably, the same relationship is not found in cell bodies of the same neurons and throughout the cortical column. Spindles during sleep have been suggested to be important for brain development and plasticity.

Unsupervised Robust Detection of Behavioral Correlates in ECoG	2017 8TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAY 25-28, 2017	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, EMBS		BCI; Correntropy; ECoG; Neuromodulation; Transient Model	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; HUMANS; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG	Electrocorticogram (ECoG) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) provide finer spatial resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio than its noninvasive counterpart, Electroencephalogram (EEG). This remarkable feature allows for processing in higher spectral bands in order to elucidate more spatially localized encoding mechanisms. We propose an automatic, fully data-driven method to extract relevant neuromodulation events from single-channel, single-trial traces. In particular, our scheme involves two alternating optimizations that resemble k-means; moreover, correntropy is utilized to provide robust estimation and protection against outliers. In this way, we find distinct behavioral correlates in the low-gamma band (76 - 100 Hz) that encode finger flexion movements in a cued task. The results show that correntropy should be used when working with neuronal oscillations due to the high probability of outliers.

Past researchers have reported reduced alpha and increased theta and delta spectral powers on quantitative EEG recordings in those with prominent negative symptoms. Aim: Present analysis aimed at exploring the relationships between lower-frequency EEG powers and negative symptoms, in schizophrenia, over a period of naturalistic antipsychotic treatment. Method: Fifteen right-handed drug-free/drug-naive schizophrenia patients (N = 15; M = 12, F = 3) were recruited and assessed on PANSS. Spontaneous 192-channel resting-state EEG was recorded at baseline, and PANSS rating was repeated at 4 weeks. Baseline EEGs of patients were compared to 15 age-sexhandedness matched controls. Results: Non-significant differences emerged between patient and controls in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. Over left frontal and left temporal regions, baseline ratio of alpha/theta power (bATR) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in patients, correlated negatively with baseline PANSS negative score (PNS) (p < 0.05); and over 4-weeks of antipsychotic treatment, left temporal bATR correlated positively with relative improvements in PNS. Conclusion: Reduced alpha power over frontal regions might imply altered arousal and/ or impaired attentional process, while abnormal theta range oscillations may relate to impairments in working memory via their influences on theta-gamma coupling. Our findings suggest left-predominant deficiencies in these processes might mediate negative symptoms. Further, since ATR might reflect integrity of certain cognitive processes, those with a higher bATR might possess better cognitive resource at baseline and therefore experience greater improvement in negative symptoms with antipsychotic treatments, at least during the first 4 weeks.

Recent studies showed that complex kinematics like grasping can be successfully decoded from low frequency electroencephalogram. In this work we present a hierarchical method to asynchronously discriminate two different grasps often used in daily life actions (palmar, pincer) from a combined set of motor execution and motor intention. We compared sensorimotor rhythms based features and time features from the low frequency spectrum for best discrimination results. Our results show not only the principle feasibility of the proposed method with detection of asynchronous motor intention at rates of 80% accuracy and subsequent grasping discrimination over 60%, but also that low frequency time domain features provide a more consistent detection pattern. Although the basis of this results is still an off-line analysis we are confident that these results can be transferred to on-line use.

Here we asked subjects to perform a visual discrimination task while we changed the temporal context in which the stimuli were presented. We collected electroen-cephalography (EEG) signals in two temporal contexts. In predictable blocks stimuli were presented after a constant delay relative to a visual cue, and in unpredictable blocks stimuli were presented after variable delays relative to the visual cue. Four subsecond delays of 83, 150, 400, and 800 ms were used in the predictable and unpredictable blocks. We observed that predictability modulated the power of prestimulus alpha oscillations in the parieto-occipital sites: alpha power increased in the 300-ms window before stimulus onset in the predictable blocks compared with the unpredictable blocks. This modulation only occurred in the longest delay period, 800 ins, in which predictability also improved the behavioral performance of the subjects. Moreover, learning the temporal context shaped the prestimulus alpha power: modulation of prestimulus alpha power grew during the predictable block and correlated with performance enhancement. These results suggest that the brain is able to learn the subsecond temporal context of stimuli and use this to enhance sensory processing. Furthermore, the neural correlate of this temporal prediction is reflected in the alpha oscillations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY It is not well understood how the uncertainty in the timing of an external event affects its processing, particularly at subsecond scales. Here we demonstrate how a predictable timing scheme improves visual processing. We found that learning the predictable scheme gradually shaped the prestimulus alpha power. These findings indicate that the human brain is able to extract implicit subsecond patterns in the temporal context of events.

These non-equilibrium transitions are brought on by modulations from naturally occurring neurotransmitters, primarily acetylcholine and GABA, whose concentrations vary dynamically during sleep. In particular, we find that the slow-wave oscillations of deepest nonREM sleep are fundamentally chaotic in nature, arising spontaneously from a competitive interaction between Turing (spatial) and Hopf (temporal) instabilities. We show that by introducing an activity-based regulation of inhibitory gap-junction diffusion, the sleeping cortex can move towards the edge of chaos defined by the boundary between the disordered slow-wave state and a pathologically ordered seizure-like state. We suggest that such self-organization could allow the brain to dwell in a state that is optimized for pruning and consolidation of memories.	[Steyn-Ross, D.

The effect of prior knowledge and intelligibility on the cortical entrainment response to speech	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; EEG; entrainment; intelligibility; prior knowledge	AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; COMPREHENSION; PERCEPTION; EEG; MODULATION; MECHANISM; ATTENTION	It has been suggested that cortical entrainment plays an important role in speech perception by helping to parse the acoustic stimulus into discrete linguistic units. However, the question of whether the entrainment response to speech depends on the intelligibility of the stimulus remains open. Studies addressing this question of intelligibility have, for the most part, significantly distorted the acoustic properties of the stimulus to degrade the intelligibility of the speech stimulus, making it difficult to compare across "intelligible" and "unintelligible" conditions. To avoid these acoustic confounds, we used priming to manipulate the intelligibility of vocoded speech. We used EEG to measure the entrainment response to vocoded target sentences that are preceded by natural speech (nonvocoded) prime sentences that are either valid (match the target) or invalid (do not match the target). For unintelligible speech, valid primes have the effect of restoring intelligibility. We compared the effect of priming on the entrainment response for both 3-channel (unintelligible) and 16-channel (intelligible) speech. We observed a main effect of priming, suggesting that the entrainment response depends on prior knowledge, but not a main effect of vocoding (16 channels vs. 3 channels). Furthermore, we found no difference in the effect of priming on the entrainment response to 3-channel and 16-channel vocoded speech, suggesting that for vocoded speech, entrainment response does not depend on intelligibility. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural oscillations have been implicated in the parsing of speech into discrete, hierarchically organized units. Our data suggest that these oscillations track the acoustic envelope rather than more abstract linguistic properties of the speech stimulus. Our data also suggest that prior experience with the stimulus allows these oscillations to better track the stimulus envelope.

Specifically, the power and phase of low frequency oscillations have been found to predict whether an upcoming weak visual target will be detected or not. However, the mechanisms by which baseline oscillatory activity influences perception remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that the frequently reported negative relationship between alpha power and stimulus detection may be explained by changes in detection criterion (i. e., increased target present responses regardless of whether the target was present/absent) driven by the state of neural excitability, rather than changes in visual sensitivity (i. e., more veridical percepts). Here, we recorded EEG while human participants performed a luminance discrimination task on perithreshold stimuli in combination with single-trial ratings of perceptual awareness. Our aim was to investigate whether the power and/or phase of prestimulus oscillatory activity predict discrimination accuracy and/or perceptual awareness on a trial-by-trial basis. Prestimulus power (3-28 Hz) was inversely related to perceptual awareness ratings (i. e., higher ratings in states of low prestimulus power/high excitability) but did not predict discrimination accuracy. In contrast, prestimulus oscillatory phase did not predict awareness ratings or accuracy in any frequency band. These results provide evidence that prestimulus alpha power influences the level of subjective awareness of threshold visual stimuli but does not influence visual sensitivity when a decision has to be made regarding stimulus features. Hence, we find a clear dissociation between the influence of ongoing neural activity on conscious awareness and objective performance.	[Benwell, Christopher S.

Task-induced amplitude modulation of neural oscillations is routinely used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for decoding subjects' intents, and underlies some of the most robust and common methods in the field, such as common spatial patterns and Riemannian geometry. While there has been some interest in phase-related features for classification, both techniques usually presuppose that the frequencies of neural oscillations remain stable across various tasks. We investigate here whether features based on task-induced modulation of the frequency of neural oscillations enable decoding of subjects' intents with an accuracy comparable to task-induced amplitude modulation. Approach. We compare cross-validated classification accuracies using the amplitude and frequency modulated features, as well as a joint feature space, across subjects in various paradigms and pre-processing conditions. We show results with a motor imagery task, a cognitive task, and also preliminary results in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as using common spatial patterns and Laplacian filtering. Main results. The frequency features alone do not significantly out-perform traditional amplitude modulation features, and in some cases perform significantly worse. However, across both tasks and pre-processing in healthy subjects the joint space significantly out-performs either the frequency or amplitude features alone. This result only does not hold for ALS patients, for whom the dataset is of insufficient size to draw any statistically significant conclusions. Significance. Task-induced frequency modulation is robust and straight forward to compute, and increases performance when added to standard amplitude modulation features across paradigms. This allows more information to be extracted from the EEG signal cheaply and can be used throughout the field of BCIs.

The two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis then operates on the multi-scale matrices to reduce the dimension, rather than vectors in conventional PCA. Results are presented from an experiment to classify twenty hand motions using 89-channel EMG signals recorded in stroke survivors, which illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for biomedical signal analysis. With this multi-scale two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis for high-dimensional signal classification, spatial-time-frequency discriminant information from high-dimensional EMG electrode array can be effectively extracted and reduced using the proposed method. Compared with the time domain feature extraction in conjunction with PCA, MS2D(2)PCA performed better with higher classification accuracy and less PCs in EMG classification. The efficiency and effectiveness of the method can be further validated by using high-dimensional EEG, MEG, fMRI signals. Although the present study focuses on high-dimensional signal pattern classification, based on the PCs obtained at multiple scales, it is relatively straightforward to expand MS2D(2)PCA for high-dimensional signal compression, denoising, component extraction, and other related tasks.

Evaluation of a minimum-norm based beamforming technique, sLORETA, for reducing tonic muscle contamination of EEG at sensor level	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Electromyogram; Inverse modelling; Beamformer; Forward modelling; Neurophysiological response	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SCALP ELECTRICAL SIGNALS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC INFERENCES; ELECTROMYOGENIC ARTIFACTS; PERICRANIAL MUSCLES; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; EMG CONTAMINATION; SURFACE LAPLACIAN; TENSION HEADACHE; COMMON MIGRAINE	Background: Cranial and cervical muscle activity (electromyogram, EMG) contaminates the surface electroencephalogram (EEG) from frequencies below 20 through to frequencies above 100 Hz. It is not possible to have a reliable measure of cognitive tasks expressed in EEG at gamma-band frequencies until the muscle contamination is removed. New method: In the present work, we introduce a new approach of using a minimum-norm based beam forming technique (sLORETA) to reduce tonic muscle contamination at sensor level. Using a generic volume conduction model of the head, which includes three layers (brain, skull, and scalp), and sLORETA, we estimated time-series of sources distributed within the brain and scalp. The sources within the scalp were considered to be muscle and discarded in forward modelling. Result: (1) The method reduced EMG contamination, more strongly at peripheral channels; (2) task-induced cortical activity was retained or revealed after removing putative muscle activity. Comparison with existing methods: This approach can decrease tonic muscle contamination in scalp measurements without relying on time-consuming processing of expensive MRI data. In addition, it is competitive to ICA in muscle reduction and can be reliably applied on any length of recorded data that captures the dynamics of the signals of interest. Conclusion: This study suggests that sLORETA can be used as a method to quantitate cranial muscle activity and reduce its contamination at sensor level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG differences between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting remain in healthy ageing	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Normal ageing; Resting EEG; Eyes open vs. eyes closed; Arousal/activation; Clinical screening tool; EEG reactivity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY GO/NOGO TASK; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; ORIENTING REFLEX; STATE AROUSAL; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; VISUAL PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; QUANTITATIVE EEG	In young adults and children, the eyes-closed (EC) resting state is one of low EEG arousal, with the change to eyes-open (EO) primarily involving an increase in arousal. We used this arousal perspective to interpret EC/ EO differences in healthy young and older adults. EEG was recorded from 20 young (Mage = 20.4 years) and 20 gender-matched older (M-age = 68.2 years) right-handed adults during two 3 min resting conditions; EC then EO. Older participants displayed less delta and theta, some reduction in alpha, and increased beta. Global activity in all bands reduced with opening the eyes, but did not differ with age, indicating that the energetics of EEG reactivity is maintained in healthy ageing. However, older adults had more focal changes than young adults, particularly in beta, suggesting the mobilisation of additional localised resources. This maintained reactivity, and heightened focal activity, may underlie preserved performance levels in healthy ageing.

The results of these studies are often heterogeneous, a fact which may be partly explained by an inherent heterogeneity in the TI population and partly by the applied EEG data analysis procedure and EEG hardware. Hence this study was performed to re-enact a formerly published study (loos et al., 2012) to better understand the reason for differences and overlap between studies from different labs. We re-investigated the relationship between neural oscillations and behavioral measurements of affective states in TI, namely depression and tinnitus-related distress by recruiting 45 TI who underwent resting-state EEG. Comprehensive psychopathological (depression and tinnitus-related distress scores) and psychometric data (including other tinnitus characteristics) were gathered. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to unveil independent factors that predict distinct aspects of tinnitus-related pathology. Furthermore, we correlated EEG power changes in the standard frequency bands with the behavioral scores for both the whole-brain level and, as a post hoc approach, for selected regions of interest (ROI) based on sLORETA. Behavioral data revealed significant relationships between measurements of depression and tinnitus-related distress. Notably, no significant results were observed for the depressive scores and modulations of the EEG signal. However, akin to the former study we evidenced a significant relationship between a power increase in the beta-bands and tinnitus-related distress. In conclusion, it has emerged that depression and tinnitus-related distress, even though they are assumed not to be completely independent, manifest in distinct neural configurations.

One of the major causes of traffic accidents is drowsiness while driving. Since drowsiness is related to human physiological conditions, drowsiness is hard to prevent. Several studies have been conducted in assessing drowsiness, especially in a driving environment. One of the common methods used is the electroencephalogram (EEG). It is known that drowsiness occurs in the central nervous system; thus, estimating drowsiness using EEG is the promising way to assess drowsiness accurately. In this study, we tried to estimate drowsiness using frequency-domain and time-domain analysis of EEG. To validate the physiological conditions of the subjects, the Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), a subject-based assessment of drowsiness condition; and an examiner-based assessment known as facial expression evaluation (FEE) were applied. Three categories were considered; alert (KSS < 6; FEE < 1), weak drowsiness (KSS 6-7; FEE 1-2) and strong drowsiness (KSS > 7; FEE > 2). The six parameters (absolute and relative power of alpha, ratio of beta/alpha and (theta+alpha)/beta, and Hjorth activity and mobility parameters) had statistically significant differences between the three drowsiness conditions (P < 0.001). By using both KSS and FEE, these parameters showed high accuracy in detecting drowsiness (up to 92.9%). Taken together, we suggest that EEG parameters can be used in detecting the three drowsiness conditions in a simulated driving environment.

In the last 25 years MEG was used more and more in clinical studies concerning localization of focal epileptic activity, functional cortex and network analysis. Simultaneous MEG/EEG recording and analysis offer the use of complimentary information increasing the sensitivity for tracing primary epileptic activity. Combined MEG/Stereo-EEG recordings showed that MEG noninvasively identified regional interictal networks. The current role of MEG for presurgical evaluation with regard to noninvasive localization in MRI normal patients, guiding of invasive electrode implantation and correlation to postoperative outcome after epilepsy surgery is stressed. Challenges and future opportunities for MEG in clinical epileptology are discussed. (C) 2016 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, detailed descriptions, including ictal video-EEG, have not been reported. We report the case of a 4-year-old boy who developed recurrent epileptic eyelid twitching at 1 year and 5 months of age. Seizures gradually increased in frequency to more than 50 times per day and manifested with upward eye deviation, motion arrest, loss of consciousness, and eyelid twitching lasting for five seconds. Ictal EEG showed rhythmic, generalized slow or spike-and-wave complex activity with posterior predominance. Moderate psychomotor developmental delay and unsteady gait were also noted. Neuroimaging results were normal. Seizures were refractory to carbamazepine and levetiracetam but were reduced in frequency by ethosuximide and lamotrigine administration. Genetic analysis identified a c.3583-6 G>A mutation in the SYNGAP1 gene. SYNGAP1 gene analysis should be considered for intellectually disabled patients with early-onset drug resistant eyelid twitching and photosensitivity. Further clinical research on SYNGAP1 function may be necessary to treat epilepsy of this aetiology.

According to the clinical context, we used non invasive EEG recordings. As a prerequisite, we developed miniaturized Ag/AgCl electrodes for full band EEG recordings in mice and verified that Urethane had no effect on EEG band power. Since mice are born with a "preterm" brain, we evaluated three age groups: P0/P1, P3/P4 and P13/P14. Our aim was to identify EEG patterns in the somatosensory cortex which are distinguishable between developmental stages and represent a physiologic brain development. In mice, we were able to find clear differences between age groups with a simple power analysis of EEG bands and also for phase locking and power spectral density. Interhemispheric coherence between corresponding regions can only be seen in two week old mice. The canolty maps for piglets as well as for mice show a clear PAC (phase amplitude coupling) pattern during development. From our data it can be concluded that analytic tools relying on network activity, as for example PAC (phase amplitude coupling) are best suited to extract basic EEG patterns of cortical development across species.

While it has mainly been used to explore the hemodynamic changes associated with epileptic spikes, this approach could also provide new insight into human cognition. However, the first step is to ensure that cognitive EEG components, that have lower amplitudes than epileptic spikes, can be appropriately detected under fMRI. We compared the high frequency activities (HFA, 50-150 Hz) elicited by a reading task in icEEG- only and subsequent icEEG-fMRI in the same patients (n = 3), implanted with depth electrodes. Comparable responses were obtained, with 71% of the recording sites that responded during the icEEG- only session also responding during the icEEG- fMRI session. For all the remaining sites, nearby clusters (distant of 7 mm or less) also demonstrated significant HFA increase during the icEEG- fMRI session. Significant HFA increases were also observable at the single-trial level in icEEG- fMRI recordings. Our results show that low-amplitude icEEG signal components such as cognitive-induced HFAs can be reliably recorded with simultaneous fMRI. This paves the way for the use of icEEG- fMRI to address various fundamental and clinical issues, notably the identification of the neural correlates of the BOLD signal.

The data were collected from 16 normal-hearing participants in a double-oddball paradigm that contained a consonant (/ba/ to /da/) and vowel (/ba/ to /bu/) change in quiet and noise (speech-babble background at a 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio) conditions. Time frequency analysis was applied to obtain inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) measures in delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands for the P3 response. Behavioral measures included percent correct phoneme detection and reaction time as well as percent correct IEEE sentence recognition in quiet and in noise. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to determine possible brain-behavior correlates. A significant noise-induced reduction in P3 amplitude was found, accompanied by significantly longer P3 latency and decreases in ITPC across all frequency bands of interest. There was a differential effect of noise on consonant discrimination and vowel discrimination in both ERP and behavioral measures, such that noise impacted the detection of the consonant change more than the vowel change. The P3 amplitude and some of the ITPC and ERSP measures were significant predictors of speech perception at segmental- and sentence-levels across listening conditions and stimuli. These data demonstrate that the P3 response with its associated cortical oscillations represents a potential neurophysiological marker for speech perception in noise. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The ability to distinguish frequencies and patterns due to different stimuli is the basis for brain computer interfaces (BCIs) used for communication and control of neurologically disabled patients. Since such responses are recorded in presence of high levels of noise from background brain processes, the detection task is rather challenging. In this work, we propose a detection approach for VEPs based on Ramanujan Periodicity Transform matrices (RPT), which have shown promise in detecting periodicities in data. Our results show that the RPT-based approach can outperform conventional spectral techniques and the state-of-the-art correlation analysis, and is more compatible with real-time BCIs which have to work with short duration EEG epochs. The proposed approach is fairly robust to unknown natural latencies in brain response.

Using stereotactic EEG (SEEG) recordings, we aimed at identifying which of the brain regions involved in autonomic control trigger ictal tachycardia.& para;& para;Methods: The neural activity of several mesial temporal lobe structures including amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and lateral temporal lobe recorded with SEEG were collected during 37 TL seizures in 9 patients, using indices based on High Frequency Activity (HFA). R-R intervals (RR) monitoring and time-frequency spectral analysis were performed to assess parasympathetic (High frequency power (HF)) and sympathetic (Low frequency/High frequency (LF/HF) ratio) reactivities.& para;& para;Results: Tachycardia was associated with a significant increase in LF/HF ratio and decrease in HF. Autonomic cardiac changes were accompanied by simultaneous SEEG signal changes with an increase in seizure-related HFA in anterior hippocampal formation and amygdala, but not in insula.& para;& para;Conclusion: In our sample, TL seizures are thus accompanied by an early decrease in parasympathetic control of cardiac rhythm and by an increase of sympathetic tone, concomitant to seizure activity in anterior hippocampus and amygdala.& para;& para;Significance: These results support a pivotal role of hippocampus and amygdala in tachycardia occurring during TL seizures.

Alpha band (7-14 Hz) oscillations lateralize with spatial attention and rhythmically inhibit visual activity and awareness through pulses of inhibition. Here we show that human observers' awareness of spatially unattended targets is dependent on both alpha power and alpha phase at target onset. Following a predictive directional cue, alpha oscillations were entrained bilaterally using repetitive visual stimuli. Subsequently, we presented either spatially cued or uncued targets at SOAs either validly or invalidly predicted in time by the entrainers. Temporal validity maximally modulated perceptual performance outside the spatial focus of attention and was associated with both increased alpha power and increased neural entrainment of phase in the hemisphere processing spatially unattended information. The results demonstrate that alpha oscillations represent a pulsating inhibition, which impedes visual processing for unattended space.	[Kizuk, Sayeed A.

Both the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network and support vector machine (SVM) were used as training methods for the prediction.

This study investigated the effects of speech articulation features on the amplitude and latency of cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) components. The speech articulation features included the placing contrast and voicing contrast. 12 Malay subjects with normal hearing and 12 Malay subjects with SNHL were recruited for the study. The CAEPs response recorded at higher amplitude with longer latency when stimulated by voicing contrast cues compared to that of the placing contrast. Subjects with SNHL elicited greater amplitude with prolonged latencies in the majority of the CAEP components in both speech stimuli. The existence of different frequency spectral and time-varying acoustic cues of the speech stimuli was reflected by the CAEPs response strength and timing. We anticipate that the CAEPs responses could equip audiologist and clinicians with useful knowledge, concerning the potential deprivation experience by hearing impaired individuals, in auditory passive perception. This would help to determine what type of speech stimuli that might be useful in measuring speech perception abilities, especially in Malay Malaysian ethic group, for choosing a better rehabilitation program, since no such study conducted for evaluating speech perception among Malaysian clinical population.

Mice were submitted to treadmill running at moderate speed for 30 min, and their brain activity was monitored before and after exercise using electrocorticogram (ECG) recordings. After exercise, normal, but not APP/PS1 mice, a well established AD model, showed significantly increased ECG theta rhythm. At the same time normal, but not AD mice, showed significantly enhanced performance in a spatial memory test after exercise. Therefore, we postulate that a running bout coupled to pre-and post-exercise brain activity recordings will help identify individuals with cognitive alterations, by determining the presence or absence of exercise-specific changes in brain activity. Work in humans using a bout of moderate exercise plus electroencephalography, a clinically affordable procedure, is warranted.

Evaluation of band, baseline, and cognitive specificity of sensorimotor rhythm- and gamma-based neurofeedback	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognitive training; EEG; Neurofeedback; Resting state; Specificity; Tonic EEG	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; ENHANCING NEUROFEEDBACK; SELF-REGULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; BRAIN; INTELLIGENCE; PERFORMANCE	Neurofeedback (NF) is often criticized because of the lack of empirical evidence of its specificity. Our present study thus focused on the specificity of NF on three levels: band specificity, cognitive specificity, and baseline specificity. Ten healthy middle-aged individuals performed ten sessions of SMR (sensorimotor rhythm, 12-15 Hz) NF training. A second group (N = 10) received feedback of a narrow gamma band (40-43 Hz). Effects of NF on EEG resting measurements (tonic EEG) and cognitive functions (memory, intelligence) were evaluated using a pre-post design. Both training groups were able to linearly increase the target training frequencies (either SMR or gamma), indicating the trainability of these EEG frequencies. Both NF training protocols led to nonspecific changes in other frequency bands during NF training. While SMR NF only led to concomitant changes in slower frequencies, gamma training affected nearly the whole power spectrum. SMR NF specifically improved memory functions. Gamma training showed only marginal effects on cognitive functions. SMR power assessed during resting measurements significantly increased after SMR NF training compared to a pre-assessment, indicating specific effects of SMR NF on baseline/tonic EEG. The gamma group did not show any pre-post changes in their EEG resting activity. In conclusion, SMR NF specifically affects cognitive functions (cognitive specificity) and tonic EEG (baseline specificity), while increasing SMR during NF training nonspecifically affects slower EEG frequencies as well (band non-specificity). Gamma NF was associated with nonspecific effects on the EEG power spectrum during training, which did not lead to considerable changes in cognitive functions or baseline EEG activity.

To carry out this study, we explored the potentials of MODWT to decompose the signals into time-frequency sub-bands till sixth level. And demodulation analysis (DA) was investigated to reveal the subtle envelope information from the sub-bands. All obtained coefficients were then used to calculate LDN features, scale parameter (sigma) and shape parameter (mu), which were fed to a random forest classifier (RFC) for classification. Besides, some experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed model in the consideration of various wavelet functions as well as feature extractors. The implementation results demonstrated that our proposed technique has yielded remarkable classification performance for all the concerned problems and outperformed the reported methods in terms of the universality. The major finding of this research is that the proposed technique was capable of classifying EEG segments with satisfied accuracy and clinically acceptable computational time. These advantages have make our technique an attractive diagnostic and monitoring tool, which helps doctors in providing better and timely care for the patients.

J	Keller, AS; Payne, L; Sekuler, R				Keller, Arielle S.; Payne, Lisa; Sekuler, Robert			Characterizing the roles of alpha and theta oscillations in multisensory attention	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Attention; Multisensory; Oscillations; Alpha; Theta; EEG	BAND POWER; VISUAL-ATTENTION; PHASE SYNCHRONY; FRONTAL THETA; MEMORY; EEG; RESPONSES; INCREASES; COHERENCE; RHYTHMS	Cortical alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) appear to play a role in suppressing distractions when just one sensory modality is being attended, but do they also contribute when attention is distributed over multiple sensory modalities? For an answer, we examined cortical oscillations in human subjects who were dividing attention between auditory and visual sequences. In Experiment 1, subjects performed an oddball task with auditory, visual, or simultaneous audiovisual sequences in separate blocks, while the electroencephalogram was recorded using high-density scalp electrodes. Alpha oscillations were present continuously over posterior regions while subjects were attending to auditory sequences. This supports the idea that the brain suppresses processing of visual input in order to advantage auditory processing. During a divided-attention audiovisual condition, an oddball (a rare, unusual stimulus) occurred in either the auditory or the visual domain, requiring that attention be divided between the two modalities. Fronto-central theta band (4-7 Hz) activity was strongest in this audiovisual condition, when subjects monitored auditory and visual sequences simultaneously. Theta oscillations have been associated with both attention and with short-term memory. Experiment 2 sought to distinguish these possible roles of fronto-central theta activity during multisensory divided attention. Using a modified version of the oddball task from Experiment 1, Experiment 2 showed that differences in theta power among conditions were independent of short-term memory load. Ruling out theta's association with short-term memory, we conclude that fronto-central theta activity is likely a marker of multisensory divided attention.

Cortical dynamics of disfluency in adults who stutter	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						Disfluent speech; neural oscillations; phase coherence; stuttering	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; NEURONAL INTERACTIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; NONWORD REPETITION; EEG DATA; SPEECH; GAMMA; ACTIVATION; COHERENCE	Stuttering is a disorder of speech production whose origins have been traced to the central nervous system. One of the factors that may underlie stuttering is aberrant neural miscommunication within the speech motor network. It is thus argued that disfluency (any interruption in the forward flow of speech) in adults who stutter (AWS) could be associated with anomalous cortical dynamics. Aberrant brain activity has been demonstrated in AWS in the absence of overt disfluency, but recording neural activity during disfluency is more challenging. The paradigm adopted here took an important step that involved overt reading of long and complex speech tokens under continuous EEG recording. Anomalies in cortical dynamics preceding disfluency were assessed by subtracting out neural activity for fluent utterances from their disfluent counterparts. Differences in EEG spectral power involving alpha, beta, and gamma bands, as well as anomalies in phase-coherence involving the gamma band, were observed prior to the production of the disfluent utterances. These findings provide novel evidence for compromised cortical dynamics that directly precede disfluency in AWS.

Rhythmic Activity and Individual Variability in Recognition Memory: Theta Oscillations Correlate with Performance whereas Alpha Oscillations Correlate with ERPs	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG-ALPHA; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; MENTAL-IMAGERY; SEMANTIC MEMORY; TASK; RETRIEVAL; SYNCHRONIZATION	During study trials of a recognition memory task, alpha (approximate to 10 Hz) oscillations decrease, and concurrently, theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations increase when later memory is successful versus unsuccessful (subsequent memory effect). Likewise, at test, reduced alpha and increased theta activity are associated with successful memory (retrieval success effect). Here we take an individual-differences approach to test three hypotheses about theta and alpha oscillations in verbal, old/new recognition, measuring the difference in oscillations between hit trials and miss trials. First, we test the hypothesis that theta and alpha oscillations have a moderately mutually exclusive relationship; but no support for this hypothesis was found. Second, we test the hypothesis that theta oscillations explain not only memory effects within participants, but also individual differences. Supporting this prediction, durations of theta (but not alpha) oscillations at study and at test correlated significantly with d across participants. Third, we test the hypothesis that theta and alpha oscillations reflect familiarity and recollection processes by comparing oscillation measures to ERPs that are implicated in familiarity and recollection. The alpha-oscillation effects correlated with some ERP measures, but inversely, suggesting that the actions of alpha oscillations on memory processes are distinct from the roles of familiarity- and recollection-linked ERP signals. The theta-oscillation measures, despite differentiating hits from misses, did not correlate with any ERP measure; thus, theta oscillations may reflect elaborative processes not tapped by recollection-related ERPs. Our findings are consistent with alpha oscillations reflecting visual inattention, which can modulate memory, and with theta oscillations supporting recognition memory in ways that complement the most commonly studied ERPs.

This improvement is demonstrated by training several deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models on data from six participants who each perform several Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) sessions on five separate days spread out over a month-long period. Each participant-specific classifier is trained on the first four days of data and tested using the fifth's. Average classification accuracy of 93.0% is achieved using a deep LSTM architecture. These results represent a 59% decrease in error compared to the best previously published results for this dataset. This study additionally evaluates the significance of new features: all combinations of mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of EEG frequency-domain power distributions. Mean and variance are statistically significant features, while skewness and kurtosis are not. The overall performance of this approach is high enough to warrant evaluation for inclusion in operational systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is especially challenging when dedicated EOG channels are unavailable or when there are very few EEG channels available for independent component analysis based ocular artifact removal. It is even more challenging to avoid loss of the signal of interest during the artifact correction process, where the signal of interest can be multiple magnitudes weaker than the artifact. To address these issues, we propose a novel discriminative ocular artifact correction approach for feature learning in EEG analysis. Without extra ocular movement measurements, the artifact is extracted from raw EEG data, which is totally automatic and requires no visual inspection of artifacts. Then, artifact correction is optimized jointly with feature extraction by maximizing oscillatory correlations between trials from the same class and minimizing them between trials from different classes. We evaluate this approach on a real-world EEG dataset comprising 68 subjects performing cognitive tasks. The results showed that the approach is capable of not only suppressing the artifact components but also improving the discriminative power of a classifier with statistical significance. We also demonstrate that the proposed method addresses the confounding issues induced by ocular movements in cognitive EEG study.

Various EEG findings in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis have been reported, however, the correlation between the EEG findings and clinical course of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis remains unclear. We describe a patient with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with a focus on EEG findings, which included: status epilepticus, generalised rhythmic delta activity, excess beta activity, extreme delta brush, and paroxysmal alpha activity upon arousal from sleep, which we term"arou sal alpha pattern". Initially, status epilepticus was observed on the EEG when the patient was comatose with conjugate deviation. The EEG then indicated excess beta activity, followed by the emergence of continuous slow activity, including generalised rhythmic delta activity and extreme delta brush, in the most severe phase. Slow activity gradually faded in parallel with clinical amelioration. Excess beta activity persisted, even after the patient became almost independent in daily activities, and finally disappeared with full recovery. In summary, our patient with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis demonstrated slow activity on the EEG, including extreme delta brush during the most severe phase, which gradually faded in parallel with clinical amelioration, with excess beta activity persisting into the recovery phase.

Here we used neuronal oscillations in the human EEG to investigate sleep-dependent changes in the cortical memory trace. The retrieval activity for object-color associations was assessed immediately after encoding and after 3 hr of sleep or wakefulness. Sleep had beneficial effects on memory performance and led to reduced event-related theta and gamma power during the retrieval of associative memories. Furthermore, event-related alpha suppression was attenuated in the wake group for memorized and novel stimuli. There were no sleep-dependent changes in retrieval activity for missed items or items retrieved without color. Thus, the sleep-dependent reduction in theta and gamma oscillations was specific for the retrieval of associative memories. In line with theoretical accounts on sleep-dependent memory consolidation, decreased theta may indicate reduced mediotemporal activity because of a transfer of information into neocortical networks during sleep, whereas reduced parietal gamma may reflect effects of synaptic downscaling. Changes in alpha suppression in the wake group possibly index reduced attentional resources that may also contribute to a lower memory performance in this group. These findings indicate that the consolidation of associative memories during sleep is associated with profound changes in the cortical memory trace and relies on multiple neuronal processes working in concert.

Utilizing Retinotopic Mapping for a Multi-Target SSVEP BCI With a Single Flicker Frequency	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces; Neurocontrollers; Spatial filters; Pattern recognition	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; HALF-FIELD STIMULATION; VISUAL-EVOKED-RESPONSE; VEP; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; PATTERN; TIME	In brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that use the steady-state visual evoked response (SSVEP), the user selects a control command by directing attention overtly or covertly to one out of several flicker stimuli. The different control channels are encoded in the frequency, phase, or time domain of the flicker signals. Here, we present a new type of SSVEP BCI, which uses only a single flicker stimulus and yet affords controlling multiple channels. The approach rests on the observation that the relative position between the stimulus and the foci of overt attention result in distinct topographies of the SSVEP response on the scalp. By classifying these topographies, the computer can determine at which position the user is gazing. Offline data analysis in a study on 12 healthy volunteers revealed that 9 targets can be recognized with about 95 +/- 3% accuracy, corresponding to an information transfer rate (ITR) of 40.8 +/- 3.3 b/min on average. We explored how the classification accuracy is affected by the number of control channels, the trial length, and the number of EEG channels. Our findings suggest that the EEG data from five channels over parieto-occipital brain areas are sufficient for reliably classifying the topographies and that there is a large potential to improve the ITR by optimizing the trial length. The robust performance and the simple stimulation setup suggest that this approach is a prime candidate for applications on desktop and tablet computers.

If the same cortical ensembles are indeed used for encoding and storage of a given piece of information, forcing the sleeping brain to re-engage in task-intrinsic information processing should disturb the natural ongoing consolidation processes and therefore impair possible sleep benefits. Here we aimed at recreating an integral part of the sensory experience of a motor skill in a daytime nap, by means of a tactile stimulation. We hypothesized that tampering with the tactile component of a motor skill during sleep would result in hindered performance at retest, due to interference between the highly congruent incoming stimuli and the core skill trace. Contrary to our predictions, the tactile stimulation did not influence neither speed nor accuracy, when compared to natural sleep. However, an explbratory sleep EEG analysis revealed stimulation-induced alterations in the abundance and cortical topography of slow oscillations and spindles. These findings suggest that despite the lack of a significant effect on motor behavior, tactile stimulation induced changes in EEG features suggestive of a possible uncoupling between the sleep oscillations thought to underlie consolidation processes, i.e. slow oscillations and sleep spindles.

J	Chwedorowicz, R; Skarzynski, H; Pucek, W; Studzinski, T				Chwedorowicz, Roman; Skarzynski, Henryk; Pucek, Weronika; Studzinski, Tadeusz			Neurophysiological maturation in adolescence - vulnerability and counteracting addiction to alcohol	ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Review						adolescence; neurophysiological maturation; alcohol vulnerability; alcohol addiction; genetic markers; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); P3 amplitude; event-related oscillation (ERO)	CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; RISK; GENETICS; CHILDREN; AGE; OSCILLATIONS; DEPENDENCE; CHILDHOOD	The results of contemporary studies confirm the formation of two neural networks in the brain during the period of adolescence. The first is defined as emotional, located in the limbic system, develops earlier, quicker, and more intensively than the second one in the prefrontal cortex, called the judgement network, which fulfils the role of control and inhibition of emotional reactions. The domination of the emotional network in adolescence is manifested by hyperactivity of the limbic system, accompanied by intensified undertaking of courageous, reckless, risky, or even sometimes dangerous actions, so very characteristic in the maturation. The aim of the article is to present the state of the art in the field of latest achievements in experimental neurophysiology related to the maturation of the structural end functional processes in adolescents, and to alcohol vulnerability. Alcohol effect initiation starts in early adolescence, and therefore is connected with alcohol abuse and addiction in adulthood, which confirms the necessity for provision of an early prophylactic protection for juveniles, even before entering the phase of early adolescence. Some electrophysiological characteristics, such as low P3 amplitude of the Event-Related Potential (ERP) and Event-Related Oscillations (EROs), are manifested by their high risk offspring, and are considered to be biological markers (endophenotypes) of a predisposition to develop alcohol use disorders. Electroencephalographic oscillations induced within the range of the theta and delta waves (Event-Related Oscillation-ERO), considered as endophenotypes and markers of increased vulnerability for addiction, present three groups of genes and three types of neurotransmitters, with gamma aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine and glutamate as neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. A new research approach consisting in the application of electroencephalographic methods and techniques in developmental and genetic studies of the conditioning of varied vulnerability, and especially increased preferences for alcohol tasting and abuse in adolescence, provide unique possibilities for comprehensive and deepened studies which may contribute to the prevention of alcohol addiction, the genesis of which, to a great extent, is related with the effect of causative environmental and genetic factors during adolescent development.

This process is considered more reliable as it is done manually by experts. However, due to the fact that experts may also be mistaken, it has led to an increase in the importance given to automatic sleep staging studies. Many methods have been tested on the signals in order to increase the success of these systems. In this study, an automatic sleep staging system was implemented using the Hilbert-Huang transformation method which is a new time-frequency analysis type. In the study, EEG signals from 5 subjects were used in the sleep laboratory. In the 5-class (Alpha, Beta, Theta, Delta and Spindle bands) applications, the highest classification success was 84.75% as a result of sequential feature selection method.

J	Lee, S; Kim, D				Lee, Seonjin; Kim, Dongwook			Effect of Color Light Stimulation Using LED on Sleep Induction Time	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article								The effects of color are already being used widely. For this reason, in this study, an attempt was made to use such effects of color to examine the changes in sleep onset through the use of the preferred and nonpreferred color light stimulation. Color light stimulations were randomly presented to the subjects, and based on these colors, the changes in sleep onset were examined through the EEG. Also, to quantify the physiological changes that were caused by each color light stimulation, the changes in the HRV were examined through ECG to determine the level of activation of the autonomous nervous system. The results showed that sleep onset time was changed based on the light stimulation. The result of the EEG analysis showed that sleep onset time was most significantly shortened in preferred color light stimulation. Also, the result of HRV was the fastest change about both the time domain and the frequency domain in the preferred color light stimulation. Therefore, because the preferred color light stimulation activated the parasympathetic nervous system, sleep was induced quickly. Also, by simply using the HRV, the differences in the index of HRV showed changes of sleep onset according to the color light stimulation.

As physiological aging is related to a decrease in motor performance and changes in excitability and connectivity strength within cerebral sensorimotor circuits, we aimed to explore whether aging affects EEG-MEP interactions. Using MRI-navigated TMS and multichannel EEG, we compared the EEG-MEP interactions observed in healthy aged subjects with those observed in young volunteers. We divided the MEPs amplitude into two different subgroups consisting of "high" and "low" MEPs, based on the 50th percentile of their amplitude distribution. Then we analysed the characteristics of the pre-stimulus EEG from M1 and correlated areas separately for the "high" and "low" MEPs, comparing the two conditions. In both young and old subjects, significantly larger MEPs were evoked when the stimulated Ml was coupled in the beta-2 band with the homolateral prefrontal cortex. Conversely, only in young participants was the MEP size modulated when the M1 and homolateral parieto-occipital cortices were coupled in the delta band. The elderly didn't show this kind of pattern. Importantly, this coupling was significantly higher in elderly brains than in young brains, both for high and low MEPs. Our results suggest an age-related significant influence of time-varying coupling of spatially patterned EEG rhythms on motor cortex excitability in response to TMS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Dysregulation of immune responses and oxidative imbalance underpins this mental disorder. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CP) alone or combined with the natural antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on changes in the hippocampal average spectral power induced by ketamine (MET). Three days after stereotactic implantation of electrodes, male Wistar rats were divided into groups treated for 10 days with saline (control) or KET (10 mg/kg, IP). CP (1 or 5 mg/kg, IP) alone or combined with ALA (100 mg/kg, P.O.) was administered 30 min before MET or saline. Hippocampal EEG recordings were taken on the 1st, 5th and 10th days of treatment immediately after the last drug administration. KET significantly increased average spectral power of delta and gamma-high bands on the 5th and 10th days of treatment when compared to control. Gamma low-band significantly increased on the 1st, 5th and 10th days when compared to control group. This effect of KET was prevented by CP alone or combined with ALA. Indeed, the combination of ALA 100 CP1 potentiated the inhibitory effects of CP1 on gamma low -band oscillations. In conclusion, our results showed that KET presents excitatory and time-dependent effects on hippocampal EEG bands activity. MET excitatory effects on EEG were prevented by CP alone and in some situations potentiated by its combination with ALA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By elucidating the cortical networks responsible for these stochastic fluctuations in perception, we can potentially learn much about the neural correlates of visual awareness. We obtained concurrent EEG-fMRI data for a group of 20 healthy human subjects during the continuous presentation of dichoptic visual stimuli. The two eyes' images were tagged with different temporal frequencies so that eye specific steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signals could be extracted from the EEG data for direct comparison with changes in fMRI BOLD activity associated with binocular rivalry. We additionally included a smooth replay condition that emulated the perceptual transitions experienced during binocular rivalry as a control stimulus. We evaluated a novel SSVEP-informed fMRI analysis in this study in order to delineate the temporal dynamics of rivalry-related BOLD activity from both an electrophysiological and behavioral perspective. In this manner, we assessed BOLD activity during rivalry that was directly correlated with peaks and crosses of the two rivaling, frequency-tagged SSVEP signals, for comparison with BOLD activity associated with subject reported perceptual transitions. Our findings point to a critical role of a right lateralized fronto-parietal network in the processing of bistable stimuli, given that BOLD activity in the right superior/inferior parietal lobules was significantly elevated throughout binocular rivalry and in particular during perceptual transitions, compared with the replay condition. Based on the SSVEP-informed analysis, rivalry was further associated with significantly enhanced BOLD suppression in the posterior mid-cingulate cortex during perceptual transitions, compared with SSVEP crosses. Overall, this work points to a careful interplay between early visual areas, the right posterior parietal cortex and the mid-cingulate cortex in mediating the spontaneous perceptual changes associated with binocular rivalry and has significant implications for future multimodal imaging studies of perception and awareness.

The present study therefore investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha activity and asymmetries in apnoea divers (experts) compared to non-divers (novices). EEG of 10 apnoea and 10 non-divers were recorded in the laboratory for either four minutes or for two minutes of BI-I. Alpha activity and alpha asymmetry (i.e. hemispherical EEG differences) were calculated and compared between expertise level and BH duration. Alpha amplitude in experts significantly decreased at four minutes of BH compared to resting activity, while alpha amplitude significantly decreased in novices only at centro-parietal regions. Alpha-asymmetry analysis revealed that the experts' decrease in alpha at the end of BH was different in the frontal electrodes with the left prefrontal cortex activity higher than that in the right prefrontal cortex. This lateralized pattern reflected differential prefrontal processing of the unique psycho-physiological state of BH.

J	Jia, JR; Liu, L; Fang, F; Luo, H				Jia, Jianrong; Liu, Ling; Fang, Fang; Luo, Huan			Sequential sampling of visual objects during sustained attention	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; BEHAVIORAL OSCILLATIONS; UNATTENDED STIMULI; WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-BAND; PERCEPTION; EEG; INHIBITION; MODULATION; RESOLUTION	In a crowded visual scene, attention must be distributed efficiently and flexibly over time and space to accommodate different contexts. It is well established that selective attention enhances the corresponding neural responses, presumably implying that attention would persistently dwell on the task-relevant item. Meanwhile, recent studies, mostly in divided attentional contexts, suggest that attention does not remain stationary but samples objects alternately over time, suggesting a rhythmic view of attention. However, it remains unknown whether the dynamic mechanism essentially mediates attentional processes at a general level. Importantly, there is also a complete lack of direct neural evidence reflecting whether and how the brain rhythmically samples multiple visual objects during stimulus processing. To address these issues, in this study, we employed electroencephalography (EEG) and a temporal response function (TRF) approach, which can dissociate responses that exclusively represent a single object from the overall neuronal activity, to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of attention in various attentional contexts. First, attention, which is characterized by inhibitory alpha-band (approximately 10 Hz) activity in TRFs, switches between attended and unattended objects every approximately 200 ms, suggesting a sequential sampling even when attention is required to mostly stay on the attended object. Second, the attentional spatiotemporal pattern is modulated by the task context, such that alpha-mediated switching becomes increasingly prominent as the task requires a more uniform distribution of attention. Finally, the switching pattern correlates with attentional behavioral performance. Our work provides direct neural evidence supporting a generally central role of temporal organization mechanism in attention, such that multiple objects are sequentially sorted according to their priority in attentional contexts. The results suggest that selective attention, in addition to the classically posited attentional "focus," involves a dynamic mechanism for monitoring all objects outside of the focus. Our findings also suggest that attention implements a space (object)-to-time transformation by acting as a series of concatenating attentional chunks that operate on 1 object at a time.

J	Wang, J; Wang, J; Wan, Y; Li, XL				Wang, Jing; Wang, Juan; Wan, You; Li, Xiaoli			The Frontal area with higher Frequency response is the Principal Feature of laser-evoked Potentials in rats with chronic inflammatory Pain: a Parallel Factor analysis study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						chronic inflammatory pain; event-related potentials; parallel factor analysis; wavelet transform; rat	EEG; CORTEX; SHIFTS	Chronic pain is a pathological developing course of pain. In clinic, an objective indicator is needed for diagnosing and better controlling chronic pain. The abnormal neural responses in chronic pain are reflected by multiple event-related potentials (ERPs) in time, frequency, and location domain, respectively. However, multiple changes in ERPs are not applicable in clinic. So, the principal feature covered the most informative changes extracted from these three domains of ERP during the development of chronic pain is needed. In the present study, a parallel factor analysis method was employed to extract time-frequency-channel features of laser-evoked potential (LEP) simultaneously from rats with chronic inflammatory pain. Results showed that the main feature of LEP in channel domain locates in the frontal brain region in rats with chronic inflammatory pain while in the parietal brain region in control rats. In the frequency domain, the main frequency of LEP was significantly higher in chronic inflammatory pain rats than that in control rats. These findings indicate that the frontal region with higher frequency response to nociceptive information is the principal feature in the chronic pain state. Our study provided not only a principal feature of LEP but also a promising strategy for chronic pain, which is potential for clinic application.

ObjectivesThe study aims to reveal how individual differences in dopaminergic functioning due to genetic variations in the dopamine transporter gene influences behavioral and EEG correlates of recognition memory. MethodsFifty-eight participants performed an item recognition task. Participants were asked to retrieve 200 previously presented words while brain activity was recorded with EEG. Regions of interest were established in scalp locations associated with recognition memory. Mean ERP amplitudes and event-related spectral perturbations when correctly remembering old items (hits) and recognizing new items (correct rejections) were compared as a function of dopamine transporter group. ResultsParticipants in the dopamine transporter group that codes for increased dopamine transporter expression (10/10 homozygotes) display slower reaction times compared to participants in the dopamine transporter group associated with the expression of fewer dopamine transporters (9R-carriers). 10/10 homozygotes further displayed differences in ERP and oscillatory activity compared to 9R-carriers. 10/10 homozygotes fail to display the left parietal old/new effect, an ERP signature of recognition memory associated with the amount of information retrieved. 10/10 homozygotes also displayed greater decreases of alpha and beta oscillatory activity during item memory retrieval compared to 9R-carriers. ConclusionCompared to 9R-carriers, 10/10 homozygotes display slower hit and correct rejection reaction times, an absence of the left parietal old/new effect, and greater decreases in alpha and beta oscillatory activity during recognition memory. These results suggest that dopamine transporter polymorphisms influence recognition memory.

Group and individual data from 34 participants were considered. The participant's objective was to press a response key immediately following 4 non-repeating, single integer odd digits. These were presented amongst a continuous stream of digits and Xs. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from 32 electrodes (pooled to 12 regions). In the group analyses, participant EEG response was compared to baseline revealing that upper alpha desynchronised during anticipation, RE and RI; lower beta during anticipation and RE; and upper beta just RE. Upper alpha desynchronisation during rapid, unplanned RI is novel. Also, upper alpha and lower/upper beta synchronised during PRR. For upper alpha, we speculate this indexes brief cortical deactivation; for beta we propose this indexes response set maintenance. Lastly, lower alpha fluctuations correlated negatively with RT, indexing neural efficiency. Individual analyses involved calculation of the proportion of individuals displaying the typical RE and PRR trends; these were not reflected by all participants. The former was displayed individually by the largest proportion in upper alpha recorded left fronto-centrally; the latter was most reliably displayed individually in lower beta recorded mid centro-parietally. Therefore, group analyses identified typical alpha and beta synchronisation/desynchronisation trends, whilst individual analyses identified their degree of representation in single participants. Attention is drawn to the clinical relevance of this issue.

For this task, five minutes of spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from 22 patients with mild AD and 16 cognitively healthy controls were studied. To assess PAC patterns, phase-locking value was computed between the phase of low frequencies and the power of high frequencies within each sensor. Our results showed that high-frequency gamma power is phase-locked to the alpha peak in EEG signals. Furthermore, statistically significant differences (p<0.05, permutation test) between patients with mild AD and elderly controls were observed at the lower left temporo-parietal area, suggesting that early stages of AD elicit a region-specific decrease of PAC in the neural activity.

Cortical Alpha Oscillations Predict Speech Intelligibility	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech in noise; EEG; digits in noise; hearing; brain; attention	SECONDARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; NOISE SCREENING-TEST; BRAIN-STEM RESPONSE; NORMAL-HEARING; PARIETAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; COCKTAIL PARTY; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Understanding speech in noise (SiN) is a complex task involving sensory encoding and cognitive resources including working memory and attention. Previous work has shown that brain oscillations, particularly alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) play important roles in sensory processes involving working memory and attention. However, no previous study has examined brain oscillations during performance of a continuous speech perception test. The aim of this study was to measure cortical alpha during attentive listening in a commonly used SiN task (digits-in-noise, DiN) to better understand the neural processes associated with "top-down"cognitive processing in adverse listening environments. We recruited 14 normal hearing (NH) young adults. DiN speech reception threshold (SRT) was measured in an initial behavioral experiment. EEG activity was then collected: (i) while performing the DiN near SRT; and (ii) while attending to a silent, close-caption video during presentation of identical digit stimuli that the participant was instructed to ignore. Three main results were obtained: (1) during attentive ("active") listening to the DiN, a number of distinct neural oscillations were observed (mainly alpha with some beta; 15-30 Hz). No oscillations were observed during attention to the video ("passive"listening); (2) overall, alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) of central/parietal sources were observed during active listening when data were grand averaged across all participants. In some participants, a smaller magnitude alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD), originating in temporal regions, was observed; and (3) when individual EEG trials were sorted according to correct and incorrect digit identification, the temporal alpha ERD was consistently greater on correctly identified trials. No such consistency was observed with the central/parietal alpha ERS. These data demonstrate that changes in alpha activity are specific to listening conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows almost no brain oscillatory changes during a passive task compared to an active task in any sensory modality. Temporal alpha ERD was related to correct digit identification.

A state-of-the-art is a BCI based on hybrid frequency and phase coded SSVEP, which needs a large set of calibration data as reference signals, so-called individual templates. The aim of this study is to propose an approach to calibration reduction by generating from individual templates corresponding to apart of commands (source templates) to new templates corresponding to the rest of commands. The new templates can be obtained by shifting the frequency and phase of the source template to the desired frequency and phase. In this way, time and cost for calibration can be greatly reduced. The experimental results suggested that the proposed approach successfully transferred the source template, closely achieving the performance using the full calibration dataset.

The implantation effect: delay in seizure occurrence with implantation of intracranial electrodes	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; neuropharmacology	INTRACTABLE PARTIAL EPILEPSY; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG; BRAIN-STIMULATION; SEVOFLURANE; ISOFLURANE; DESFLURANE; INFLAMMATION; WITHDRAWAL	Objective: A transient decrease in seizure frequency has been identified during therapeutic brain stimulation trials with stimulator in patients in the inactive sham group. This study was performed to examine whether the implantation of intracranial electrodes decreases seizure occurrence and explores factors that may be associated. Methods: A retrospective review of 193 patients was performed, all evaluated with both scalp video EEG monitoring and intracranial EEG (iEEG) monitoring. Data about the number of seizures per day during the monitoring period, the number of days until the first seizure, anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), pain medications, types of implanted electrodes, and anesthetic agents were reviewed. We conducted a repeated measure analysis for counted data using generalized estimating equations with a log-link function and adjustment for number of days and anti-epileptic medication load on the previous day to compare seizure frequencies between scalp and iEEG monitoring. Results: The time to the first seizure was significantly prolonged during iEEG monitoring as compared to scalp monitoring after correction for AED withdrawal (hazard ratio: 0.81, CI 0.69-0.96). During scalp video EEG monitoring, patients experienced an average of 1.09 seizures/day vs 1.27 seizures/day during iEEG monitoring (P=.066). There was no significant difference in seizure frequency in patients that received craniotomy vs burr holes only for intracranial implantation. An increasing number of electrodes implanted increased the delay to seizures (P=.01). Of all anesthetic agents used, desflurane seemed to have an anticonvulsive effect compared to other anesthetics (P=.006). Pain medication did not influence delay to seizures. Significance: Seizures are delayed during iEEG as opposed to scalp monitoring illustrating the "implantation effect" previously observed. Surgical planning should account for longer monitoring periods, particularly when using larger intracranial arrays.	[Lane, M. A.; Kahlenberg, C. A.; Secore, K. L.; Thadani, V. M.; Bujarski, K.

J	Matsuda, T; Komaki, F				Matsuda, Takeru; Komaki, Fumiyasu			Time Series Decomposition into Oscillation Components and Phase Estimation	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							THETA-OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; PRIORS	Many time series are naturally considered as a superposition of several oscillation components. For example, electroencephalogram (EEG) time series include oscillation components such as alpha, beta, and gamma. We propose a method for decomposing time series into such oscillation components using state-space models. Based on the concept of random frequency modulation, gaussian linear state-space models for oscillation components are developed. In this model, the frequency of an oscillator fluctuates by noise. Time series decomposition is accomplished by this model like the Bayesian seasonal adjustment method. Since the model parameters are estimated from data by the empirical Bayes' method, the amplitudes and the frequencies of oscillation components are determined in a data-driven manner. Also, the appropriate number of oscillation components is determined with the Akaike information criterion (AIC). In this way, the proposed method provides a natural decomposition of the given time series into oscillation components. In neuroscience, the phase of neural time series plays an important role in neural information processing. The proposed method can be used to estimate the phase of each oscillation component and has several advantages over a conventional method based on the Hilbert transform. Thus, the proposed method enables an investigation of the phase dynamics of time series. Numerical results show that the proposed method succeeds in extracting intermittent oscillations like ripples and detecting the phase reset phenomena. We apply the proposed method to real data from various fields such as astronomy, ecology, tidology, and neuroscience.

The Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) measurement is an effective method for processing nonlinear dynamical analysis of electroencephalograms (EEGs), and has been used for emotion recognition in affective brain -computer interface (aBCI) systems. In this paper, an improved algorithm based on conventional LZC was proposed for resolving emotion recognition in EEGs. In the new method, the EEG signal was first preprocessed by employing wavelet packet transform to remove EEG series with low frequencies. Then, a nonlinear filter was used to remove ectopic values from the EEG. Furthermore, an effective adaptive LZC algorithm was proposed for measuring the complexity of EEG signals, and this method was applied to recognize emotions. The fluctuations of LZC sequences in designated electrode sites were constructed using three different LZC algorithms. Then, statistical analysis was carried out for group comparisons of the statistically significant fluctuation of LZC sequences. Finally, it was used as the classified features in a support vector machine classification algorithm. The experiment demonstrated that the proposed method effectively discovered more patterns occurring in EEG signals. Also, it precisely detected oscillations of EEG signals, which may help reveal intrinsic nonlinearity in EEG -based emotion recognition. The adaptive LZC algorithm reached a high average accuracy of 82.43%.

In prelingually deaf children, such difficulties may have detrimental consequences on the learning process and, later in life, on academic performance. Despite the importance of such a topic, currently, there is no validated test for the assessment of cognitive load during audiological tasks. Recently, alpha and theta EEG rhythm variations in the parietal and frontal areas, respectively, have been used as indicators of cognitive load in adult subjects. The aim of the present study was to investigate, by means of EEG, the cognitive load of pediatric subjects affected by asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss as they were engaged in a speech-in-noise identification task. Methods: Seven children (4F and 3M, age range = 8-16 years) affected by asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss (i.e. profound degree on one side, mild-to-severe degree on the other side) and using a hearing aid only in their better ear, were included in the study. All of them underwent EEG recording during a speech-in-noise identification task: the experimental conditions were quiet, binaural noise, noise to the better hearing ear and noise to the poorer hearing ear. The subjects' Speech Recognition Thresholds (SRT) were also measured in each test condition. The primary outcome measures were: frontal EEG Power Spectral Density (PSD) in the theta band and parietal EEG PSD in the alpha band, as assessed before stimulus (word) onset. Results: No statistically significant differences were noted among frontal theta power levels in the four test conditions. However, parietal alpha power levels were significantly higher in the "binaural noise" and in the "noise to worse hearing ear" conditions than in the "quiet" and "noise to better hearing ear" conditions (p < 0.001). SRT scores were consistent with task difficulty, but did not correlate with alpha and theta power level variations. Conclusion: This is the first time that EEG has been applied to children with sensorineural hearing loss with the purpose of studying the cognitive load during effortful listening. Significantly higher parietal alpha power levels in two of three noisy conditions, compared to the quiet condition, are consistent with increased cognitive load. Specifically, considering the time window of the analysis (pre-stimulus), parietal alpha power levels may be a measure of cognitive functions such as sustained attention and selective inhibition. In this respect, the significantly lower parietal alpha power levels in the most challenging listening condition (i.e. noise to the better ear) may be attributed to loss of attention and to the subsequent fatigue and "withdrawal" from the task at hand.

However, most of these studies examined EEG correlates at channel domain, which suffers the limitation that EEG signals are the mixture of multiple underlying neuronal sources due to the volume conduction effect. Moreover, few studies have been conducted in real-world tasks. To precisely probe EEG correlates with specific neural substrates to mental factors in real-world tasks, the present study examined EEG correlates to three mental factors, i.e., mental fatigue [also known as time-on-task (TOT) effect], workload and effort, in EEG component signals, which were obtained using an independent component analysis (ICA) on high-density EEG data. EEG data were recorded when subjects performed a realistically simulated air traffic control (ATC) task for 2 h. Five EEG independent component (IC) signals that were associated with specific neural substrates (i.e., the frontal, central medial, motor, parietal, occipital areas) were identified. Their spectral powers at their corresponding dominant bands, i.e., the theta power of the frontal IC and the alpha power of the other four ICs, were detected to be correlated to mental workload and effort levels, measured by behavioral metrics. Meanwhile, a linear regression analysis indicated that spectral powers at five ICs significantly increased with TOT. These findings indicated that different levels of mental factors can be sensitively reflected in EEG signals associated with various brain functions, including visual perception, cognitive processing, and motor outputs, in real-world tasks. These results can potentially aid in the development of efficient operational interfaces to ensure productivity and safety in ATC and beyond.

The present review focuses on few pivotal recent studies of our research team regarding graph theory application in functional dynamic connectivity investigated by electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis. The article is divided into two parts. The first describes the methodological approach to EEG functional connectivity data analysis. In the second part, network studies of physiological aging and neurological disorders are explored, with a particular focus on epilepsy and neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease.

However, few studies investigated the changes of global brain networks during the resting state in young smokers by EEG. In the present study, we used minimum spanning tree (MST) to assess the differences of global network efficiency between young smoker (n = 20) and nonsmokers (n = 20). Compared with healthy nonsmokers, young smokers showed decreased leaf fraction, kappa value, increased diameter and eccentricity value in alpha band (r = 0.574, p = 0.008), which suggested the global network efficiency was decreased in young smokers. We also found positive correlation between leaf fraction and onset time of smoking in smokers. These results provided more scientific evidence of the abnormal neural oscillations of young smokers and improved our understanding of smoking addiction.

Purpose - To investigate EEG functional connectivity (EEGfC) networks in 14 neurological disorders. Patients - Potentially eligible patients were collected from clinical and EEG databases. All the available clinical data and EEG records were critically revised. All the patients who suffered of a single neurological disorder (out of the 14) and had a good quality EEG recording entered the study. Confoundig factors as comorbidity and CNS-active drug effects were eliminated as far as possible. EEG analysis - Three minutes of resting-state, waking EEG activity were selected for analysis. Current source density (CSD) values were computed for 2394 cortical voxels by Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Thereafter, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between all pairs of 23 cortical regions of interest (ROI) in each hemisphere (LORETA Source Correlation, LSC software). Computation was carried out for conventional EEG broad bands and very narrow bands (1 Hz bandwidth) between 1 and 25 Hz as well. Correlation coefficients of each group were statistically compared to our normative EEG (LSC) database by two-talied t-tests. Bonferroni-corrected p<0.05 values were accepted as statistically significant, and were graphically displayed as topographical networks. Results and conclusion - Group-specific networks were demonstrated. However, non-specific networks, charasteristic for most groups, were detected as well. Common finding were: decreased connectivity in the alpha band and increased connectivity in the delta, theta bands and upper beta band. Decreased alpha-band connectivity presumably reflected primary lesional effects and on the other hand, non-specific vulnerability of "rich club connections". Increased connectivity in the slow bands presumably indicated adaptive-compensatory activity of brain homeostasis.

The present study investigates the evolution of visual expertise for printed stimuli with aging. Fifty-five participants of increasing age (20-30, 40-50,60-70,75-85 years old) were recruited. Behavioral and EEG data were collected during a lexical decision task, in which words and symbol strings were presented. Analyses of EEG data focused mainly on three major points: visual expertise for print, automatization of the expertise and differences in attentional demand between the processing of words and symbols. Results indicated a preservation of visual expertise with age, with larger N170 amplitude for words than for symbols. Moreover, a decrease in stimulus processing speed was observed as a function of age. No difference in attentional demand as a function of stimulus was observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the improved behavioral efficiency are unclear. Here, we investigated frontal theta dynamics-a neural mechanism involved in cognitive control processes-in long-term mindfulness meditators. The dynamics of EEG theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) recorded over the medial frontal cortex (MFC) were examined in terms of their power (MFC theta power) and their functional connectivity with other brain areas (the MFC-centered theta network). Using a flanker-type paradigm, EEG data were obtained from 22 long-term mindfulness meditators and compared to those from 23 matched controls without meditation experience. Meditators showed more efficient cognitive control after conflicts, evidenced by fewer error responses irrespective of response timing. Furthermore, meditators exhibited enhanced conflict modulations of the MFC-centered theta network shortly before the response, in particular for the functional connection between the MFC and the motor cortex. In contrast, MFC theta power was comparable between groups. These results suggest that the higher behavioral efficiency after conflicts in mindfulness meditators could be a function of increased engagement to control the motor system in association with the MFC-centered theta network.

Statistical learning is crucial in predictive processing, and in the acquisition of perceptual, motor, cognitive, and social skills. Although previous studies have revealed competitive neu-rocognitive processes underlying statistical learning, the neural communication of the related brain regions (functional connectivity, FC) has not yet been investigated. The present study aimed to fill this gap by investigating FC networks that promote statistical learning in humans. Young adults (N = 28) performed a statistical learning task while 128-channels EEG was acquired. The task involved probabilistic sequences, which enabled to measure incidental/implicit learning of conditional probabilities. Phase synchronization in seven frequency bands was used to quantify FC between cortical regions during the first, second, and third periods of the learning task, respectively. Here we show that statistical learning is negatively correlated with FC of the anterior brain regions in slow (theta) and fast (beta) oscillations. These negative correlations increased as the learning progressed. Our findings provide evidence that dynamic antagonist brain networks serve a hallmark of statistical learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have reported that trial-by-trial neural variability is reduced (quenched) by the presentation of a stimulus. However, the functional significance and behavioral relevance of variability quenching and the potential physiological mechanisms that may drive it have been studied only rarely. Here, we recorded neural activity with EEG as subjects performed a two-interval forced-choice contrast discrimination task. Trial-by-trial neural variability was quenched by similar to 40% after the presentation of the stimulus relative to the variability apparent before stimulus presentation, yet there were large differences in the magnitude of variability quenching across subjects. Individual magnitudes of quenching predicted individual discrimination capabilities such that subjects who exhibited larger quenching had smaller contrast discrimination thresholds and steeper psychometric function slopes. Furthermore, the magnitude of variability quenching was strongly correlated with a reduction in broadband EEG power after stimulus presentation. Our results suggest that neural variability quenching is achieved by reducing the amplitude of broadband neural oscillations after sensory input, which yields relatively more reproducible cortical activity across trials and enables superior perceptual abilities in individuals who quench more.

Few studies have identified HFOs in noninvasive EEG and MEG signals due to the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required, but beamforming-based virtual sensors (VS) can increase SNR. We computed the beamforming-VS as a grid inside the brain volume model for 200 s MEG signals. Events of interest (EOIs) exceeding a threshold were automatically determined as well as the area of interest, where EOIs occurred more frequently. Finally HFOs inside the area of interest were selected and compared with simultaneous iEEG recordings.

J	Aviyente, S; Tootell, A; Bernat, EM				Aviyente, Selin; Tootell, Anne; Bernat, Edward M.			Time-frequency phase-synchrony approaches with ERPs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Time-frequency; Phase synchrony; Functional connectivity; Medial frontal theta	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WAVELET ANALYSIS; ERROR-DETECTION; MIDLINE THETA; EEG COHERENCE; BRAIN; COMPONENTS	Time-frequency signal processing approaches are well-developed, and have been widely employed for the study of the energy distribution of event-related potential (ERP) data across time and frequency. Wavelet time frequency transform (TFT) and Cohen's class of time-frequency distributions (TFD) are the most widely used in the field. While ERP TFT approaches have been most extensively developed for amplitude measures, reflecting the magnitude of regional neuronal activity, time-frequency phase-synchrony measures have gained increased utility in recent years for the assessment of functional connectivity. Phase synchrony measures can be used to index the functional integration between regions (interregional), in addition to the consistency of activity within region (intertrial). In this paper, we focus on a particular class of time-frequency distributions belonging to Cohen's class, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID) for quantifying functional connectivity, which we recently introduced (Aviyente et al., 2011). The present report first summarizes common time frequency approaches to computing phase-synchrony with ERP data in order to highlight the similarities and differences relative to the RID. In previous work, we demonstrated differences between the RID and wavelet approaches to indexing phase-synchrony, and have applied the RID to demonstrate that RID-based time frequency phase-synchrony measures can index increased functional connectivity between medial and lateral prefrontal regions during control processing, observed in the theta band during the error-related negativity (ERN). Because ERN amplitude measures have been associated with two other widely studied medial-frontal theta components (no-go N2; feedback negativity, FN), the application of the RID phase synchrony measure in the present report extends our previous work with ERN to include theta activity during the no-go N2 (inhibitory processing) and the feedback negativity (FN; loss feedback processing). Findings support the idea that similar medial-lateral prefrontal functional connectivity underlies the ERN, no-go N2, and FN components, and provide initial validation that the proposed RID-based time-frequency phase-synchrony measure can index this activity.

Dynamics of high frequency brain activity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP; NOISE; MECHANISM; MEMBRANE; BEHAVIOR; RAT	Evidence suggests that electroencephalographic (EEG) activity extends far beyond the traditional frequency range. Much of the prior study of > 120 Hz EEG is in epileptic brains. In the current work, we measured EEG activity in the range of 200 to 2000 Hz, in the brains of healthy, spontaneously behaving rats. Both arrhythmic (1/f-type) and rhythmic (band) activities were identified and their properties shown to depend on EEG-defined stage of sleep/wakefulness. The inverse power law exponent of 1/f-type noise is shown to decrease from 3.08 in REM and 2.58 in NonREM to a value of 1.99 in the Waking state. Such a trend represents a transition from long-to short-term memory processes when examined in terms of the corresponding Hurst index. In addition, treating the 1/f-type activity as baseline noise reveals the presence of two, newly identified, high frequency EEG bands. The first band (psi) is centered between 260-280 Hz; the second, and stronger, band is a broad peak in the 400-500 Hz range (termed omega). Both of these peaks display lognormal distributions. The functional significance of these frequency bands is supported by the variation in the strength of the peaks with EEG-defined sleep/wakefulness.

This paper proposed a method which utilized the inter/intra-region phase synchronization and functional units (FUs) to explore whether EEG synchronization changes from the alert state to the fatigue state. Mean phase coherence (MPC) is adopted as a measure for the phase synchronization. In order to find spatial-frequency features associated with mental state, we studied the intra/inter-region phase synchronization of EEG in different frequencies. The major finding is that EEG synchronizations in delta and alpha bands in frontal and parietal lobe are significantly increased as the mental state of the driver shifted from alertness to fatigue. This finding is simultaneously validated by NASA-Task Load Index (TLX) and Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS). The statistical analysis results suggest MPC may be used to distinguish between alert and fatigue state of mind. In addition, the another contribution of the work indicates a simple and significant spatial-frequency pair of electrodes, i.e., Fz-Oz in delta band, to evaluate driver fatigue. It helps to implement real-world applications with wearable EEG equipment.

J	Raduntz, T				Raduentz, Thea			Dual Frequency Head Maps: A New Method for Indexing Mental Workload Continuously during Execution of Cognitive Tasks	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						mental workload; electroencephalography; biomedical signal processing; pattern recognition; state monitoring	WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENT; ALPHA; LOAD; INTERFERENCE; PERFORMANCE; RETENTION; RESPONSES; FEATURES	One goal of advanced information and communication technology is to simplify work. However, there is growing consensus regarding the negative consequences of inappropriate workload on employee's health and the safety of persons. In order to develop a method for continuous mental workload monitoring, we implemented a task battery consisting of cognitive tasks with diverse levels of complexity and difficulty. We conducted experiments and registered the electroencephalogram (EEG), performance data, and the NASA-TLX questionnaire from 54 people. Analysis of the EEG spectra demonstrates an increase of the frontal theta band power and a decrease of the parietal alpha band power, both under increasing task difficulty level. Based on these findings we implemented a new method for monitoring mental workload, the so-called Dual Frequency Head Maps (DFHM) that are classified by support vectors machines (SVMs) in three different workload levels. The results are in accordance with the expected difficulty levels arising from the requirements of the tasks on the executive functions. Furthermore, this article includes an empirical validation of the new method on a secondary subset with new subjects and one additional new task without any adjustment of the classifiers. Hence, the main advantage of the proposed method compared with the existing solutions is that it provides an automatic, continuous classification of the mental workload state without any need for retraining the classifier-neither for new subjects nor for new tasks. The continuous workload monitoring can help ensure good working conditions, maintain a good level of performance, and simultaneously preserve a good state of health.

Equally important is the ability to understand the underlying factors that drive or characterize viewer's decision to watch a movie. Traditional approaches (which involve pilot test-screenings, questionnaires, and focus groups) have reached a plateau in their ability to predict the population-wide responses to new movies. In this study, we develop a novel computational approach for extracting neurophysiological electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-gaze based metrics to predict the population-wide behavior of movie goers. We further, explore the connection of the derived metrics to the underlying cognitive processes that might drive moviegoers' decision to watch a movie. Towards that, we recorded neural activity-through the use of EEG-and eye-gaze activity from a group of naive individuals while watching movie trailers of pre-selected movies for which the population-wide preference is captured by the movie's market performance (i.e., box-office ticket sales in the US). Our findings show that the neural based metrics, derived using the proposed methodology, carry predictive information about the broader audience decisions to watch a movie, above and beyond traditional methods. In particular, neural metrics are shown to predict up to 72% of the variance of the films' performance at their premiere and up to 67% of the variance at following weekends; which corresponds to a 23-fold increase in prediction accuracy compared to current neurophysiological or traditional methods. We discuss our findings in the context of existing literature and hypothesize on the possible connection of the derived neurophysiological metrics to cognitive states of focused attention, the encoding of long-term memory, and the synchronization of different components of the brain's rewards network. Beyond the practical implication in predicting and understanding the behavior of moviegoers, the proposed approach can facilitate the use of video stimuli in neuroscience research; such as the study of individual differences in attention-deficit disorders, and the study of desensitization to media violence.

These can be observed through various aspects of cognition such as intelligence and perceptual ability. Studies have shown that both mental constituents originate from the same neurological substrate in the prefrontal cortex. Hence, the paper discusses the relationship between intelligence and perceptual ability using electroencephalogram (EEG) features. The study is based on resting brainwave of fifty samples and focused on the left and right prefrontal cortex. The intelligence quotient (IQ) scores obtained are then used to establish the control groups. Subsequently, the pattern of alpha and theta power ratio for each IQ level is observed and successfully correlated with perceptual ability through the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis of intelligence.

A systematic review of EEG and MEG studies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPECTRUM DISORDER; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; RESTING-STATE; WHITE-MATTER; INTERHEMISPHERIC CONNECTIVITY; YOUNG-CHILDREN; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS	Background Although it is well recognized that autism is associated with altered patterns of over-and under-connectivity, specifics are still a matter of debate. Little has been done so far to synthesize available literature using whole-brain electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Objectives 1) To systematically review the literature on EEG/MEG functional and effective connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 2) to synthesize and critically appraise findings related with the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by long-range underconnectivity and local overconnectivity, and 3) to provide, based on the literature, an analysis of tentative factors that are likely to mediate association between ASD and atypical connectivity (e.g., development, topography, lateralization). Methods Literature reviews were done using PubMed and PsychInfo databases. Abstracts were screened, and only relevant articles were analyzed based on the objectives of this paper. Special attention was paid to the methodological characteristics that could have created variability in outcomes reported between studies. Results Our synthesis provides relatively strong support for long-range underconnectivity in ASD, whereas the status of local connectivity remains unclear. This observation was also mirrored by a similar relationship with lower frequencies being often associated with underconnectivity and higher frequencies being associated with both under-and over-connectivity. Putting together these observations, we propose that ASD is characterized by a general trend toward an under-expression of lower-band wide-spread integrative processes compensated by more focal, higher-frequency, locally specialized, and segregated processes. Further investigation is, however, needed to corroborate the conclusion and its generalizability across different tasks. Of note, abnormal lateralization in ASD, specifically an elevated left-over-right EEG and MEG functional connectivity ratio, has been also reported consistently across studies. Conclusions The large variability in study samples and methodology makes a systematic quantitative analysis (i.e. meta-analysis) of this body of research impossible. Nevertheless, a general trend supporting the hypothesis of long-range functional underconnectivity can be observed.

Temporal Expectations Guide Dynamic Prioritization in Visual Working Memory through Attenuated alpha Oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; attention; neuronal oscillations; temporal attention; working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ORIENTING ATTENTION; INFORMATION; MODULATION; GAMMA; FOCUS; LOCATIONS; BETA; EEG; SUPPRESSION	Although working memory is generally considered a highly dynamic mnemonic store, popular laboratory tasks used to understand its psychological and neural mechanisms (such as change detection and continuous reproduction) often remain relatively "static," involving the retention of a set number of items throughout a shared delay interval. In the current study, we investigated visual working memory in a more dynamic setting, and assessed the following: (1) whether internally guided temporal expectations can dynamically and reversibly prioritize individual mnemonic items at specific times at which they are deemed most relevant; and (2) the neural substrates that support such dynamic prioritization. Participants encoded two differently colored oriented bars into visual working memory to retrieve the orientation of one bar with a precision judgment when subsequently probed. To test for the flexible temporal control to access and retrieve remembered items, we manipulated the probability for each of the two bars to be probed over time, and recorded EEG in healthy human volunteers. Temporal expectations had a profound influence on working memory performance, leading to faster access times as well as more accurate orientation reproductions for items that were probed at expected times. Furthermore, this dynamic prioritization was associated with the temporally specific attenuation of contralateral alpha (8-14 Hz) oscillations that, moreover, predicted working memory access times on a trial-by-trial basis. We conclude that attentional prioritization in working memory can be dynamically steered by internally guided temporal expectations, and is supported by the attenuation of alpha oscillations in task-relevant sensory brain areas.

Strain-dependence of the Angelman Syndrome phenotypes in Ube3a maternal deficiency mice	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SLEEP DISTURBANCES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; GENETIC-ASPECTS; MOUSE MODEL; EEG; EPILEPSY; 15Q11-13; ABNORMALITIES; GENOTYPES; PATTERNS	Angelman syndrome (AS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, most commonly caused by deletion or mutation of the maternal allele of the UBE3A gene, with behavioral phenotypes and seizures as key features. Currently no treatment is available, and therapeutics are often ineffective in controlling AS-associated seizures. Previous publications using the Ube3a maternal deletion model have shown behavioral and seizure susceptibility phenotypes, however findings have been variable and merit characterization of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. In this study, we extend previous studies comparing the effect of genetic background on the AS phenotype by investigating the behavioral profile, EEG activity, and seizure threshold. AS C57BL/6J mice displayed robust behavioral impairments, spontaneous EEG polyspikes, and increased cortical and hippocampal power primarily driven by delta and theta frequencies. AS 129 mice performed poorly on wire hang and contextual fear conditioning and exhibited a lower seizure threshold and altered spectral power. AS F1 hybrid mice (C57BL/6J x 129) showed milder behavioral impairments, infrequent EEG polyspikes, and fewer spectral power alterations. These findings indicate the effect of common genetic backgrounds on the Ube3a maternal deletion behavioral, EEG, and seizure threshold phenotypes. Our results will inform future studies on the optimal strain for evaluating therapeutics with different AS-like phenotypes.

Because of the abnormal electrical activities occurring in the brain, the occurrence of epileptic seizures become prominent. In epilepsy research, convulsions too are sometimes related to epileptic seizures. So to investigate and understand the brain's electrical activity, recording the scalp is important and that can be done with the help of Electroencephalograph (EEG). The time consumption with the long term measurements is enormous and so reviewing it becomes quite a hectic task. So the need for an automatic detection of seizures is required. As the long term measurements produce a huge amount of data, it would be pretty difficult to process and so with the help of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), the dimensions of the data are reduced. Then it is transmitted via a Space Time Block Coded Multiple Input Single Output (2 x 1) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (STBC MISO-OFDM) System. As the system has a high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR), it is reduced with the help of Hadamard Based PAPR Reduction and then at the receiver the Bit Error Rate (BER) is computed. Also at the receiver side, the classifier employed is Linear Kernel Support Vector Machines (L-SVM). Finally the epilepsy risk level classification from EEG Signals is measured in terms in Specificity, Sensitivity, Accuracy, Time Delay and Quality Values.	[Prabhakar, S.

Sixty-one university students were randomized to a 15-min single-session MM (n = 24), NFB (n = 17), or sham-NFB (SHAM; n = 20) intervention and were compared on EEG alpha full and sub-band amplitudes during completion of a single 15-min session of either intervention across 5 successive 3-min epochs, as well as during performance of the Stroop test. MM and NFB participants demonstrated higher global full-band alpha amplitude when compared with SHAM participants during the final intervention epoch, whereas no group differences were observed for sub-band amplitudes. In the absence of group differences in behavioral performance, MM participants exhibited a lower ERD of the upper alpha-band within frontal cortex 200-400 ms post-stimulus on the Stroop task, an effect that correlated with upper alpha amplitudes demonstrated during the intervention. Future research directions are discussed.

J	Minami, S; Amano, K				Minami, Sorato; Amano, Kaoru			Illusory Jitter Perceived at the Frequency of Alpha Oscillations	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							INDUCED SPATIAL CONFLICT; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; CORTEX; BRAIN; EEG; FEEDFORWARD; ATTENTION	Neural oscillations, such as alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-100 Hz), are widespread across cortical areas, and their possible functional roles include feature binding [1], neuronal communication [2, 3], and memory [1, 4]. The most prominent signal among these neural oscillations is the alpha oscillation. Although accumulating evidence suggests that alpha oscillations correlate with various aspects of visual processing [5-18], the number of studies proving their causal contribution in visual perception is limited [11, 16-18]. Here we report that illusory visual vibrations are consciously experienced at the frequency of intrinsic alpha oscillations. We employed an illusory jitter perception termed the motion-induced spatial conflict [19] that originates from the cyclic interaction between motion and shape processing. Comparison between the perceived frequency of illusory jitter and the peak alpha frequency (PAF) measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed that the inter-and intra-participant variations of the PAF aremirrored by an illusory jitter perception. More crucially, psychophysical and MEG measurements during amplitude-modulated current stimulation [20] showed that the PAF can be artificially manipulated, which results in a corresponding change in the perceived jitter frequency. These results suggest the causal contribution of neural oscillations at the alpha frequency in creating temporal characteristics of visual perception. Our results suggest that cortical areas, dorsal and ventral visual areas in this case, are interacting at the frequency of alpha oscillations [2, 3, 21-27].

J	Sharif, B; Jafari, AH				Sharif, Babak; Jafari, Amir Homayoun			Prediction of epileptic seizures from EEG using analysis of ictal rules on Poincare plane	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Epileptic seizure prediction; Poincare plane; Dynamic pattern; Fuzzy rule	SPECTRAL POWER	Background and Objective: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes recurrent and abrupt seizures which makes the patients insecure. Predicting seizures can reduce the burdens of this disorder. Methods: A new approach in seizure prediction is presented that includes a novel technique in feature extraction from EEG. The algorithm firsts creates an embedding space from EEG time series. Then it takes samples with most of the information using an optimized and data specific Poincare plane. In order to quantify small dynamics on the Poincare plane, based on the order of locations of Poincare samples in the sequence, 64 fuzzy rules in each channel are defined. Features are extracted based on the frequency distribution of these fuzzy rules in each minute. Then features with higher variance are selected as ictal features and again reduced using PCA. Finally, in order to evaluate how these innovative features can increase the performance of the seizure prediction algorithm, the transition from interictal to preictal state is scored utilizing SVM. Results: The algorithm is tested on 460 h of EEG from 19 patients of Freiburg dataset who had at least 3 seizures. Considering maximum Seizure Prediction Horizon of 42 minutes, average sensitivity was 91.8 96.6% and average false prediction rate was 0.05 - 0.08/h. Conclusions: The presented algorithm shows a better performance and more robustness compare to most of existing methods, and shows power in extracting optimal features from EEG.

The emotion elicitation in an electroencephalogram (EEG) is a novel area to evaluate methods for emotional differences from brain signals. In this paper, utilizing the idea of joint instantaneous frequency of multivariate data, a multivariate extension of pseudo Wigner distribution is used for emotion recognition from EEG signals, in which different window sizes are employed to interpret the results. As a preliminary study, the best results are obtained as 90%, 75%, 65% in terms of valence, arousal and dominance scale respectively for larger window size.

While wearable technologies are available today, many of these technologies are limited to data collection only. Embedded processors have minimal computational capabilities. We propose an efficient implementation of the Stockwell Transform which can enable real-time time-frequency analysis of biological signals in a microcontroller. The method is built upon the fact that the Stockwell Transform can be implemented as a compact filter bank with pre-computed filter taps. Additionally, due to the long tails of the gaussian windowing function, low amplitude filter taps can be removed. The method was implemented on a TI MSP430 processor. Simulated ECG data was fed into the processor to demonstrate performance and evaluate computational efficiency.

Jennifer			Chronic Paroxetine Treatment Prevents the Emergence of Abnormal Electroencephalogram Oscillations in Huntington's Disease Mice	NEUROTHERAPEUTICS			English	Article						SSRI; Quantitative EEG; Gamma power; Theta oscillation; Biomarker	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; OF-THE-LITERATURE; R6/2 MOUSE MODEL; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; VISUAL-CORTEX; POWER SPECTRA; REM-SLEEP; EEG	Disturbance of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep appears early in both patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and mouse models of HD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are widely prescribed for patients with HD, and are also known to suppress REM sleep in healthy subjects. To test whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can correct abnormal REM sleep and sleep-dependent brain oscillations in HD mice, we treated wild-type and symptomatic R6/2 mice acutely with vehicle and paroxetine (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg). In addition, we treated a group of R6/2 mice chronically with vehicle or paroxetine (20 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks, with treatment starting before the onset of overt motor symptoms. During and after treatment, we recorded electroencephalogram/electromyogram from the mice. We found that both acute and chronic paroxetine treatment normalized REM sleep in R6/2 mice. However, only chronic paroxetine treatment prevented the emergence of abnormal low-gamma (25-45 Hz) electroencephalogram oscillations in R6/2 mice, an effect that persisted for at least 2 weeks after treatment stopped. Chronic paroxetine treatment also normalized REM sleep theta rhythm in R6/2 mice, but, interestingly, this effect was restricted to the treatment period. By contrast, acute paroxetine treatment slowed REM sleep theta rhythm in WT mice but had no effect on abnormal theta or low-gamma oscillations in R6/2 mice. Our data show that paroxetine treatment, when initiated before the onset of symptoms, corrects both REM sleep disturbances and abnormal brain oscillations, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between early disruption of REM sleep and the subsequent abnormal brain activity in HD mice.

It has found various applications in EEG research and clinical practice, including the assessment of anesthetic depth, the identification of epileptic seizures, and more recently, the evaluation of non-linear cross-frequency brain functional connectivity. However, the validity and reliability of the indices drawn from bispectral analysis of EEG signals are potentially biased by the use of a non-neutral EEG reference. The present study aims at investigating the effects of the reference choice on the analysis of the non-linear features of EEG signals through bicoherence, as well as on the estimation of cross-frequency EEG connectivity through two different non-linear measures, i.e., the cross-bicoherence and the antisymmetric cross-bicoherence. To this end, four commonly used reference schemes were considered: the vertex electrode (Cz), the digitally linked mastoids, the average reference, and the Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST). The reference effects were assessed both in simulations and in a real EEG experiment. The simulations allowed to investigated: (i) the effects of the electrode density on the performance of the above references in the estimation of bispectral measures; and (ii) the effects of the head model accuracy in the performance of the REST. For real data, the EEG signals recorded from 10 subjects during eyes open resting state were examined, and the distortions induced by the reference choice in the patterns of alpha-beta bicoherence, cross-bicoherence, and antisymmetric cross-bicoherence were assessed. The results showed significant differences in the findings depending on the chosen reference, with the REST providing superior performance than all the other references in approximating the ideal neutral reference. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of considering the effects of the reference choice in the interpretation and comparison of the results of bispectral analysis of scalp EEG.

However, online FR detection is restricted by their low signal-to-noise ratio. Here we propose the integration of low-noise EEG with unsupervised FR detection. Methods: Pre-and post-resection ECoG (N = 9 patients) was simultaneously recorded by a commercial device (CD) and by a custom-made low-noise amplifier (LNA). FR were analyzed by an automated detector previously validated on visual markings in a different dataset. Results: Across all recordings, in the FR band the background noise was lower in LNA than in CD (p < 0.001). FR rates were higher in LNA than CD recordings (0.9 +/- 1.4 vs 0.4 +/- 0.9, p < 0.001). Comparison between FR rates in post-resection ECoG and surgery outcome resulted in positive predictive value PPV = 100% in CD and LNA, and negative predictive value NPV = 38% in CD and NPV = 50% for LNA. Prediction accuracy was 44% for CD and 67% for LNA. Conclusions: Prediction of seizure outcome was improved by the optimal integration of low-noise EEG and unsupervised FR detection. Significance: Accurate, automated and fast FR rating is essential for consideration of FR in the intraoperative setting.

In this paper, we examined the neurophysiological differences between the abstinent heroin addicts (AHAs) and healthy controls (HCs) using nonlinear dynamic analysis and source localization analysis in resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) data; 5 min resting EEG data from 20 AHAs and twenty age-, education-, and gender-matched HCs were recorded using 64 electrodes. The results of nonlinear characteristics (e.g., the correlation dimension, Kolmogorov entropy, and Lempel-Ziv complexity) showed that the EEG signals in alpha band from AHAs were significantly more irregular. Moreover, the source localization results confirmed the neuronal activities in alpha band in AHAs were significantly weaker in parietal lobe (BA3 and BA7), frontal lobe (BA4 and BA6), and limbic lobe (BA24). Together, our analysis at both the sensor level and source level suggested the functional abnormalities in the brain during heroin abstinence, in particular for the neuronal oscillations in alpha band.

While in a laboratory environment, artifacts and interference can, to a large extent, be avoided or controlled, in real-life scenarios this is a challenge. Ear-EEG is a concept where EEG is acquired from electrodes in the ear. Methods: We present a characterization of physiological artifacts generated in a controlled environment for nine subjects. The influence of the artifacts was quantified in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) deterioration of the auditory steady-state response. Alpha band modulation was also studied in an open/closed eyes paradigm. Results: Artifacts related to jaw muscle contractions were present all over the scalp and in the ear, with the highest SNR deteriorations in the gamma band. The SNR deterioration for jaw artifacts were in general higher in the ear compared to the scalp. Whereas eye-blinking did not influence the SNR in the ear, it was significant for all groups of scalps electrodes in the delta and theta bands. Eye movements resulted in statistical significant SNR deterioration in both frontal, temporal and ear electrodes. Recordings of alpha band modulation showed increased power and coherence of the EEG for ear and scalp electrodes in the closed-eyes periods. Conclusions: Ear-EEG is a method developed for unobtrusive and discreet recording over long periods of time and in real-life environments. This study investigated the influence of the most important types of physiological artifacts, and demonstrated that spontaneous activity, in terms of alpha band oscillations, could be recorded from the ear-EEG platform. In its present form ear-EEG was more prone to jaw related artifacts and less prone to eye-blinking artifacts compared to state-of-the-art scalp based systems.

Yet the central processing of cold thermosensation in the human brain has not been extensively studied. Here, we used magnetoencephalography and EEG in healthy volunteers to investigate the time course (evoked fields and potentials) and oscillatory activity associated with the perception of cold temperature changes. Nonnoxious cold stimuli consisting of Delta 3 degrees C and Delta 5 degrees C decrements from an adapting temperature of 35 degrees C were delivered on the dorsum of the left hand via a contact thermode. Coldevoked fields peaked at around 240 and 500 ms, at peak latencies similar to the N1 and P2 cold-evoked potentials. Importantly, coldrelated changes in oscillatory power indicated that innocuous thermosensation is mediated by oscillatory activity in the range of delta (1-4 Hz) and gamma (55-90 Hz) rhythms, originating in operculoinsular cortical regions. We suggest that delta rhythms coordinate functional integration between operculo-insular and frontoparietal regions, while gamma rhythms reflect local sensory processing in operculo-insular areas. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using magnetoencephalography, we identified spatiotemporal features of central cold processing, with respect to the time course, oscillatory profile, and neural generators of cold-evoked responses in healthy human volunteers. Cold thermosensation was associated with low-and high-frequency oscillatory rhythms, both originating in operculo-insular regions. These results support further investigations of central cold processing using magnetoencephalography or EEG and the clinical utility of cold-evoked potentials for neurophysiological assessment of cold-related smallfiber function and damage.

Pre-stimulus alpha oscillations over somatosensory cortex predict tactile misperceptions	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Pre-stimulus; Alpha oscillations; Somatosensory; Perception; Signal detection	VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MU RHYTHM; POWER; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PHASE; ENTRAINMENT; INCREASES; MECHANISM	Fluctuations of pre-stimulus oscillatory activity in the somatosensory alpha band (8-14 Hz) observed using human EEG and MEG have been shown to influence the detection of supra- and peri-threshold somatosensory stimuli. However, some reports of touch occur even without a stimulus. We investigated the possibility that pre-stimulus alpha oscillations might also influence these false reports of touch known as tactile misperceptions. We recorded EEG while participants performed the Somatic Signal Detection Task (SSDT), in which participants must detect brief, peri-threshold somatosensory targets. We found that pre-stimulus oscillatory power in the somatosensory alpha range exhibited a negative linear relationship with reporting of touch at electrode clusters over both contralateral and ipsilateral somatosensory regions. As pre-stimulus alpha power increased, the probability of reporting a touch declined; as it decreased, the probability of reporting a touch increased. This relationship was stronger on trials without a somatosensory stimulus than on trials with a somatosensory stimulus, although was present for both trial types. Spatio-temporal cluster-based permutation analysis also found that pre-stimulus alpha was lower on trials when touch was reported irrespective of whether it was present over contralateral and ipsilateral somatosensory cortices, as well as left frontocentral areas. We argue that alpha power may reflect changes in response criterion rather than sensitivity alone. Low alpha power relates to a low barrier to reporting a touch even when one is not present, while high alpha power is linked to less frequent reporting of touch overall.

This neurotool allows the establishment of a causal link between endogenous oscillatory activity and behavior. Most of the tACS studies have shown online effects of tACS. However, little is known about the underlying action mechanisms of this technique because of the AC-induced artifacts on Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Here we show a unique approach to investigate online physiological frequency-specific effects of tACS of the primary motor cortex (M1) by using single pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to probe cortical excitability changes. In our setup, the TMS coil is placed over the tACS electrode while Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) are collected to test the effects of the ongoing M1-tACS. So far, this approach has mainly been used to study the visual and motor systems. However, the current tACS-TMS setup can pave the way for future investigations of cognitive functions. Therefore, we provide a step-by-step manual and video guidelines for the procedure.

Current EEG research mainly focuses on the N200 and P300 ERPs and corresponding activity in the theta and delta frequency range, thereby leaving us with a limited understanding of the mechanisms of response inhibition. Here, 15 functional networks were estimated from time-frequency transformed EEG recorded during processing of a visual stop signal task. Cortical sources underlying these functional networks were reconstructed, and a total of 45 features, each representing spectrally and temporally coherent activity, were extracted to train a classifier to differentiate between go and stop trials. A classification accuracy of 85.55% for go and 83.85% for stop trials was achieved. Features capturing fronto-central delta-and theta activity, parieto-occipital alpha, fronto-central as well as right frontal beta activity were highly discriminating between trial-types. However, only a single network, comprising a feature defined by oscillatory activity below 12 Hz, was associated with a generator in the opercular region of the right inferior frontal cortex and showed the expected associations with behavioral inhibition performance. This study pioneers by providing a detailed ranking of neural features regarding their information content for stop and go differentiation at the single-trial level, and may further be the first to identify a scalp EEG marker of the inhibitory control network. This analysis allows for the characterization of the temporal dynamics of response inhibition by matching electrophysiological phenomena to cortical generators and behavioral inhibition performance.

Synchronization in activated regions of cortical networks affect the brain's frequency response, which has been associated with a wide range of states and abilities, including memory. A non-invasive method for manipulating cortical synchronization is binaural beats. Binaural beats take advantage of the brain's response to two pure tones, delivered independently to each ear, when those tones have a small frequency mismatch. The mismatch between the tones is interpreted as a beat frequency, which may act to synchronize cortical oscillations. Neural synchrony is particularly important for working memory processes, the system controlling online organization and retention of information for successful goal-directed behavior. Therefore, manipulation of synchrony via binaural beats provides a unique window into working memory and associated connectivity of cortical networks. Approach. In this study, we examined the effects of different acoustic stimulation conditions during an N-back working memory task, and we measured participant response accuracy and cortical network topology via EEG recordings. Six acoustic stimulation conditions were used: None, Pure Tone, Classical Music, 5 Hz binaural beats, 10 Hz binaural beats, and 15 Hz binaural beats. Main results. We determined that listening to 15 Hz binaural beats during an N-Back working memory task increased the individual participant's accuracy, modulated the cortical frequency response, and changed the cortical network connection strengths during the task. Only the 15 Hz binaural beats produced significant change in relative accuracy compared to the None condition. Significance. Listening to 15 Hz binaural beats during the N-back task activated salient frequency bands and produced networks characterized by higher information transfer as compared to other auditory stimulation conditions.

Leading evidence for this thesis derives from functional neuroimaging, a methodology ill-suited for detailed assessment of sensory transmission dynamics occurring at the millisecond scale. Electrophysiological assessments of this thesis, however, are sparse and unconvincing. We conducted detailed examination of visual and somatosensory evoked activity using high-density electrical mapping in individuals with autism (N = 20) and precisely matched neurotypical controls (N = 20), recording large numbers of trials that allowed for exhaustive time-frequency analyses at the single-trial level. Measures of intertrial coherence and event-related spectral perturbation revealed no convincing evidence for an unreliability account of sensory responsivity in autism. Indeed, results point to robust, highly reproducible response functions marked for their exceedingly close correspondence to those in neurotypical controls	[Butler, John S.; Molholm, Sophie; Andrade, Gizely N.; Foxe, John J.] Montefiore Med Ctr, Albert Einstein Coll Med, Sheryl & Daniel R Tishman Cognit Neurophysiol Lab, Dept Pediat, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Butler, John S.] Dublin Inst Technol, Sch Math Sci, Kevin St, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Butler, John S.; Foxe, John J.] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll, Inst Neurosci, Dublin, Ireland; [Molholm, Sophie; Foxe, John J.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dominick P Purpura Dept Neurosci, Rose F Kennedy Intellectual & Dev Disabil Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Foxe, John J.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurosci, Ernest J Del Monte Inst Neurosci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA		Butler, JS; Foxe, JJ (corresponding author), Montefiore Med Ctr, Albert Einstein Coll Med, Sheryl & Daniel R Tishman Cognit Neurophysiol Lab, Dept Pediat, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.; Butler, JS (corresponding author), Dublin Inst Technol, Sch Math Sci, Kevin St, Dublin 8, Ireland.; Butler, JS; Foxe, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll, Inst Neurosci, Dublin, Ireland.; Foxe, JJ (corresponding author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dominick P Purpura Dept Neurosci, Rose F Kennedy Intellectual & Dev Disabil Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.; Foxe, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurosci, Ernest J Del Monte Inst Neurosci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.	john.s.butler@dit.ie; john_foxe@urmc.rochester.edu	Butler, John/L-7789-2019	Butler, John/0000-0001-5567-8634	U.S. National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH RO1 MH085322]; Nathan Gantcher Foundation; Women's Division of The Albert Einstein College of Medicine; center grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development [NICHD P30 HD071593]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT [P30HD071593] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [R01MH085322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER	U.S. National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Nathan Gantcher Foundation; Women's Division of The Albert Einstein College of Medicine; center grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))	This work was supported by a grant from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH RO1 MH085322 to J.J.F. and S.M.).

Neural oscillatory mechanisms during novel grammar learning underlying language analytical abilities	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Language learning; EEG; Oscillations; Second language acquisition; Artificial Grammar Learning; Language aptitude	EEG ALPHA; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; COHERENCE; BAND; SIMILARITY	The goal of the present study was to investigate the initial phases of novel grammar learning on a neural level, concentrating on mechanisms responsible for individual variability between learners. Two groups of participants, one with high and one with average language analytical abilities, performed an Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) task consisting of learning and test phases. During the task, EEG signals from 32 cap-mounted electrodes were recorded and epochs corresponding to the learning phases were analysed. We investigated spectral power modulations over time, and functional connectivity patterns by means of a bivariate, frequency specific index of phase synchronization termed Phase Locking Value (PLV). Behavioural data showed learning effects in both groups, with a steeper learning curve and higher ultimate attainment for the highly skilled learners. Moreover, we established that cortical connectivity patterns and profiles of spectral power modulations over time differentiated L2 learners with various levels of language analytical abilities. Over the course of the task, the learning process seemed to be driven by whole-brain functional connectivity between neuronal assemblies achieved by means of communication in the beta band frequency. On a shorter time-scale, increasing proficiency on the AGL task appeared to be supported by stronger local synchronisation within the right hemisphere regions. Finally, we observed that the highly skilled learners might have exerted less mental effort, or reduced attention for the task at hand once the learning was achieved, as evidenced by the higher alpha band power.

Neurophysiologic Correlates of Ketamine Sedation and Anesthesia A High-density Electroencephalography Study in Healthy Volunteers	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR; PROPOFOL-INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; DISSOCIATIVE ANESTHETICS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INTRAVENOUS KETAMINE; INFORMATION-TRANSFER; HYPNOTIC ACTIONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EEG	Background: Previous studies have demonstrated inconsistent neurophysiologic effects of ketamine, although discrepant findings might relate to differences in doses studied, brain regions analyzed, coadministration of other anesthetic medications, and resolution of the electroencephalograph. The objective of this study was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of ketamine on cortical oscillations and functional connectivity. Methods: Ten healthy human volunteers were recruited for study participation. The data were recorded using a 128-channel electroencephalograph during baseline consciousness, subanesthetic dosing (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min), anesthetic dosing (1.5 mg/kg bolus), and recovery. No other sedative or anesthetic medications were administered. Spectrograms, topomaps, and functional connectivity (weighted and directed phase lag index) were computed and analyzed. Results: Frontal theta bandwidth power increased most dramatically during ketamine anesthesia (mean power +/- SD, 4.25 +/- 1.90 dB) compared to the baseline (0.64 +/- 0.28 dB), subanesthetic (0.60 +/- 0.30 dB), and recovery (0.68 +/- 0.41 dB) states; P < 0.001. Gamma power also increased during ketamine anesthesia. Weighted phase lag index demonstrated theta phase locking within anterior regions (0.2349 +/- 0.1170, P < 0.001) and between anterior and posterior regions (0.2159 +/- 0.1538, P < 0.01) during ketamine anesthesia. Alpha power gradually decreased with subanesthetic ketamine, and anterior-to-posterior directed connectivity was maximally reduced (0.0282 +/- 0.0772) during ketamine anesthesia compared to all other states (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Ketamine anesthesia correlates most clearly with distinct changes in the theta bandwidth, including increased power and functional connectivity. Anterior-to-posterior connectivity in the alpha bandwidth becomes maximally depressed with anesthetic ketamine administration, suggesting a dose-dependent effect.

J	Han, BA; VanRullen, R				Han, Biao; VanRullen, Rufin			The rhythms of predictive coding? Pre-stimulus phase modulates the influence of shape perception on luminance judgments	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TOP-DOWN; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; CONTRAST; GAMMA; CORTEX; MONKEY; ALPHA; FEEDFORWARD; FEEDBACK	Predictive coding is an influential model emphasizing interactions between feedforward and feedback signals. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics of these interactions. Two gray disks with different versions of the same stimulus, one enabling predictive feedback (a 3D-shape) and one impeding it (random-lines), were simultaneously presented on the left and right of fixation. Human subjects judged the luminance of the two disks while EEG was recorded. The choice of 3D-shape or random-lines as the brighter disk was used to assess the influence of feedback signals on sensory processing in each trial (i.e., as a measure of post-stimulus predictive coding efficiency). Independently of the spatial response (left/right), we found that this choice fluctuated along with the pre-stimulus phase of two spontaneous oscillations: a similar to 5 Hz oscillation in contralateral frontal electrodes and a similar to 16 Hz oscillation in contralateral occipital electrodes. This pattern of results demonstrates that predictive coding is a rhythmic process, and suggests that it could take advantage of faster oscillations in low-level areas and slower oscillations in high-level areas.

If the motor system is indeed involved in the generation of action predictions, activation should be modulated by the degree of predictability of an observed action. This study used EEG and eye-tracking to investigate whether and how predictability of an observed action modulates motor system activation as well as behavioral predictions in the form of anticipatory eye-movements. Participants were presented with object-directed actions (e.g., making a cup of tea) consisting of three action steps which increased in their predictability. While the goal of the first step was ambiguous (e.g., when making tea, one can first grab the teabag or the cup), the goals of the following steps became predictable over the course of the action. Motor system activation was assessed by measuring attenuation of sensorimotor mu- and beta-oscillations. We found that mu- and beta-power were attenuated during observation, indicating general activation of the motor system. Importantly, predictive motor system activation, indexed by beta-band attenuation, increased for each action step, showing strongest activation prior to the final (i.e. most predictable) step. Sensorimotor activity was related to participants' predictive eye-movements which also showed a modulation by action step. Our results demonstrate that motor system activity and behavioral predictions become stronger for more predictable action steps. The functional roles of sensorimotor oscillations in predicting other's actions are discussed.

Toward this end, WM training protocols aim to improve WM capacity and extend improvements to unpracticed domains, yet success is limited. One emerging approach is to couple WM training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This pairing of WM training with tDCS in longitudinal designs promotes behavioral improvement and evidence of transfer of performance gains to untrained WM tasks. However, the mechanism(s) underlying tDCS-linked training benefits remain unclear. Our goal was to gain purchase on this question by recording high-density EEG before and after a weeklong WM training + tDCS study. Participants completed four sessions of frontoparietal tDCS (active anodal or sham) during which they performed a visuospatial WM change detection task. Participants who received active anodal tDCS demonstrated significant improvement on the WM task, unlike those who received sham stimulation. Importantly, this pattern was mirrored by neural correlates in spectral and phase synchrony analyses of the HD-EEG data. Notably, the behavioral interaction was echoed by interactions in frontal posterior alpha band power, and theta and low alpha oscillations. These findings indicate that one mechanism by which paired tDCS + WM training operates is to enhance cortical efficiency and connectivity in task-relevant networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Stationary Biological Signals with Sparse Linear Regression Based Fourier Linear Combiner	SENSORS			English	Article						time-frequency decomposition; truncated fourier series model; sparse linear regression; l(1) regularization; ADMM	KALMAN SMOOTHER APPROACH; ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION; BAND IDENTIFICATION; SPECTRAL ESTIMATION; RESPIRATORY RATE; EEG; PARAMETERS; TREMOR	I t is often difficult to analyze biological signals because of their nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics. This necessitates the usage of time-frequency decomposition methods for analyzing the subtle changes in these signals that are often connected to an underlying phenomena. This paper presents a new approach to analyze the time-varying characteristics of such signals by employing a simple truncated Fourier series model, namely the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC). In contrast to the earlier designs, we first identified the sparsity imposed on the signal model in order to reformulate the model to a sparse linear regression model. The coefficients of the proposed model are then estimated by a convex optimization algorithm. The performance of the proposed method was analyzed with benchmark test signals. An energy ratio metric is employed to quantify the spectral performance and results show that the proposed method Sparse-BMFLC has high mean energy (0.9976) ratio and outperforms existing methods such as short-time Fourier transfrom (STFT), continuous Wavelet transform (CWT) and BMFLC Kalman Smoother. Furthermore, the proposed method provides an overall 6.22% in reconstruction error.

Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), as one of the most popular EEG modality, has been widely used in BCI applications. For SSVEP BCI, the most challenging task is to effectively improve the accuracy, especially in minimum number of recording electrodes and short stimulation duration. In this study, a novel multi-channel integrated GT(circ)(2) statistic method was proposed for the frequency recognition in a four-class steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP)-based BCI. The proposed method was compared with the widely used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and verified with three-channel EEG data from three healthy subjects. Results indicated that a higher recognition performance with shorter recording time and few electrodes can be achieved by using of this novel method rather than CCA method, making multi-channel integrated GT(circ)(2) statistic a robust approach for the implementation of SSVEP BCIs.

It is not clear, however, how alpha oscillations are controlled and how they interact with the flow of visual information mediated by gamma-band activity. Using noninvasive human MEG recordings in subjects performing a visuospatial attention task, we show that fluctuations in alpha power during a delay period in a spatial attention task preceded subsequent stimulus-driven gamma-band activity. Importantly, these interactions correlated with behavioral performance. Using Granger analysis, we further show that the right frontal-eye field (rFEF) exerted feedback control of the visual alpha oscillations. Our findings suggest that alpha oscillations controlled by the FEF route cortical information flow by modulating gamma-band activity.

However, the outcomes of brain stimulation are shaped by behavioral states and endogenous fluctuations in brain activity. To better understand how this intrinsic oscillatory activity controls the susceptibility of the brain to stimulation, we analyzed a computational model of the thalamo-cortical system in two distinct states (rest and task-engaged) to identify the mechanisms by which endogenous alpha oscillations (8Hz-12Hz) are modulated by periodic stimulation. Our analysis shows that the different responses to stimulation observed experimentally in these brain states can be explained by a passage through a bifurcation combined with stochastic resonance a mechanism by which irregular fluctuations amplify the response of a nonlinear system to weak periodic signals. Indeed, our findings suggest that modulation of brain oscillations is best achieved in states of low endogenous rhythmic activity, and that irregular state-dependent fluctuations in thalamic inputs shape the susceptibility of cortical population to periodic stimulation.

Reactivation of seizure-related changes to interictal spike shape and synchrony during postseizure sleep in patients	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Seizure; Interictal spike; EEG; Neural plasticity	TIME-REVERSIBILITY; EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; FIELD POTENTIALS; FIRING PATTERNS; EEG; EPILEPTOGENESIS; RECONSOLIDATION; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION	ObjectiveLocal field potentials (LFPs) arise from synchronous activation of millions of neurons, producing seemingly consistent waveform shapes and relative synchrony across electrodes. Interictal spikes (IISs) are LFPs associated with epilepsy that are commonly used to guide surgical resection. Recently, changes in neuronal firing patterns observed in the minutes preceding seizure onset were found to be reactivated during postseizure sleep, a process called seizure-related consolidation (SRC), due to similarities with learning-related consolidation. Because IISs arise from summed neural activity, we hypothesized that changes in IIS shape and relative synchrony would be observed in the minutes preceding seizure onset and would be reactivated preferentially during postseizure slow-wave sleep (SWS). MethodsScalp and intracranial recordings were obtained continuously across multiple days from clinical macroelectrodes implanted in patients undergoing treatment for intractable epilepsy. Data from scalp electrodes were used to stage sleep. Data from intracranial electrodes were used to detect IISs using a previously established algorithm. Partial correlations were computed for sleep and wake periods before and after seizures as a function of correlations observed in the minutes preceding seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans were co-registered with electroencephalography (EEG) to determine the location of the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). ResultsChanges in IIS shape and relative synchrony were observed on a subset of macroelectrodes minutes before seizure onset, and these changes were reactivated preferentially during postseizure SWS. Changes in synchrony were greatest for pairs of electrodes where at least one electrode was located in the SOZ. SignificanceThese data suggest preseizure changes in neural activity and their subsequent reactivation occur across a broad spatiotemporal scale: from single neurons to LFPs, both within and outside the SOZ. The preferential reactivation of seizure-related changes in IISs during postseizure SWS adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that pathologic neural processes may utilize physiologic mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.

Processing of massive brain data has become a constant in neuroscience research and practice, which is vital in revealing the hidden information to better understand the brain functions and malfunctions. Brain data are routinely non-linear and non-stationary in nature, and existing algorithms and approaches to neural data processing are generally complicated in order to characterize the non-linearity and non-stationarity. Brain big data processing has pressing needs for appropriate computing technologies to address three grand challenges: (1) efficiency, (2) scalability and (3) reliability. Recent advances of computing technologies are making non-linear methods viable in sophisticated applications of massive brain data processing. General-purpose Computing on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) technology fosters an ideal environment for this purpose, which benefits from the tremendous computing power of modern graphics processing units in massively parallel architecture that is frequently an order of magnitude larger than the modern multi-core CPUs. This article first recaps significant speed-ups of existing algorithms aided by GPGPU in neuroimaging and processing electroencephalogram (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and etc. The article then demonstrates a series of successful approaches to processing EEG data in various dimensions and scales in a massively parallel manner: (1) decomposition: a massively parallel Ensemble Local Mean Decomposition (ELMD) algorithm aided by GPGPU can decompose EEG series, which forms the basis of further time-frequency transformation, in real-time without sacrificing the precision of processing; (2) synchronization measurement: a parallelized Nonlinear Interdependence (NLI) method for global synchronization measurement of multivariate EEG with speed-up of more than 1000 times, and it was successful in localization of epileptic focus; and (3) dimensionality reduction: a large-scale Parallel Factor Analysis which excels in run-time performance and scales far better by hundreds of times than conventional approach does, and it supports fast factorization of EEG with more than 1000 channels. Through these practices, the massively parallel computing technology manifests great potentials in addressing the grand challenges of brain big data processing.

In a between-subjects design, 35 participants were assigned to one of three ITI durations (short: 768 ms; medium: 1,280 ms; long: 1,792 ms) in a standard Stroop task while EEG was recorded. Participants in the short-ITI group demonstrated lower performance accuracy, a reduced error-related negativity (even when correcting for frequency of errors), lower error-related alpha suppression during the ITI, and increased post-error slowing. Results indicate that fast-paced trial timing can be disruptive to self-monitoring, perhaps due to capacity limitations or bottlenecks in processing.

By combining this technology with biological sensors, a student in a virtual educational environment can be monitored for physiological markers of engagement or more cognitive states of learning. With this information, the virtual reality environment can be adaptively altered to reflect the student's state, essentially creating a closed-loop feedback system. This paper explores these concepts, and presents preliminary data on a combined EEG-VR working memory experiment as a first step toward a broader implementation of an intelligent adaptive learning system. This first-pass neural time-series and oscillatory data suggest that while an EEG-based neurofeedback system is feasible, more work on removing artifacts and identifying relevant and important features will lead to higher prediction accuracy.

The diagnosis of sleep apnea is performed by specialist physicians. This siruation extends the duration of the diagnosis. To shorten this period and at the same time to avoid the mistakes that may occur in diagnosis, an automated decision support system has been considered in the diagnosis and classification of sleep apnea. In this study, ECG signal was analyzed to obtain Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signal and the power spectral density (PSD) of this signal was examined. It has been observed that the low and high frequency energy ratios are different in the PSD of examined HRV. Parallel to this analysis, the energy of the respiratory signal is obtained and it is understood that there is a significant energy exchange in the apnea cases. However, the powers of the frequency bands in the EEG signal were found separately and the ratios of these bands to each other were calculated. In the analysis, it was observed that the ratios of and non-apnea periods. By using these differences, an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm is constructed to diagnose and classify the sleep apnea. This algorithm was tested on two patient data; ANN was trained and tested separately for each patient. As a result, it was determined that the average accuracy rate of ANN is high.

In recent years, emotional state data have been examined by using data-driven methods such as Empirical Mode Decomposition as well as classical time-frequency methods. Although Empirical Mode Decomposition has many advantages, it has disadvantages such as being designed for univariate data, prone to mode mixing, and providing signal via a sufficient number of the local extrema. To overcome these disadvantages, in this study, the Noise-Assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition has been shown to classify the emotional state using electroencephalographic signals.

Voluntary action is also accompanied by prominent rhythmic activity, and recent behavioral evidence suggests that this might be coupled with perception. Here, we reveal the neurophysiological underpinnings of this sensorimotor coupling in humans. We link the trial-by trial dynamics of EEG oscillatory activity during movement preparation to the corresponding dynamics in perception, for two unrelated visual and motor tasks. The phase of theta oscillations (similar to 4 Hz) predicts perceptual performance, even >1 s before movement. Moreover, theta oscillations are phase-locked to the onset of the movement. Remarkably, the alignment of theta phase and its perceptual relevance unfold with similar non-monotonic profiles, suggesting their relatedness. The present work shows that perception and movement initiation are automatically synchronized since the early stages of motor planning through neuronal oscillatory activity in the theta range.

Theta (3-8 Hz) and alpha (10-16 Hz) neuronal oscillations were analyzed to compare encoding processes during an intentional and an incidental encoding task. In all three age groups, both encoding conditions were associated with an increase in event-related theta activity. Encoding-related alpha suppression increased with age. Memory performance was higher in the intentional compared to the incidental task in all age groups. Furthermore, intentional learning was associated with an improved encoding of perceptual features, which were relevant for the retrieval phase. Theta activity increased from incidental to intentional encoding. Specifically, frontal theta increased in all age groups, while parietal theta increased only in adults and older children. In younger children, parietal theta was similarly high in both encoding phases. While alpha suppression may reflect semantic processes during encoding, increased theta activity during intentional encoding may indicate perceptual binding processes, in accordance with the demands of the encoding task. Higher encoding-related alpha suppression in the older age groups, together with age differences in parietal theta activity during incidental learning in young children, is in line with recent theoretical accounts, emphasizing the role of perceptual processes in mnemonic processing in young children, whereas semantic encoding processes continue to mature throughout middle childhood.

Using these two conditions, we tested whether the sequence in which the two conditions were fulfilled influenced the brain activation observable during the L condition (LR -> L or L -> LR). We recorded high-density EEG during the playing of four well-known positively experienced soundtracks in two subject groups. One group started with the L condition and continued with the LR condition (L -> LR); the second group performed this experiment in reversed order (LR -> L). We computed from the recorded EEG the power for different frequency bands (theta, lower alpha, upper alpha, lower beta, and upper beta). Statistical analysis revealed that the power in all examined frequency bands increased during the L condition but only when the subjects had not had previous experience with the LR condition (i.e., L -> LR). For the subjects who began with the LR condition, there were no power increases during the L condition. Thus, the previous experience with the LR condition prevented subjects from developing the particular mental state associated with the typical power increase in all frequency bands. The subjects without previous experience of the LR condition listened to the musical pieces in an unconstrained and undisturbed manner and showed a general power increase in all frequency bands. We interpret the fact that unconstrained music listening was associated with increased power in all examined frequency bands as a neural indicator of a mental state that can best be described as a mind-wandering state during which the subjects are "drawn into" the music.

Potential synergistic action of 19 schizophrenia risk genes in the thalamus	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; NMDAR hypofunction; Dopamine receptor hyperfunction; Delta oscillations; Nucleus reticularis; Relay cells	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; NUCLEUS REUNIENS; CA2+ CHANNELS; DOPAMINE; NEURONS; PROTEIN; DYSREGULATION; STIMULATION	A goal of current schizophrenia (SZ) research is to understand how multiple risk genes work together with environmental factors to produce the disease. In schizophrenia, there is elevated delta frequency EEG power in the awake state, an elevation that can be mimicked in rodents by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist action in the thalamus. This thalamic delta can be blocked by dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, agents known to be therapeutic in SZ. Experiments suggest that these oscillations can interfere with brain function and may thus be causal in producing psychosis. Here we evaluate the question of whether well-established schizophrenia risk genes may interact to affect the delta generation process. We identify 19 risk genes that can plausibly work in a synergistic fashion to generate delta oscillations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We report that this conclusion has overlooked an equally important determinant, namely, the frequency of the entraining stream in which these targets are embedded. Specifically, we show in two experiments that the signature of the attentional blink-second target accuracy that increases with intertarget lag-is significantly larger for entraining streams that are in the alpha-beta frequency range, relative to streams that are slower (theta) or faster (gamma). This finding ties the attentional blink critically, for the first time, to these two prominent oscillation frequencies that are known to be involved in the control of human attention and consciousness.

Studying the effect of stress is very important especially in academic life for the students. Nowadays; there have been many recent methods evaluating the relationship between stress, learning and memory performance based on different techniques. The most common methods are conducted based on the biological response. Some of these methods have assessed the impact of stress based on biochemical effects by measuring specific hormones such as cortisol, adrenalin and glucocorticoids, or based on physiological effects such as blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature. However, in all these methods, there are inconsistent findings due to the instability of hormones and a large number of related factors. The aim of this research is to discover the impact of pre-learning stress on long-term memory retrieval using EEG signals. The results indicate that there is a relationship between theta rhythm in the temporal lobe and long-term memory retrieval.

Hypoglycemia was induced with a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp in six T1DM patients with a history of hypoglycemia unawareness previous severe hypoglycemic coma (SH) and in six T1DM patients without (C) history of hypoglycemia unawareness previous severe hypoglycemic coma. Cognitive function tests (four choice reaction time), counterregulatory responses (adrenaline), and symptomatic responses were evaluated at euglycemia (90 mg/dl) and during step-wise plasma glucose reduction (68, 58 and 49 mg/dl). EEG activity was recorded continuously throughout the study and analyzed by spectral analysis. Cognitive function deteriorated significantly at a glucose threshold of 55 +/- 1 mg/dl in both groups (p = ns) during hypoglycemia, while the glucose threshold for autonomic symptoms was significantly lower in SH patients than in C patients (49 +/- 1 vs. 54 +/- 1 mg/dl, p < 0.05, respectively). In SH patients, eye-closed resting EEG showed a correlation between the mean dominance frequency and plasma glucose (r = 0.62, p < 0.001). Theta relative power increased during controlled hypoglycemia compared to euglycemia (21.6 +/- 6 vs. 15.5 +/- 3% Hz p < 0.05) and was higher than in the C group (21.6 +/- 6 vs. 13.8 +/- 3%, p < 0.03). The cognitive task beta activity was lower in the SH group than in the C group (14.8 +/- 3 Hz, vs. 22.6 +/- 4 vs. p < 0.03). Controlled hypoglycemia elicits cognitive dysfunction in both C and SH patients; however, significant EEG alterations during hypoglycemia were detected mainly in patients with a history of hypoglycemia unawareness and previous severe hypoglycemic coma. These data suggest that prior episodes of hypoglycemic coma modulate brain electric activity.

In this research, an in-depth analysis of Task Difficulty Level (TDL) for program comprehension is proposed with features extracted from different areas of the brain. Two levels of task difficulty were analysed: easy and difficult. Eight students were asked to solve nine Java programs of different difficulty level and the subject's cognitive load was recorded using EEG. Four different feature extraction methods were used for analysis - Energy, Frequency ratio, Event Related De-Synchronization (ERD) and Asymmetry ratio and Naive Bayes classifier was used for classifying different TDL. The results indicated that the recorded EEG signals could reflect TDL for program comprehension tasks for predicting easy and difficult tasks. The classifier predicted task difficulty (easy/difficult) of a new task with an overall correctly classified accuracy of 76.55% with a precision of 80.03% and recall of 76.66%. This in-depth analysis of TDL for program comprehension tasks using EEG could support in developing future generation learning tools.

Slow and Fast Neocortical Oscillations in the Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Model SAMP8	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						slow waves; slow oscillations; aging; gamma; cerebral cortex; Up states; Alzheimer; brain rhythms	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NETWORK MECHANISMS; CORTICAL RHYTHMS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; IN-VIVO; NEURONS; STATES; MEMORY; BRAIN	The senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model is characterized by accelerated, progressive cognitive decline as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurodegenerative changes, and resembles the etiology of multicausal, sporadic late-onset/age-related AD in humans. Our aim was to find whether these AD-like pathological features, together with the cognitive deficits present in the SAMP8 strain, are accompanied by disturbances in cortical network activity with respect to control mice (SAM resistance 1, SAMR1) and, if so, how the alterations in cortical activity progress with age. For this purpose, we characterized the extracellular spontaneous oscillatory activity in different regions of the cerebral cortex of SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice under ketamine anesthesia at 5 and 7 months of age. Under these conditions, slow oscillations and fast rhythms generated in the cortical network were recorded and different parameters of these oscillations were quantified and compared between SAMP8 and their control, SAMR1 mice. The average frequency of slow oscillations in SAMP8 mice was decreased with respect to the control mice at both studied ages. An elongation of the silent periods or Down states was behind the decreased slow oscillatory frequency while the duration of active or Up states remained stable. SAMP8 mice also presented increased cycle variability and reduced high frequency components during Down states. During Up states, the power peak in the gamma range was displaced towards lower frequencies in all the cortical areas of SAMP8 with respect to control mice suggesting that the spectral profile of SAMP8 animals is shifted towards lower frequencies. This shift is reminiscent to one of the principal hallmarks of electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and adds evidence in support of the suitability of the SAMP8 mouse as a model of this disease. Although some of the differences between SAMP8 and control mice were emphasized with age, the evolution of the studied parameters as SAMR1 mice got older indicates that the SAMR1 phenotype tends to converge with that of SAMP8 animals. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic characterization of the cortical slow and fast rhythms in the SAMP8 strain and it provides useful insights about the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying the reported alterations.

J	Boashash, B; Barki, H; Ouelha, S				Boashash, Boualem; Barki, Hichem; Ouelha, Samir			Performance evaluation of time-frequency image feature sets for improved classification and analysis of non-stationary signals: Application to newborn EEG seizure detection	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; Non-Stationary signal analysis; Hu invariant moments; Haralick features; Local Binary Patterns; Time-frequency distributions; Random forests	TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; SHAPE REPRESENTATION; FOURIER DESCRIPTORS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION	This study demonstrates that a time-frequency (TF) image pattern recognition approach offers significant advantages over standard signal classification methods that use t-domain only or f-domain only features. Two approaches are considered and compared. The paper describes the significance of the standard TF approach for non-stationary signals; TF signal (TFS) features are defined by extending t-domain or (domain features to a joint (t, f) domain resulting in e.g. TF flatness and TF flux. The performance of the extended TFS features is comparatively assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis Area Under the Curve (AUC) measure. Experimental results confirm that the extended TFS features generally yield improved performance (up to 19%) when compared to the corresponding t-domain and f-domain features. The study also explores a second approach based on novel TF image (TFI) features that further improves TF-based classification of non-stationary signals. New TFI features are defined and extracted from the (t, f) domain; they include TF Hu invariant moments, TF Haralick features, and TF Local Binary Patterns (LBP). Using a state-of-the-art classifier, different metrics based on confusion matrix performance are compared for all extended TFS features and TFI features. Experimental results show the improved performance of TFI features over both TFS features and t-domain only or f-domain only features, for all TF representations and for all the considered performance metrics. The experiment is validated by comparing this new proposed methodology with a recent study, utilizing the same large and complex data set of EEG signals, and the same experimental setup. The resulting classification results confirm the superior performance of the proposed TFI features with accuracy improvement up to 5.52%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By our bootstraps: Comparing methods for measuring auditory 40 Hz steady-state neural activity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; 40 Hz auditory steady-state response; magnetoencephalography; superior temporal gyrus	GAMMA SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; MEG; FIELDS; CORTEX; PHASE; BRAIN	Although the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is of clinical interest, the construct validity of EEG and MEG measures of 40 Hz ASSR cortical microcircuits is unclear. This study evaluated several MEG and EEG metrics by leveraging findings of (a) an association between the 40 Hz ASSR and age in the left but not right hemisphere, and (b) right- > left-hemisphere differences in the strength of the 40 Hz ASSR. The contention is that, if an analysis method does not demonstrate a left 40 Hz ASSR and age relationship or hemisphere differences, then the obtained measures likely have low validity. Fifty-three adults were presented 500 Hz stimuli modulated at 40 Hz while MEG and EEG were collected. ASSR activity was examined as a function of phase similarity (intertrial coherence) and percent change from baseline (total power). A variety of head models (spherical and realistic) and a variety of dipole source modeling strategies (dipole source localization and dipoles fixed to Heschl's gyri) were compared. Several sensor analysis strategies were also tested. EEG sensor measures failed to detect left 40 Hz ASSR and age associations or hemisphere differences. A comparison of MEG and EEG head-source models showed similarity in the 40 Hz ASSR measures and in estimating age and left 40 Hz ASSR associations, indicating good construct validity across models. Given a goal of measuring the 40 Hz ASSR cortical microcircuits, a source-modeling approach was shown to be superior in measuring this construct versus methods that rely on EEG sensor measures.

Reactivity of alpha rhythms to eyes opening (the Berger effect) during menstrual cycle phases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Menstrual cycle; EEG alpha-amplitude suppression magnitude; Alpha suppression duration; Alpha band width; Forehead EMG; Progesterone	EEG ALPHA; PROGESTERONE LEVELS; ESTRADIOL; WOMEN; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; BRAIN; DESYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; DURATION	The impact of the menstrual cycle on the alpha EEG reactivity to eyes opening (Berger effect) was studied in relation to hormonal and EMG indices. Repeated measurements of salivary progesterone and cortisol, forehead EMG, and EEG alpha-activity indices in 76 healthy women aged 18-27 were obtained in resting eyes closed (1 min) and eyes open (30 s) conditions. Ten recording sessions occurred, at 2-3 day intervals, during 1-2 menstrual cycles. For example, if a participant had a menstrual cycle length of 30-32 days, she could finish the investigation during 1 cycle, but if she had a 24 day cycle, she would finish the investigation over 1 1/2 cycles. 6 women extended their investigation into a second cycle. The personal points of each woman's phase data were averaged before being used in group analyses. EEG and EMG responses to eyes open showed that magnitude of alpha-1 amplitude suppression corresponds to increasing EMG and salivary cortisol concentration only at the Follicular phase, when low alpha frequency waves are dominant in combination with low progesterone level. The magnitude of alpha suppression in response to eyes open in the upper alpha-2 frequency range does not vary with the menstrual cycle. The Luteal phase corresponds to the highest level of salivary progesterone and is associated with enhancement of the alpha-bandwidth. The most prominent reaction of salivary cortisol level, forehead EMG, and alpha EEG power to opening of the eyes occurs in the Follicular phase. This research reveals the dependence of the EEG Berger effect on the hormonal state and EEG alpha frequency.

Age-related differences in beta engagement during single word processing	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; beta; motor processing; semantic embodiment; time frequency	SPHERICAL SPLINES; EEG; LANGUAGE; MOTOR; KNOWLEDGE; CORTEX; BRAIN; VERBS; OSCILLATIONS; NEUROSCIENCE	Linguistic processing involves the activation of many underlying conceptual features, including semantic and sensori-perceptual information, a process referred to as semantic motor embodiment. Studies of motor embodiment report activation in motor regions when processing action-related language in both adults and children. Electrophysiological studies implicate neural oscillations in the beta range (12-30Hz) as reflecting motor processing when adults process motor-related language (e.g. man-made objects, action verbs), but these have yet to be studied in children. The current study investigates beta responses within the noun category, specifically comparing processing of animal words to action-related object words in adults and children (7-9 years). Results revealed that adults selectively engage the beta range when processing motor semantic features, whereas children show no differential engagement in beta across word type. Findings suggest that although children show some evidence of embodiment for motor features of language, they may be retrieving this information differently than adults.

If both locations match, the time taken for response production is markedly reduced relative to when they mismatch, a phenomenon called the Simon effect. While there is a consensus that this stimulusresponse (S-R) conflict is associated with brief (4-7 Hz) frontal midline theta (fm theta) complexes generated in medial frontal cortex, it remains controversial (1) whether there are multiple, simultaneously active theta generator areas in the medial frontal cortex that commonly give rise to conflict-related fm theta complexes; and if so, (2) whether they are all related to the resolution of conflicting task information. Here, we combined mental chronometry with high-density electroencephalographic measures during a Simon-type manual reaching task and used independent component analysis and time-frequency domain statistics on source-level activities to model fm theta sources. During target processing, our results revealed two independent fm theta generators simultaneously active in or near anterior cingulate cortex, only one of them reflecting the correspondence between current and previous S-R locations. However, this fm theta response is not exclusively linked to conflict but also to other, conflict-independent processes associated with response slowing. These results paint a detailed picture regarding the oscillatory correlates of conflict processing in Simon tasks, and challenge the prevalent notion that fm theta complexes induced by conflicting task information represent a unitary phenomenon related to cognitive control, which governs conflict processing across various types of response-override tasks.

Here, we used electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to investigate neural oscillations during the maintenance of auditory duration in working memory (WM). EEG analyses indicated that the auditory duration length was not associated with changes in the theta band amplitude, whereas the alpha band amplitudes during 3- s and 4- s auditory duration conditions were lower than during the 1-s and 2-s conditions. Moreover, the alpha band amplitude and accuracy were positively correlated in the 2-s duration condition. We also found that the neural representation of auditory duration is segmented, with a critical threshold point of approximately 2 s, which is shorter than that for visual duration (3 s). The results emphasised the involvement of the alpha band in auditory duration maintenance in WM. Our study's findings indicate that different internal representations of auditory durations are maintained in WM below and above 2 s from the perspective of electrophysiology. Additionally, the critical threshold point is related to the sensory modality of duration.

These different mechanisms may reflect different tissue abnormalities which, we hypothesize, could also be reflected in morphological differences in the interictal epileptic and background EEG activity. Methods: We searched our database of intracranial EEG recordings for mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy patients with either predominant low-voltage fast activity (LVF) or periodic spiking (PS). Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were characterized by the spike/polyspike amplitude, the amplitude of the postspike slow wave, and the associated low-frequency and high-frequency power increases. The EEG background was assessed with the root mean square amplitude, the distribution of the instantaneous amplitude relative to the root mean square value, and the power spectral density. Results: We identified 18 patients with predominant LVF or PS. IEDs in PS were 1.7-times sharper as determined by the high-frequency power increase than IEDs in LVF. In contrast, IEDs in LVF had a 1.2times higher post-spike slow wave amplitude, and a 1.5-times larger low-frequency power content than IEDs in PS. There was no difference in rates of IEDs/HFOs, spike amplitude, HFO co-occurrence, and EEG background. Conclusions: We demonstrated an association between the morphology of IEDs and the type of the seizure-onset pattern in mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy. Significance: Our findings therefore suggest that IED morphology is a marker of the underlying mechanisms of seizure generation. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Several lines of evidence now support their involvement in the formation and long-term consolidation of hippocampusdependent memories. During SWRs, the hippocampal networks experience a sharp and transient (similar to 50-100 ms) increase in neuronal activity that is temporally coherent across both hippocampi; further, sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations express a remarkably high oscillation frequency of similar to 120-250 cycles per second; finally, SWRs are irregular in occurrence. Despite around three decades of research into the mechanistic underpinnings of this phenomenon, a coherent theory of various aspects-e.g. its initiation and termination, and the precise synchronization of thousands of neurons at millisecond precision--is still unavailable. Here, we will outline the current understanding of the implications and the mechanisms that govern SWRs, from both a physiological and a network-theoretical perspective. We will put special emphasis on the contributing neuronal populations and will discuss unresolved aspects.

Interpersonal synchrony enhanced through 20 Hz phase-coupled dual brain stimulation	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						interpersonal synchronization; brain-to-brain coupling; social interaction; beta oscillations; phase	NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SOCIAL COORDINATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR SYSTEM; TELL US; ALPHA; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; MODULATION	Synchronous movement is a key component of social behavior in several species including humans. Recent theories have suggested a link between interpersonal synchrony of brain oscillations and interpersonal movement synchrony. The present study investigated this link. Using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied over the left motor cortex, we induced beta band (20 Hz) oscillations in pairs of individuals who both performed a finger-tapping task with the right hand. In-phase or anti-phase oscillations were delivered during a preparatory period prior to movement and while the tapping task was performed. In-phase 20Hz stimulation enhanced interpersonal movement synchrony, compared with anti-phase or sham stimulation, particularly for the initial taps following the preparatory period. This was confirmed in an analysis comparing real vs pseudo pair surrogate data. No enhancement was observed for stimulation frequencies of 2Hz (matching the target movement frequency) or 10 Hz (alpha band). Thus, phase-coupling of beta band neural oscillations across two individuals' (resting) motor cortices supports the interpersonal alignment of sensorimotor processes that regulate rhythmic action initiation, thereby facilitating the establishment of synchronous movement. Phase-locked dual brain stimulation provides a promising method to study causal effects of interpersonal brain synchrony on social, sensorimotor and cognitive processes.

Renyi entropy generalizes the well-known Shannon entropy, and hence providing better flexibility in application to real data. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of Renyi entropy as feature extraction method for motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). In this paper, Renyi entropy has been implemented in MI systems of various settings using BCI competition data sets. The classification accuracy of Renyi entropy in all data sets is benchmarked against common spatial pattern (CSP), the state-of-the-art feature extraction method. For common binary class data sets, Renyi entropy achieves an accuracy of approximately 3.4 % higher for BCI Competition II Data Set III and 0.87 % lower for BCI Competition III Data Set I, and there is no difference in accuracy for BCI Competition III Data Set IVc when compared against conventional CSP. In small sample setting, the average classification accuracy using Renyi entropy is approximately 3.4 and 0.3 % higher as compared to conventional CSP and best performing variant of regularized CSP, respectively. In addition, Renyi entropy is also compared to other chaos-inspired feature extraction methods, namely Katz and Higuchi which are implemented for MI systems by earlier researchers. The effect of implementing Renyi entropy on multiple narrower frequency sub-bands is also investigated in this study. In multi-class setting, Renyi entropy shows no statistical difference (p = 0.6022, paired t test) in accuracy when compared to the algorithm of the BCI competition winner. However, Renyi entropy has an advantage of requiring only one single application of feature extraction regardless of the number of classes, while multiple implementation of CSP is required as CSP is originally designed for binary class problem. The successful application of Renyi entropy in all the aforementioned settings indicates that Renyi entropy is a viable feature extraction alternative for MI-based BCI systems.

In order to measure the levels of subject's attention, many types of biological signals can be recorded such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram(ECG), electrooculogram(EOG), and electromyogram (EMG). Among these methods EEG generally is used as the most effective one for assessing subject's cognitive functions. Recognizing attention levels can be used in a wide variety of applications such as students' attention level, clinical application in detecting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and driver fatigue detecting system. Highlighting the four levels of attention is proposed here, in which the acquired signals from subjects are modeled in a designed task so that attention levels vary from non attention conditions (closed eyes and reading task) to full attention conditions (mathematics task and vigilance). While the previous studies only worked on two levels of attention (low and high levels), the novelty of proposed method is in using four levels of attention. After proving the effectiveness of proposed system, the results reveal appropriate signal processing and classification methods for discriminating the levels of attention which can be used for boosting the BCI performance.

Yet, how reliably, how fast these changes are detected and how long they are processed in the human brain remain unknown. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 18 participants presented with a neutral-expression face at a rate of 5.88 Hz (F) for 80 s. Every five faces, the face changed expression to fear, disgust or happiness (different stimulation sequences). The resulting 1.18 Hz (F/5) EEG response and its harmonics objectively indexed detection of a brief change of facial expression. This response was recorded in every participant in a few minutes but was largely reduced for inverted faces, indicating that it reflects high-level processes. Although this response focused on occipito-temporal sites, different expression changes evoked reliably distinct topographical maps, pointing to partly distinct neural generators. These effects were also observed at a faster 12 Hz frequency rate and a lower ratio of expression change (1/9). Time-domain analysis showed that a brief change of expression inserted in a dynamic stimulation sequence elicits specific occipito-temporal responses between 100 and 310 ms, indicating a rapid change detection process followed by a long integration period of facial expression information in the human brain.

In this paper, SSVEP was elicited by sinusoidal stimulation, and Filter Bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) was used to solve the problem that the amplitude and energy of the nonlinear and non-stationary signals at each frequency band varied with time. The experimental results show that the correct recognition rate is 97.5%.And the mean ITR are 152bits/min. The method can effectively improve the identification and control of SSVEP EEG signals. At the same time, the stimulus paradigm displayed on the computer screen reduced the visual fatigue of the subjects and improved the comfort level of the subjects.

However, the brain mechanisms underlying dream generation and its encoding in memory during NREM sleep are still mostly unknown. In fact, only few studies have investigated on the mechanisms of dream phenomenology related to NREM sleep. For this reason, our study is specifically aimed to elucidate the electrophysiological (EEG) correlates of dream recall (DR) upon NREM sleep awakenings. Under the assumption that EEG activity predicts the presence/absence of DR also during NREM sleep, we have investigated whether DR from stage 2 NREM sleep shares similar brain mechanisms to those involved in the encoding of episodic memory during wakefulness, or it depends on the specific electrophysiological milieu of the sleep period along the desynchronized/synchronized EEG continuum. We collected DR from a multiple nap protocol in a within-subjects design. We found that DR is predicted by an extensive reduction of delta activity during the last segment of sleep, encompassing left frontal and temporo-parietal areas. The results could represent an update on the mechanisms underlying the sleep mentation during NREM sleep. In particular, they support the hypothesis that an increased cortical EEG activation is a prerequisite for DR, and they are not necessarily in conflict with the hypothesis of common wake-sleep mechanisms. We also confirmed that EEG correlates of DR depend on a state-like relationship.

The iterature has shown that the control of swarms can become quite complicated. On the other hand, Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI) can offer intuitive control in a plethora of applications where other interfaces alone (e.g. joysticks) are inadequate or impractical, e.g. for people with motor disabilities. There are multiple types of BMI, but most of them rely on the analysis of ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) signals. The authors have previously shown that swarm behaviors elicit specific brain activity on human subjects that observe them. Motivated by this result, in this work, we present preliminary results of a hybrid BMI that combines information from the brain and an external device. An algorithm for extracting information from the frequency domain of EEG signals that allows integration with the manual task of using a joystick is presented. The hybrid interface shows high accuracy and robustness when used as a brain-robot interface. Moreover, it allows for continuous control variables extracted from the EEG signals. Finally, its efficacy is proven across multiple subjects, while its performance is also demonstrated in the real-time control of a swarm of quadrotors.

This is achieved based on a combination of noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition and short-time Fourier transform-based univariate and multivariate synchrosqueezing transforms. It is shown that the ISC outperforms six other combinations of algorithms in estimating degrees of synchrony in synthetic linear and nonlinear bivariate signals. Its advantage is further illustrated in the precise identification of the synchronized respiratory and heart rate variability frequencies among a subset of bass singers of a professional choir, where it distinctly exhibits better performance than the continuous wavelet transform-based ISC. We also introduce an extension to the intrinsic phase synchrony (IPS) measure, referred to as nested intrinsic phase synchrony (N-IPS), for the empirical quantification of physically meaningful and straightforward-to-interpret trends in phase synchrony. The N-IPS is employed to reveal physically meaningful variations in the levels of cooperation in choir singing and performing a surgical procedure. Both the proposed techniques successfully reveal degrees of synchronization of the physiological signals in two different aspects: (i) precise localization of synchrony in time and frequency (ISC), and (ii) large-scale analysis for the empirical quantification of physically meaningful trends in synchrony (N-IPS).

This study studied the BCI system that was based on the left-right hand motion imagination (MI) from the offline analysis and online application. First of all, we designed a MI brain-computer interface (BCI) experimental paradigm with visual cues, and collected the EEG signal of the left-right hand MI in offline experiment, of which the average classification accuracy was 69.14% after analyzed. Secondly, five able-bodied subjects executed two online sessions individually, of which the average classification accuracy was 64.5% and 66.2%, respectively. The characteristics of features are mainly in the Mu (8-13Hz) and Beta (14-30Hz) frequency band with the channels of FC3, FC4, C3, C4, CP3 and CP4. Finally, we designed a new protocol to extract the error-related potentials (ErrPs). Furthermore, we also analyzed follow-up study plans that extract the ErrPs signal online in real-time used for cancelling the error command sent by BCI.

We used intracortical macro electrodes to record neural activity in the human hippocampus of awake subjects undergoing surgical treatment for refractory epilepsy and distinguished two populations of ripple episodes based on their frequency spectrum. The phase-coupling of one population, slow ripples (90-110 Hz), to cortical delta oscillations was differentially modulated by cognitive task; whereas the second population, fast ripples (130-170 Hz), was not seemingly correlated to local neural activity. Furthermore, as cognitive tasks changed, the ongoing coordination of neural activity associated to slow ripples progressively augmented along the parahippocampal axis. Thus, during resting states, slow ripples were coordinated in restricted hippocampal territories; whereas during active states, such as attentionally-demanding tasks, high frequency activity emerged across the hippocampus and parehippocampal cortex, that was synchronized with slow ripples, consistent with ripples supporting information transfer and coupling anatomically distant regions. Hence, our results provide further evidence of neural diversity in hippocampal high-frequency oscillations and their association to cognitive processing in humans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ronconi, L; Melcher, D				Ronconi, Luca; Melcher, David			The Role of Oscillatory Phase in Determining the Temporal Organization of Perception: Evidence from Sensory Entrainment	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						behavioral oscillations; oscillations; temporal perception; time perception; visual perception	ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG ALPHA; BEHAVIORAL OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; MODULATION; PREDICTS; STIMULI; RHYTHMS; RESET	Recent behavioral, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological studies have renewed the idea that the information processing within different temporal windows is linked to the phase and/or frequency of the ongoing oscillations, predominantly in the theta/alpha band (similar to 4-7 and 8-12 Hz, respectively). However, being correlational in nature, this evidence might reflect a nonfunctional byproduct rather than having a causal role. A more direct link can be shown with methods that manipulate oscillatory activity. Here, we used audiovisual entrainment at different frequencies in the prestimulus period of a temporal integration/segregation task. We hypothesized that entrainment would align ongoing oscillations and drive them toward the stimulation frequency. To reveal behavioral oscillations in temporal perception after the entrainment, we sampled the segregation/integration performance densely in time. In Experiment 1, two groups of human participants (both males and females) received stimulation either at the lower or the upper boundary of the alpha band (similar to 8.5 vs 11.5 Hz). For both entrainment frequencies, we found a phase alignment of the perceptual oscillation across subjects, but with two different power spectra that peaked near the entrainment frequency. These results were confirmed when perceptual oscillations were characterized in the time domain with sinusoidal fittings. In Experiment 2, we replicated the findings in a within-subject design, extending the results for frequencies in the theta (similar to 6.5 Hz), but not in the beta (similar to 15 Hz), range. Overall, these findings show that temporal segregation can be modified by sensory entrainment, providing evidence for a critical role of ongoing oscillations in the temporal organization of perception.

Here, we use electroencephalography to demonstrate that auditory neural oscillations of older adults entrain less firmly and less flexibly to speech-paced (B3 Hz) rhythms than younger adults' during attentive listening. These neural entrainment effects are distinct in magnitude and origin from the neural response to sound per se. Non-entrained parieto-occipital alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations are enhanced in young adults, but suppressed in older participants, during attentive listening. Entrained neural phase and task-induced alpha amplitude exert opposite, complementary effects on listening performance: higher alpha amplitude is associated with reduced entrainment-driven behavioural performance modulation. Thus, alpha amplitude as a task-driven, neuro-modulatory signal can counteract the behavioural corollaries of neural entrainment. Balancing these two neural strategies may present new paths for intervention in age-related listening difficulties.

Intraoperative fast ripples independently predict postsurgical epilepsy outcome: Comparison with other electrocorticographic phenomena	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						High frequency oscillation; Epilepsy surgery; Seizure outcome; Intraoperative electrocorticography; EEG; Biomarker	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMPLEX; PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY; SCALP EEG; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; SEIZURE FREEDOM; SURGERY; CHILDREN	In the surgical management of epilepsy, the resection of cortex exhibiting interictal fast ripples (250-500 Hz) on electrocorticography has been linked to postoperative seizure-freedom. Although fast ripples appear to accurately identify the epileptogenic zone the minimum tissue that must be removed at surgery to achieve seizurefreedom it has not been established that fast ripples are a superior biomarker in comparison with multimodal presurgical neuroimaging and other electrocorticography abnormalities. Hence, in the prediction of postoperative seizure-freedom, we compared the value of fast ripples with other intraoperative electocorticography abnormalities including focal slowing, paroxysmal fast activity, intermittent spike discharges, continuous epileptiform discharges, focal attenuation, and intraoperative seizures, as well as complete resection of the lesion defined by MRI and other neuroimaging. In a cohort of 60 children with lesional epilepsy and median postsurgical follow-up exceeding 4 years, who underwent resective epilepsy surgery with intraoperative electrocorticography, we evaluated the extent to which removal of each intraoperative electrocorticography abnormality impacts time to first postoperative seizure using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression. Secondly, we contrasted the predictive value of resection of each competing electrocorticography abnormality using standard test metrics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value). In contrast with all other intraoperative electrocorticography abnormalities, fast ripples demonstrated the most favorable combination of positive predictive value (100%) and negative predictive value (76%) in the prediction of postoperative seizures. Among all candidate electrocorticography features, time to first postoperative seizure was most strongly associated with incomplete resection of fast ripples (hazard ratio = 19.8, p < 0.001). In multivariate survival analyses, postoperative seizures were independently predicted by incomplete resection of cortex generating fast ripples (hazard ratio = 25.4, 95%CI 6.71-96.0, p < 0.001) and focal slowing (hazard ratio = 5.79, 95%CI 1.76-19.0, p = 0.004), even after adjustment for the impact of an otherwise complete resection. All children with incomplete resection of interictal FR-generating cortex exhibited postoperative seizures within six months. Notably, this cohort included many patients with large resections and thus limited opportunity to exhibit unresected fast ripples. Future study in a cohort with small resection volume, or a clinical trial in which resection margins are guided by fast ripple distribution, would likely yield a more precise estimate of the risk posed by unresected fast ripples. With a high detection rate during brief intraoperative electrocorticography and favorable positive and negative predictive value, interictal fast ripple characterization during surgery is a feasible and useful adjunct to standard methods for epilepsy surgery planning, and represents a valuable spatially-localizing biomarker of the epileptogenic zone, without the need for prolonged extraoperative electrocorticography.

Visual and auditory working memory (WM) research, on the other hand, has indicated a predominant role of gamma oscillations for active WM processing. Here we reconciled these findings by recording whole-head magnetoencephalography during a vibrotactile frequency comparison task. A Braille stimulator presented healthy subjects with a vibration to the left fingertip that was retained in WM for comparison with a second stimulus presented after a short delay. During this retention interval spectral power in the beta band from the right intraparietal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) monotonically increased with the to-be-remembered vibrotactile frequency. In contrast, induced gamma power showed the inverse of this pattern and decreased with higher stimulus frequency in the right IFG. Together, these results expand the previously established role of beta oscillations for somatosensory WM to the gamma band and give further evidence that quantitative information may be processed in a fronto-parietal network.

Prefrontal cortex modulates posterior alpha oscillations during top-down guided visual perception	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						top-down control; directional cross-frequency coupling; prefrontal cortex; alpha oscillations; phase-amplitude coupling	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL EXPECTATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; ATTENTION; ENTRAINMENT; PHASE; DYNAMICS; SPEECH; MECHANISM	Conscious visual perception is proposed to arise from the selective synchronization of functionally specialized but widely distributed cortical areas. It has been suggested that different frequency bands index distinct canonical computations. Here, we probed visual perception on a fine-grained temporal scale to study the oscillatory dynamics supporting prefrontal-dependent sensory processing. We tested whether a predictive context that was embedded in a rapid visual stream modulated the perception of a subsequent near-threshold target. The rapid stream was presented either rhythmically at 10 Hz, to entrain parietooccipital alpha oscillations, or arrhythmically. We identified a 2- to 4-Hz delta signature that modulated posterior alpha activity and behavior during predictive trials. Importantly, delta-mediated top-down control diminished the behavioral effects of bottom-up alpha entrainment. Simultaneous source-reconstructed EEG and cross-frequency directionality analyses revealed that this delta activity originated from prefrontal areas and modulated posterior alpha power. Taken together, this study presents converging behavioral and electrophysiological evidence for frontal delta-mediated top-down control of posterior alpha activity, selectively facilitating visual perception.

Temporally and spatially distinct theta oscillations dissociate a language-specific from a domain-general processing mechanism across the age trajectory	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY CONSTRAINTS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; POWER INCREASES; BRAIN; EEG; ALPHA; COMPREHENSION; INTERFERENCE; FREQUENCY; ADULTS	The cognitive functionality of neural oscillations is still highly debated, as different functions have been associated with identical frequency ranges. Theta band oscillations, for instance, were proposed to underlie both language comprehension and domain-general cognitive abilities. Here we show that the ageing brain can provide an answer to the open question whether it is one and the same theta oscillation underlying those functions, thereby resolving a long-standing paradox. While better cognitive functioning is predicted by low theta power in the brain at rest, resting state (RS) theta power declines with age, but sentence comprehension deteriorates in old age. We resolve this paradox showing that sentence comprehension declines due to changes in RS theta power within domain-general brain networks known to support successful sentence comprehension, while low RS theta power within the left-hemispheric dorso-frontal language network predicts intact sentence comprehension. The two RS theta networks were also found to functionally decouple relative to their independent internal coupling. Thus, both temporally and spatially distinct RS theta oscillations dissociate a language-specific from a domain-general processing mechanism.

Hence, their automatic detection has become a subject of high interest. So far, all detection algorithms consisted of comparing HFOs energy, computed in bands of interest, to a threshold. In this paper, a sequential technique was investigated. Detection was based on a variant of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test, the so-called Page-Hinkley algorithm showing optimal results for detecting abrupt changes in the mean of a normal random signal. Experiments on simulated and real datasets showed the good performance of the method in terms of sensitivity and false detection rate. Compared to the classical thresholding, Page-Hinkley showed better performance.

Functional MRI Correlates of Resting-State Temporal Theta and Delta EEG Rhythms	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Theta rhythm; Delta rhythm; Functional MRI	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; ALPHA-RHYTHM; CORTICOTHALAMIC SYSTEMS; HUMAN BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; FMRI; EEG/FMRI; ACTIVATION; SIGNATURES; NETWORKS	Purpose: The EEG rhythms demonstrate changes in frequency and power with spontaneous changes in behavioral state that do not have well-understood metabolic correlates within the brain. To investigate this question and compare the temporal lobe theta and delta rhythms, resting-state functional MRI was obtained with simultaneous EEG. Methods: Simultaneous EEG-functional MRI was recorded from 14 healthy sleep-deprived subjects in awake and drowsy states. Scalp electrodes corresponding to bilateral temporal lobes were used to calculate delta and theta band power. The resulting time series was used as input in a general linear model, and the final power curves were convolved with the standard hemodynamic response function. Resulting images were thresholded at Z>2.0. Results: Positive and negative correlations for unilateral theta and delta rhythms were present bilaterally in different structures and with differing correlation signs. Theta rhythm positive correlation was present in hindbrain, peri-opercular, and frontoparietal regions and subcortical gray structures, whereas negative correlation was present in parietooccipital cortex. Delta rhythm positive correlation was present in parietooccipital cortex, and negative correlation roughly resembled positive correlations for the theta rhythm. Conclusions: Temporal lobe theta and delta rhythms are correlated with functional MRI signal in an almost mutually exclusive distribution. The different distributions indicate different corresponding networks. These normal findings supplement the understanding of theta and delta rhythm significance.

Fast and slow Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization mechanisms connect membrane potential and sleep homeostasis	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; REM-SLEEP; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; THALAMOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; NETWORK MECHANISMS; GENETIC-EVIDENCE; CALCIUM-CHANNEL; PLASTIC CHANGES; WAVE ACTIVITY	Several lines of evidence indicate that the sleep-wake state of cortical neurons is regulated not only through neuronal projections from the lower brain, but also through the cortical neurons' intrinsic ability to initiate a slow firing pattern related to the slow-wave oscillation observed in electroencephalography of the sleeping brain. Theoretical modeling and experiments with genetic and pharmacological perturbation suggest that ion channels and kinases acting downstream of calcium signaling regulate the cortical-membrane potential and sleep duration. In this review, we introduce possible Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization mechanisms in cortical neurons, in which Ca2+ signaling associated with neuronal excitation evokes kinase cascades, and the activated kinases modify ion channels or pumps to regulate the cortical sleep/wake firing mode.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power in the cortex and hippocampus has also been correlated with learning and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of globally reduced BDNF levels on learning behavior and EEG power via BDNF heterozygous (KO) rats. We employed several behavioral tests that are thought to depend on cortical and hippocampal plasticity to varying degrees: novel object recognition, a test that is reliant on a variety of cognitive systems; contextual fear, which is highly hippocampal-dependent; and cued fear, which has been shown to be amygdala-dependent. We also examined the effects of BDNF reduction on cortical and hippocampal EEG spectral power via chronically implanted electrodes in the motor cortex and dorsal hippocampus. We found that BDNF KO rats were impaired in novelty recognition and fear memory retention, while hippocampal EEG power was decreased in slow waves and increased in fast waves. Interestingly, our results, for the first time, show sexual dimorphism in each of our tests. These results support the hypothesis that BDNF drives both cognitive plasticity and coordinates EEG activity patterns, potentially serving as a link between the two.

While emphasizing its specific strengths in terms of millisecond source imaging, we also identify and discuss current practical challenges, in particular in signal extraction and interpretation. We also take issue with some perceived disadvantages of MEG, including the misconception that the technique is redundant with electroencephalography. Overall, MEG contributes uniquely to our deeper comprehension of both regional and large-scale brain dynamics: from the functions of neural oscillations and the nature of event-related brain activation, to the mechanisms of functional connectivity between regions and the emergence of modes of network communication in brain systems. We expect MEG to play an increasing and pivotal role in the elucidation of these grand mechanistic principles of cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience.

NMDA receptor antagonists induce psychotic symptoms in humans and a schizophrenia-like phenotype in animals, suggesting NMDA receptor dysfunction is involved in the generation of many symptoms of the disorder. We investigated the effects of a single intraperitoneal injection of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 in rats, a model of first-episode schizophrenia, on network oscillations recorded ex vivo in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We found that spontaneous gamma oscillations in hippocampal slices of MK-801-treated animals had a higher peak frequency, but that their rate of occurrence, peak power and Q factor (ratio of peak frequency to half bandwidth) were not affected. Hippocampal gamma oscillations induced by application of acetylcholine displayed a higher peak power, a reduced peak frequency and a shortened induction latency, whereas the Q factor did not change. In the prefrontal cortex, co-application of carbachol and kainate induced two types of network activity in sham animals: continuous gamma oscillations and alternating alpha/gamma oscillations. In MK-801-treated animals, the alternating pattern completely disappeared, and only continuous gamma oscillations could be detected, possessing an increased peak power, decreased peak frequency and decreased Q factor. Alpha oscillations recorded in MK-801-treated animals also had a significantly lower Q factor. In conclusion, our data suggest that NMDA receptor antagonists fundamentally alter the power, peak frequency, dynamics and periodicity of neuronal oscillations in the alpha and gamma frequency band.

Altered premotor cortical oscillations during repetitive movement in persons with Parkinson's disease	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Alpha band; Beta band; Desynchronization; Electroencephalography; Secondary motor regions	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; FINGER MOVEMENTS; MOTOR AREA; ACTIVATION; FREQUENCY; PET; REPRESENTATION; SUPPLEMENTARY; PERFORMANCE	Premotor areas play a critical role in the control of repetitive movements. While research has shown that movement-related oscillations are abnormal during repetitive movements in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), there is limited research examining the contribution of premotor areas, such as the contralateral dorsal premotor area (PMd) and supplementary motor area (SMA), to this impairment. This study compared movement-related oscillations over premotor regions between participants with PD and control participants. Nine participants with PD off and on medication and nine matched control participants were studied. Participants performed cued index finger movements. Spectral power was derived from electroencephalographic recordings from electrodes FC3/FC4 and Cz over the regions of the contralateral PMd and SMA respectively. Movement-related alpha and beta band oscillations were suppressed over electrode FC3/FC4 (contralateral PMd) in participants with PD, particularly at higher movement rates, in both the off and on medication conditions compared to control subjects. The pattern of movement-related oscillations recorded from Cz (SMA) was similar between PD and control groups. This would suggest that the region of the contralateral PMd may be preferentially involved with the control of externally cued repetitive movements and that changes in this activity may contribute to the deterioration of repetitive finger movements at higher rates in persons with PD.

Changes of heart-rate variability was non-specific for two groups of patients (with or without anxiety). EEG-dynamic during cognitive probe was specific for patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. The speech signal correlation dimension was of particular interest and shown different changes for patients with and without anxiety. The standard deviation of correlation dimension was higher for people with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder which may be connected with muscle regulation and vocal tremor. This point should be investigated in the future research.	[Kazimirova, E. A.; Lebedeva, N. N.] RAS, Inst Higher Nervous Activ & Neurophysiol, Moscow, Russia; [Kazimirova, E. A.; Grishkina, M.

EEG epochs with less alpha rhythm improve discrimination of mild Alzheimer's	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Alpha rhythm; Cognitive state; Quantitative EEG; Resting-state EEG	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; QUANTITATIVE EEG; NEURAL-NETWORK; DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; THALAMUS	Background and objective: Eyes-closed-awake electroencephalogram (EEG) is a useful tool in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. However, there is eyes-closed-awake EEG with dominant or rare alpha rhythm. In this paper, we show that random selection of EEG epochs disregarding the alpha rhythm will lead to bias concerning EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. Methods: We compared EEG epochs with more than 30% and with less than 30% alpha rhythm of mild Alzheimer's Disease patients and healthy elderly. We classified epochs as dominant alpha scenario and rare alpha scenario according to alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) percentage in 01, 02 and Oz channels. Accordingly, we divided the probands into four groups: 17 dominant alpha scenario controls, 15 mild Alzheimer's patients with dominant alpha scenario epochs, 12 rare alpha scenario healthy elderly and 15 mild Alzheimer's Disease patients with rare alpha scenario epochs. We looked for group differences using one-way ANOVA tests followed by post-hoc multiple comparisons (p < 0.05) over normalized energy values (%) on the other four well-known frequency bands (delta, theta, beta and gamma) using two different electrode configurations (parieto-occipital and central). Results: After carrying out post-hoc multiple comparisons, for both electrode configurations we found significant differences between mild Alzheimer's patients and healthy elderly on beta- and theta-energy (%) only for the rare alpha scenario. No differences were found for the dominant alpha scenario in any of the five frequency bands. Conclusions: This is the first study of Alzheimer's awake-EEG reporting the influence of alpha rhythm on epoch selection, where our results revealed that, contrarily to what was most likely expected, less synchronized EEG epochs (rare alpha scenario) better discriminated mild Alzheimer's than those presenting abundant alpha (dominant alpha scenario). In addition, we find out that epoch selection is a very sensitive issue in qEEG research. Consequently, for Alzheimer's studies dealing with resting state EEG, we propose that epoch selection strategies should always be cautiously designed and thoroughly explained.

We contrasted differences in frontal upper alpha-band activity between tasks with high and low creativity demands by recording EEGs while skilled musicians listened to, played back, and improvised jazz melodies. Neural responses were compared for skilled musicians with training in musical improvisation versus those who had no formal improvisation training. Consistent with our hypotheses, individuals showed increased frontal upper alpha-band activity during more creative tasks (i.e., improvisation) compared to during less creative tasks (i.e., rote playback). Moreover, this effect was greatest for musicians with formal improvisation training. The strength of this effect also appeared to modulate the quality of these improvisations, as evidenced by significant correlations between upper alpha EEG power and objective post-hoc ratings of individuals' performances. These findings support a conceptualization of creativity as a distinct mental state and suggest spontaneous processing capacity is better nurtured through formal institutional training than informal.

Previous studies indicate that auditory perception depends on pre-target neural activity. However, so far the pre-target electrophysiological conditions which enable the detection of small pitch changes are not well studied, but might yield important insights into pitch-processing. We used magnetoen-cephalography (MEG) source imaging to reveal the pre-target effects of successful auditory detection of small pitch deviations from a sequence of standard tones. Participants heard a sequence of four pure tones and had to determine whether the last target tone was different or identical to the first three standard sounds. We found that successful pitch change detection could be predicted from the amplitude of theta (4-8 Hz) oscillatory activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as well as beta (12-30 Hz) oscillatory activity in the right auditory cortex. These findings confirm and extend evidence for the involvement of theta as well as beta-band activity in auditory perception.

Unambiguously interpreting the results is complicated by the fact that speech signal manipulations affect acoustics and intelligibility alike. In the current EEG study, the acoustic properties of the stimuli were altered and the trials were sorted according to the correctness of the listeners' spoken responses to separate out these two factors. Firstly, more periodicity (i.e. voicing) rendered the event-related potentials (ERPs) more negative during the first second after sentence onset, indicating a greater cortical sensitivity to auditory input with a pitch. Secondly, we observed a larger contingent negative variation (CNV) during sentence presentation when the subjects could subsequently repeat more words correctly. Additionally, slow alpha power (7-10 Hz) before sentences with the least correctly repeated words was increased, which may indicate that subjects have not been focussed on the upcoming task.

Our goal was to assess this relationship by analyzing concurrently obtained EEG/functional MRI data using hypothesis-independent methods. Methods: We collected functional MRI and EEG data during eyes-closed rest in 20 participants aged 19 to 37 (10 females) and performed independent component analysis on the functional MRI data and a Hamming-windowed fast Fourier transform on the EEG data. We correlated functional MRI fluctuations in the DMN with alpha power. Results: Of the six independent components found to have significant relationships with alpha, four contained DMN-associated regions: One independent component was positively correlated with alpha power, whereas all others were negatively correlated. Furthermore, two independent components with opposite relationships with alpha had overlapping voxels in the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that subpopulations of neurons within these classic nodes within the DMN may have different relationships to alpha power. Conclusions: Different parts of the DMN exhibit divergent relationships to alpha power. Our results highlight the relationship between DMN activity and alpha power, indicating that networks, such as the DMN, may have subcomponents that exhibit different behaviors.

Many individuals with ASD show severe deficits in facial affect recognition, an important component of social communication. In recent years, computer-assisted technologies (CAT) have been developed to train the facial affect recognition skills of individuals with ASD. The goal of this paper is to explore whether electroencephalogram (EEG) could be used to predict the performance of facial affect recognition of individuals with ASD, so that CAT-based intervention system could be dynamically adapted according to the needs of specific individuals. In addition, we investigated whether verbal communication, which serves as the social context for the emotional facial expression, could provide valuable information to improve the accuracy of facial affect recognition performance prediction. We designed a CAT-based facial affect recognition task with seven emotional facial expressions and four strength levels. EEG data were recorded from eight subjects; each of them participated in two sessions. The extracted time and frequency domain features were evaluated with seven machine learning algorithms. Results indicate that EEG-based facial affect recognition performance prediction achieved high accuracies. The social context that related to the emotional facial expression was shown to increase the performance prediction accuracy. This improvement is statistically significant with a medium effect size. The averaged best classification results is 87%. These results provide the basis for the development of an adaptive closed-loop CAT-based training system to teach individuals with ASD the facial affect recognition skills.

However, we currently ignore the neural states that predispose to an accurate perception within different crowding regimes. Here, we performed single-trial analyses of the electroencephalographical (EEG) oscillations, evaluating the prestimulus power and phase differences between correct and incorrect discrimination during a letter-crowding task, where irrelevant letters were placed nearby (strong crowding) or far (mid crowding) relative to the target. Results show that prestimulus alpha (8-12 Hz) power was related to target discrimination in the mid, but not in the strong, crowding condition. Importantly, accurate discrimination in the strong crowding condition was predicted by the phase of alpha and by the power of beta (13-20 Hz) oscillations. These evidence suggest that both periodic visual sampling mechanisms, reflected in the alpha phase, and network predisposition to extract local information, reflected in the beta power, predispose to object discrimination in a crowded scene.

EEG beta-power changes reflect motor involvement in abstract action language processing	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Embodiment; Abstract language; Action verbs; Beta-oscillation; Event-related desynchronization (ERD)	SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY; SENTENCE; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; SYSTEM; VERBS; MU; COMPREHENSION; COHERENCE	Brain oscillations in the alpha- and beta-range become suppressed during motor processing and motor imagery. It has recently been discussed that such power changes also occur during action language processing. In our study, we compared beta(2)-oscillations (16-25 Hz) during the observation of prototypical arm movements (revealed via motion tracking) as well as during semantic processing of concrete and abstract sentences containing arm-related action verbs. Whereas we did find a strong desynchronization in the beta(2)-range during action observation, the processing of action sentences evoked a rather weak desynchronization. However, this desynchronization occurred for action verbs in both concrete and abstract contexts. These results might indicate a tendency for abstract action language to be processed similar to concrete action language rather than abstract sentences.

Neurodynamic evaluation of hearing aid features using EEG correlates of listening effort	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Listening effort; Hearing loss; Hearing aids; EEG	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; MENTAL FATIGUE; COCKTAIL PARTY; GAIN-CONTROL; SPEECH; INTELLIGIBILITY; PERCEPTION; COGNITION; AGE	In this study, we propose a novel estimate of listening effort using electroencephalographic data. This method is a translation of our past findings, gained from the evoked electroencephalographic activity, to the oscillatory EEG activity. To test this technique, electroencephalographic data from experienced hearing aid users with moderate hearing loss were recorded, wearing hearing aids. The investigated hearing aid settings were: a directional microphone combined with a noise reduction algorithm in a medium and a strong setting, the noise reduction setting turned off, and a setting using omnidirectional microphones without any noise reduction. The results suggest that the electroencephalographic estimate of listening effort seems to be a useful tool to map the exerted effort of the participants. In addition, the results indicate that a directional processing mode can reduce the listening effort in multitalker listening situations.

However, there are many challenges in developing soft real-time, health-care apps for non-dedicated mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. In this paper, we share our experiences in developing the HifoCap app, a mobile app for receiving electroencephalogram (EEG) wave samples from a wearable device, visualizing the received EEG samples, and transmitting them to a cloud storage server. The app is network and data-intensive. We describe the challenges we faced while developing the HifoCap app-e.g., ensuring the soft real-time requirement in the presence of uncertainty on the Android platform-along with our solutions to them. We measure both the time and space efficiency of our app and evaluate the effectiveness of our solutions quantitatively. We believe our solutions to be applicable to other soft real-time apps targeted for non-dedicated Android devices.

Active auditory experience in infancy promotes brain plasticity in Theta and Gamma oscillations	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Auditory; EEG; Development; Brain oscillations; Infant; Plasticity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; FAMILY-HISTORY; CORTEX; EEG; AGE; SPEECH	Language acquisition in infants is driven by on-going neural plasticity that is acutely sensitive to environmental acoustic cues. Recent studies showed that attention-based experience with non-linguistic, temporally-modulated auditory stimuli sharpens cortical responses. A previous ERP study from this laboratory showed that interactive auditory experience via behavior-based feedback (AEx), over a 6-week period from 4- to 7-months-of-age, confers a processing advantage, compared to passive auditory exposure (PEx) or maturation alone (Naive Control, NC). Here, we provide a follow-up investigation of the underlying neural oscillatory patterns in these three groups. In AEx infants, Standard stimuli with invariant frequency (STD) elicited greater Theta-band (4-6 Hz) activity in Right Auditory Cortex (RAC), as compared to NC infants, and Deviant stimuli with rapid frequency change (DEV) elicited larger responses in Left Auditory Cortex (LAC). PEx and NC counterparts showed less-mature bilateral patterns. AEx infants also displayed stronger Gamma (33-37 Hz) activity in the LAC during DEV discrimination, compared to NCs, while NC and PEx groups demonstrated bilateral activity in this band, if at all. This suggests that interactive acoustic experience with non-linguistic stimuli can promote a distinct, robust and precise cortical pattern during rapid auditory processing, perhaps reflecting mechanisms that support fine-tuning of early acoustic mapping.

J	Spironelli, C; Angrilli, A				Spironelli, Chiara; Angrilli, Alessandro			Posture Used in fMRI-PET Elicits Reduced Cortical Activity and Altered Hemispheric Asymmetry with Respect to Sitting Position: An EEG Resting State Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; supine position; body posture; hemispheric asymmetry; resting state; EEG	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; BRAIN; DELTA; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; PRESSURE; LANGUAGE; BEHAVIOR; HUMANS; MARKER	Horizontal body position is a posture typically adopted for sleeping or during brain imaging recording in both neuroscience experiments and diagnostic situations. Recent literature showed how this position and similar ones with head down are associated to reduced plasticity, impaired pain and emotional responses. The present study aimed at further understanding the decrease of cortical activity associated with horizontal body position by measuring high-frequency EEG bands-typically associated with high-level cognitive activation-in a resting state experimental condition. To this end, two groups of 16 female students were randomly assigned to either sitting control (SC) or 2-h horizontal Bed Rest condition (hBR) while EEG was recorded from 38 scalp recording sites. The hBR group underwent several body transitions, from sitting to supine, and from supine to sitting. Results revealed a clear effect of horizontal posture: the hBR group showed, compared to its baseline and to SC, reduced High-Beta and Gamma EEG band amplitudes throughout the 2-h of hBR condition. In addition, before and after the supine condition, hBR group as well as SC exhibited a greater left vs. right frontal activation in both EEG bands while, on the contrary, the supine position induced a bilateral and reduced activation in hBR participants. The cortical sources significantly more active in SC compared with hBR participants included the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus and left Insula. Results are discussed in relation to the differences among neuroimaging methods (e.g., fMRI, EEG, NIRS), which can be partially explained by posture-induced neural network changes.

Functional connectivity analysis in EEG source space: The choice of method	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOURCE LOCALIZATION; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; CHALLENGES; DENSITY; EEG/MEG; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; ELECTRODE	Functional connectivity (FC) is among the most informative features derived from EEG. However, the most straightforward sensor-space analysis of FC is unreliable owing to volume conductance effects. An alternative-source-space analysis of FC-is optimal for high-and mid-density EEG (hdEEG, mdEEG); however, it is questionable for widely used low-density EEG (ldEEG) because of inadequate surface sampling. Here, using simulations, we investigate the performance of the two source FC methods, the inverse-based source FC (ISFC) and the cortical partial coherence (CPC). To examine the effects of localization errors of the inverse method on the FC estimation, we simulated an oscillatory source with varying locations and SNRs. To compare the FC estimations by the two methods, we simulated two synchronized sources with varying between-source distance and SNR. The simulations were implemented for hdEEG, mdEEG, and ldEEG. We showed that the performance of both methods deteriorates for deep sources owing to their inaccurate localization and smoothing. The accuracy of both methods improves with the increasing between-source distance. The best ISFC performance was achieved using hd/mdEEG, while the best CPC performance was observed with ldEEG. In conclusion, with hdEEG, ISFC outperforms CPC and therefore should be the preferred method. In the studies based on ldEEG, the CPC is a method of choice.

The anterior and middle cerebral arteries of both hemispheres from 15 women with fibromyalgia and 15 healthy women were monitored using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) during a 5-minute eyes-closed resting period. Several signal processing methods based on time, information theory, frequency and time-frequency analyses were used in order to extract different features to characterize the CBFV signals in the different vessels. Main results indicated that, in comparison with control subjects, fibromyalgia patients showed a higher complexity of the envelope CBFV and a different distribution of the power spectral density. In addition, it has been observed that complexity and spectral features show correlations with clinical pain parameters and emotional factors. The characterization features were used in a lineal model to discriminate between fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls, providing a high accuracy. These findings indicate that CBFV signals, specifically their complexity and spectral characteristics, contain information that may be relevant for the assessment of fibromyalgia patients in resting-state conditions.

Ten percent of premature birth survivors develop motor impairment, but almost half exhibit later sensorial, cognitive, and emotional disabilities attributed to white matter injury and decreased volume of neuronal structures. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that premature and full-term infants differ in their development of emotional face processing. A comparative longitudinal study was conducted in premature and full-term infants at 4 and 8 months of age. The absolute power of the electroencephalogram was analyzed in both groups during 5 conditions of an emotional face processing task: positive, negative, neutral faces, non-face, and rest. Differences between the conditions of the task at 4 months were limited to rest versus non-rest comparisons in both groups. Eight-month-old term infants had increases (P .05) in absolute power in the left occipital region at the frequency of 10.1 Hz and in the right occipital region at 3.5, 12.8, and 16.0 Hz when shown a positive face in comparison with a neutral face. They also showed increases in absolute power in the left occipital region at 1.9 Hz and in the right occipital region at 2.3 and 3.5 Hz with positive compared to non-face stimuli. In contrast, positive, negative, and neutral faces elicited the same responses in premature infants. In conclusion, our study provides electrophysiological evidence that emotional face processing develops differently in premature than in full-term infants, suggesting that premature birth alters mechanisms of brain development, such as the myelination process, and consequently affects complex cognitive functions.

If possible this would allow for the development of BCI interfaces to train disorders of action and intention understanding beyond simple imitation, such as autism. Methods: We used EEG recordings from 20 healthy participants, as well as electrocorticography (ECoG) in one, based on a virtual reality setup. To test feasibility of discrimination between each type of imagery at the single trial level, time-frequency and source analysis were performed and further assessed by data-driven statistical classification using Support Vector Machines. Results: The main observed differences between self-other imagery conditions in topographic maps were found in Frontal and Parieto-Occipital regions, in agreement with the presence of 2 independent non mu related contributions in the low alpha frequency range. ECOG corroborated such separability. Source analysis also showed differences near the temporo- parietal junction and single-trial average classification accuracy between both types of motor imagery was 67 +/- 1%, and raised above 70% when 3 trials were used. The single-trial classification accuracy was significantly above chance level for all the participants of this study (p < 0.02). Conclusions: The observed pattern of results show that Self and Third Person MI use distinct electrophysiological mechanisms detectable at the scalp (and ECOG) at the single trial level, with separable levels of involvement of the mirror neuron system in different regions. These observations provide a promising step to develop new BCI training/rehabilitation paradigms for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders of action understanding beyond simple imitation, such as autism, who would benefit from training and anticipation of the perceived intention of others as opposed to own intentions in social contexts.

The dominant rhythm in the healthy adult human brain is formed by alpha oscillations with a typical power peak most commonly found between 8 and 12 Hz. This alpha peak frequency has been repeatedly discussed as a highly heritable and stable neurophysiological "trait" marker reflecting anatomical properties of the brain, and individuals' general cognitive capacity. However, growing evidence suggests that the alpha peak frequency is highly volatile at shorter time scales, dependent on the individuals' "state". Based on the converging experimental and theoretical results from numerous recent studies, here we propose that alpha frequency variability forms the basis of an adaptive mechanism mirroring the activation level of neural populations which has important functional implications. We here integrate experimental and computational perspectives to shed new light on the potential role played by shifts in alpha peak frequency and discuss resulting implications. We further propose a potential mechanism by which alpha oscillations are regulated in a noisy network of spiking neurons in presence of delayed feedback. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this study, the hypothesis of a neural synchronization impairment is investigated more specifically as a function of different neural oscillatory bands and temporal information rates in speech. Auditory steady-state responses to 4, 10, 20 and 40 Hz modulations were recorded in normal reading and dyslexic adolescents to measure neural synchronization of theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma oscillations to syllabic and phonemic rate information. In comparison to normal readers, dyslexic readers showed reduced non-synchronized theta activity, reduced synchronized alpha activity and enhanced synchronized beta activity. Positive correlations between alpha synchronization and phonological skills were found in normal readers, but were absent in dyslexic readers. In contrast, dyslexic readers exhibited positive correlations between beta synchronization and phonological skills. Together, these results suggest that auditory neural synchronization of alpha and beta oscillations is atypical in dyslexia, indicating deviant neural processing of both syllabic and phonemic rate information. Impaired synchronization of alpha oscillations in particular demonstrated to be the most prominent neural anomaly possibly hampering speech and phonological processing in dyslexic readers.

Identifying the factors able to predict cognitive worsening since the early stage may improve disease management. The objective of this study was to define the best predictors of future cognitive worsening in a group of patients with newly diagnosed PD and to propose cutoff values potentially useful at the individual level. Methods: Fifty-four consecutive drug-naive patients with de novo PD were prospectively evaluated by clinical and neuropsychological assessment, resting EEG, and I-123-FP-CIT-SPECT and clinically classified into mainly motor, diffuse/malignant, and intermediate PD subtypes; they were then followed up for an average of 5 years. Cognitive outcome was defined by identifying cognitively stable or worsened patients. Results: Step-wise logistic regression selected the posterior qEEG mean frequency and I-123-FP-CIT-SPECT uptake at caudate level (P < 0.0001). The posterior qEEG mean frequency (cut point, 8.3 Hz) and the caudate I-123-FP-CIT-SPECT uptake (cut point, 2.3, specific to nondisplaceable binding ratio) achieved 82% and 80% of accuracy, respectively, in predicting cognitive outcome. Survival analysis showed decreasing expected time to cognitive worsening associated with scores below the established thresholds for qEEG and I-123-FP-CIT-SPECT and with the presence of a malignant clinical phenotype. Conclusions: Resting EEG and I-123-FP-CIT-SPECT are good predictors of future cognitive worsening, in de novo drug-naive PD patients. Wherever available, these biomarkers could add valuable prognostic information to classification into different clinical phenotypes.

Because the pathological alterations are predominantly probed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), many questions about the electrophysiological bases of resting-state alterations in psychiatric disorders, particularly among mood disorder patients, remain unanswered. Alongside important research using electroencephalography (EEG), the specific recent contributions and future promise of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in this field are not fully recognized and valued. Here, we provide a critical review of recent findings from MEG resting-state connectivity within major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The clinical MEG resting-state results are compared with those previously reported with fMRI and EEG. Taken together, MEG appears to be a promising but still critically underexploited technique to unravel the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate abnormal (both hyper- and hypo-) connectivity patterns involved in MDD and BD. In particular, a major strength of MEG is its ability to provide source-space estimations of neuromagnetic long-range rhythmic synchronization at various frequencies (i.e., oscillatory coupling). The reviewed literature highlights the relevance of probing local and interregional rhythmic synchronization to explore the pathophysiological underpinnings of each disorder. However, before we can fully take advantage of MEG connectivity analyses in psychiatry, several limitations inherent to MEG connectivity analyses need to be understood and taken into account. Thus, we also discuss current methodological challenges and outline paths for future research. MEG resting-state studies provide an important window onto perturbed spontaneous oscillatory brain networks and hence supply an important complement to fMRI-based resting-state measurements in psychiatric populations.

This study aimed at evaluating the effects of different neuromodulation techniques in patients with CVP on cortical activity, through electreocephalography (EEG) and on pain perception, through clinical tests. Design: A pilot crossover randomized controlled study. Settings: Out-patient. Subjects: Adults with CVP (>3 months). Methods: Participants received four interventions in a randomized order: (1) transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) and active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined, (2) tPCS alone, (3) tDCS alone, and (4) sham condition. Resting state quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and pain assessments were performed before and after each intervention. Results were compared with a cohort of 47 healthy controls. Results: We enrolled six patients with CVP for a total of 21 visits completed. Compared with healthy participants, patients with CVP showed altered cortical activity characterized by increased power in theta, alpha and beta bands, and a significant reduction in the alpha/beta ratio. Regarding tES, the combination of tDCS with tPCS had no effect on power in any of the bandwidths, nor brain regions. Comparing tPCS with tDCS alone, we found that tPCS induced higher increase in power within the theta and alpha bandwidths. Conclusion: This study confirms that patients with CVP present abnormal EEG-indexed cortical activity compared with healthy controls. Moreover, we showed that combining two types of neurostimulation techniques had no effect, whereas the two interventions, when applied individually, have different neural signatures.

Accumulating evidence has also revealed the modulatory effects of emotional arousal on attentional processing. However, it remains unclear how top-down attention interacts with emotional memoranda in VSTM. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of alpha oscillations and their spatiotemporal characteristics that underlie top-down attention to threatening representations during VSTM maintenance with electroencephalography. Participants were instructed to remember a threatening object and a neutral object in a cued variant delayed response task. Retrospective cues (retro-cues) were presented to direct attention to the hemifield of a threatening object (i.e., cue-to-threat trials) or a neutral object (i.e., cue-to-neutral trials) during a retention interval prior to the probe test. We found a significant retro-cue-related alpha lateralisation over posterior regions during VSTM maintenance. The novel finding was that the magnitude of alpha lateralisation was greater for cue-to-threat objects compared to cue-to-neutral ones. These results indicated that directing attention towards threatening representations compared to neutral representations could result in greater regulation of alpha activity contralateral to the cued hemifield. Importantly, we estimated the spatiotemporal pattern similarity in alpha activity and found significantly higher similarity indexes for the posterior regions relative to the anterior regions and for the cue-to-threat objects relative to cue-to-neutral objects over the posterior regions. Together, our findings provided the oscillatory evidence of greater top-down modulations of alpha lateralisation and spatiotemporal pattern similarity for attending to threatening representations in VSTM.

In fact, most standardized interoceptive tasks require directing attention to internal signals. However, most studies in the field have failed to compare attentional modulations between internally- and externally-driven processes, thus probing blind to the specificity of the former. Here we address this issue through a multidimensional approach combining behavioral measures, analyses of event-related potentials and functional connectivity via high-density electroencephalography, and intracranial recordings. In Study 1, 50 healthy volunteers performed a heartbeat detection task as we recorded modulations of the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) in three conditions: exteroception, basal interoception (also termed interoceptive accuracy), and post-feedback interoception (sometimes called interoceptive learning). In Study 2, to evaluate whether key interoceptive areas (posterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex) were differentially modulated by externally- and internally-driven processes, we analyzed human intracranial recordings with depth electrodes in these regions. This unique technique provides a very fine grained spatio-temporal resolution compared to other techniques, such as EEG or fMRI. We found that both interoceptive conditions in Study 1 yielded greater HEP amplitudes than the exteroceptive one. In addition, connectivity analysis showed that post-feedback interoception, relative to basal interoception, involved enhanced long-distance connections linking frontal and posterior regions. Moreover, results from Study 2 showed a differentiation between oscillations during basal interoception (broadband: 35-110 Hz) and exteroception (1-35 Hz) in the insula, the amygdala, the somatosensory cortex, and the inferior frontal gyrus. In sum, this work provides convergent evidence for the specificity and dynamics of attentional mechanisms involved in interoception.

J	Kaiser, AK; Doppelmayr, M; Iglseder, B				Kaiser, Andreas K.; Doppelmayr, Michael; Iglseder, Bernhard			EEG beta 2 power as surrogate marker for memory impairment: a pilot study	INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS			English	Article						EEG; beta power; MCI; memory; geriatric medicine	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OSCILLATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; ALPHA	Background: Memory deficits are dominant in dementia and are positively correlated with electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) beta power. EEG beta power can predict the progression of Alzheimer's (AD) as early as at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and could possibly be used as surrogate marker for memory impairment. The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between frontal and parietal EEG beta power and memory-test outcome. Frontal and parietal beta power is analyzed for a resting state and an eyes-closed backward counting condition and related to memory impairment parameters. Methods: A total of 28 right-handed female geriatric patients (mean age = 80.6) participated voluntarily in this study. Beta 1 (12.9-19.2 Hz) and beta 2 (19.2-32.4 Hz) EEG power at F3, F4, Fz, P3, P4, and Pz are correlated with immediate wordlist recall, delayed wordlist recall, recognition of learned words, and delayed figure recall. For classification between impaired and intact memory, we calculated a binary logistic regression model with memory impairment as a dependent variable and beta 2 power as an independent variable. Results: We found significant positive correlations between frontal and parietal beta power and delayed memory recall. A significant correlation (Bonferroni correction, p < 0.05) was found at F4 beta 2 during backward counting. The binary logistic regression model with F4 beta 2 power during the counting condition as a predictor yielded a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI) and a specificity of 73.3% (95% CI) for classifying patients into "verbal-memory impaired" and "intact." Conclusions: EEG beta 2 power recorded during a backward counting condition with eyes closed can be used as surrogate marker for verbal memory impairment in geriatric patients. Antidepressant treatment was correlated with EEG data in resting state but not in counting condition. Further studies are necessary to verify the results of this pilot study.

Two EEG phenotypes, low- and high-voltage alpha (LVA & HVA), have been demonstrated to have high heritabilities. They have different prevalence depending on a population's ancestral origins. In the present study we assessed the influence of ancestry admixture on EEG alpha power, and conducted a whole genome sequencing association analysis and an ancestry-informed polygenic study on those phenotypes in a Native American (NA) population that has a high prevalence of LVA. Seven common variants, in LD with each other upstream from gene ASIC2, reached genome-wide significance (p = 2 x 10(-8)) having a positive association with alpha voltage. They had lower minor allele frequencies in the NAs than in a global population sample. Overall correlations between lower degrees of NA (higher degree European) ancestry and HVA, and higher degrees of NA and LVA were also found. Additionally a rare-variant gene-based study identified gene TIA1 being negatively associated with LVA. Approximately 3% of SNPs exhibited a 15-fold enrichment that explained nearly half of the total SNP-heritability for EEG alpha. These regions showed the most significant anti-correlations between NA ancestry and alpha voltage, and were enriched for genes and pathways mediating cognitive functions. Our findings suggested that these regions likely harbor causal variants for HVA, and lacking of such variants could explain the high prevalence of LVA in this NA population, possibly illuminating the ancestral origin and genetic basis for EEG alpha.

However, as yet it is unclear what aspects of behavioral abnormalities are related to pathology in which striatal subcomponent, that is, the matrix and the striosomes. We therefore studied cognitive control in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism, a model disease of striosomal degeneration, using behavioral paradigms and EEG. Methods: We studied genetically confirmed X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism patients (N = 21) in their early disease stages and healthy matched controls. Error-related behavioral adaptation was tested in a flanker task and response inhibition in a Go/Nogo paradigm during EEG. We focused on error-related negativity during error processing and the Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 in the response inhibition task. Source localization analyses were calculated. In addition, total wavelet power and phase-locking factor reflecting neural synchronization processes in time and frequency across trials were calculated. Results: Error processing and behavioral adaptation predominantly engaging the anterior cingulate cortex was markedly impaired in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism. This was reflected in abnormal reaction times correlating with error-related negativity amplitudes, error related theta band activity, and the phase-locking factor. Also, abnormal error processing correlated with dystonia severity but not with parkinsonism. Response inhibition and corresponding EEG activity were normal. Conclusions: This dissociable pattern of cognitive deficits most likely reflects predominant dysfunction of the striosomal compartment and its connections to the anterior cingulate cortex in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism. The results underscore the importance of striosomes for cognitive function in humans and suggest that striosomes are relays of error-related behavioral adaptation but not inhibitory control.

The 5-HT6 receptor antagonist idalopirdine potentiates the effects of donepezil on gamma oscillations in the frontal cortex of anesthetized and awake rats without affecting sleep-wake architecture	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						5-HT6 receptor; Idalopirdine; Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; EEG; sleep; Alzheimer's disease	MULTIMODAL ANTIDEPRESSANT VORTIOXETINE; NEURONAL NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OBJECT RECOGNITION; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR	The 5-HT6 receptor is a promising target for cognitive disorders, in particular for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The high affinity and selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist idalopirdine (Lu AE58054) is currently in development for mild-moderate AD as adjunct therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). We studied the effects of idalopirdine alone and in combination with the AChEl donepezil on cortical function using two in vivo electrophysiological methods. Neuronal network oscillations in the frontal cortex were measured during electrical stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis (nPO) in the anesthetized rat and by an electroencephalogram (EEG) in the awake, freely moving rat. In conjunction with the EEG study, we investigated the effects of idalopirdine and donepezil on sleep-wake architecture using telemetric polysomnography. Idalopirdine (2 mg/kg i.v.) increased gamma power in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during nPO stimulation. Donepezil (03 and 1 mg/kg i.v.) also increased cortical gamma power and pretreatment with idalopirdine (2 mg/kg i.v.) potentiated and prolonged the effects of donepezil. Similarly, donepezil (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently increased frontal cortical gamma power in the freely moving rat and pretreatment with idalopirdine (10 mg/kg p.o.) augmented the effect of donepezil 1 mg/kg. Analysis of the sleep-wake architecture showed that donepezil (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently delayed sleep onset and decreased the time spent in both REM and non REM sleep stages. In contrast, idalopirdine (10 mg/kg p.o.) did not affect sleep-wake architecture nor the effects of donepezil. In summary, we show that idalopirdine potentiates the effects of donepezil on frontal cortical gamma oscillations, a pharmacodynamic biomarker associated with cognition, without modifying the effects of donepezil on sleep.

User status such as attention affects BCI performance; thus detecting the user's attention drift due to internal or external factors is essential for high detection accuracy. New method: An auditory oddball task was applied to divert the users' attention during a simple ankle dorsiflexion movement. Electroencephalogram signals were recorded from eighteen channels. Temporal and time-frequency features were projected to a lower dimension space and used to analyze the effect of two attention levels on motor tasks in each participant. Then, a global feature distribution was constructed with the projected time-frequency features of all participants from all channels and applied for attention classification during motor movement execution. Results: Time-frequency features led to significantly better classification results with respect to the temporal features, particularly for electrodes located over the motor cortex. Motor cortex channels had a higher accuracy in comparison to other channels in the global discrimination of attention level. Comparing with existing methods: Previous methods have used the attention to a task to drive external devices, such as the P300 speller. However, here we focus for the first time on the effect of attention drift while performing a motor task. Conclusions: It is possible to explore user's attention variation when performing motor tasks in synchronous BCI systems with time-frequency features. This is the first step towards an adaptive real-time BCI with an integrated function to reveal attention shifts from the motor task. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Heart rate variability as a biomarker for epilepsy seizure prediction	BRATISLAVA MEDICAL JOURNAL-BRATISLAVSKE LEKARSKE LISTY			English	Article						epileptic seizure; heart rate variability; linear and non-linear analysis; prediction		OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes seizures of many different types. Recent research has shown that epileptic seizures can be predicted by using the electrocardiogrami instead of the electroencephalogram. In this study, we used the heart rate variability that is generated by the fluctuating balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to predict epileptic seizures. METHODS: We studied 11 epilepsy patients to predict the seizure interval. With regar tos the fact that HRV signals are nonstationary, our analysis focused on linear features in the time and frequency domain of HRV signal such as RR Interval (RRI), mean heart rate (HR), high-frequency (HF) (0.15-0.40 Hz) and low-frequency (LF) (0.04-0.15 Hz), as well as LF/HF. Also, quantitative analyses of Poincare plot features (SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2 ratio) were performed. HRV signal was divided into intervals of 5 minutes. In each segment linear and nonlinear features were extracted and then the amount of each segment compared to the previous segment using a threshold. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our method using specificity and sensitivity. RESULTS: During seizures, mean HR, LF/HF, and SD2/SD1 ratio significantly increased while RRI significantly decreased. Significant differences between two groups were identified for several HRV features. Therefore, these parameters can be used as a useful feature to discriminate a seizure from a non-seizure The seizure prediction algorithm proposed based on HRV achieved 88.3% sensitivity and 86.2 % specificity. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the HRV signal contains valuable information and can be a predictor for epilepsy seizure. Although our results in comparison with EEG ares a little bit weaker, the recording of ECG is much easier and faster than EEG. Also, our finding showed the results of this study are considerably better than recent research based on ECG (Tab. 1, Fig. 10, Ref. 17). Text in PDF www.elis.sk.	[Moridani, M.

Ketamine: differential neurophysiological dynamics in functional networks in the rat brain	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS; EEG OSCILLATIONS; AMPA RECEPTORS; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Recently, the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine has emerged as a fast-onset mechanism to achieve antidepressant activity, whereas its psychomimetic, dissociative and amnestic effects have been well documented to pharmacologically model schizophrenia features in rodents. Sleep-wake architecture, neuronal oscillations and network connectivity are key mechanisms supporting brain plasticity and cognition, which are disrupted in mood disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. In rats, we investigated the dynamic effects of acute and chronic subcutaneous administration of ketamine (2.5, 5 and 10 mg kg(-1)) on sleep-wake cycle, multichannels network interactions assessed by coherence and phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling, locomotor activity (LMA), cognitive information processing as reflected by the mismatch negativity-like (MMN) component of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Acute ketamine elicited a short, lasting inhibition of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, increased coherence in higher gamma frequency oscillations independent of LMA, altered theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling, increased MMN peak-amplitude response and evoked higher gamma oscillations. In contrast, chronic ketamine reduced large-scale communication among cortical regions by decreasing oscillations and coherent activity in the gamma frequency range, shifted networks activity towards slow alpha rhythm, decreased MMN peak response and enhanced aberrant higher gamma neuronal network oscillations. Altogether, our data show that acute and chronic ketamine elicited differential changes in network connectivity, ERPs and event-related oscillations (EROs), supporting possible underlying alterations in NMDAR-GABAergic signaling. The findings underscore the relevance of intermittent dosing of ketamine to accurately maintain the functional integrity of neuronal networks for long-term plastic changes and therapeutic effect.

J	Nozaradan, S; Mouraux, A; Cousineau, M				Nozaradan, Sylvie; Mouraux, Andre; Cousineau, Marion			Frequency tagging to track the neural processing of contrast in fast, continuous sound sequences	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalographic; frequency tagging; auditory contrast; sensory discrimination	INDIVIDUAL FACE DISCRIMINATION; STATE EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; STREAM SEGREGATION; DEVIANCE DETECTION; BRAIN; ENTRAINMENT; PREDICTABILITY; SENSITIVITY; ADAPTATION	The human auditory system presents a remarkable ability to detect rapid changes in fast, continuous acoustic sequences, as best illustrated in speech and music. However, the neural processing of rapid auditory contrast remains largely unclear, probably due to the lack of methods to objectively dissociate the response components specifically related to the contrast from the other components in response to the sequence of fast continuous sounds. To overcome this issue, we tested a novel use of the frequency-tagging approach allowing contrast-specific neural responses to be tracked based on their expected frequencies. The EEG was recorded while participants listened to 40-s sequences of sounds presented at 8Hz. A tone or interaural time contrast was embedded every fifth sound (AAAAB), such that a response observed in the EEG at exactly 8 Hz/5 (1.6 Hz) or harmonics should be the signature of contrast processing by neural populations. Contrast-related responses were successfully identified, even in the case of very fine contrasts. Moreover, analysis of the time course of the responses revealed a stable amplitude over repetitions of the AAAAB patterns in the sequence, except for the response to perceptually salient contrasts that showed a buildup and decay across repetitions of the sounds. Overall, this new combination of frequency-tagging with an oddball design provides a valuable complement to the classic, transient, evoked potentials approach, especially in the context of rapid auditory information. Specifically, we provide objective evidence on the neural processing of contrast embedded in fast, continuous sound sequences. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Recent theories suggest that the basis of neurodevelopmental auditory disorders such as dyslexia might be an impaired processing of fast auditory changes, highlighting how the encoding of rapid acoustic information is critical for auditory communication. Here, we present a novel electrophysiological approach to capture in humans neural markers of contrasts in fast continuous tone sequences. Contrast-specific responses were successfully identified, even for very fine contrasts, providing direct insight on the encoding of rapid auditory information.

Traditional electroencephalographic studies investigating sleep architecture have found reduced deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, or slow wave sleep (SWS), and increased REMdensity. However, these findings have been inconsistently observed, and have not survivedmeta- analysis. By contrast, several recent EEG studies exploring brain activity during sleep have established marked deficits in sleep spindles in schizophrenia, including first-episode and early-onset patients, compared to both healthy and psychiatric comparison subjects. Spindles are waxing and waning, 12-16 Hz NREMsleep oscillations that are generated within the thalamus by the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and are then synchronized and sustained in the cortex. While the functional role of sleep spindles still needs to be fully established, increasing evidence has shown that sleep spindles are implicated in learning and memory, including sleep dependent memory consolidation, and spindle parameters have been associated to general cognitive ability and IQ. In this article wewill review the EEG studies demonstrating sleep spindle deficits in patients with schizophrenia, and show that spindle deficits can predict their reduced cognitive performance. We will then present data indicating that spindle impairments point to a TRN-MD thalamus-prefrontal cortex circuit deficit, and discuss about the possible molecular mechanisms underlying thalamo-cortical sleep spindle abnormalities in schizophrenia.

Inferring oscillatory modulation in neural spike trains	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							FIELD POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; GRID CELLS; DYNAMICS; MODELS; FREQUENCY	Oscillations are observed at various frequency bands in continuous-valued neural recordings like the electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) in bulk brain matter, and analysis of spike-field coherence reveals that spiking of single neurons often occurs at certain phases of the global oscillation. Oscillatory modulation has been examined in relation to continuous-valued oscillatory signals, and independently from the spike train alone, but behavior or stimulus triggered firing-rate modulation, spiking sparseness, presence of slow modulation not locked to stimuli and irregular oscillations with large variability in oscillatory periods, present challenges to searching for temporal structures present in the spike train. In order to study oscillatory modulation in real data collected under a variety of experimental conditions, we describe a flexible point-process framework we call the Latent Oscillatory Spike Train (LOST) model to decompose the instantaneous firing rate in biologically and behaviorally relevant factors: spiking refractoriness, event-locked firing rate non-stationarity, and trial-to-trial variability accounted for by baseline offset and a stochastic oscillatory modulation. We also extend the LOST model to accommodate changes in the modulatory structure over the duration of the experiment, and thereby discover trial-to-trial variability in the spike-field coherence of a rat primary motor cortical neuron to the LFP theta rhythm. Because LOST incorporates a latent stochastic auto-regressive term, LOST is able to detect oscillations when the firing rate is low, the modulation is weak, and when the modulating oscillation has a broad spectral peak.

Methods: we studied EEG-EMG recordings of 19 consecutive patients, aged 2-29 years, with DS associated with SCN1A gene mutations to detect and evaluate myoclonus based on the spectrum of EMG activity on antagonist muscle pairs and cortico-muscular coherence (CMC). Results: multifocal action myoclonus was detected in all patients corresponding to brief EMG bursts, which occurred synchronously on antagonist muscles at a frequency peaking in beta band. There was significant CMC in beta band, and a cortico-muscular transfer time consistent with a cortical origin of the jerks. The somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were giant in only one patient who also showed exaggerated long-loop reflexes (LLRs). The nine patients who had experienced myoclonic seizures showed greater CMC. Conclusions: The cortical myoclonus consistently observed in patients with DS shows features that are similar to those characterizing progressive myoclonus epilepsy, but differs because it does not have a severely worsening course and is not commonly associated with increased SSEPs or enhanced LLRs. This kind of myoclonus is an intrinsic feature of DS associated with SCN1A mutations, and may be a cause of disability. Significance: We hypothesize that myoclonus is generated in cortical motor areas by hyper-synchronous oscillations, which are possibly due to sodium channel dysfunction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Overexpressing wild-type gamma 2 subunits rescued the seizure phenotype in Gabrg2(+/Q390X) Dravet syndrome mice	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						GABA(A) receptors; Genetic epilepsies; GABRG2(Q390X) mutation; Gene-replacement therapy; Dravet syndrome; Epileptic encephalopathy	CHILDHOOD ABSENCE EPILEPSY; GABA(A) RECEPTOR; FEBRILE SEIZURES; GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; GENETIC EPILEPSIES; NATURAL-HISTORY; GABRG2 MUTATION; RETT-SYNDROME; MOUSE MODEL; IN-VITRO	Objective: The mutant gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor gamma 2(Q390X) subunit (Q351X in the mature peptide) has been associated with the epileptic encephalopathy, Dravet syndrome, and the epilepsy syndrome genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). The mutation generates a premature stop codon that results in translation of a stable truncated and misfolded gamma 2 subunit that accumulates in neurons, forms intracellular aggregates, disrupts incorporation of gamma 2 subunits into GABAA receptors, and affects trafficking of partnering a and b subunits. Heterozygous Gabrg2(+/Q390X) knock-in (KI) mice had reduced cortical inhibition, spike wave discharges on electroencephalography (EEG), a lower seizure threshold to the convulsant drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), and spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In this proof-of-principal study, we attempted to rescue these deficits in KI mice using a gamma 2 subunit gene (GABRG2) replacement therapy. Methods: We introduced the GABRG2 allele by crossing Gabrg2(+/Q390X) KI mice with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice overexpressing HA (hemagglutinin)- tagged human gamma 2(HA) subunits, and compared GABAA receptor subunit expression by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining, seizure threshold by monitoring mouse behavior after PTZ-injection, and thalamocortical inhibition and network oscillation by slice recording. Results: Compared to KI mice, adult mice carrying both mutant allele and transgene had increased wild-type gamma 2 and partnering a1 and b2/ 3 subunits, increased miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) amplitudes recorded from layer VI cortical neurons, reduced thalamocortical network oscillations, and higher PTZ seizure threshold. Significance: Based on these results we suggest that seizures in a genetic epilepsy syndrome caused by epilepsy mutant gamma 2(Q390X) subunits with dominant negative effects could be rescued potentially by overexpression of wild-type c2 subunits.

Fine Structure of Posterior Alpha Rhythm in Human EEG: Frequency Components, Their Cortical Sources, and Temporal Behavior	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN ACTIVITY; BAND POWER; OSCILLATIONS; LOCALIZATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SLEEP; TWIN	Heterogeneity of the posterior alpha rhythm (AR) is a widely assumed but rarely tested phenomenon. We decomposed the posterior AR in the cortical source space with a 3-way PARAFAC technique, taking into account the spatial, frequency, and temporal aspects of mid-density EEG. We found a multicomponent AR structure in 90% of a group of 29 healthy adults. The typical resting-state structure consisted of a high-frequency occipito-parietal component of the AR (ARC1) and a low-frequency occipito-temporal component (ARC2), characterized by individual dynamics in time. In a few cases, we found a 3-component structure, with two ARC1s and one ARC2. The AR structures were stable in their frequency and spatial features over weeks to months, thus representing individual EEG alpha phenotypes. Cortical topography, individual stability, and similarity to the primate AR organization link ARC1 to the dorsal visual stream and ARC2 to the ventral one. Understanding how many and what kind of posterior AR components contribute to the EEG is essential for clinical neuroscience as an objective basis for AR segmentation and for interpreting AR dynamics under various conditions, both normal and pathological, which can selectively affect individual components.

How this reprocessing of memory during sleep affects the hippocampal representation itself, is unclear. Here we tested hippocampal stimulus processing (i.e., pattern separation) before and after periods of sleep and wakefulness in humans (female and male participants). Pattern separation deteriorated across the wake period but remained stable across sleep (p=0.013) with this sleep-wake difference being most pronounced for stimuli with low similarity to targets (p=0.006). Stimuli with the highest similarity showed a reversed pattern with reduced pattern separation performance after sleep (p=0.038). Pattern separation performance was positively correlated with sleep spindle density, slow oscillation density, and theta power phase-locked to slow oscillations. Sleep, presumably by neural memory replay, shapes hippocampal representations and enhances computations of pattern separation to subsequent presentation of similar stimuli.

In addition, continuous blood pressure measurements which comply with MEG compatibility requirements are lacking. For instance, by combining methods reflecting neurovascular status one could obtain more information on low frequency fluctuations that have recently gained increasing interest as a mediator of functional connectivity within brain networks. This paper presents a multimodal brain imaging setup, capable to non-invasively and continuously measure cerebral hemodynamic, cardiorespiratory and blood pressure oscillations simultaneously with MEG. In the setup, all methods apart from MEG rely on the use of fibre optics. In particular, we present a method for measuring of blood pressure and cardiorespiratory oscillations continuously with MEG. The potential of this type of multimodal setup for brain research is demonstrated by our preliminary studies on human, showing effects of mild hypercapnia, gathered simultaneously with the presented modalities.

Nevertheless, the molecular regulators of prolonged wakefulness remain poorly understood. Evidence from genetic, behavioral, pharmacologic and imaging studies suggest that dopaminergic signaling contributes to the behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) consequences of sleep loss, although direct human evidence thereof is missing. We tested whether dopamine neurotransmission regulate sustained attention and evolution of EEG power during prolonged wakefulness. Here, we studied the effects of functional genetic variation in the dopamine transporter (DAT1) and the dopamine D-2 receptor (DRD2) genes, on psychomotor performance and standardized waking EEG oscillations during 40 hours of wakefulness in 64 to 82 healthy volunteers. Sleep deprivation consistently enhanced sleepiness, lapses of attention and the theta-to-alpha power ratio (TAR) in the waking EEG. Importantly, DAT1 and DRD2 genotypes distinctly modulated sleep loss-induced changes in subjective sleepiness, PVT lapses and TAR, according to inverted U-shaped relationships. Together, the data suggest that genetically determined differences in DAT1 and DRD2 expression modulate functional consequences of sleep deprivation, supporting the hypothesis that striato-thalamo-cortical dopaminergic pathways modulate the neurobehavioral and neurophysiological consequences of sleep loss in humans.

This phenomenon is labeled as serial order effect in DT. The present study investigated whether different executive processes (i.e., updating, shifting, and inhibition) specifically contribute to the serial order effect in DT. Participants' executive functions were measured by corresponding experimental tasks outside of the EEG lab. They were required to generate original uses of conventional objects (alternative uses task) during EEG recording. The behavioral results revealed that the originality of ideas was higher in later stage of DT (i.e., Epoch 2) than in its earlier stage (i.e., Epoch 1) for higher-shifting individuals, but showed no difference between two epochs for lower-shifting individuals. The EEG results revealed that lower-inhibition individuals showed stronger upper alpha (10-13 Hz) synchronization in left frontal areas during Epoch 1 compared to during Epoch 2. For higher-inhibition individuals, no changes in upper alpha activity from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2 were found. These findings indicated that shifting and inhibition contributed to create a serial order effect in DT, perhaps because individuals suppress interference from obvious ideas and switch to new idea categories during DT, thus more original ideas appear as time passes by.

Many studies have determined robust predictors of recovery and treatment gains and yielded many great results using linear approachs. Evidence has emerged that the nonlinearity is a crucial aspect to study the inter-areal communication in human brains and abnormality of oscillatory activities in the motor system is linked to the pathological states. In this study, we hypothesized that combinations of linear and nonlinear (cross-frequency) network connectivity parameters are favourable biomarkers for stratifying patients for upper limb rehabilitation with increased accuracy. We identified the biomarkers by using 37 prerehabilitation electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets during a movement task through effective connectivity and logistic regression analyses. The predictive power of these biomarkers was then tested by using 16 independent datasets (i.e. construct validation). In addition, 14 right handed healthy subjects were also enrolled for comparisons. The result shows that the beta plus gamma or theta network features provided the best classification accuracy of 92%. The predictive value and the sensitivity of these biomarkers were 81.3% and 90.9%, respectively. Subcortical lesion, the time poststroke and initial Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) score were identified as the most significant clinical variables affecting the classification accuracy of this predictive model. Moreover, 12 of 14 normal controls were classified as having favourable recovery. In conclusion, EEG-based linear and nonlinear motor network biomarkers are robust and can help clinical decision making.

Here, we evaluated the effect of dLAN on the cerebrovascular system by analyzing cerebral hemodynamic oscillations using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Fourteen healthy male subjects underwent polysomnography coupled with cerebral MRS. The data collected during sleep with dim light (10 lux) were compared with those collected during sleep under the control dark conditions for the sleep structure, cerebral hemodynamic oscillations, heart rate variability (HRV), and their electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum. Power spectral analysis was applied to oxy-hemoglobin concentrations calculated from the MRS signal. Spectral densities over endothelial very-low-frequency oscillations (VLFOs) (0.003-0.02 Hz), neuro-genic VLFOs (0.02-0.04 Hz), myogenic low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) (0.04-0.15 Hz), and total LFOs (0.003-0.15 Hz) were obtained for each sleep stage. The polysomnographic data revealed an increase in the N2 stage under the dLAN conditions. The spectral analysis of cerebral hemody-namics showed that the total LFOs increased significantly during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and decreased during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Specifically, endothelial (median of normalized value, 0.46 vs. 0.72, p = 0.019) and neurogenic (median, 0.58 vs. 0.84, p = 0.019) VLFOs were enhanced during SWS, whereas endothelial VLFOs (median, 1.93 vs. 1.47, p = 0.030) were attenuated during REM sleep. HRV analysis exhibited altered spectral densities during SWS induced by dLAN, including an increase in very-low-frequency and decreases in low-frequency and high-frequency ranges. In the EEG power spectral analysis, no significant difference was detected between the control and dLAN conditions. In conclusion, dLAN can disturb cerebral hemodynamics via the endothelial and autonomic systems without cortical involvement, predominantly during SWS, which might represent an underlying mechanism of the increased cere-brovascular risk associated with light exposure during sleep.

We determined epileptogenicity using the occurrence rate (OR) of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and the modulation index (MI), demonstrating strength of coupling between HFO and slow wave. We hypothesized that epileptogenicity increased over the multiple lobes but skipped the MA. Methods: We analyzed 23 children (14 subtotal hemispherectomy; 9 multilobar resections). Scalp video-EEG and magnetoencephalography were performed before surgery. We analyzed the OR(HFO) and MI(5 (phases= 0.5-8) (Hz)) on electrodes of total area, resection areas, and MA. We compared the data between good [International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) class I-II] and poor (III-VI) seizure outcome groups. Results: ILAE class Ia outcome was achieved in 18 children. Among the MI(5 phases) in the resection areas, MI(3-4 (Hz)) was the highest. The OR(HFO) and MI(3-4 (Hz)) in both total area and resection areas were significantly higher in the good seizure outcome group than in the poor outcome group. The OR(HFO) and MI(3-4 (Hz)) in resection areas were significantly higher than in the MA. Conclusions: Our patients with multilobar drug-resistant epilepsy showed evidence of multifocal epileptogenicity that specifically skipped the MA.

The present study investigated neural correlates of early stages of emotional face processing in this group compared with typically developing children using the Gamma Band Activity (GBA). Methods: A total of 19 children diagnosed with ADHD (Combined type) based on DSM-IV classification were compared with 19 typically developing children matched on age, gender, and IQ. The participants performed an emotional face recognition while their brain activities were recorded using an event-related oscillation procedure. Results: The results indicated that ADHD children compared to normal group showed a significant reduction in the gamma band activity, which is thought to reflect early perceptual emotion discrimination for happy and angry emotions (P<0.05). Conclusion: The present study supports the notion that individuals with ADHD have some impairments in early stage of emotion processing which can cause their misinterpretation of emotional faces.

The Effect of Lateralization of Motor Onset and Emotional Recognition in PD Patients Using EEG	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; Emotion; Parkinson's disease; Body side of motor onset	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; PROSODIC STIMULI; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; ASYMMETRY; DEFICITS; AROUSAL; MUSIC; CUES	The objective of this research was to investigate the relationship between emotion recognition and lateralization of motor onset in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The subject pool consisted of twenty PD patients [ten with predominantly left-sided (LPD) and ten with predominantly right-sided (RPD) motor symptoms] and 20 healthy controls (HC) that were matched for age and gender. Multimodal stimuli were used to evoke simple emotions, such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. Artifact-free emotion EEG signals were processed using the auto regressive spectral method and then subjected to repeated ANOVA measures. No group differences were observed across behavioral measures; however, a significant reduction in EEG spectral power was observed at alpha, beta and gamma frequency oscillations in LPD, compared to RPD and HC participants, suggesting that LPD patients (inferred right-hemisphere pathology) are impaired compared to RPD patients in emotional processing. We also found that PD-related emotional processing deficits may be selective to the perception of negative emotions. Previous findings have suggested a hemispheric effect on emotion processing that could be related to emotional response impairment in a subgroup of PD patients. This study may help in clinical practice to uncover potential neurophysiologic abnormalities of emotional changes with respect to PD patient's motor onset.

In this study, harmonics of certain frequencies in brain are used which are detected by SSVEP and visual stimulus potentials to be used in Robot Arm Control. This stimulus has been made using shapes of box that oscillated at certain frequencies. The signal components were clustered according to the same direction and stimulus frequency on the data set for the desired work, task or movement. These signals were processed by the band pass filters at 5-30 Hz then HD process were applied. The filtered signals classified by Neural Network and Cubic-Support Vector Machine after MWT analysis were applied to these. Evaluated average success rate is over 90 %. Finally, the test brain signals recorded for 3 tasks over the trained network have been successfully used for Robot Arm Control. The use of the proposed HD-MWT method is promising for the development of a real-time robot control with SSVEP-based BCI.

We hypothesized that interictal VHFOs are more specific biomarkers for epileptogenic zone compared to traditional HFOs. Methods: Forty patients with focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical stereo-EEG (SEEG) were included in the study. SEEG data were recorded with a sampling rate of 25kHz, and a 30-minute resting period was analyzed for each patient. Ten patients met selected criteria for analyses of correlations with surgical outcome: detection of interictal ripples (Rs), fast ripples (FRs), and VHFOs; resective surgery; and at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up. Using power envelope computation and visual inspection of power distribution matrixes, electrode contacts with HFOs and VHFOs were detected and analyzed. Results: Interictal very fast ripples (VFRs; 500-1,000Hz) were detected in 23 of 40 patients and ultrafast ripples (UFRs; 1,000-2,000Hz) in almost half of investigated subjects (n=19). VFRs and UFRs were observed only in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and were recorded exclusively from mesiotemporal structures. The UFRs were more spatially restricted in the brain than lower-frequency HFOs. When compared to R oscillations, significantly better outcomes were observed in patients with a higher percentage of removed contacts containing FRs, VFRs, and UFRs. Interpretation: Interictal VHFOs are relatively frequent abnormal phenomena in patients with epilepsy, and appear to be more specific biomarkers for epileptogenic zone when compared to traditional HFOs.

However, the response rate is variable depending on baseline conditions. Optimizing rTMS protocols to improve treatment effects and response rates will depend on reliably assessing brain state conditions. In this regard, neural activity guided optimization has shown potential in several neuroimaging studies. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on optimizing rTMS treatment of a balance disorder called Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS), a motion perception disorder caused by entrainment to background motion. Our previous work has revealed that a neuroimaging marker of resting state functional connectivity may help predict therapeutic effect. Motivated by our previous pilot study with fMRI, the present study aims to extend the investigation to EEG data that were simultaneously acquired with fMRI, with the aim of transferring the fMRI imaging marker to a more accessible neural recording technology.

Frequency shift in topography of spontaneous brain rhythms from childhood to adulthood	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Spectral power; Development; Individual alpha peak frequency; Frequency shifting; Topography; Children	DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BAND POWER; EEG ALPHA; ADOLESCENTS; MATURATION; AGE; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE	It has been described that the frequency ranges at which theta, mu and alpha rhythms oscillate is increasing with age. The present report, by analyzing the spontaneous EEG, tries to demonstrate whether there is an increase with age in the frequency at which the cortical structures oscillate. A topographical approach was followed. The spontaneous EEG of one hundredand seventy subjects was recorded. The spectral power (from 0.5 to 45.5 Hz) was obtained by means of the Fast Fourier Transform. Correlations of spatial topographies among the different age groups showed that older groups presented the same topographical maps as younger groups, but oscillating at higher frequencies. The results suggest that the same brain areas oscillate at lower frequencies in children than in older groups, for a broad frequency range. This shift to a higher frequency with age would be a trend in spontaneous brain rhythm development.	[Rodriguez-Martinez, E. I.; Ruiz-Martinez, F. J.; Barriga Paulino, C.

In this paper, the frequency and duration of these segments were monitored during calm meditation and insight meditation in experienced and naive meditators. A newly developed methodology based on complex continuous wavelet coherence was used to estimate these parameters. The durations highly depend on frequency band and vary from 60 ms to 250 ms. A shorter duration and a lower frequency of synchronization were found for experienced meditators during both types of meditations for the real and the imaginary parts of the complex continuous wavelet coherence. The greatest duration differences were in the gamma band, which may be associated with handling attention during meditation, whereas the differences in the alpha band were most significant for frequency. Combining the two parameters resulted in the total duration of the synchronization, which has discriminative accuracy of up to 100% and appears to be a sensitive parameter of the length of training of meditators.

Dynamic Increase in Corticomuscular Coherence during Bilateral, Cyclical Ankle Movements	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						corticomuscular coherence; motor control; locomotion; electroencephalography; electromyography	TIBIALIS ANTERIOR; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION; EEG OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR CORTEX; BETA; WALKING; SYNCHRONIZATION; MUSCLE; MODULATION; TASK	In humans, the midline primary motor cortex is active during walking. However, the exact role of such cortical participation is unknown. To delineate the role of the primary motor cortex in walking, we examined whether the primary motor cortex would activate leg muscles during movements that retained specific requirements of walking (i.e., locomotive actions). We recorded electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals from 15 healthy, young men while they sat and performed bilateral, cyclical ankle movements. During dorsiflexion, near-20-Hz coherence increased cyclically between the midline primary motor cortex and the co-contracting antagonistic pair (i.e., tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles) in both legs. Thus, we have shown that dynamic increase in corticomuscular coherence, which has been observed during walking, also occurs during simple bilateral cyclical movements of the feet. A possible mechanism for such coherence is corticomuscular communication, in which the primary motor cortex participates in the control of movement. Furthermore, because our experimental task isolated certain locomotive actions, the observed coherence suggests that the human primary motor cortex may participate in these actions (i.e., maintaining a specified movement frequency, bilaterally coordinating the feet, and stabilizing the posture of the feet). Additional studies are needed to identify the exact cortical and subcortical interactions that cause corticomuscular coherence and to further delineate the functional role of the primary motor cortex during bilateral cyclical movements such as walking.

The goal of this review was to give a comprehensive overview of the most frequently studied EEG spectral and event-related potential (ERP) measures in social anxiety during rest, anticipation, stimulus processing, and recovery. A Web of Science search yielded 35 studies reporting on electrocortical measures in individuals with social anxiety or related constructs. Social anxiety was related to increased delta-beta cross-frequency correlation during anticipation and recovery, and information processing biases during early processing of faces (P1) and errors (error-related negativity). These electrocortical measures are discussed in relation to the persistent cycle of information processing biases maintaining SAD. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms of this persistent cycle and study the utility of electrocortical measures in early detection, prevention, treatment and endophenotype research.

J	O'Hare, L				O'Hare, Louise			Steady-state VEP responses to uncomfortable stimuli	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG spectral analysis; steady-state potentials; vision; visual discomfort	OPTOKINETIC NYSTAGMUS; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; VISUAL DISCOMFORT; ILLUSORY MOTION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; OP-ART; PSYCHOPHYSICS; MIGRAINE; IMAGES; STATISTICS	Periodic stimuli, such as op-art, can evoke a range of aversive sensations included in the term visual discomfort. Illusory motion effects are elicited by fixational eye movements, but the cortex might also contribute to effects of discomfort. To investigate this possibility, steady-state visually evoked responses (SSVEPs) to contrast-matched op-art-based stimuli were measured at the same time as discomfort judgements. On average, discomfort reduced with increasing spatial frequency of the pattern. In contrast, the peak amplitude of the SSVEP response was around the midrange spatial frequencies. Like the discomfort judgements, SSVEP responses to the highest spatial frequencies were lowest amplitude, but the relationship breaks down between discomfort and SSVEP for the lower spatial frequency stimuli. This was not explicable by gross eye movements as measured using the facial electrodes. There was a weak relationship between the peak SSVEP responses and discomfort judgements for some stimuli, suggesting that discomfort can be explained in part by electrophysiological responses measured at the level of the cortex. However, there is a breakdown of this relationship in the case of lower spatial frequency stimuli, which remains unexplained.

We compared practitioners of three different meditation traditions (Vipassana, Himalayan Yoga and Isha Shoonya) with a control group during a meditative and instructed mind-wandering (IMW) block. All meditators showed higher parieto-occipital 60-110 Hz gamma amplitude than control subjects as a trait effect observed during meditation and when considering meditation and IMW periods together. Moreover, this gamma power was positively correlated with participants meditation experience. Independent component analysis was used to show that gamma activity did not originate in eye or muscle artifacts. In addition, we observed higher 7-11 Hz alpha activity in the Vipassana group compared to all the other groups during both meditation and instructed mind wandering and lower 10-11 Hz activity in the Himalayan yoga group during meditation only. We showed that meditation practice is correlated to changes in the EEG gamma frequency range that are common to a variety of meditation practices.

Classic examples of such modulations are the strong stimulus-related oscillatory phenomena known as the movement related beta decrease (MRBD) and post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). A sharp decrease in neural oscillatory power is observed during movement (MRBD) followed by an increase above baseline on movement cessation (PMBR). MRBD and PMBR represent important neuroscientific phenomena which have been shown to have clinical relevance. Here, we present a parsimonious model for the dynamics of synchrony within a synaptically coupled spiking network that is able to replicate a human MEG power spectrogram showing the evolution from MRBD to PMBR. Importantly, the high-dimensional spiking model has an exact mean field description in terms of four ordinary differential equations that allows considerable insight to be obtained into the cause of the experimentally observed time-lag from movement termination to the onset of PMBR (similar to 0.5 s), as well as the subsequent long duration of PMBR (similar to 1 - 10 s). Our model represents the first to predict these commonly observed and robust phenomena and represents a key step in their understanding, in health and disease.

Propofol is known to increase GABAA inhibition and decrease H-current strength, but how it generates these rhythms and their interactions is still unknown. To investigate both generation of the alpha rhythm and its PAC to SWO, we simulate a Hodgkin-Huxley network model of a hyperpolarized thalamus and corticothalamic inputs. We find, for the first time, that the model thalamic network is capable of independently generating the sustained alpha seen in propofol, which may then be relayed to cortex and expressed on the EEG. This dose-dependent sustained alpha critically relies on propofol GABAA potentiation to alter the intrinsic spindling mechanisms of the thalamus. Furthermore, the H-current conductance and background excitation of these thalamic cells must be within specific ranges to exhibit any intrinsic oscillations, including sustained alpha. We also find that, under corticothalamic SWO UP and DOWN states, thalamocortical output can exhibit maximum alpha power at either the peak or trough of this SWO; this implies the thalamus may be the source of propofol-induced PAC. Hyperpolarization level is the main determinant of whether the thalamus exhibits trough-max PAC, which is associated with lower propofol dose, or peak-max PAC, associated with higher dose. These findings suggest: the thalamus generates a novel rhythm under GABAA potentiation such as under propofol, its hyperpolarization may determine whether a patient experiences trough-max or peak-max PAC, and the thalamus is a critical component of propofolinduced cortical spectral phenomena. Changes to the thalamus may be a critical part of how propofol accomplishes its effects, including unconsciousness.

Monitored common mode waveform contains Hum noise frequency component during EEG measurement is used for a master clock frequency of the N-path filter. The hum noise frequency as a master clock of the PLL is compared with a rectangular wave obtained by dividing the output frequency of the VCO which is aimed to oscillate at 400 or 480 Hz by 8. The oscillation frequency of the VCO is controlled by the bias voltage. The output signal of the VCO is inputted to a logic circuit that generates an 8-bit digital waveform, and the output for controlling the N-path filter is generated. It is possible to attenuate 50 or 60 Hz component of the EEG signal contains hum noise through an N-path (N = 8) filter. We simulated the PLL (PFD-CP, VCO), logic circuit, N-path filter and measured characteristics of the implemented PLL and logic circuit in this research.

The Effects of Methylphenidate on the Neural Signatures of Sustained Attention	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						EEG oscillations; Inattention; Perceptual decision making; Psychostimulants; Ritalin; Time-on-task decrement	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ADHD; ATOMOXETINE; MODULATION; CITALOPRAM; ADULTS; SIGNAL; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; ACCUMULATION	BACKGROUND: Although it is well established that methylphenidate (MPH) enhances sustained attention, the neural mechanisms underpinning this improvement remain unclear. We examined how MPH influenced known electro-physiological precursors of lapsing attention over different time scales. METHODS: We measured the impact of MPH, compared with placebo, on behavioral and electrocortical markers while healthy adults (n = 40) performed a continuous monitoring paradigm designed to elicit attentional lapses. RESULTS: MPH led to increased rates of target detection, and electrophysiological analyses were conducted to identify the mechanisms underlying these improvements. Lapses of attention were reliably preceded by progressive increases in alpha activity that emerged over periods of several seconds. MPH led to an overall suppression of alpha activity across the entire task but also diminished the frequency of these maladaptive pretarget increases through a reduction of alpha variability. A drug-related linear increase in the amplitude of the frontal P3 event-related component was also observed in the pretarget timeframe (3 or 4 seconds). Furthermore, during immediate target processing, there was a significant increase in the parietal P3 amplitude with MPH, indicative of enhanced perceptual evidence accumulation underpinning target detection. MPH-related enhancements occurred without significant changes to early visual processing (visual P1 and 25-Hz steady-state visual evoked potential). CONCLUSIONS: MPH serves to reduce maladaptive electrophysiological precursors of lapsing attention by acting selectively on top-down endogenous mechanisms that support sustained attention and target detection with no significant effect on bottom-up sensory excitability. These findings offer candidate markers to monitor the therapeutic efficacy of psychostimulants or to predict therapeutic responses.

J	Stankovski, T				Stankovski, Tomislav			Time-varying coupling functions: Dynamical inference and cause of synchronization transitions	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; SYSTEMS; CAUSALITY; TUTORIAL; SERIES	Interactions in nature can be described by their coupling strength, direction of coupling, and coupling function. The coupling strength and directionality are relatively well understood and studied, at least for two interacting systems; however, there can be a complexity in the interactions uniquely dependent on the coupling functions. Such a special case is studied here: synchronization transition occurs only due to the time variability of the coupling functions, while the net coupling strength is constant throughout the observation time. To motivate the investigation, an example is used to present an analysis of cross-frequency coupling functions between delta and alpha brain waves extracted from the electroencephalography recording of a healthy human subject in a free-running resting state. The results indicate that time-varying coupling functions are a reality for biological interactions. A model of phase oscillators is used to demonstrate and detect the synchronization transition caused by the varying coupling functions during an invariant coupling strength. The ability to detect this phenomenon is discussed with the method of dynamical Bayesian inference, which was able to infer the time-varying coupling functions. The form of the coupling function acts as an additional dimension for the interactions, and it should be taken into account when detecting biological or other interactions from data.

Steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs), the brain responses to repetitive stimulation, are commonly used in both clinical practice and scientific research. Particular brain mechanisms underlying SSEPs in different modalities (i.e. visual, auditory and tactile) are very complex and still not completely understood. Each response has distinct resonant frequencies and exhibits a particular brain topography. Moreover, the topography can be frequency-dependent, as in case of auditory potentials. However, to study each modality separately and also to investigate multisensory interactions through multimodal experiments, a proper experimental setup appears to be of critical importance. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate a novel SSEP experimental setup providing a repetitive stimulation in three different modalities (visual, tactile and auditory) with a precise control of stimuli parameters. Results from a pilot study with a stimulation in a particular modality and in two modalities simultaneously prove the feasibility of the device to study SSEP phenomenon. Approach. We developed a setup of three separate stimulators that allows for a precise generation of repetitive stimuli. Besides sequential stimulation in a particular modality, parallel stimulation in up to three different modalities can be delivered. Stimulus in each modality is characterized by a stimulation frequency and a waveform (sine or square wave). We also present a novel methodology for the analysis of SSEPs. Main results. Apart from constructing the experimental setup, we conducted a pilot study with both sequential and simultaneous stimulation paradigms. EEG signals recorded during this study were analyzed with advanced methodology based on spatial filtering and adaptive approximation, followed by statistical evaluation. Significance. We developed a novel experimental setup for performing SSEP experiments. In this sense our study continues the ongoing research in this field. On the other hand, the described setup along with the presented methodology is a considerable improvement and an extension of methods constituting the state-of-the-art in the related field. Device flexibility both with developed analysis methodology can lead to further development of diagnostic methods and provide deeper insight into information processing in the human brain.

Dissecting the Function of Hippocampal Oscillations in a Human Anxiety Model	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anxiety; approach-avoidance; cingulate cortex; hippocampus; MEG; theta oscillations	APPROACH-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT; DECISION-MAKING; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS; CINGULATE CORTEX; BOLD SIGNAL; THETA; MEG; EEG; BEHAVIORS	Neural oscillations in hippocampusandmedial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) are a hallmark of rodent anxiety models that buildonconflict between approachandavoidance. Yet, the function of these oscillations, andtheir expression inhumans, remainelusive. Here, weusedmagnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate neural oscillations in a task that simulated approach-avoidance conflict, wherein 23 male and female human participants collected monetary tokens under a threat of virtual predation. Probability of threat was signaled by color and learned beforehand by direct experience. Magnitude of threat corresponded to a possible monetary loss, signaled as a quantity. We focused our analyses on an a priori defined region-of-interest, the bilateral hippocampus. Oscillatory power under conflict was linearly predicted by threat probability in a location consistent with right mid-hippocampus. This pattern was specific to the hippocampus, most pronounced in the gamma band, and not explained by spatial movement or anxiety-like behavior. Gamma power was modulated by slower theta rhythms, and this theta modulation increased with threat probability. Furthermore, theta oscillations in the same location showed greater synchrony with mPFC theta with increased threat probability. Strikingly, these findings were not seen in relation to an increase in threat magnitude, which was explicitly signaled as a quantity and induced similar behavioral responses as learned threat probability. Thus, our findings suggest that the expression of hippocampal and mPFC oscillatory activity in the context of anxiety is specifically linked to threat memory. These findings resonate with neurocomputational accounts of the role played by hippocampal oscillations in memory.

J	Samiee, S; Baillet, S				Samiee, Soheila; Baillet, Sylvain			Time-resolved phase-amplitude coupling in neural oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Phase-amplitude coupling; Cross-frequency coupling; Neural oscillations; Electrophysiology; Brain dynamics	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES; GAMMA; EEG; HIPPOCAMPUS; MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE	Cross-frequency coupling between neural oscillations is a phenomenon observed across spatial scales in a wide range of preparations, including human non-invasive electrophysiology. Although the functional role and mechanisms involved are not entirely understood, the concept of interdependent neural oscillations drives an active field of research to comprehend the ubiquitous polyrhythmic activity of the brain, beyond empirical observations. Phase-amplitude coupling, a particular form of cross-frequency coupling between bursts of high-frequency oscillations and the phase of lower frequency rhythms, has recently received considerable attention. However, the measurement methods have relatively poor sensitivity and require long segments of experimental data. This obliterates the resolution of fast changes in coupling related to behavior, and more generally, to the non-stationary dynamics of brain electrophysiology. We propose a new measure of phase-amplitude coupling that can resolve up to one, optimally two, cycles of the underlying slow frequency component. The method also provides a measure of the coupling strength, for augmented insight into the mechanisms involved. We demonstrate the technique with synthesized data and compare its performances with existing methods. We also show that the method reveals rapid changes in coupling parameters in data from the entorhinal cortex of a free-behaving rat. The time-resolved changes revealed are compatible with behavior and complement observed modulations of oscillatory power. We anticipate that this new measure of dynamic phase-amplitude coupling will contribute to accelerate research into the dynamics of inter-dependent oscillatory components related to brain functions and dysfunctions.

J	von Ellenrieder, N; Dubeau, F; Gotman, J; Frauscher, B				von Ellenrieder, Nicolas; Dubeau, Francois; Gotman, Jean; Frauscher, Birgit			Physiological and pathological high-frequency oscillations have distinct sleep-homeostatic properties	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Epilepsy; Intracerebral EEG; Polysomnography; High frequency oscillations; Sleep	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SEIZURE-ONSET ZONE; SLOW WAVES; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS	Objective: The stage of sleep is a known modulator of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). For instance, high amplitude slow waves during NREM sleep and the subtypes of REM sleep were shown to contribute to a better separation between physiological and pathological HFOs. This study investigated rates and spatial spread of the different HFO types (physiological and pathological ripples in the 80-250 Hz frequency band, and fast ripples above 250 Hz) depending on time spent in sleep across the different sleep cycles. Methods: Fifteen patients with focal pharmaco-resistant epilepsy underwent one night of video-polysomnography during chronic intracranial EEG recording for presurgical epilepsy evaluation. The HFO rate and spread across the different sleep cycles were determined with an automatic HFO detector. We built models to explain the observed rate and spread based on time in sleep and other variables i.e. sleep stage, delta band and sigma band activity, and slow wave amplitude. Statistical significance of the different variables was determined by a model comparison using the Akaike information criterion. Results: The rate of HFOs depends significantly on the accumulated time of sleep. As the night advanced, the rate of pathological ripples and fast ripples decreased during NREM sleep (up to 15% per hour spent in the respective sleep stages), while the rate of physiological ripples increased during REM sleep (8% per hour spent in REM sleep). Interestingly, the stage of sleep but not the sleep cycle determined the extent of spread of HFOs, showing a larger field during NREM sleep and a more restricted field during REM sleep. Conclusion: The different dependence with sleep time for physiological and pathological ripples is in keeping with their distinct underlying generating mechanisms. From a practical point of view, the first sleep cycle seems to be best suitable for studying HFOs in epilepsy, given that the contrast between physiological and pathological ripple rates is largest during this time.

A Prospective Study of Age-dependent Changes in Propofol-induced Electroencephalogram Oscillations in Children	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the International-Anesthesia-Research-Society	MAR 23, 2015	Honolulu, HI	Int Anesthesia Res Soc			GENERAL-ANESTHESIA EXPOSURE; INDUCED ALPHA-RHYTHM; BISPECTRAL INDEX; POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM; NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCK; EEG SIGNAL; SEVOFLURANE; CHILDHOOD; CONSCIOUSNESS; INFANTS	Background: In adults, frontal electroencephalogram patterns observed during propofol-induced unconsciousness consist of slow oscillations (0.1 to 1 Hz) and coherent alpha oscillations (8 to 13 Hz). Given that the nervous system undergoes significant changes during development, anesthesia-induced electroencephalogram oscillations in children may differ from those observed in adults. Therefore, we investigated age-related changes in frontal electroencephalogram power spectra and coherence during propofol-induced unconsciousness. Methods: We analyzed electroencephalogram data recorded during propofol-induced unconsciousness in patients between 0 and 21 yr of age (n = 97), using multitaper spectral and coherence methods. We characterized power and coherence as a function of age using multiple linear regression analysis and within four age groups: 4 months to 1 yr old (n = 4), greater than 1 to 7 yr old (n = 16), greater than 7 to 14 yr old (n = 30), and greater than 14 to 21 yr old (n = 47). Results: Total electroencephalogram power (0.1 to 40 Hz) peaked at approximately 8 yr old and subsequently declined with increasing age. For patients greater than 1 yr old, the propofol-induced electroencephalogram structure was qualitatively similar regardless of age, featuring slow and coherent alpha oscillations. For patients under 1 yr of age, frontal alpha oscillations were not coherent. Conclusions: Neurodevelopmental processes that occur throughout childhood, including thalamocortical development, may underlie age-dependent changes in electroencephalogram power and coherence during anesthesia. These age-dependent anesthesia- induced electroencephalogram oscillations suggest a more principled approach to monitoring brain states in pediatric patients.

However, the characteristics of this input differ across sensory systems; therefore, and as a direct consequence, each sensory system might have developed specialized strategies to cope with the continuous stream of incoming information. Neural oscillations are intimately connected with this selection process, as they can be used by the brain to rhythmically amplify or attenuate input and therefore represent an optimal tool for stimulus selection. In this paper, we focus on oscillatory processes for stimulus selection in the visual and auditory systems. We point out both commonalities and differences between the two systems and develop several hypotheses, inspired by recently published findings: (1) The rhythmic component in its input is crucial for the auditory, but not for the visual system. The alignment between oscillatory phase and rhythmic input (phase entrainment) is therefore an integral part of stimulus selection in the auditory system whereas the visual system merely adjusts its phase to upcoming events, without the need for any rhythmic component. (2) When input is unpredictable, the visual system can maintain its oscillatory sampling, whereas the auditory system switches to a different, potentially internally oriented, "mode" of processing that might be characterized by alpha oscillations. (3) Visual alpha can be divided into a faster occipital alpha (10 Hz) and a slower frontal alpha (7 Hz) that critically depends on attention.

The psychomotor efficiency hypothesis proposes that the development of motor expertise through practice is accompanied by physiological refinements whereby irrelevant processes are suppressed and relevant processes are enhanced. The present study employed a test-retest design to evaluate the presence of greater neurophysiological efficiency with practice and mediation analyses to identify the factors accounting for performance improvements, in a golf putting task. Putting performance, movement - specific conscious processing, electroencephalographic alpha power and alpha connectivity were measured from 12 right-handed recreational golfers (age: M = 21 years; handicap: M = 23) before and after 3 practice sessions. As expected, performance improved and conscious processing decreased with training. Mediation analyses revealed that improvements in performance were partly attributable to increased regional gating of alpha power and reduced cross-regional alpha connectivity. However, changes in conscious processing were not associated with performance improvements. Increased efficiency was manifested at the neurophysiological level as selective inhibition and functional isolation of task-irrelevant cortical regions (temporal regions) and concomitant functional activation of task-relevant regions (central regions). These findings provide preliminary evidence for the development of greater psychomotor efficiency with practice in a precision aiming task.

Neurophysiological correlates of vertical disparity in 3D images are studied in an objective approach using EEG technique. These disparities are known to negatively affect the quality of experience and to cause visual discomfort in stereoscopic visualizations. Approach. We have presented four conditions to subjects: one in 2D and three conditions in 3D, one without vertical disparity and two with different vertical disparity levels. Event related potentials (ERPs) are measured for each condition and the differences between ERP components are studied. Analysis is also performed on the induced potentials in the time frequency domain. Main results. Results show that there is a significant increase in the amplitude of P1 components in 3D conditions in comparison to 2D. These results are consistent with previous studies which have shown that P1 amplitude increases due to the depth perception in 3D compared to 2D. However the amplitude is significantly smaller for maximum vertical disparity (3D-3) in comparison to 3D with no vertical disparity. Our results therefore suggest that the vertical disparity in 3D-3 condition decreases the perception of depth compared to other 3D conditions and the amplitude of P1 component can be used as a discriminative feature. Significance. The results show that the P1 component increases in amplitude due to the depth perception in the 3D stimuli compared to the 2D stimulus. On the other hand the vertical disparity in the stereoscopic images is studied here. We suggest that the amplitude of P1 component is modulated with this parameter and decreases due to the decrease in the perception of depth.

J	Dan, A; Reiner, M				Dan, Alex; Reiner, Miriam			EEG-based cognitive load of processing events in 3D virtual worlds is lower than processing events in 2D displays	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Cognitive load; 3D virtual reality; Social learning VLE	MENTAL WORKLOAD; AUGMENTED REALITY; BRAIN; TASK; ENVIRONMENTS; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; INTELLIGENCE; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE	Interacting with 2D displays, such as computer screens, smartphones, and TV, is currently a part of our daily routine; however, our visual system is built for processing 3D worlds. We examined the cognitive load associated with a simple and a complex task of learning paper-folding (origami) by observing 2D or stereoscopic 3D displays. While connected to an electroencephalogram (EEG) system, participants watched a 2D video of an instructor demonstrating the paper-folding tasks, followed by a stereoscopic 3D projection of the same instructor (a digital avatar) illustrating identical tasks. We recorded the power of alpha and theta oscillations and calculated the cognitive load index (CLI) as the ratio of the average power of frontal theta (Fz.) and parietal alpha (Pz). The results showed a significantly higher cognitive load index associated with processing the 2D projection as compared to the 3D projection; additionally, changes in the average theta Fz power were larger for the 2D conditions as compared to the 3D conditions, while alpha average Pz power values were similar for 2D and 3D conditions for the less complex task and higher in the 3D state for the more complex task. The cognitive load index was lower for the easier task and higher for the more complex task in 2D and 3D. In addition, participants with lower spatial abilities benefited more from the 3D compared to the 2D display. These findings have implications for understanding cognitive processing associated with 2D and 3D worlds and for employing stereoscopic 3D technology over 2D displays in designing emerging virtual and augmented reality applications.

J	Dippel, G; Muckschel, M; Ziemssen, T; Beste, C				Dippel, Gabriel; Mueckschel, Moritz; Ziemssen, Tjalf; Beste, Christian			Demands on response inhibition processes determine modulations of theta band activity in superior frontal areas and correlations with pupillometry - Implications for the norepinephrine system during inhibitory control	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Response inhibition; Pupil diameter; Norepinephrine; EEG; Theta; Superior frontal cortex	LOCUS-COERULEUS; PUPIL DIAMETER; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; ADAPTIVE GAIN; CONFLICT; EEG; ERP; SELECTION; CORTEX	Response inhibition processes are important for goal-directed behavior and particularly demanded when it is unlikely to inhibit automatically executed responses. It has been suggested that the norepinephrine (NE) system is important to consider for such likelihood effects. As an indirect measure of the NE system activity we used the pupil diameter and integrated this data with neurophysiological (EEG) data and beamforming analyses. The study shows that inhibitory control processes reflected by theta oscillations are strongly modulated by the likelihood to employ these processes and that these mechanisms were related to neural processes in the SMA and SFG. Probably, the modulations observed for theta band activity may reflect modulations in the encoding of a surprise, or conflict signal. Interestingly, correlation analyses of neuronal activity at the sensor and the source level with pupil diameter data revealed strong correlations that were only seen in the condition where inhibitory control processes were rarely demanded. On the basis of findings and theoretical models suggesting that the pupil diameter can be interpreted as a proximate of NE system activity the results may be interpreted that the NE system modulates inhibitory control processes via theta band activity in the SFB when the likelihood to inhibit a prepotent response tendency is low. From this it may be speculated that the NE system dynamically gains and loses relevance to modulate inhibitory control depending on boundary conditions that determine the mode of responding.

Posterior alpha EEG Dynamics Dissociate Current from Future Goals in Working Memory-Guided Visual Search	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; priority; selective attention; states; visual search template; visual working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; RETRO-CUEING PARADIGM; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; CORTEX	Current models of visual search assume that search is guided by an active visual working memory representation of what we are currently looking for. This attentional template for currently relevant stimuli can be dissociated from accessory memory representations that are only needed prospectively, for a future task, and that should be prevented from guiding current attention. However, it remains unclear what electrophysiological mechanisms dissociate currently relevant (serving upcoming selection) from prospectively relevant memories (serving future selection). We measured EEG of 20 human subjects while they performed two consecutive visual search tasks. Before the search tasks, a cue instructed observers which item to look for first (current template) and which second (prospective template). During the delay leading up to the first search display, we found clear suppression of alpha band (8-14 Hz) activity in regions contralateral to remembered items, comprising both local power and interregional phase synchronization within a posterior parietal network. Importantly, these lateralization effects were stronger when the memory item was currently relevant (i.e., for the first search) compared with when it was prospectively relevant (i.e., for the second search), consistent with current templates being prioritized over future templates. In contrast, event-related potential analysis revealed that the contralateral delay activity was similar for all conditions, suggesting no difference in storage. Together, these findings support the idea that posterior alpha oscillations represent a state of increased processing or excitability in task-relevant cortical regions, and reflect enhanced cortical prioritization of memory representations that serve as a current selection filter.

Recent brain-computer interface (BCI) assisted stroke rehabilitation protocols tend to focus on sensorimotor activity of the brain. Relying on evidence claiming that a variety of brain rhythms beyond sensorimotor areas are related to the extent of motor deficits, we propose to identify neural correlates of motor learning beyond sensorimotor areas spatially and spectrally for further use in novel BCI-assisted neurorehabilitation settings. Approach. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from healthy subjects participating in a physical force-field adaptation task involving reaching movements through a robotic handle. EEG activity recorded during rest prior to the experiment and during pre-trial movement preparation was used as features to predict motor adaptation learning performance across subjects. Main results. Subjects learned to perform straight movements under the force-field at different adaptation rates. Both resting-state and pre-trial EEG features were predictive of individual adaptation rates with relevance of a broad network of beta activity. Beyond sensorimotor regions, a parieto-occipital cortical component observed across subjects was involved strongly in predictions and a fronto-parietal cortical component showed significant decrease in pre-trial beta-powers for users with higher adaptation rates and increase in pre-trial beta-powers for users with lower adaptation rates. Significance. Including sensorimotor areas, a large-scale network of beta activity is presented as predictive of motor learning. Strength of resting-state parieto-occipital beta activity or pre-trial fronto-parietal beta activity can be considered in BCI-assisted stroke rehabilitation protocols with neurofeedback training or volitional control of neural activity for brain-robot interfaces to induce plasticity.

Motor expertise modulates neural oscillations and temporal dynamics of cognitive control	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Athletes; Behavioral fluctuation; Conflict processing; Neural oscillations	RESPONSE CONFLICT; AEROBIC FITNESS; PERFORMANCE VARIABILITY; PREADOLESCENT CHILDREN; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SEDENTARY CONTROLS; BASEBALL PLAYERS; TENNIS PLAYERS; WORKING-MEMORY; THETA	The field of motor expertise in athletes has recently been receiving increasing levels of investigation. However, there has been less investigation of how dynamic changes in behavior and in neural activity as a result of sporting participation might result in superiority for athletes in domain-general cognition. We used a flanker task to investigate conflict-related behavioral measures, such as mean reaction time (RT) and RT variability, in conjunction with electroencephalographic (EEG) measures, including N2d, theta activity power, and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC). These measures were compared for 18 badminton players, an interceptive sport requiring the performance of skills in a fast-changing and unpredictable environment, and 18 athletic controls (14 track-and-field athletes and 4 dragon boat athletes), with high fitness levels but no requirement for skills such as responses to their opponents. Results showed that badminton players made faster and less variable responses on the flanker task than athletic controls, regardless of stimulus congruency levels. For EEG measures, both badminton players and athletic controls showed comparable modulations of conflicting on midfrontal N2 and theta power. However, such an effect on ITPC values was found only for the badminton players. The behavior-EEG correlation seen suggests that smaller changes in RT variability induced by conflicting process in badminton players may be attributable to greater stability in the neural processes in these individuals. Because these findings were independent from aerobic fitness levels, it seems such differences are likely due to training-induced adaptations, consistent with the idea of specific transfer from cognitive components involved in sport training to domain-general cognition.

Therefore, two single chronic stroke patients with memory deficits (subject A with a bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage; subject B with an ischemic stroke in the left arteria cerebri media) and a healthy elderly control group (N = 24) received up to ten NF training sessions. To evaluate NF training effects, all participants performed multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) resting measurements and a neuropsychological test battery assessing different cognitive functions before and after NF training. Stroke patients showed improvements in memory functions after successful NF training compared to the pre-assessment. Subject B had a pathological delta (0.5-4 Hz) and upper alpha (10-12 Hz) power maximum over the unaffected hemisphere before NF training. After NF training, he showed a more bilateral and "normalized" topographical distribution of these EEG frequencies. Healthy participants as well as subject A did not show any abnormalities in EEG topography before the start of NF training. Consequently, no changes in the topographical distribution of EEG activity were observed in these participants when comparing the pre- and post-assessment. Hence, our results show that upper alpha based NF training had on the one hand positive effects on memory functions, and on the other hand led to cortical "normalization" in a stroke patient with pathological brain activation patterns, which underlines the potential usefulness of NF as neurological rehabilitation tool.

Methods: Male rats were divided into 2 groups including kindled (n = 10) and sham (n = 7) and respectively underwent an amygdala rapid kindling and placebo kindling. EEG signals in stages 1-2 (initial seizure stages (ISS5)), 3 (localized seizure stage (LSS)), and 4-5 generalized seizure stages (GSSs) were divided into 5 bands: delta (0-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-28 Hz), and gamma (28-40 Hz). Spectral power of the sub bands and the ratios of theta/alpha and delta/beta were compared in the three phases and between the sham and kindling groups. Results: Beta power significantly increased during kindling acquisition, though it was significantly lower than sham. Delta oscillation in ISSs was higher than LSS and GSSs, but the difference was significant only with LSS. Moreover, delta power was higher in all stages of kindling than sham. Gamma power in all stages of kindling was significantly lower than sham. Alpha power was significantly reduced in ISS5, compared with sham, but gradually increased during epileptogenesis. Theta/alpha and delta/beta increased in all stages, compared with sham (p < 0.05). Theta/alpha significantly decreased in LSS and GSSs, compared with ISSs (p < 0.05). Delta/beta decreased during kindling, but it was significantly different only between ISSs and LSS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Beta and alpha oscillations at ISS5 significantly decreased, but gradually increased along with kindling progression. Furthermore, delta power significantly increased during kindling process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These task contexts are challenging for the human operator because they require inputs at irregular and highly interspaced moments even though these actions are often critical. It has been shown that such conditions lead to divided and distracted attentional states which in turn reduce the processing of external stimuli (e.g. alarms) and may lead to miss critical events. In this study we explored to which extent it is possible to predict an operator's behavioural performance in a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) monitoring task using electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. More specifically we investigated the relevance of large-scale EEG connectivity for performance prediction by correlating relative coherence with reaction times (RT). We show that long-range EEG relative coherence, i.e. between occipital and frontal electrodes, is significantly correlated with RT and that different frequency bands exhibit opposite effects. More specifically we observed that coherence between occipital and frontal electrodes was: negatively correlated with RT at 6Hz (0 band), more coherence leading to better performance, and positively correlated with RT at 8Hz (lower a band), more coherence leading to worse performance. Our results suggest that EEG connectivity measures could be useful in predicting an operator's attentional state and her/his performances in ecological settings. Hence these features could potentially be used in a neuro-adaptive interface to improve operator-system interaction and safety in critical systems.

In this paper, we combine behavioral measures, virtual environment, and EEG signal-processing to provide a holistic investigation about the influence of landmarks on performance during navigation in a maze-like environment. In an experiment, participants were randomly divided into two conditions, Landmark-enriched (LM+; N = 17) and Landmark-devoid (LM-; N = 18), and asked to navigate from an initial location to a goal location in a maze. In the LM+ condition, there were landmarks placed at certain locations, which participants could use for wayfinding in the maze. However, in the LM-condition, such landmarks were not present. Beyond behavioral analyses of data, analyses were carried out of the EEG data collected using a 64-channel device. Results revealed that participants took less time and committed fewer errors in navigating the maze in the LM+ condition compared to the LM- condition. EEG analyses of the data revealed that the left-hemispheric activation was more prominent in the LM+ condition compared to the LM- condition. The event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) of the theta frequency band, revealed activation in the left posterior inferior and superior regions in the LM+ condition compared to the LM- condition, suggesting an occurrence of an object-location binding in the LM+ condition along with spatial transformation between representations. Moreover, directed transfer function method, which measures information flow between two regions, showed a higher number of active channels in the LM- condition compared to the LM+ condition, exhibiting additional wiring cost associated with the cognitive demands when no landmark was available. These findings reveal pivotal role of the left-hemispheric region (especially, parietal cortex), which indicates the integration of available sensory cues and current memory requirements to encode contextual information of landmarks. Overall, this research helps to understand the role of brain regions and processes that are utilized when people use landmarks in navigating maze-like environments.

Post-hypnotic instructions may enable highly hypnotizable participants to inhibit the automatic access to word meaning. Here we compared the consequences of hypnosis alone and hypnosis with post-hypnotic instructions on the Stroop effect and its facilitation and inhibition components. Importantly, we studied the mechanisms of the hypnosis effects at the neural level by analyzing EEG frequencies. Highly hypnotizable participants performed the Stroop task in a counterbalanced design following (1) post-hypnotic suggestions that words had lost their meaning, (2) after hypnosis alone, and (3) in a control condition without hypnosis. The overall Stroop effect and both its facilitation and interference components, were not significant after the post-hypnotic suggestion but in both other conditions. Hypnosis alone neither affected the Stroop effect nor in contrast to some previous reports and claims overall performance. EEG recorded during the Stroop task showed a significant increase in both frontal theta and frontal beta power when participants were under the impact of post-hypnotic suggestions, in comparison to the two other sessions. Together, these findings indicate that post-hypnotic suggestions but not hypnosis alone are powerful tools for eliciting top down processes. Our EEG findings could be interpreted as clue that this is due to the investment of additional cognitive control.

Technical solutions for simultaneous MEG and SEEG recordings: towards routine clinical use	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; intracerebral EEG; simultaneous recordings; epilepsy	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SIMULTANEOUS MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: The simultaneous recording of intracerebral EEG (stereotaxic EEG, SEEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a promising strategy that provides both local and global views on brain pathological activity. Yet, acquiring simultaneous signals poses difficult technical issues that hamper their use in clinical routine. Our objective was thus to develop a set of solutions for recording a high number of SEEG channels while preserving signal quality. Approach: We recorded data in a patient with drug resistant epilepsy during presurgical evaluation. We used dedicated insertion screws and optically insulated amplifiers. We recorded 137 SEEG contacts on 10 depth electrodes (5-15 contacts each) and 248 MEG channels (magnetometers). Signal quality was assessed by comparing the distribution of RMS values in different frequency bands to a reference set of MEG acquisitions. Main results: The quality of signals was excellent for both MEG and SEEG; for MEG, it was comparable to that of MEG signals without concurrent SEEG. Discharges involving several structures on SEEG were visible on MEG, whereas discharges limited in space were not seen at the surface. Significance: SEEG can now be recorded simultaneously with whole-head MEG in routine. This opens new avenues, both methodologically for understanding signals and improving signal processing methods, and clinically for future combined analyses.	[Badier, J. M.; Dubarry, A.

However, aged mice show an increase in the amount of sleep, whereas humans show a decrease when aging. Mice are considered an important model in aging studies, and this divergence warrants further investigation. Recently, insights into the network dynamics of cortical activity during sleep were obtained by investigating characteristics of individual electroencephalogram (EEG) slow waves in young and elderly humans. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the parameters of EEG slow waves, including their incidence, amplitude, duration and slopes, in young (6 months) and older (18-24 months) C57BL/6J mice during undisturbed 24 h, and after a 6-h sleep deprivation (SD). As expected, older mice slept more but, in contrast to humans, absolute NREM sleep EEG slow-wave activity (SWA, spectral power density between 0.5-4 Hz) was higher in the older mice, as compared to the young controls. Furthermore, slow waves in the older mice were characterized by increased amplitude, steeper slopes and fewer multipeak waves, indicating increased synchronization of cortical neurons in aging, opposite to what was found in humans. Our results suggest that older mice, in contrast to elderly humans, live under a high sleep pressure.

The wavelet transform (WT) method was improved by combining the complex Morlet WT with Shannon entropy to enhance the temporal-frequency resolution during HFO detection. And the matching pursuit (MP) method was improved by combining it with an adaptive genetic algorithm to improve the speed and accuracy of the calculations for HFO detection. The HFOs detected by these two methods were used to localize SOZs in five patients. A comparison shows that the improved WT method provides high specificity and quick localization and that the improved MP method provides high sensitivity.

Until recently insufficient attention was paid to the question of how different types of oscillations are synchronized during the processing of the information coming to the brain. In the present work the expressiveness and correlation of rhythmic activity in the theta, alpha and gamma ranges in animals in two behavioral states were analyzed: during quiet wakefulness and during perception of sensory signals. Local field potentials (LFPs) in eight brain structures (cortical and subcortical) were registered. In many areas, an increase of oscillatory activity during the presentation of external signals was revealed. The main result of the present work is the detection of a sharp increase of cross-frequency relations in all oscillatory bands, both in the cortical and subcortical structures during the processing of sensory information. It is supposed that an increase of synchronization of rhythmic activities in different brain areas is necessary for detailed assessment of environmental signals and their registration in the memory system.

Results show that brain oscillations are synchronized between listener and speaker during oral narratives. This interpersonal synchronization is mediated in part by a lower-level sensory mechanism of speech-to-brain synchronization, but also by the interactive process that takes place in the situation per se. These results demonstrate the existence of brain-to-brain entrainment which is not merely an epiphenomenon of auditory processing, during listening to one speaker. The study highlights the validity of the two-person neuroscience framework for understanding induced brain activity, and suggests that verbal information exchange cannot be fully understood by examining the listener's or speaker's brain activity in isolation.

In epileptic rats analyzed up to approximately two weeks after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), these patterns are associated with specific high-frequency oscillation (HFO) content: ripples (80-200 Hz) or fast-ripples (250-500 Hz) predominate in LVF or HYP seizures, respectively. To establish whether these features change over the course of the disease, we recorded the EEG from the hippocampal CA3 subfield, subiculum, entorhinal cortex and dentate gyms in two groups of pilocarpine-treated rats: the "early stage group" (n = 8) was analyzed from day 3 to 20 post-SE while the "late stage group" (n = 7) was studied from day 27 to 53 post-SE. We found that: (i) HYP and LVF seizures prevail in the early and late stage group, respectively; (ii) HYP seizures mainly originate from CA3 in the early stage group only; (iii) LVF seizures in both early and late stage group originate from a diffuse network; (iv) LVF and HYP seizures in the early stage group are mainly associated with ripples and fast ripples, respectively; but (v) fast ripples predominate in the late stage group, regardless of seizure onset pattern. Finally, extensive neuronal loss occurred in the hippocampus of the late stage group. Our results reveal that significant changes in ictogenesis and HFO occurrence, which are associated with the manifestation of severe hippocampal damage, occur over time in this MTLE model.

Empirical research on these NCCs covers a wide range of brain activity signals, measures, and methodologies. In this paper, we focus on spontaneous brain oscillations; rhythmic fluctuations of neuronal (population) activity which can be characterized by a range of parameters, such as frequency, amplitude (power), and phase. We provide an overview of oscillatory measures that appear to correlate with conscious perception. We also discuss how increasingly sophisticated techniques allow us to study the causal role of oscillatory activity in conscious perception (i.e., 'entrainment'). This review of oscillatory correlates of consciousness suggests that, for example, activity in the alpha-band (7-13 Hz) may index, or even causally support, conscious perception. But such results also showcase an increasingly acknowledged difficulty in NCC research; the challenge of separating neural activity necessary for conscious experience to arise (prerequisites) from neural activity underlying the conscious experience itself (substrates) or its results (consequences).

Dissecting gamma frequency activity during human memory processing	BRAIN			English	Article						gamma oscillations; intracranial EEG; ECoG; evoked response potential; neuronal ensembles	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INTRACRANIAL RECORDINGS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; SPIKING ACTIVITY; BAND ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; THETA; EEG	Gamma frequency activity (30-150 Hz) is induced in cognitive tasks and is thought to reflect underlying neural processes. Gamma frequency activity can be recorded directly from the human brain using intracranial electrodes implanted in patients undergoing treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. Previous studies have independently explored narrowband oscillations in the local field potential and broadband power increases. It is not clear, however, which processes contribute to human brain gamma frequency activity, or their dynamics and roles during memory processing. Here a large dataset of intracranial recordings obtained during encoding of words from 101 patients was used to detect, characterize and compare induced gamma frequency activity events. Individual bursts of gamma frequency activity were isolated in the time-frequency domain to determine their spectral features, including peak frequency, amplitude, frequency span, and duration. We found two distinct types of gamma frequency activity events that showed either narrowband or broadband frequency spans revealing characteristic spectral properties. Narrowband events, the predominant type, were induced by word presentations following an initial induction of broadband events, which were temporally separated and selectively correlated with evoked response potentials, suggesting that they reflect different neural activities and play different roles during memory encoding. The two gamma frequency activity types were differentially modulated during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words. In conclusion, we found evidence for two distinct activity types induced in the gamma frequency range during cognitive processing. Separating these two gamma frequency activity components contributes to the current understanding of electrophysiological biomarkers, and may prove useful for emerging neurotechnologies targeting, mapping and modulating distinct neurophysiological processes in normal and epileptogenic brain.

Well-functioning BCIs often require many channels, which can be difficult to properly prepare and require expert support. Low-channel setups, however, can lead to poor or unreliable classification of intent. Here we introduce a novel method for extracting more information from a single EEG channel and test it on a ten subject motor imagery dataset. Instead of looking at bandpower or phase synchrony, we test the average frequency within each trial to see if there are task-dependent changes in the spectral locations of neural frequency peaks. We show that using this feature in combination with standard bandpower features is significantly better than bandpower features alone across subjects, both for standard electrodes and electrodes that include a Laplacian filter.

Pronounced increase of theta activity is commonly observed in patients with chronic neurogenic pain. However, its association with encoding of pain experience in patients with chronic pain is still unclear. The goal of the present study is to investigate the theta encoding of sensory and emotional information of long-term menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea (PDM). Forty-six young women with PDM and 46 age-matched control subjects underwent resting-state magnetoencephalography study during menstrual and periovulatory phases. Our results revealed increased theta activity in brain regions of pain processing in women with PDM, including the right parahippocampal gyrus, right posterior insula, and left anterior/middle cingulate gyrus during the menstrual phase and the left anterior insula and the left middle/inferior temporal gyrus during the periovulatory phase. The correlations between theta activity and the psychological measures pertaining to pain experience (depression, state anxiety, and pain rating index) implicate the role of theta oscillations in emotional and sensory processing of pain. The present study provides evidence for the role of theta oscillations in encoding the immediate and sustained effects of pain experience in young women with PDM.

For this reason, multichannel EEG recordings were adopted, while the solution of the inverse problem was applied in a generic head model, in order to obtain the cortical signals. The cortical networks have been computed for each band separately, using the magnitude square coherence metric. The main graph theoretical parameters, showed differences in segregation and integration in almost all EEG bands of the HMAs in comparison to LMAs, indicative of a great influence of the anticipatory anxiety prior to mathematical performance.

Previous research suggests that the processing of fear and sadness has different neural bases, and that dynamics in theta frequency is particularly sensitive to the processing of emotional stimuli. However, it remains unknown whether theta oscillations vary in emotion regulation processes as a function of discrete emotions. We, therefore, explored theta oscillatory patterns of cognitive reappraisal for sad and fearful stimuli by spectrum analysis. EEG from 24 healthy volunteers was recorded correspondingly while they were asked to passively watch or reappraise the content of pictures with sad or fear emotion. In the first "watching" task, volunteers were asked to only watch the stimulus attentively. In the later "regulation" tasks, the volunteers, however, were asked to engage in cognitive reappraisal and decrease the negative interpretation of the presenting scenes. Through our analysis of the results, we realized that fearful stimuli were invoked stronger than sad stimuli in both "watching" and "regulation" tasks. Furthermore, the reappraisal or fearful scenes could decrease the theta oscillations more in "regulation" task than in "watching" task with fearful stimuli.

This method combines the advantages of both the Shannon-entropy-based complex Morlet wavelet transform (SE-CMWT) and adaptive-genetic-algorithm-based matching pursuit (AGA-MP) methods to achieve satisfactory localization performance. The Hilbert transform method is used to identify events of interest. The SE-CMWT-based power spectral density method is applied to acquire channels of interest (Cols). By using the Morlet wavelets as the dictionary elements, the AGA-MP method combined with Morlet wavelets is developed to detect high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) on Cols with faster speed and higher accuracy than the AGA-MP method. And the characteristics of HFOs are used to localize SOZs based on the half maximum method. A comparison shows that our method has higher sensitivity and specificity than four existing methods.

Neural processing of musical meter in musicians and non-musicians	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Musical meter; Temporal structure; Tempo; Duple vs. triple meter; Music training; EEG	BEAT PERCEPTION; AUDITORY SEQUENCES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RHYTHM; BRAIN; RESPONSES; P2; SOUNDS; BETA; OSCILLATIONS	Musical sounds, along with speech, are the most prominent sounds in our daily lives. They are highly dynamic, yet well structured in the temporal domain in a hierarchical manner. The temporal structures enhance the predictability of musical sounds. Western music provides an excellent example: while time intervals between musical notes are highly variable, underlying beats can be realized. The beat-level temporal structure provides a sense,of regular pulses. Beats can be further organized into units, giving the percept of alternating strong and weak beats (i.e. metrical structure or meter). Examining neural processing at the meter level offers a unique opportunity to understand how the human brain extracts temporal patterns, predicts future stimuli and optimizes neural resources for processing. The present study addresses two important questions regarding meter processing, using the mismatch negativity (MMN) obtained with electroencephalography (EEG): 1) how tempo (fast vs. slow) and type of metrical structure (duple: two beats per unit vs. triple: three beats per unit) affect the neural processing of metrical structure in non-musically trained individuals, and 2) how early music training modulates the neural processing of metrical structure. Metrical structures were established by patterns of consecutive strong and weak tones (Standard) with occasional violations that disrupted and reset the structure (Deviant). Twenty non-musicians listened passively to these tones while their neural activities were recorded. MMN indexed the neural sensitivity to the meter violations. Results suggested that MMNs were larger for fast tempo and for triple meter conditions. Further, 20 musically trained individuals were tested using the same methods and the results were compared to the non-musicians. While tempo and meter type similarly influenced MMNs in both groups, musicians overall exhibited significantly reduced MMNs, compared to their non-musician counterparts. Further analyses indicated that the reduction was driven by responses to sounds that defined the structure (Standard), not by responses to Deviants. We argue that musicians maintain a more accurate and efficient mental model for metrical structures, which incorporates occasional disruptions using significantly fewer neural resources.	[Zhao, T.

Spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics of visual selective attention during a flanker task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; MEG; Cortical; Oscillation; Alpha; Theta	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SPACE SEPARATION METHOD; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HUMAN BRAIN; RESPONSE COMPETITION; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; DORSAL; MEMORY; THETA; EEG	The flanker task is a test of visual selective attention that has been widely used to probe error monitoring, response conflict, and related constructs. However, to date, few studies have focused on the selective attention component of this task and imaged the underlying oscillatory dynamics serving task performance. In this study, 21 healthy adults successfully completed an arrow-based version of the Eriksen flanker task during magnetoencephalography (MEG). All MEG data were pre-processed and transformed into the time-frequency domain. Significant oscillatory brain responses were imaged using a beamforming approach, and voxel time series were extracted from the peak responses to identify the temporal dynamics. Across both congruent and incongruent flanker conditions, our results indicated robust decreases in alpha (9-12 Hz) activity in medial and lateral occipital regions, bilateral parietal cortices, and cerebellar areas during task performance. In parallel, increases in theta (3-7 Hz) oscillatory activity were detected in dorsal and ventral frontal regions, and the anterior cingulate. As per conditional effects, stronger alpha responses (i.e., greater desynchronization) were observed in parietal, occipital, and cerebellar cortices during incongruent relative to congruent trials, whereas the opposite pattern emerged for theta responses ( i.e., synchronization) in the anterior cingulate, left dorsolateral prefrontal, and ventral prefrontal cortices. Interestingly, the peak latency of theta responses in these latter brain regions was significantly correlated with reaction time, and may partially explain the amplitude difference observed between congruent and incongruent trials. Lastly,whole-brain exploratory analyses implicated the frontal eye fields, right temporoparietal junction, and premotor cortices. These findings suggest that regions of both the dorsal and ventral attention networks contribute to visual selective attention processes during incongruent trials, and that such differential processes are transient and fully completed shortly after the behavioral response in most trials.

However, the neural correlates of memory-related processes remain unclear. In the current EEG study, SMs and control participants performed a digit memory task during which their brain activity was recorded. Chinese SMs used a digit-image mnemonic for encoding digits, in which they associated 2 digit groups with images immediately after the presentation of each even-position digit in sequences. Behaviorally, SMs' memory of digit sequences was better than the controls'. During encoding in the study phase, SMs showed an increased right central P2 (150-250 ms post onset) and a larger right posterior high-alpha (10-14 Hz, 500-1720 ms) oscillation on digits at even-positions compared with digits at odd-positions. Both P2 and high-alpha oscillations in the study phase co-varied with performance in the recall phase, but only in SMs, indicating that neural dynamics during encoding could predict successful retrieval of digit memory in SMs. Our findings suggest that representation of a digit sequence in SMs using mnemonics may recruit both the early-stage attention allocation process and the sustained information preservation process. This study provides evidence for the role of dynamic and efficient neural encoding processes in mnemonists.

Neurofeedback learning modifies the incidence rate of alpha spindles, but not their duration and amplitude	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							REAL-TIME FMRI; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; SELF-REGULATION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FEEDBACK; REINFORCEMENT; BIOFEEDBACK; METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION; EPILEPSY	Although the first experiments on alpha-neurofeedback date back nearly six decades ago, when Joseph Kamiya reported successful operant conditioning of alpha-rhythm in humans, the effectiveness of this paradigm in various experimental and clinical settings is still a matter of debate. Here, we investigated the changes in EEG patterns during a continuously administered neurofeedback of P4 alpha activity. Two days of neurofeedback training were sufficient for a significant increase in the alpha power to occur. A detailed analysis of these EEG changes showed that the alpha power rose because of an increase in the incidence rate of alpha episodes, whereas the amplitude and the duration of alpha oscillations remained unchanged. These findings suggest that neurofeedback facilitates volitional control of alpha activity onset, but alpha episodes themselves appear to be maintained automatically with no volitional control-a property overlooked by previous studies that employed continuous alpha-power neurofeedback. We propose that future research on alpha neurofeedback should explore reinforcement schedules based on detection of onsets and offsets of alpha waves, and employ these statistics for exploration and quantification of neurofeedback induced effects.

However, understanding those interaction between neural network and motor performance comprehensively in achieving optimal performance is still lacking, mainly in cycling. The purpose of this study was to discuss the issues in neuroscience related to brain activity, physiology and biomechanics in achieving optimal performance in cycling. As sports technology improves, more objective measurement can be demonstrated in solving specific issue in cycling, with optimization of performance as the main focus. In this review, the focus on brain activity will be based on the evaluation of the alpha and beta brainwaves as well as the alpha/beta ratio since they are biomarkers of EEG specifically related to cycling performance. Further in-depth understanding of the mechanism and interaction between brain activity, physiology and biomechanics in competitive cycling were acquired and discussed. Moreover, the biomarkers of brain activity related to cycling performance from previous studies were clearly identified and discussed and recommendations to be incorporated in future research were proposed.

However, these responses are related exclusively to the activation of a specific subclass of nociceptive afferents: quickly-adapting thermonociceptors. In fact, except if the activation of A delta fibers is avoided or if A fibers are blocked, these responses specifically reflect activity triggered by the activation of Type 2 quickly-adapting A fiber mechano-heat nociceptors (AMH-2). Here, we propose a novel method to isolate, in the human electroencephalogram (EEG), cortical activity related to the sustained periodic activation of heat-sensitive thermonociceptors, using very slow (0.2 Hz) and long-lasting (75 s) sinusoidal heat stimulation of the skin between baseline and 50 degrees C. In a first experiment, we show that when such long-lasting thermal stimuli are applied to the hand dorsum of healthy volunteers, the slow rises and decreases of skin temperature elicit a consistent periodic EEG response at 0.2 Hz and its harmonics, as well as a periodic modulation of the magnitude of theta, alpha and beta band EEG oscillations. In a second experiment, we demonstrate using an A fiber block that these EEG responses are predominantly conveyed by unmyelinated C fiber nociceptors. The proposed approach constitutes a novel mean to study C fiber function in humans, and to explore the cortical processing of tonic heat pain in physiological and pathological conditions.

Evaluation of short interval cortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; RECEPTOR FUNCTION; EXCITABILITY; GLUTAMATE; MANIPULATION; COGNITION; DOPAMINE	GABAergic and glutamatergic dysfunction in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are thought to be the core pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia. Recently, we have established a method to index these functions from the DLPFC using the paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms of short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) combined with electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, we aimed to evaluate neurophysiological indicators related to GABA(A) and glutamate receptor-mediated functions respectively from the DLPFC in patients with schizophrenia using these paradigms, compared to healthy controls. Given that these activities contribute to cognitive functions, the relationship between the TMS-evoked potential (TEP) modulations by SICI/ICF and cognitive/clinical measures were explored. Compared to controls, patients showed reduced inhibition in P60 (t(22) = -4.961, p < 0.0001) by SICI and reduced facilitation in P60 (t(22) = 5.174, p < 0.0001) and N100 (t(22) = 3.273, p = 0.003) by ICF. In patients, the modulation of P60 by SICI was correlated with the longest span of the Letter-Number Span Test (r = -0.775, p = 0.003), while the modulation of N100 by ICF was correlated with the total score of the Positive and Negative. Syndrome Scale (r = 0.817, p = 0.002).

The methodology of event-related EEG coherence is one of the essential methods used to analyze functional connectivity. The aims of the present study are to find out the long range EEG connectivity changes in perception of different affective pictures and analyze gender differences in these long range connected networks. EEGs of 28 healthy subjects (14 female) were recorded at 32 locations. The participants passively viewed emotional pictures (IAPS, unpleasant, pleasant, neutral). The long-distance intra-hemispheric event-related coherence was analyzed for delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), and alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency ranges for F-3-T-7, F-4-T-8, F-3-TP7, F-4-TP8, F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4, F-3-O-1, F-4-O-2, C-3-O-1, C-4-O-2 electrode pairs. Unpleasant pictures elicited significantly higher delta coherence values than neutral pictures (p < 0.05), over fronto-parietal, fronto-occipital, and centro-occipital electrode pairs. Furthermore, unpleasant pictures elicited higher theta coherence values than pleasant (p < 0.05) and neutral pictures (p < 0.05). The present study showed that female subjects had higher delta (p < 0.05) and theta (p < 0.05) coherence values than male subjects. This difference was observed more for emotional pictures than for neutral pictures. This study showed that the brain connectivity was higher during emotional pictures than neutral pictures. Females had higher connectivity between different parts of the brain than males during emotional processes. According to these results, we may comment that increased valence and arousal caused increased brain activity. It seems that not just single sources but functional networks were also activated during perception of emotional pictures.

Convergent evidence provided by studies using these techniques in healthy subjects has led to a reformulation of several unresolved issues of dream generation and recall [ such as the inter-and intra-individual differences in dream recall and the predictivity of specific EEG rhythms, such as theta in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, for dream recall] within more comprehensive models of human consciousness and its variations across sleep/wake states than the traditional models, which were largely based on the neurophysiology of REM sleep in animals. These studies are casting new light on the neural bases (in particular, the activity of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex regions and hippocampus and amygdala areas) of the inter-and intra-individual differences in dream recall, the temporal location of specific contents or properties (e.g., lucidity) of dream experience and the processing of memories accessed during sleep and incorporated into dream content. Hd-EEG techniques, used on their own or in combination with neuroimaging, appear able to provide further important insights into how the brain generates not only dreaming during sleep but also some dreamlike experiences in waking.

In patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, HFO rates tend to be higher in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) than in other brain regions and the resection of HFO-generating areas positively correlates with seizure-free surgery outcome. Nonetheless, the development of robust unsupervised HFO-based tools for SOZ localization remains challenging. Current approaches predict the SOZ by processing small samples of intracranial EEG (iEEG) data and applying patientspecific thresholds on the HFO rate. The HFO rate, though, varies largely over time with the patient's conditions (e.g., sleep versus wakefulness) and across patients. We propose a novel localization method for SOZ that uses a time-varying, HFO-based index to estimate the epileptic susceptibility of the iEEG channels. The method is insensitive to the average HFO rate across channels (which is both patient-and condition-specific), tracks the channel susceptibility over time, and predicts the SOZ based on the temporal evolution of the HFO rate. Tested on a preliminary dataset of continuous multi-day multichannel interictal iEEG recordings from two epileptic patients (117 +/- 97.6 h/per patient, mean +/- S.D.), the reported SOZ prediction had an average 0.70 +/- 0.18accuracy and 0.67 +/- 0.07 area under the ROC curve (mean +/- S.D.) across patients.

Distinct Oscillatory Frequencies Underlie Excitability of Human Occipital and Parietal Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical excitability; occipital; oscillations; parietal; phosphenes; visual perception	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CONSCIOUS VISUAL-PERCEPTION; ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; PHASE PREDICTS; EEG; BRAIN; INHIBITION; PHOSPHENES	Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of human occipital and posterior parietal cortex can give rise to visual sensations called phosphenes. We used near-threshold TMS with concurrent EEG recordings to measure how oscillatory brain dynamics covary, on single trials, with the perception of phosphenes after occipital and parietal TMS. Prestimulus power and phase, predominantly in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), predicted occipital TMS phosphenes, whereas higher-frequency beta-band (13-20 Hz) power (but not phase) predicted parietal TMS phosphenes. TMS-evoked responses related to phosphene perception were similar across stimulation sites and were characterized by an early (200 ms) posterior negativity and a later (>300 ms) parietal positivity in the time domain and an increase in low-frequency (similar to 5-7 Hz) power followed by a broadband decrease in alpha/beta power in the time-frequency domain. These correlates of phosphene perception closely resemble known electrophysiological correlates of conscious perception of near-threshold visual stimuli. The regionally differential pattern of prestimulus predictors of phosphene perception suggests that distinct frequencies may reflect cortical excitability in occipital versus posterior parietal cortex, calling into question the broader assumption that the alpha rhythm may serve as a general index of cortical excitability.

Alpha frequencies are modulated by working memory load and are used to process information during task switching, however we do not know how this oscillatory network communication is modulated. In order to understand the mechanisms that drive cognitive flexibility, ERPs, oscillatory power and how the communication within these networks is organized are of importance. The EEG data show that during phases reflecting preparatory processes to pre-activate task sets, alpha oscillatory power but not the small world properties of the alpha network architecture was modulated. During the switching only the N2 ERP component showed clear modulations. After the response, alpha oscillatory power reinstates and therefore seems to be important to deactivate or maintain the previous task set. For these reactive control processes the network architecture in terms of small-world properties is modulated. Effects of memory load on small-world aspects were seen in repetition trials, where small-world properties were higher when memory processes were relevant. These results suggest that the alpha oscillatory network becomes more small-world-like when reactive control processes during task switching are less complex.

The neural activity underlying stimulus-response processes can be assessed with ERPs, but the relations between these cognitive processes and the brain's intrinsic resting state EEG activity are less understood. This study focused on the neurocognitive functioning of 20 healthy young adults in an equiprobable go/no-go task to map the ERP correlates of behavioral responses and examine contributions of the resting state intrinsic EEG to task-related outcomes. Continuous EEG was recorded during pretask eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions, and in the subsequent task. Delta, theta, alpha, and beta band amplitudes were assessed for the EC state and also for the reactive change to EO. Go/no-go ERPs were submitted to temporal principal components analysis, where the P2, N2, P3, and slow wave components of interest were extracted. The performance measure of reaction time (RT) variability was positively correlated with no-go and go errors, and also with go P2 amplitude, linking these to stimulus discrimination efforts involved in appropriate response selection. An N2c-P3b pairing was enhanced for shorter mean RTs, supporting their involvement in the decision to execute a response. A stepwise regression model identified EC midline delta as a predictor of P3b positivity, highlighting the relevance of delta in the neural mechanisms of attentional processes. These findings clarify the electrophysiology underlying decision-making processes in executive function, and provide a platform for further research assessing performance outcomes in larger samples and in developmental/clinical contexts.

To answer this question, we compared Event Related Potentials (ERPs) correlated with success and failure during a highly-ecological-virtual game. Participants played a tennis-like game in an immersive 3D virtual world, against a computer player, by controlling a virtual tennis racket with a force feedback robotic arm. Results showed that success, i.e. hitting the target, and failure, by missing the target, evoked ERP's that differ by peak, latencies, scalp signal distributions, sLORETA source estimation, and time-frequency patterns. The success related grand averaged ERP at the Cz electrode, had two peaks - a negative peak at 244 ms and a positive peak at 12 ms, prior to the actual successful hit, suggesting a possible process of prediction of success. The grand averaged ERP correlated with failure at Cz, had two peaks, a negative peak at about 107 ms and a positive peak at about 311 ms post failure. These results suggest different top-down and bottom-up loops for success and failure, which seem to be rooted in the spatial arrangement of the virtual game. Although the latency of the latter is consistent with the error related potentials reported in the literature, the characteristic is unique to this specific error, and differ significantly from other error related potentials in the same environment. These results further provide a basis for EEG based assessment and prediction of user's successful or erroneous movements, and design of the feedback loop in EEG based Brain-Computer Interfaces.

Recording of Electroencephalogram (EEG) for detection of the onset of epileptic seizure had been used for constructing automatic seizure detection algorithm. Electrocardiogram (ECG) also can be used to evaluate Heart Rate Variability in patients with epileptic seizures. This paper studies 5 minutes pre-ictal ECG signal acquired from subjects suffering from Frontal Lobe Epilepsy with demonstrated seizures, whose age ranges from 18-28. ECG is acquired for both normal and epileptic subjects with demonstrated seizures. After detection of QRS complex using modified Pan-Tompkins algorithm, we perform three analysis methods to evaluate the features that uniquely help to predict an epileptic seizure. Time domain, Frequency domain and Non linear features provide accurate results in this prediction. The process can be used for implementing an automated prediction of pre-ictal (before seizure) period for seizure using only ECG signal.

Brain waves-based index for workload estimation and mental effort engagement recognition	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NEW COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR INVERSE PROBLEMS	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on New Computational Methods for Inverse Problems (NCMIP)	MAY 12, 2017	Ecole Normale Superieure Paris Saclay, Paris, FRANCE		Ecole Normale Superieure Paris Saclay		COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION	The advent of the communication systems and considering the complexity that some impose in their use, it is necessary to incorporate and equip these systems with a certain intelligence which takes into account the cognitive and mental capacities of the human operator. In this work, we address the issue of estimating the mental effort of an operator according to the cognitive tasks difficulty levels. Based on the Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, the proposed approach analyzes the user's brain activity from different brain regions while performing cognitive tasks with several levels of difficulty. At a first time, we propose a variances comparison-based classifier (VCC) that makes use of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the EEG signal. The aim of using such a classifier is to highlight the brain regions that enter into interaction according to the cognitive task difficulty. In a second time, we present and describe a new EEG-based index for the estimation of mental efforts. The designed index is based on information recorded from two EEG channels. Results from the VCC demonstrate that powers of the Theta [4-7 Hz] (theta) and Alpha [8-12 Hz] (alpha) oscillations decrease while increasing the cognitive task difficulty. These decreases are mainly located in parietal and temporal brain regions. Based on the Kappa coefficients, decisions of the introduced index are compared to those obtained from an existing index. This performance assessment method revealed strong agreements. Hence the efficiency of the introduced index.

Different iEEG recording techniques namely subdural grids, strips, depth electrodes and stereo encephalography (SEEG) are available with distinct limitations and advantages. Epilepsy centres mastering multiple techniques apply them in an individualised patient approach. These tools are used to map the seizure onset zone which is pivotal in approximating the epileptogenic zone, i.e. the zone which is indispensable for the generation of seizures and when resected will render the patient seizure free. Besides, the implanted electrodes can be used to define eloquent cortex through direct cortical stimulation. Different clinical scenarios exist which favour one iEEG recording technique over the other. Proximity of the presumed epileptogenic zone to eloquent cortex, for example, is a clinical scenario which may favour grid electrodes over SEEG. We here review the indication for iEEG for the work-up of patients suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy. In addition, we provide a description of the recording techniques focussing on the main techniques used: grid electrodes, depth electrodes and stereoencephalography. We then outline different clinical scenarios and the preferred technical approach for intracranial recordings in these scenarios. Finally, we highlight which advances have been made in the field of iEEG and which advances are in the pipeline waiting to be established for clinical use. This review provides the clinician with an update on the diagnostic use of intracranial EEG for epilepsy surgery and thus aids in understanding patient selection for this technique which may ultimately improve referral patterns.

Physical attributes such as color, brightness and spatial frequency of emotional visual stimuli have crucial effect on the perception of complex scene. Brightness is intimately related with emotional valence. Here we explored the effect of brightness on delta oscillatory responses upon presentation of pleasant, unpleasant and neutral pictures. We found that bright unpleasant pictures elicited lower amplitude of delta response than original unpleasant pictures. The electro-physiological finding of the study was in accordance with behavioral data. These results denoted the importance of delta responses on the examination of the association between perceptual and conceptual processes while in the question of brightness and emotion.

In motor imagery (MI) based BCI, features that characterize ERS/ERD phenomenon could favor the discriminant of different kinds of MI tasks. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), a spatial filtering method which is often used in MI-EEG feature extraction, shows outstanding performance due to its effectiveness in maximizing the difference of variance between each class. But one of the shortcomings of CSP is that performance is greatly affected by the frequency of the signal, because the variances can be used to discriminate each class only by processing those task related frequency bands. However, individual differences existed in EEG is an obstacle for CSP. Although MI related frequency bands focus on mu and beta rhythms, for every subject, the distinguishing hands could be different. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method (Subject Dependent Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition, SD-MEMD) for MI based BCI is proposed, it utilizes MEMD algorithm to decompose the multi-channel EEG into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), each IMF represents an inherent oscillation mode of the raw signal. Then an enhanced EEG is re-constructed after a careful selection of the task related IMF subset. Classification accuracy for right hand and left hand MI tasks is improved by 5.76% on our dataset.

Ten Minutes of alpha-tACS and Ambient Illumination Independently Modulate EEG alpha-Power	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); EEG; after effect; alpha oscillations	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ENTRAINMENT; FREQUENCY; PERFORMANCE; INCREASE	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) sees increased use in neurosciences as a tool for the exploration of brain oscillations. It has been shown that tACS stimulation in specific frequency bands can result in aftereffects of modulated oscillatory brain activity that persist after the stimulation has ended. The general relationship between persistency of the effect and duration of stimulation is sparsely investigated but previous research has shown that the occurrence of tACS aftereffects depends on the brain state before and during stimulation. Early alpha neurofeedback research suggests that particularly in the alpha band the responsiveness to a manipulation depends on the ambient illumination during measurement. Therefore, in the present study we assessed the brain's susceptibility to tACS at the individual alpha frequency during darkness compared to ambient illumination. We measured alpha power after 10 min of stimulation in 30 participants while they continuously performed a visual vigilance task. Our results show that immediately after stimulation, the alpha power in the illumination condition for both the stimulated and sham group has increased by only about 7%, compared to about 20% in both groups in the 'dark' condition. For the group that did not receive stimulation, the power in darkness remained stable after stimulation, whereas the power in light increased by an additional 10% during the next 30 min. For the group that did receive stimulation, alpha power during these 30 min increased by another 11% in light and 22% in darkness. Since alpha power already increased by about 10% without stimulation, the effect of illumination does not seem to have interacted with the effect of stimulation. Instead, both effects seem to have added up linearly. Although our findings do not show that illumination-induced differences in oscillatory activity influence the susceptibility toward tACS, they stress the importance of controlling for factors like ambient light that might add an independent increase or decrease to the power of brain oscillations during periods, where possible persistent effects of stimulation are explored.

This loss of cortical processing efficiency is reflected in focal changes to the electroencephalogram, including islands of increased delta power concurrent with drop-offs in neuronal activity (i.e., focal cortical inactivity). The authors hypothesized that these focal changes are evidenced at individual electrodes by combination of increased instantaneous amplitude in delta band and decreased instantaneous frequency in theta-alpha band, permitting their categorization as "active" and "inactive." An analysis of records from six patients with refractory epilepsy undergoing video-electrocorticographic monitoring was conducted. Feature extraction and state classification on multiple recordings revealed focal changes consistent with the hypothesis, as well as progressively increased numbers of inactive electrodes with time awake. The implications of these findings on the study of sleep, and particularly local sleep, are discussed.

The linguistic hedge (LH) is used for proper elicitation and pruning of the fuzzy rules and network is trained using scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) and speeding up SCG (SSCG) techniques. The performance of the proposed classifier, NFCSSCGLH (NFC using SSCG as training algorithm and is powered by LH) is compared with four different NFCs for classifying two class MI-based tasks. We observed a shortening of computation time per iteration by 57.78% in case of SSCG as compared to SCG technique of training. Supremacy of NFCSSCGLH among the considered classifier is validated through Friedman test. Classification result is used to control switching of light emitting diode, turning thoughts into action.

Moving beyond this convention, many researchers have begun exploring network-based neurodynamics and coordination between brain regions as a function of behavioral parameters or environmental statistics; however, most approaches average evoked activity across the experimental session to study task-dependent networks. Here, we examined on-going oscillatory activity as measured with EEG and use a methodology to estimate directionality in brain-behavior interactions. After source reconstruction, activity within specific frequency bands (delta: 2-3 Hz; theta: 4-7 Hz; alpha: 8-12 Hz; beta: 13-25 Hz) in a priori regions of interest was linked to continuous behavioral measurements, and we used a predictive filtering scheme to estimate the asymmetry between brain-to-behavior and behavior-to-brain prediction using a variant of Granger causality. We applied this approach to a simulated driving task and examined directed relationships between brain activity and continuous driving performance (steering behavior or vehicle heading error). Our results indicated that two neuro-behavioral states may be explored with this methodology: a Proactive brain state that actively plans the response to the sensory information and is characterized by delta-beta activity, and a Reactive brain state that processes incoming information and reacts to environmental statistics primarily within the alpha band.

The current study represents a simultaneous manipulation of demand (working memory load) and success importance (financial incentive) to investigate neurophysiological (EEG) and cardiovascular measures of effort. A 2 x 2 repeated-measures study was conducted where 18 participants performed a n-back task under three conditions of demand: easy (1-back), hard (4 -back) and very hard (7-back). In addition, participants performed these tasks in the presence of performance-contingent financial incentive or in a no -incentive (pilot trial) condition. Three bands of EEG activity were quantified: theta (4-7 Hz), lower -alpha (7.5-10 Hz) and upper-alpha (10.5-13 Hz). Fronto-medial activity in the theta band and activity in the upper-alpha band at frontal, central and parietal sites were sensitive to demand and indicated greatest effort when the task was challenging and success was possible. Mean systolic blood pressure and activity in the lower -alpha band at parietal sites were also sensitive to demand but also increased in the incentive condition across all levels of task demand. The results of the study largely support the predictions of motivational intensity using neurophysiological markers of effort.(C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In particular, movement initiation and execution are mediated by patterns of synchronization and desynchronization that occur concurrently across distinct frequency bands and across multiple motor cortical areas. To date, motor-related local oscillatory modulations have been predominantly examined by quantifying increases or suppressions in spectral power. However, beyond signal power, spectral properties such as phase and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) have also been shown to carry information with regards to the oscillatory dynamics underlying motor processes. Yet, the distinct functional roles of phase, amplitude and PAC across the planning and execution of goal-directed motor behavior remain largely elusive. Here, we address this question with unprecedented resolution thanks to multi-site intracerebral EEG recordings in human subjects while they performed a delayed motor task. To compare the roles of phase, amplitude and PAC, we monitored intracranial brain signals from 748 sites across six medically intractable epilepsy patients at movement execution, and during the delay period where motor intention is present but execution is withheld. In particular, we used a machine-learning framework to identify the key contributions of various neuronal responses. We found a high degree of overlap between brain network patterns observed during planning and those present during execution. Prominent amplitude increases in the delta (2-4 Hz) and high gamma (60-200 Hz) bands were observed during both planning and execution. In contrast, motor alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) power were suppressed during execution, but enhanced during the delay period. Interestingly, single-trial classification revealed that low-frequency phase information, rather than spectral power change, was the most discriminant feature in dissociating action from intention. Additionally, despite providing weaker decoding, PAC features led to statistically significant classification of motor states, particularly in anterior cingulate cortex and premotor brain areas. These results advance our understanding of the distinct and partly overlapping involvement of phase, amplitude and the coupling between them, in the neuronal mechanisms underlying motor intentions and executions.

However, the mechanisms underlying their anesthetic, psychotic, cognitive, and emotional effects are still elusive. The basal ganglia (BG) integrate input from different cortical domains through their dopamine-modulated connections to achieve optimal behavior control. NMDA antagonists have been shown to induce gamma oscillations in human EEG recordings and in rodent cortical and BG networks. However, network relations and implications to the primate brain are still unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from the primary motor cortex (M1) and the external globus pallidus (GPe) of four vervet monkeys (26 sessions, 97 and 76 cortical and pallidal LFPs, respectively) before and after administration of ketamine (NMDA antagonist, 10 mg/kg im). Ketamine induced robust, spontaneous gamma (30-50 Hz) oscillations in M1 and GPe. These oscillations were initially modulated by ultraslow oscillations (similar to 0.3 Hz) and were highly synchronized within and between M1 and the GPe (mean coherence magnitude = 0.76, 0.88, and 0.41 for M1-M1, GPe-GPe, and M1-GPe pairs). Phase differences were distributed evenly around zero with broad and very narrow distribution for the M1-M1 and GPe-GPe pairs (-3.5 +/- 31.8 degrees and -0.4 +/- 6.0 degrees), respectively. The distribution of M1-GPe phase shift was skewed to the left with a mean of -18.4 +/- 20.9 degrees. The increased gamma coherence between M1 and GPe, two central stages in the cortico-BG loops, suggests a global abnormal network phenomenon with a unique spectral signature, which is enabled by the BG funneling architecture. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first to show spontaneous gamma oscillations under NMDA antagonist in nonhuman primates. These oscillations appear in synchrony in the cortex and the basal ganglia. Phase analysis refutes the confounding effects of volume conduction and supports the funneling and amplifying architecture of the cortico-basal ganglia loops. These results suggest an abnormal network phenomenon with a unique spectral signature that could account for pathological mental and neurological states.

Studies of the macroscopic connectome as well as recent neuroimaging and neuromodeling research have suggested a densely connected collective of cortical hubs, termed the rich club, to provide a central workspace for such integration. In order for rich club regions to fulfill this role they must dispose of a dynamic mechanism by which they can actively shape networks of brain regions whose information processing needs to be integrated. A potential candidate for such a mechanism comes in the form of oscillations which might be employed to establish communication channels among relevant brain regions. We explore this possibility using an integrative approach combining whole-brain computational modeling with neuroimaging, wherein we investigate the local dynamics model brain regions need to exhibit in order to fit (dynamic) network behavior empirically observed for resting as well as a range of task states. We find that rich club regions largely exhibit oscillations during task performance but not during rest. Furthermore, oscillations exhibited by rich club regions can harmonize a set of asynchronous brain regions thus supporting functional coupling among them. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that the rich club can actively shape integration using oscillations.

Although theta has been extensively studied in freely moving rodents, its presence in humans has been elusive and primarily investigated in stationary subjects. Here we used a unique clinical opportunity to examine theta within the human MTL during untethered, real-world ambulatory movement. We recorded intracranial electroencephalographic activity from participants chronically implanted with the wireless NeuroPace responsive neurostimulator (RNS) and tracked their motion with sub-millimeter precision. Our data revealed that movement-related theta oscillations indeed exist in humans, such that theta power is significantly higher during movement than immobility. Unlike in rodents, however, theta occurs in short bouts, with average durations of similar to 400 ms, which are more prevalent during fast versus slow movements. In a rare opportunity to study a congenitally blind participant, we found that both the prevalence and duration of theta bouts were increased relative to the sighted participants. These results provide critical support for conserved neurobiological characteristics of theta oscillations during ambulatory spatial navigation, while highlighting some fundamental differences across species in these oscillations between humans and rodents.

Increases in theta power have also been identified in the human hippocampus during both real and virtual movement but appear as transient bursts in distinct high-and low-frequency bands, and it is not yet clear how these bursts relate to the sustained oscillation observed in rodents. Here, we examine depth electrode recordings from the temporal lobe of 13 presurgical epilepsy patients performing a self-paced spatial memory task in a virtual environment. In contrast to previous studies, we focus on movement-onset periods that incorporate both initial acceleration and an immediately preceding stationary interval associated with prominent theta oscillations in the rodent hippocampal formation. We demonstrate that movementon-set periods are associated with a significant increase in both low (2-5 Hz)-and high (6-9 Hz)-frequency theta power in the human hippocampus. Similar increases in low-and high-frequency theta power are seen across lateral temporal lobe recording sites and persist throughout the remainder of movement in both regions. In addition, we show that movement-related theta power is greater both before and during longer paths, directly implicating human hippocampal theta in the encoding of translational movement. These findings strengthen the connection between studies of theta-band activity in rodents and humans and offer additional insight into the neural mechanisms of spatial navigation.

With the increasing demand for dealing with multivariate signals, it's of practical significance to extend univariate EMD to multivariate EMD (MEMD). Following the MEMD, a noised assisted MEMD (NA-MEMD) method has been proposed recently to restrain the mode mixing phenomenon. However the standard NA-MEMD method is prone to obtaining unstable performance, and suffering high computational complexity. In this paper, a partial noise assisted. multivariate EMD (PNA-MEMD) method is proposed to resolve the problems. In PNA-MEMD, high-frequency band-limited noise instead of the original white noise is utilized to assist the decomposition process. The numerical simulations and application to motor imagery EEG data demonstrate the superiority of proposed method, in contrast with the standard MEMD and NA-MEMD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Escitalopram but not placebo modulates brain rhythmic oscillatory activity in the first week of treatment of Major Depressive Disorder	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Brain oscillations; Major Depressive Disorder; Biomarker; Remission; Antidepressant medication; Placebo; Thalamic pacemakers; Intermediate phenotype; Biosignature	SEROTONIN MODULATION; INTERMEDIATE PHENOTYPES; ANTIDEPRESSANT; RECEPTORS; ALPHA; BIOMARKERS; MEMORY; THETA; MECHANISMS; THALAMUS	Serotonin modulates brain oscillatory activity, and serotonergic projections to the thalamus and cortex modulate the frequency of prefrontal rhythmic oscillations. Changes in serotonergic tone have been reported to shift oscillations between the combined delta-theta (2.5-8 Hz) and the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency ranges. Such frequency shifts may constitute a useful biomarker for the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We utilized quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to measure shifts in prefrontal rhythmic oscillations early in treatment with either the SSRI escitalopram or placebo, and examined the relationship between these changes and remission of depressive symptoms. Prefrontal delta-theta and alpha power were calculated for 194 subjects with moderate MDD prior to and one week after start of treatment. Changes at one week in delta-theta and alpha power, as well as the delta-theta/alpha ratio, were examined in three cohorts: initial (N = 70) and replication (N = 76) cohorts treated with escitalopram, and a cohort treated with placebo (N = 48). Mean delta-theta power significantly increased and alpha power decreased after one week of escitalopram treatment, but did not significantly change with placebo treatment. The delta-theta/alpha ratio change was a specific predictor of the likelihood of remission after seven weeks of medication treatment: a large increase in this ratio was associated with non-remission in escitalopram-treated subjects, but not placebo-treated subjects. Escitalopram and placebo treatment have differential effects on delta-theta and alpha frequency oscillations. Early increase in delta-theta/alpha may constitute a replicable biomarker for non-remission during SSRI treatment of MDD. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It remains unclear whether in the psychosis high-risk state, WM encoding is altered or whether patients are impaired at shielding their WM against distractors. We employed single-trial analyses of neurophysiological and behavioral data recorded during a WM paradigm, designed to include predictable distractors, on 18 patients with an at-risk mental state for psychosis (ARMS, 26.1 +/- 5.45 years) and 21 healthy controls (HCs, 25.5 +/- 3.95 years). Strong distractors were associated with reduced WM accuracy (p = 0.036), but only ARMS patients required more processing time for strong distractors (p = 0.002). Increased parieto-occipital alpha amplitude preceding distractor presentations was associated with enhanced accuracy only in HCs (p = 0.009). During encoding, increased intertrial alpha phase locking values were associated with increased performance. Reduced shielding mechanisms against distractors in ARMS patients could lead to defective WM maintenance, which may result in significant confusion that may contribute to the formation of psychotic symptoms.

Methods: We analyzed spiking and local field potential (LFP) activity of hippocampal CA1 region alongside neocortical electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) in 19 sessions from four male Long-Evans rats (260-360 g) during natural wake/sleep across the 24-hr cycle as well as data from other brain regions obtained from http://crcns. org.(1,2) Results: LOW states lasted longer than OFF/DOWN states and were distinguished by a subset of "LOW-active" cells. LOW activity sleep was preceded and followed by increased sharp-wave ripple activity. We also observed decreased slow-wave activity and sleep spindles in the hippocampal LFP and neocortical EEG upon LOW onset, with a partial rebound immediately after LOW. LOW states demonstrated activity patterns consistent with sleep but frequently transitioned into microarousals and showed EMG and LFP differences from small-amplitude irregular activity during quiet waking. Their likelihood decreased within individual non-REM epochs yet increased over the course of sleep. By analyzing data from the entorhinal cortex of rats, 1 as well as the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex, the postsubiculum, and the anterior thalamus of mice, 2 obtained from http://crcns. org, we confirmed that LOW states corresponded to markedly diminished activity simultaneously in all of these regions. Conclusions: We propose that LOW states are an important microstate within non-REM sleep that provide respite from high-activity sleep and may serve a restorative function.

Here, participants preformed two separate visual attention tasks, one endogenous and one exogenous, while transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), at 10 Hz, 40 Hz, or sham, was applied to the right parietal lobe. Our results provide new evidence for the roles of gamma and alpha oscillations in voluntary versus involuntary shifts of attention. Gamma (40 Hz) stimulation resulted in improved disengagement from invalidly cued targets in the endogenous attention task, whereas alpha stimulation (10 Hz) had no effect on endogenous attention, but increased the exogenous cuing effect. These findings agree with previous studies suggesting that right inferior parietal regions may be especially important for the disengagement of attention, and go further to provide details about the specific type of oscillatory neural activity within that brain region that is differentially involved in endogenous versus exogenous attention. Our results also have potential implications for the plasticity and training of attention systems.

However, the potential impact of this mechanism in cognitive performance is not fully explored. Since the main consequence of E/I dysfunction is an impairment in oscillatory activity and its underlying cognitive computations, we assessed the electroencephalographic activity of ASD and typically developing (TD) subjects during a working-memory task. We found that ASD subjects committed more errors than TD subjects. Moreover, TD subjects demonstrated a parametric modulation in the power of alpha and theta band while ASD subjects did not demonstrate significant modulations. The preceding leads to significant differences between the groups in both the alpha power placed on the occipital cortex and the theta power placed on the left premotor and the right prefrontal cortex. The impaired theta modulation correlated with autistic symptoms. The results indicated that ASD may present an alteration in the recruitment of the oscillatory activity during working-memory, and this alteration could be related to the physiopathology of the disorder.

In 2009, our laboratory proposed, based on studies in rodents, that electrical stimulation of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord could become an effective treatment for motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Since our initial report in rodents and a more recent study in primates, several clinical studies have now described beneficial effects of dorsal column stimulation in parkinsonian patients. In primates, we have shown that dorsal column stimulation activates multiple structures along the somatosensory pathway and desynchronizes the pathological cortico-striatal oscillations responsible for the manifestation of PD symptoms. Based on recent evidence, we argue that neurological disorders such as PD can be broadly classified as diseases emerging from abnormal neuronal timing, leading to pathological brain states, and that the spinal cord could be used as a "channel" to transmit therapeutic electrical signals to disrupt these abnormalities.

Dynamic spatiotemporal variability of alpha-BOLD relationships during the resting-state and task-evoked responses	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha oscillation; BOLD response; Dynamic connectivity; Spontaneous; Prestimulus	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG-ALPHA; BRAIN NETWORKS; BAND POWER; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG/FMRI; NEURONAL MECHANISMS	Accurate characterization of the spatiotemporal relationship between two of the most prominent neuroimaging measures of neuronal activity, the 8-13 Hz, occipito-parietal EEG alpha oscillation and the BOLD fMRI signal, must encompass the intrinsically dynamic nature of both alpha power and brain function. Here, during the eyesopen resting state, we use a 16 s sliding-window analysis and demonstrate that the mean spatial network of dynamic alpha-BOLD correlations is highly comparable to the static network calculated over six minutes. However, alpha-BOLD correlations showed substantial spatiotemporal variability within-subjects and passed through many different configurations such that the static network was fully represented in only similar to 10% of 16 s epochs, with visual and parietal regions (coherent on average) often opposingly correlated with each other or with alpha. We find that the common assumption of static-alpha BOLD correlations greatly oversimplifies temporal variation in brain network dynamics. Fluctuations in alpha-BOLD coupling significantly depended upon the instantaneous amplitude of alpha power, and primary and lateral visual areas were most strongly negatively correlated with alpha during different alpha power states, possibly suggesting the action of multiple alpha mechanisms. Dynamic alpha-BOLD correlations could not be explained by eye-blinks/movements, head motion or non-neuronal physiological variability. Individual's mean alpha power and frequency were found to contribute to between-subject variability in alpha-BOLD correlations. Additionally, application to a visual stimulation dataset showed that dynamic alpha-BOLD correlations provided functional information pertaining to the brain's response to stimulation by exhibiting spatiotemporal fluctuations related to variability in the trial-by-trial BOLD response magnitude. Significantly weaker visual alpha-BOLD correlations were found both preceding and following small amplitude BOLD response trials compared to large response trials.	[Mayhew, S. D.; Bagshaw, A.

Cognitive film theory attributes this to the system of continuity editing, a system of editing guidelines outlining the effect of different cuts and edits on spectators. A major principle in this framework is the 180 degrees rule, a rule recommendation that, to avoid spectators' attention to the editing, two edited shots of the same event or action should not be filmed from angles differing in a way that expectations of spatial continuity are strongly violated. In the present study, we used high-density EEG to explore the neural underpinnings of this rule. In particular, our analysis shows that cuts and edits in general elicit early ERP component indicating the registration of syntactic violations as known from language, music, and action processing. However, continuity edits and cuts-across the line differ from each other regarding later components likely to be indicating the differences in spatial remapping as well as in the degree of conscious awareness of one's own perception. Interestingly, a time-frequency analysis of the occipital alpha rhythm did not support the hypothesis that such differences in processing routes are mainly linked to visual attention. On the contrary, our study found specific modulations of the central mu rhythm ERD as an indicator of sensorimotor activity, suggesting that sensorimotor networks might play an important role. We think that these findings shed new light on current discussions about the role of attention and embodied perception in film perception and should be considered when explaining spectators' different experience of different kinds of cuts.

Despite a growing number of post-stimulus tinnitus studies, uncertainty still exists regarding the neural signature of tinnitus in the resting-state brain. In the present study, we used high-gamma cross-frequency coupling and a Granger causality analysis to evaluate resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) data in healthy participants and patients with tinnitus. Patients with tinnitus lacked robust frontal delta-phase/central high-gamma-amplitude coupling that was otherwise clearly observed in healthy participants. Since low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude coupling reflects inter-regional communication during cognitive processing, and given the absence of frontal modulation in patients with tinnitus, we hypothesized that tinnitus might be related to impaired prefrontal top-down inhibitory control. A Granger causality analysis consistently showed abnormally pronounced functional connectivity of low frequency activity in patients with tinnitus, possibly reflecting a deficiency in large-scale communication during the resting state. Moreover, different causal neurodynamics were characterized across two subgroups of patients with tinnitus; the T1 group (with higher P300 amplitudes) showed abnormal frontal-to-auditory cortical information flow, whereas the T2 group (with lower P300 amplitudes) exhibited abnormal auditory-to-frontal cortical information control. This dissociation in resting-state low-frequency causal connectivity is consistent with recent post-stimulus observations. Taken together, our findings suggest that maladaptive neuroplasticity or abnormal reorganization occurs in the auditory default mode network of patients with tinnitus. Additionally, our data highlight the utility of resting-state EEG for the quantitative diagnosis of tinnitus symptoms and the further characterization of tinnitus subtypes. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Latencies of the sensorimotor simple and complex (choice) reactions, rate capabilities of the nervous processes in the tapping test, and spectral power and coherence of the frequency EEG components were estimated. Estimations were obtained for each examined person in the resting state and during finger movements with a force loading (bending of the fingers in the fist and their spreading). Men with relatively high background modal frequencies of the alpha rhythm were characterized by a higher level of the attention selectivity and more local modifications of EEG activity related to realization of manual movements. Somewhat less-differentiated patterns of cortical activation were typical of persons with lower modal alpha-frequencies; this may correlate with a lower plasticity of the cerebral processes under conditions of the control of manual motor activity with force loading and maintenance of the pre-set movement rate. Men with higher modal alpha-frequencies demonstrated better rate indices in the performance of sensorimotor reactions.	[Morenko, A.

Programmers perform program comprehension at different stages of the software development life cycle. Detecting when a programmer experiences problems or confusion can be difficult. Self-reported data may be useful, but not reliable. More importantly, it is hard to use the self-reported feedback in real time. In this study, we use an inexpensive, non-invasive EEG device to record 8 subjects' brain activity in short program comprehension. Subjects were presented either confusing or non-confusing C/C++ code snippets. Paired sample t-tests are used to compare the average magnitude in alpha and theta frequency bands. The results show that the differences in the average magnitude in both bands are significant comparing confusing and non-confusing questions. We then use ANOVA to detect whether such difference also presented in the same type of questions. We found that there is no significant difference across questions of the same difficulty level. Our outcome, however, shows alpha and theta band powers both increased when subjects are under the heavy cognitive workload. Other research studies reported a negative correlation between (upper) alpha and theta band powers.

Theelectroencephalogram(EEG) signals from nine healthy young subjects were recorded before and during acupuncture in the "closed-eye" state. The EEG signals were acquired from 19 surface scalp electrodes (FP1, FP2, F7, F3, Fz F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, and O2). Needles were inserted into the HT7 bilaterally and were then manipulated to induce deqi and retained for 15 minutes. Phase synchronization was measured by phase coherence. In the theta band, coherence significantly increased between the temporal (T5, T6) and occipital areas (O1, O2) during the acupuncture stimulation. In the alpha band, coherence significantly increased between the left temporal area (T5) and other areas (frontal, parietal, and occipital). Phase coherence in the theta and alpha bands tended to increase during the retention of the acupuncture needles after deqi. Therefore, it can be concluded that acupuncture stimulation with deqi is clinically effective via the central nervous system (CNS).

We adapted a cued dichotic listening task to examine suppression of a speech stream lateralized to the nonattended ear, and to evaluate the effects of attention on the right ear's well-known advantage in the perception of linguistic stimuli. After being cued to attend to input from either their left or right ear, participants heard two different four-word streams presented simultaneously to the separate ears. Following each dichotic presentation, participants judged whether a spoken probe word had been in the attended ear's stream. We used EEG signals to track participants' spatial lateralization of auditory attention, which is marked by interhemispheric differences in EEG alpha (8-14 Hz) power. A right-ear advantage (REA) was evident in faster response times and greater sensitivity in distinguishing attended from unattended words. Consistent with the REA, we found strongest parietal and right frontotemporal alpha modulation during the attend-right condition. These findings provide evidence for a link between selective attention and the REA during directed dichotic listening.

Spatiotemporal characteristics of sleep spindles depend on cortical location	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Sleep; Spindles; Local; Co-occurrence; Propagation	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; SLOW OSCILLATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; INTRACRANIAL EEG; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; DENSITY; NEURONS; HUMANS; MATRIX	Since their discovery almost one century ago, sleep spindles, 0.5-2 s long bursts of oscillatory activity at 9-16 Hz during NREM sleep, have been thought to be global and relatively uniform throughout the cortex. Recent work, however, has brought this concept into question but it remains unclear to what degree spindles are global or local and if their properties are uniform or location-dependent. We addressed this question by recording sleep in eight patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy with intracranial electrocorticography, which combines high spatial resolution with extensive cortical coverage. We find that spindle characteristics are not uniform but are strongly influenced by the underlying cortical regions, particularly for spindle density and fundamental frequency. We observe both highly isolated and spatially distributed spindles, but in highly skewed proportions: while most spindles are restricted to one or very few recording channels at any given time, there are spindles that occur over widespread areas, often involving lateral prefrontal cortices and superior temporal gyri. Their co-occurrence is affected by a subtle but significant propagation of spindles from the superior prefrontal regions and the temporal cortices towards the orbitofrontal cortex. This work provides a brain-wide characterization of sleep spindles as mostly local graphoelements with heterogeneous characteristics that depend on the underlying cortical area. We propose that the combination of local characteristics and global organization reflects the dual properties of the thalamo-cortical generators and provides a flexible framework to support the many functions ascribed to sleep in general and spindles specifically.

Corticomuscular Coherence With Time Lag With Application to Delay Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Corticomuscular coherence (CMC); electroencephalogram (EEG); electromyogram (EMG); global time delay; motor control system	CORTICAL ACTIVITY; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; EMG; SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; CONDUCTION	Functional coupling between the motor cortex and muscle activity is usually detected and characterized using the spectral method of corticomuscular coherence (CMC). This functional coupling occurs with a time delay, which, if not properly accounted for, may decrease the coherence and make the synchrony difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce the concept of CMC with time lag (CMCTL), that is the coherence between segments of motor cortex electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals displaced from a central observation point. This concept ismotivated by the need to compensate for the unknown delay between coupled cortex and muscle processes. We demonstrate using simulated data that under certain conditions the time lag between EEG and EMG segments at points of local maxima of CMCTL corresponds to the average delay along the involved corticomuscular conduction pathways. Using neurophysiological data, we then show that CMCTL with appropriate time lag enhances the coherence between cortical and muscle signals, and that time lags which correspond to local maxima of CMCTL provide estimates of delays involved in corticomuscular coupling that are consistent with the underlying physiology.

It represents the most frequent cause of dementia in the western world, and affects an individual's cognitive ability and psychological capacity. While clinical diagnoses of AD are made primarily on the basis of clinical evaluation and mental health tests, diagnostic certainty is only possible through necropsy. One non-invasive approach to investigating AD is to use electroencephalograms (EEGs), which reflect brain electrical activity and so can be used to detect electrical abnormalities in brain signals with non-invasive cranial surface electrodes. Generally EEGs in AD patients show a shift to lower frequencies in spectral analysis and display less complexity and contain more regular patterns compared to those of control subjects. Here we present a method for differentiating AD patients from healthy ones based on their EEG signals using Benford's law and support vector machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. EEG signals from eleven AD and eleven age-matched controls were divided into artefact-free 5-sec epochs and used to train an SVM. 10 fold cross validation was performed at both the epoch- and subject-level to evaluate the importance of each electrode in discriminating between AD and healthy subjects. Substantive variability was seen across the different electrodes, with electrodes O1, O2 and C4 particularly being important. Performance across the electrodes was reduced when subject-level cross validation was performed, but relative performance across the electrodes was consistent with that found using epoch-level cross validation.

In this study, we propose for the first time a training-free double-partial least-squares (D-PLS) model for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) detection that consists of double-layer PLS, a PLS spatial filter, and a PLS feature extractor. Electroencephalographic data from 11 healthy volunteers under four different visual stimulation frequencies were used to test the proposed method. Compared with commonly used spatial filters, minimum energy combination and average maximum contrast combination, the classification accuracies could be improved 2-10% by our proposed PLS spatial filter. Furthermore, our proposed PLS feature extractor achieved better performance than current feature extraction methods, namely power spectral density analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and the use of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The average classification accuracy for our proposed D-PLS model exceeded 90% when the signal time window was longer than 3.5 s and reached as high as 93.9% when the time window was 5 s. Moreover, the D-PLS model can be easily set without training data, so it can be used widely in SSVEP-based BCI systems.

In natural settings expectations are often implicitly based on time, e.g., when making a phone call one would expect to hear either a person answering (earlier) or a voicemail greeting (later). We investigated how time-based expectations can improve performance in the absence of explicit prior information on the pending stimulus or the associated response. Visual stimuli were presented after a characteristic short or long foreperiod, and a forced-choice categorization using either the left or the right hand was required. The electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a decrease in central 9-12 Hz power over the course of the trial. Moreover, lateralized pre-motor potentials were observed which changed polarity after the short foreperiod. At stimulus onset, amplitudes of pre-motor potentials co-varied with performance, so that higher (more negative) amplitudes were associated with slower responses to unexpected targets. Altogether, the results suggest that implicit time-based expectations entail effector-specific preparatory brain activity, which is inhibited until the expected onset time of the event. Thus, time-based expectations prepare for action. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mandarin-speaking participants were asked to name individually presented target pictures and ignore a superimposed two-character Chinese word distractor. The target and distractor were either categorically related (belonging to the same semantic category), associatively related (semantically related but not categorically related), phonologically related, or unrelated. The typical categorical interference (slower picture naming with a categorically related distractor relative to an unrelated control) was found. Furthermore, significant event-related brain potential effects were obtained in categorical and associative conditions in the time window between 275 and 450 ms post-target. By using response-locked analysis, significant effects of Target-distractor Relatedness were observed only in the associative condition within the 300-ms pre-response period. These results are consistent with the theories that assume lexical selection by competition in explaining the categorical interference effect.

In the present study, we focused on the types of playing activities that could enhance the theta frequency in preschoolers at their PFC area with study on individual brainwaves. The selected playing activities included LEGO and wooden blocks with and without instruction, iPad apps and flash card comparison. A total of 12 individual cases were analyzed in this study. The mean theta amplitudes of their PFC were measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG). Children brainwaves showed profoundly high theta frequency while playing LEGO without guidance. Meanwhile, tablet-based computer educational tool with pictures, sound, and motion initiated greater theta frequency as compared to the conventional flash card. Brainwaves analysis is a great tool to determine the cognitive development of children, based on the types of activities allocated to them.

It has been also attempted to determine which features can properly show the physiological differences of two groups during sad stimuli. For this purpose, time-, frequency-, wavelet-, and nonlinear-based approaches were examined. Applying the Wilcoxon rank sum test, significant differences between the groups were inspected. The analysis was performed on 47 college students. The effect of data length on the results was also investigated. The best results were achieved using the data length of 10 s with an overlap of 50%. In this case, the nonlinear features outperformed the other measures. 82.43% of nonlinear features, 73.33% of Db4 wavelet measures, and 64.29% of time and frequency indices showed significant differences between ECG parameters of men and women. Specifically, recurrence quantification measures and lagged Poincare indices have the best performance. In conclusion, the results of this study emphasize the efficiency of nonlinear features in the analysis of physiological signals in a negative emotional state. In addition, ECG signals can confidently serve as an indicator of emotional responses. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, existing investigations of cortical oscillatory responses in stereoscopic depth perception are quite rare. Therefore, we investigated spatiotemporal and spatio-temporo-spectral features at four different stereoscopic depths within the comfort zone. We adopted a simultaneous EEG/MEG acquisition technique to collect the oscillatory responses of eight participants. We defined subject-specific retinal disparities and designed a single trial-based stereoscopic viewing experimental paradigm. In the group analysis, we observed that, as the depth increased from Level 1 to Level 3, there was a time-locked increase in the N200 component in MEG and the P300 component in EEG in the occipital and parietal areas, respectively. In addition, initial alpha and beta event-related desynchronizations (ERD) were observed at approximately 500 to 1000 msec, while theta, alpha, and beta event-related synchronizations (ERS) appeared at approximately 1000 to 2000 ms. Interestingly, there was a saturation point in the increase in cognitive responses, including N200, P300, and alpha ERD, even when the depth increased only within the comfort zone. Meanwhile, the magnitude of low beta ERD decreased in the dorsal pathway as depth increased. From these findings, we concluded that cognitive responses are likely to become saturated in the visual comfort zone, while perceptual load may increase with depth.

Children with developmental dyslexia show impairments in beat synchronization. These impairments may reflect deficiencies in auditory perception of the beat which in turn affect auditory-motor mapping, or may reflect an independent motor deficit. Here, we used a new methodology in EEG based on measuring beat-related steady-state evoked potentials (SS-EPs, Nozaradan et al., 2015) in an attempt to disentangle neural sensory and motor contributions to behavioral beat synchronization in children with dyslexia. Children tapped with both their left and right hands to every second beat of a metronome pulse delivered at 2.4 Hz, or listened passively to the beat. Analyses of preferred phase in EEG showed that the children with dyslexia had a significantly different preferred phase compared to control children in all conditions. Regarding SS-EPs, the groups differed significantly for the passive Auditory listening condition at 2.4 Hz, and showed a trend toward a difference in the Right hand tapping condition at 3.6 Hz (sensorimotor integration measure). The data suggest that neural rhythmic entrainment is atypical in children with dyslexia for both an auditory beat and during sensorimotor coupling (tapping). The data are relevant to a growing literature suggesting that rhythm-based interventions may help language processing in children with developmental disorders of language learning.

The higher sampling frequency enables inaudible sound components (above 20 kHz) that are cut off in low-resolution audio to be reproduced. Previous studies of high-resolution audio have mainly focused on the effect of such high-frequency components. It is known that alpha-band power in a human electroencephalogram (EEG) is larger when the inaudible high-frequency components are present than when they are absent. Traditionally, alpha-band EEG activity has been associated with arousal level. However, no previous studies have explored whether sound sources with high-frequency components affect the arousal level of listeners. The present study examined this possibility by having 22 participants listen to two types of a 400-s musical excerpt of French Suite No. 5 by J. S. Bach (on cembalo, 24-bit quantization, 192 kHz A/D sampling), with or without inaudible high-frequency components, while performing a visual vigilance task. High-alpha (10.5-13 Hz) and low-beta (13-20 Hz) EEG powers were larger for the excerpt with high-frequency components than for the excerpt without them. Reaction times and error rates did not change during the task and were not different between the excerpts. The amplitude of the P3 component elicited by target stimuli in the vigilance task increased in the second half of the listening period for the excerpt with high-frequency components, whereas no such P3 amplitude change was observed for the other excerpt without them. The participants did not distinguish between these excerpts in terms of sound quality. Only a subjective rating of inactive pleasantness after listening was higher for the excerpt with high-frequency components than for the other excerpt. The present study shows that high-resolution audio that retains high-frequency components has an advantage over similar and indistinguishable digital sound sources in which such components are artificially cut off, suggesting that high-resolution audio with inaudible high-frequency components induces a relaxed attentional state without conscious awareness.

Methods: Computation of spectral activity for sleep (non-REM and REM) and wake electroencephalogram recordings from 18 frequent NM recallers and 15 control participants. Results: There was higher "slow-theta" (2-5 Hz) for NM recallers than for controls during wake, non-REM sleep and REM sleep. Differences were clearest for frontal and central derivations and for REM sleep cycles 2-4. There was also higher beta activity during NREM sleep for NM recallers. Findings partially replicate past research by demonstrating higher relative "slow-theta" (3-4Hz) for NM recallers than for controls. Conclusions: Findings are consistent with a neurocognitive model of nightmares that stipulates cross-state anomalies in emotion processing in NM-prone individuals.

Using oscillatory responses in the electroencephalogram, we tested the hypothesis that inducers automatically attract spatial attention and, thus, favor a conscious experience of color. Achromatic inducers and real-colored non-inducers were presented to the left or to the right visual hemifield and orientation judgments were required for subsequently presented Gabor patches. The graphemes were irrelevant for the task so that the related brain response was purely stimulus-driven. Synesthetes (n = 12), but not an equal number of controls, showed an early theta power increase for inducers presented to the right compared to the left hemifield, with sources in left fusiform gyrus. Alpha power asymmetries indicative of shifts of spatial attention were not observed. Together, synesthetes showed an increased responsiveness to inducers in grapheme processing areas. However, contrary to our hypothesis, inducers did not attract spatial attention in synesthetes.	[Volberg, G.; Chockley, A. S.; Greenlee, M.

Specifically, we were interested in the recovery dynamics of 3-dimensional components of selfhood (a 3-dimensional construct model for the complex experiential selfhood has been recently proposed based on the empirical findings on the functional-topographical specialization of 3 operational modules of brain functional network responsible for the self-consciousness processing) derived from the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. The analysis revealed progressive (though not monotonous) restoration of EEG functional connectivity of 3 modules of brain functional network responsible for the self-consciousness processing, which was also paralleled by the clinically significant functional recovery. We propose that restoration of normal integrity of the operational modules of the self-referential brain network may underlie the positive dynamics of 3 aspects of selfhood and provide a neurobiological mechanism for their recovery. The results are discussed in the context of recent experimental studies that support this inference. Studies of ongoing recovery after severe brain injury utilizing knowledge about each separate aspect of complex selfhood will likely help to develop more efficient and targeted rehabilitation programs for patients with brain trauma.

We examined reliability and external validity of each of its 12-item scales, E, M, W, V, F, and S (evening and morning lateness, anytime and daytime wakeability, anytime and night-time sleepability, respectively). Questionnaire data were collected from residents of Novosibirsk and two smaller Russian cities (N = 755 and 720, respectively). Analysis of these two data-sets suggested good and acceptable internal consistency of each of the scales, respectively. Evidence for external validity of each of the 6 scales was obtained by applying stepwise linear regression analysis to data collected from 160 participants of sleep deprivation experiments who were asked to self-report 6 characteristics of their sleep for a week prior to the experiment. As expected, predictors of scales? scores were a later self-reported time for going to bed (E, W), an earlier/later time for final awakening (W/M), a shorter/longer sleep latency (F, S/E), a shorter/longer total sleep time (W + V/F), a lower/higher sleep satisfaction score (M/W + V), a lower/higher nap frequency (V/F), and a lower self-scored sleepiness after deprivation from sleep for a night (W, V).

Although, the CSD presents a second-order statistical description in the frequency domain and reveals the hidden periodicity in EEG signals, it needs an efficient algorithm for calculating and also a suitable model for describing. By employing an efficient computational algorithm which is called the FFT accumulation method (FAM), the CSD of ECG signals can be computed. In this study, In order to choose an efficient statistical model for the Cyclic Spectral Analysis (CSA) coefficients of ECG signals, their statistical features are investigated at various regions of bi-frequency plane. It is revealed that the CSA coefficients are heteroscedastic and the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) is a suitable model for them. Hence, The GARCH parameters of CSA sub-bands are calculated and are employed to classify the ECG using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Evidently, the results reveal that the performance of the new method in ECG classification outperforms the former studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In everyday situations, there are many event features competing for our attention, and our ability to successfully recover those details may depend on our ability to ignore others. Failures of selective attention may contribute to older adults' context memory impairments. In the current electroencephalogram (EEG) study, we assessed the effects of age on processes supporting successful context memory retrieval of selectively attended features as indexed by neural oscillations. During encoding, young and older adults were directed to attend to a picture of an object and its relationship to one of two concurrently presented contextual details: a color or scene. At retrieval, we tested their memory for the object, its attended and unattended context features, and their confidence for both the attended and unattended features. Both groups showed greater memory for attended than unattended contextual features. However, older adults showed evidence of hyper-binding between attended and unattended context features while the young adults did not. EEG results in the theta band suggest that young and older adults recollect similar amounts of information but brain-behavior correlations suggest that this information was supportive of contextual memory performance, particularly for young adults. By contrast, sustained beta desynchronization, indicative of sensory reactivation and episodic reconstruction, was correlated with contextual memory performance for older adults only. We conclude that older adults' inhibition deficits during encoding reduced the selectivity of their contextual memories, which led to reliance on executive functions like episodic reconstruction to support successful memory retrieval.

Despite these data, the role of the PCC in episodic memory has received only limited treatment using the spatial and temporal precision of intracranial EEG, with previous analyses focused on item retrieval. Using data gathered from 21 human participants who underwent stereo-EEG for seizure localization, we characterized oscillatory patterns in the PCC during the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories. We identified a subsequent memory effect during item encoding characterized by increased gamma band oscillatory power and a low-frequency power desynchronization. Fourteen participants had stereotactic electrodes located simultaneously in the hippocampus and PCC, and with these unique data, we describe connectivity changes between these structures that predict successful item encoding and that precede item retrieval. Oscillatory power during retrieval matched the pattern we observed during encoding, with low-frequency (below 15 Hz) desynchronization and a gamma band (especially high gamma, 70-180 Hz) power increase. Encoding is characterized by synchrony between the hippocampus and PCC, centered at 3 Hz, consistent with other observations of properties of this oscillation akin to those for rodent theta activity. We discuss our findings in light of existing theories of episodic memory processing, including the information via desynchronization hypothesis and retrieved context theory, and examine how our data fit with existing theories for the functional role of the PCC. These include a postulated role for the PCC in modulating internally directed attention and for representing or integrating contextual information for memory items.

A putative neural mechanism that strongly influences how input elements are transformed into meaningful memory codes relies on the ability to integrate them with existing structures of knowledge or schemas. However, it is not yet clear whether schema-related integration neural mechanisms occur during online encoding. In the current investigation, we examined the encoding-dependent nature of this phenomenon in humans. We showed that actively integrating words with congruent semantic information provided by a category cue enhances memory for words and increases false recall. The memory effect of such active integration with congruent information was robust, even with an interference task occurring right after each encoding word list. In addition, via electroencephalography, we show in 2 separate studies that the onset of the neural signals of successful encoding appeared early (similar to 400 ms) during the encoding of congruent words. That the neural signals of successful encoding of congruent and incongruent information followed similarly similar to 200 ms later suggests that this earlier neural response contributed to memory formation. We propose that the encoding of events that are congruent with readily available contextual semantics can trigger an accelerated onset of the neural mechanisms, supporting the integration of semantic information with the event input. This faster onset would result in a long-lasting and meaningful memory trace for the event but, at the same time, make it difficult to distinguish it from plausible but never encoded events (i.e., related false memories).

J	Weaver, MD; van Zoest, W; Hickey, C				Weaver, Matthew D.; van Zoest, Wieske; Hickey, Clayton			A temporal dependency account of attentional inhibition in oculomotor control	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Vision; Attention; Oculomotor control; Eye Movements; Electroencephalography	ANTI-SACCADE TASK; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL-SEARCH; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS	We used concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking to investigate the role of covert attentional mechanisms in the control of oculomotor behavior. Human participants made speeded saccades to targets that were presented alongside salient distractors. By subsequently sorting trials based on whether the distractor was strongly represented or suppressed by the visual system - as evident in the accuracy (Exp. 1) or quality of the saccade (Exp. 2) - we could characterize and contrast pre-saccadic neural activity as a function of whether oculomotor control was established. Results show that saccadic behavior is strongly linked to the operation of attentional mechanisms in visual cortex. In Experiment 1, accurate saccades were preceded by attentional selection of the target - indexed by a target-elicited N2pc component - and by attentional suppression of the distractor - indexed by early and late distractor-elicited distractor positivity (Pd) components. In Experiment 2, the strength of distractor suppression predicted the degree to which the path of slower saccades would deviate away from the distractor en route to the target. However, results also demonstrated clear dissociations of covert and overt selective control, with saccadic latency in particular showing no relationship to the latency of covert selective mechanisms. Eye movements could thus be initiated prior to the onset of attentional ERP components, resulting in stimulus-driven behaviour. Taken together, the results indicate that attentional mechanisms play a role in determining saccadic behavior, but that saccade timing is not contingent on the deployment of attention. This creates a temporal dependency, whereby attention fosters oculomotor control only when attentional mechanisms are given sufficient opportunity to impact stimuli representations before an eye movement is executed.

From healthy to pathology through a fall in dynamical complexity of involuntary oscillations of the human hand	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Tremor; Multifractality; Recurrence; Dynamical complexity	UNSTABLE PERIODIC-ORBITS; RECURRENCE PLOTS; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; TIME-SERIES; PHYSIOLOGICAL TREMOR; DISEASE; SYSTEMS; WAVELETS; BRAIN; EEG	The task is to estimate quantitative features in involuntary oscillations of shaking (tremor) of fingers accompanied the performance of the motor task by healthy subjects, patients with Parkinson' disease and individuals with the essential tremor. For solving the task the tremor patterns are examined by the wavelet-transform modulus maxima method and the recurrence quantification analysis. The physiological tremor is characterized by the minimal energy of the wavelet spectrum, the maximal degree of multifractality, the minimal degree of determinism and the maximal recurrence time density entropy, reflecting the greatest uncertainty of the period value. During the essential tremor the significant enhancement of the wavelet spectrum energy and the decrease of the dynamical complexity of involuntary oscillations are observed. It is evident as the fall in the multifractality degree, the growth of determinism in recurrence plots, the decrease of the recurrence time density entropy and the emergence of unstable periodic orbits in involuntary oscillations. For the parkinsonian tremor all the trends are enhanced that lead to more definite dynamics of patterns. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the dynamical complexity of patterns of involuntary oscillations decreases in larger degree for Parkinson' disease, than for patients with the syndrome of the essential tremor, that is, it declines with increasing the severity degree of motor disorders. The results obtained for the first time can be applied for evaluating the degree of deviation of the motor function from the healthy one. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Dick, O.

Slow and Fast Responses: Two Mechanisms of Trial Outcome Processing Revealed by EEG Oscillations	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; attention; response time; error detection; theta oscillations; alpha oscillations; beta oscillations	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; BAND OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING	Cognitive control includes maintenance of task-specific processes related to attention, and non-specific regulation of motor threshold. Depending upon the nature of the behavioral tasks, these mechanisms may predispose to different kinds of errors, with either increased or decreased response time (RT) of erroneous responses relative to correct responses. Specifically, slow responses are related to attentional lapses and decision uncertainty, these conditions tending to delay RTs of both erroneous and correct responses. Here we studied if RT may be a valid approximation distinguishing trials with high and low levels of sustained attention and decision uncertainty. We analyzed response-related and feedback-related modulations in theta, alpha and beta band activity in the auditory version of the two-choice condensation task, which is highly demanding for sustained attention while involves no inhibition of prepotent responses. Depending upon response speed and accuracy, trials were divided into slow correct, slow erroneous, fast correct and fast erroneous. We found that error-related frontal midline theta (FMT) was present only on fast erroneous trials. The feedback-related FMT was equally strong on slow erroneous and fast erroneous trials. Late post-response posterior alpha suppression was stronger on erroneous slow trials. Feedback-related frontal beta was present only on slow correct trials. The data obtained cumulatively suggests that RT allows distinguishing the two types of trials, with fast trials related to higher levels of attention and low uncertainty, and slow trials related to lower levels of attention and higher uncertainty.

Differences of temporal dynamics and signal complexity of gamma band oscillations in first-episode psychosis during a working memory task	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Article						First-episode psychosis; Gamma band oscillations; Temporal dynamics; Fractal dimension; Cortical binding; Working memory	PSYCHIATRIC RATING-SCALE; CORTICAL NETWORKS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; NEURONAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN RHYTHMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; POTENTIALS; EEG; DYSCONNECTIVITY; CONSCIOUSNESS	Gamma band oscillations participate in the temporal binding needed to synchronize cortical networks, involved in early sensory and short term memory processes. In earlier studies, alterations of these neurophysiological parameters have been found in psychotic disorders. To date no study has explored the temporal dynamics and signal complexity of gamma band oscillations in first episode psychosis (FEP). To address this issue, gamma band analysis was performed in 15 FEP patients and 18 healthy controls who successfully performed an adapted 2-back working memory task. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were computed to explore the relationship between the cognitive status and gamma oscillation changes over time. Based on regression model results, phase diagrams were constructed and their complexity was estimated using fractal dimension, a mathematical tool that describes shapes as numeric values. When adjusted for gamma values at time lags -3 to -4 ms and -15 to -16 ms, FEP patients displayed significantly higher time-dependent changes than controls, independently of the nature of the task. The present results are consistent with a discoordination of the activity of cortical generators engaged by the stimulus apparition in FEP patients, leading to a global binding deficit. In addition, fractal analysis showing higher complexity of gamma signal, confirmed this deficit. Our results provide evidence for recruitment of supplementary cortical generators as compensating mechanisms and yield further understanding for the pathophysiology cognitive impairments in FEP.

Ripples (80-250 Hz) have also been identified in non-invasive MEG, yet detection is impeded by noise, their low occurrence rates, and the workload of visual analysis. We propose a method that identifies ripples in MEG through noise reduction, beamforming and automatic detection with minimal user effort. We analysed 15 min of presurgical resting-state interictal MEG data of 25 patients with epilepsy. The MEG signal-to-noise was improved by using a cross-validation signal space separation method, and by calculating similar to 2400 beamformer-based virtual sensors in the grey matter. Ripples in these sensors were automatically detected by an algorithm optimized for MEG. A small subset of the identified ripples was visually checked. Ripple locations were compared with MEG spike dipole locations and the resection area if available. Running the automatic detection algorithm resulted in on average 905 ripples per patient, of which on average 148 ripples were visually reviewed. Reviewing took approximately 5 min per patient, and identified ripples in 16 out of 25 patients. In 14 patients the ripple locations showed good or moderate concordance with the MEG spikes. For six out of eight patients who had surgery, the ripple locations showed concordance with the resection area: 4/5 with good outcome and 2/3 with poor outcome.

This phenomenon is explained by the consistency between forward models of anticipated action effects and actual sensory feedback. Specifically, the brain state related to the binding between motor processing and sensory perception would have inhibitory function by gating sensory information via top-down control. Since the brain state could casually influence the perception of subsequent stimuli of different sensory modalities, we hypothesize that pain evoked by nociceptive stimuli following the self-initiated tactile stimulation would be attenuated as compared to that following externally determined tactile stimulation. Here, we compared psychophysical and neurophysiological responses to identical nociceptive-specific laser stimuli in two different conditions: self-initiated tactile sensation condition (STS) and nonself-initiated tactile sensation condition (N-STS). We observed that pain intensity and unpleasantness, as well as laser-evoked brain responses, were significantly reduced in the STS condition compared to the N-STS condition. In addition, magnitudes of alpha and beta oscillations prior to laser onset were significantly larger in the STS condition than in the N-STS condition. These results confirmed that pain perception and pain-related brain responses were attenuated when the tactile stimulation was initiated by subjects' voluntary actions, and exploited neural oscillations reflecting the binding between motor processing and sensory feedback. Thus, our study elaborated the understanding of underlying neural mechanisms related to top-down modulations of the analgesic effect induced by self-initiated tactile sensation, which provided theoretical basis to improve the analgesic effect in various clinical applications.

Despite this remarkable difference with other cortical areas, the influence of motor output and its amplitude on TEPs is largely unknown. Here we studied TEPs resulting from M1 stimulation and assessed whether their waveform and spectral features depend on the MEP amplitude. To this aim, we performed two separate experiments. In experiment 1, single-pulse TMS was applied at the same supra-threshold intensity on primary motor, prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices and the corresponding TEPs were compared by means of local mean field power and time-frequency spectral analysis. In experiment 2 we stimulated M1 at resting motor threshold in order to elicit MEPs characterized by a wide range of amplitudes. TEPs computed from high-MEP and low-MEP trials were then compared using the same methods applied in experiment 1. In line with previous studies, TMS of M1 produced larger TEPs compared to other cortical stimulations. Notably, we found that only TEPs produced by M1 stimulation were accompanied by a late event-related desynchronization (ERD-peaking at similar to 300 ms after TMS), whose magnitude was strongly dependent on the amplitude of MEPs. Overall, these results suggest that M1 produces peculiar responses to TMS possibly reflecting specific anatomo-functional properties, such as the re-entry of proprioceptive feedback associated with target muscle activation.

However, only within the past two decades have researchers been able to study the causal role of such oscillations using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technology. Two complementary approaches exist. A majority of research employs rhythmic TMS (rTMS) to entrain oscillatory activity and investigate its effect on targeted brain functions. On the other hand, single pulses of TMS (spTMS) that can be delivered with a high spatio-temporal resolution, can be used to precisely probe the state of the system. In this mini-review, we concentrate on this second approach. We argue that, with no a priori hypothesis on the oscillatory frequency of the targeted cortical regions, spTMS can help establish causal links between spontaneous oscillatory activity and perceptual and cognitive functions. Notably, this approach helped to demonstrate that the occipital cortex is periodically involved during specific attentional tasks at the theta (similar to 5 Hz) frequency. We propose that this frequency reflects periodic inter-areal communication for attentional exploration and selection. In the future, clever combination of non-invasive recording and stimulation with well-controlled psychophysics protocols will allow us to further our understanding of the role of brain oscillations for human brain functions.

Against the background of an aging workforce, the investigation of the interconnection of mental fatigue and aging is of great practical relevance. In the present study, a group of younger and a group of older adults performed a cognitive task for 3 h. The experimental design also comprised breaks with various durations. Beside behavioral data, the spectral properties of the ongoing EEG with respect to time on task and breaks were analyzed. No differences between the age groups were found in behavior, but electrophysiological measures provide some evidence that older adults in our study were differentially affected by time on task. In the later course of the experiment modulations in frontal theta power became larger for older, compared to younger adults. This may indicate strain due to task demands, eventually resulting from the deployment of compensatory processes. Occipital alpha, which has been linked to internally oriented brain states, saturates faster in younger adults. It thus maybe, that especially the younger participants' performance deteriorated due to the monotonous nature of the task itself. Both mechanisms, an increased consumption of cognitive resources in older adults and a decrease of motivation in younger adults, could mask differences in performance decrements between the age groups due to mental fatigue.

Recently developed effective methods for detection commands of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) that need calibration for visual stimuli, which cause more time and fatigue prior to the use, as the number of commands increases. This paper develops a novel unsupervised method based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for accurate detection of stimulus frequency. Approach. A novel unsupervised technique termed as binary subband CCA (BsCCA) is implemented in a multiband approach to enhance the frequency recognition performance of SSVEP. In BsCCA, two subbands are used and a CCA-based correlation coefficient is computed for the individual subbands. In addition, a reduced set of artificial reference signals is used to calculate CCA for the second subband. The analyzing SSVEP is decomposed into multiple subband and the BsCCA is implemented for each one. Then, the overall recognition score is determined by a weighted sum of the canonical correlation coefficients obtained from each band. Main results. A 12-class SSVEP dataset (frequency range: 9.25-14.75 Hz with an interval of 0.5 Hz) for ten healthy subjects are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results suggest that BsCCA significantly improves the performance of SSVEP-based BCI compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method is an unsupervised approach with averaged information transfer rate (ITR) of 77.04 bits min(-1) across 10 subjects. The maximum individual ITR is 107.55 bits min(-1) for 12-class SSVEP dataset, whereas, the ITR of 69.29 and 69.44 bits min(-1) are achieved with CCA and NCCA respectively. Significance. The statistical test shows that the proposed unsupervised method significantly improves the performance of the SSVEP-based BCI. It can be usable in real world applications.

Amygdala-hippocampal dynamics during salient information processing	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FEAR MEMORY; MNEMONIC INTERFERENCE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-RHYTHM; NEURAL BASIS; EEG-DATA; NETWORKS; EMOTION; COMPLEX	Recognizing motivationally salient information is critical to guiding behaviour. The amygdala and hippocampus are thought to support this operation, but the circuit-level mechanism of this interaction is unclear. We used direct recordings in the amygdala and hippocampus from human epilepsy patients to examine oscillatory activity during processing of fearful faces compared with neutral landscapes. We report high gamma (70-180 Hz) activation for fearful faces with earlier stimulus evoked onset in the amygdala compared with the hippocampus. Attending to fearful faces compared with neutral landscape stimuli enhances low-frequency coupling between the amygdala and the hippocampus. The interaction between the amygdala and hippocampus is largely unidirectional, with theta/alpha oscillations in the amygdala modulating hippocampal gamma activity. Granger prediction, phase slope index and phase lag analysis corroborate this directional coupling. These results demonstrate that processing emotionally salient events in humans engages an amygdala-hippocampal network, with the amygdala influencing hippocampal dynamics during fear processing.

Distinct Neurophysiological Mechanisms Support the Online Formation of Individual and Across-Episode Memory Representations	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; ERP; generalization; inferential learning; theta rhythm	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; COMPLEMENTARY-LEARNING-SYSTEMS; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CONTEXT; OSCILLATIONS; RETRIEVAL; RECOLLECTION; RECOGNITION; INHIBITION	Individual experiences often overlap in their content, presenting opportunities for rapid generalization across them. In this study, we show in 2 independent experiments that integrative encoding-the ability to form individual and across memory representations during online encoding-is supported by 2 distinct neurophysiological responses. Brain potential is increased gradually during encoding and fit to a trial level memory measure for individual episodes, whereas neural oscillations in the theta range (4-6 Hz) emerge later during learning and predict participants' generalization performance in a subsequent test. These results suggest that integrative encoding requires the recruitment of 2 separate neural mechanisms that, despite their co-occurrence in time, differ in their underlying neural dynamics, reflect different brain learning rates and are supportive of the formation of opposed memory representations, individual versus across-event episodes.

An innovative emotion assessment using physiological signals based on the combination mechanism	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Emotion assessment; EEG; Peripheral signal; Feature extraction; Classification		The main purpose of this paper is the assessment of emotions using Electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals and improvement of recognition accuracy of emotional states using combination mechanism. In the first step, according to the type of signals, effective features were extracted in the time and frequency domains; then, by using the Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) method, the most effective features were selected. Based on these features, six classifiers were used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Nearest Mean (NM), K-Nearest Neighborhood (K-NN), 1-Nearest Neighborhood (1-NN), FLD, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). They classified emotions in two classes (low and high) through arousal, valence, and liking dimensions. The Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) method has been implemented to evaluate the performance of classifiers. To enhance the accuracy of classification, combination at feature and classifier levels was performed. Via the concatenation method, combination at feature level was done. Then, by Majority voting, Fixed and Stacking algorithms, combination at classifier level was implemented. Results showed that these classifiers were selected properly and, thanks to them, good improvements were achieved compared with previous studies. Finally, by using combination methods, obtained recognition accuracy was much more reliable and combination at classifier level resulted in significant improvement.

It is now understood, that the seemingly random fluctuations of cortical activity form highly structured patterns, including oscillations at various frequencies, that modulate evoked neuronal responses (Arieli et al., 1996; Poulet and Petersen, 2008; He, 2013) and affect sensory perception (Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2004; Holy et al., 2007; Sadaghiani et al., 2009; Vinnik et al., 2012; Palva et al., 2013). Ongoing cortical activity is driven by proprioceptive and interoceptive inputs. In addition, it is partially intrinsically generated in which case it may be related to mental processes (Fox and Raichle, 2007; Deco et al., 2011). Here we argue that respiration, via multiple sensory pathways, contributes a rhythmic component to the ongoing cortical activity. We suggest that this rhythmic activity modulates the temporal organization of cortical neurodynamics, thereby linking higher cortical functions to the process of breathing.

Antiepileptic drugs are the main treatment option; approximately 60% of newly diagnosed patients are seizure-free with AED monotherapy and a further 10-20% with polytherapy. The aim of our study was to obtain an evaluation of the impact of sociodemo-graphic, epilepsy-related, and treatment-related characteristics on the course of the disease and to determine the predictors of not well controlled epileptic seizures. One hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients with epilepsy (57 male and 74 female, average age 40.13 +/- 13.37 years) were enrolled in the study. The methods used were documentary analysis, an interview on clinical factors, medical examination, self-reporting questionnaire (Liverpool Adverse Events Profile), and statistical methods. Significant positive correlations were found between cryptogenic type of epilepsy, abnormal EEG, higher numbers of antepileptic drugs taken, higher score of "Neurological and psychiatric side effects" subscale, and the higher seizures frequency. Statistical analysis revealed that higher pharmacoresistance grade was negatively correlated with younger age at epilepsy onset and showed a positive correlation with higher number of prescribed drugs. Type of epilepsy, higher number of antepileptic drugs taken at the present time and in the past, perception of more frequent and severe drug-related adverse events, and abnormal EEG finding in patients with epilepsy, are closely connected with the persistence of epileptic seizures. The results will be useful in the management of the patients with epilepsy, and thus in optimizing the antiepileptic therapy.

It is only until recent years has mental fatigue been explored through connectivity network analysis using graph theory. Although previous studies have revealed certain properties of the mental fatigue network via graph theory, some of these findings seemingly conflict with one another. The differences in findings could be due to mental fatigue being caused by various factors or being analyzed using different methods. So, in this study, to further understand the functional connectivity of driving fatigue, a weighted and undirected connectivity matrix would be constructed before applying graph theory to identify the biomarker from the network property. To obtain data for analysis, a 64-channel EEG cap was used to record the brain signals of subjects undergoing a one-hour driving simulation. Using the recorded EEG signal, a connectivity matrix was constructed using a synchronous method known as phase lag index (PLI) for the graph theory analysis. Results from this graph theory analysis showed that the synchronous network had increased clustering coefficient and decreased path length with the accumulation of mental fatigue. Furthermore, by calculating clustering coefficient regionally, its results revealed that the significant increase occurred mainly in the parietal and occipital regions of the brain.

Right frontal gamma and beta band enhancement while solving a spatial puzzle with insight	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Problem solving; Insight; Incremental; Spatial puzzle; Cognition neural oscillations; Gamma band; Beta band; Alpha band; Attention	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL ACTIVITY; AHA EXPERIENCE; HUMAN EEG; TASK; ACTIVATION; RETRIEVAL; PREDICTS; HUMANS; MEMORY	Solving a problem with an "a-ha" effect is known as insight. Unlike incremental problem solving, insight is sudden and unique, and the question about its distinct brain activity, intrigues many researchers. In this study, electroencephalogram signals were recorded from 12 right handed, human participants before (baseline) and while they solved a spatial puzzle known as the '10 coin puzzle' that could be solved incrementally or by insight. Participants responded as soon as they reached a solution and reported whether the process was incremental or by sudden insight EEG activity was recorded from 19 scalp locations. We found significant differences between insight and incremental solvers in the Gamma and Beta 2 bands in frontal areas (F8) and in the alpha band in right temporal areas (T6). The right-frontal gamma indicates a process of restructuring which leads to an insight solution, in spatial problems, further suggesting a universal role of gamma in restructuring. These results further suggest that solving a spatial puzzle via insight requires exclusive brain areas and neurological-cognitive processes which may be important for meta-cognitive components of insight solutions, including attention and monitoring of the solution.

Cognitive control in the eye of the beholder: Electrocortical theta and alpha modulation during response preparation in a cued saccade task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Medial frontal cortex; Theta; Saccades; Performance monitoring; Independent components analysis; Robust estimation	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; EEG-ALPHA; SPATIAL ATTENTION; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SIGNATURE; ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; PHASE SYNCHRONY; CORTEX	The oscillatory dynamics of medial frontal EEG theta and posterior alpha are implicated in the modulation of attention and cognitive control. We used a novel saccade cueing paradigm to examine whether theta and alpha are modulated by task difficulty during response preparation. After isolating and functionally classifying medial frontal and posterior alpha independent components, the EEG spectral power in these components was calculated on pro- and anti-saccade trials prior to response probes. The results of bootstrap re-sampling show that, compared to pro-saccade trials, correct anti-saccades are characterized by an increase in medial frontal theta and suppression of posterior alpha during the response preparation period. Furthermore, an absence of increased medial frontal theta prior to anti-saccades probes occurs on error trials, that is, a failure to control pre-potent eye movements. For these error trials, a burst in medial frontal theta is instead observed following error feedback. Our findings show that enhanced medial frontal theta is linked not only to dynamic cognitive control that is reactive (such as, after error commission), but is also an important prerequisite for success when behavioral control is challenged.

Language context processing deficits in schizophrenia: The role of attentional engagement	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Language; EEG; Attention; Schizophrenia; Alpha	ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; COMMUNICATION DISORDERS; THOUGHT-DISORDER; DEFAULT NETWORK; DISCOURSE; MIND; SENSITIVITY	Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit problems in language comprehension that are most evident during discourse processing. We hypothesized that deficits in cognitive control contribute to these comprehension deficits during discourse processing, and investigated the underlying cognitive-neural mechanisms using EEG (alpha power) and ERPs (N400). N400 amplitudes to globally supported or unsupported target words near the end of stories were used to index sensitivity to previous context. ERPs showed reduced sensitivity to context in patients versus controls. EEG alpha-band activity was used to index attentional engagement while participants listened to the stories. We found that context effects varied with attentional engagement in both groups, as well as with negative symptom severity in patients. Both groups demonstrated trial-to-trial fluctuations in alpha. Relatively high alpha power was associated with compromised discourse processing in participants with schizophrenia when it occurred during any early portion of the story. In contrast, discourse processing was only compromised in controls when alpha was relatively high for longer segments of the stories. Our results indicate that shifts in attention from the story context may be more detrimental to discourse processing for participants with schizophrenia than for controls, most likely due to an impaired ability to benefit from global context.

We hypothesize that the apparent contradiction may be explained by the partial overlap between 0.6-1 Hz EEG activity and K-Complex (KC). According to this view, we studied both frontal KCs and SWA in 20 AD patients and 20 healthy age-matched controls (HC) during nightly sleep, under the hypothesis that KCs better discriminate patients from healthy elderly than <= 1 Hz SWA. A drastic decrease of KC density during stage 2 NREM was found in AD compared to HC. Patients show more than 40% reduction of the KC density, allowing a correct classification of 80%. On the other hand, <= 1 Hz SWA of AD patients is slightly (not significantly) higher in most cortical areas compared to HC. Although no significant changes of <= 1 Hz SWA are detectable over frontal areas in AD, KC density decreases over the same location, and its decrease is related to the cognitive decline.

Despite theoretical models linking AAU to diminished cognitive control, empirical work testing this relationship with specific cognitive control neural correlates (e.g., prefrontal theta-band EEG dynamics) remains scarce. A longitudinal twin design was used to test the hypothesis that greater AAU is associated with reduced conflict-related EEG theta-band dynamics in adulthood, and to examine the genetic/environmental etiology of this association.& para;& para;Methods: In a large (N = 718) population-based prospective twin sample, AAU was assessed at ages 11/14/17. Twins completed a flanker task at age 29 to elicit EEG theta-band medial frontal cortex (MFC) power and medial-dorsal prefrontal cortex (MFC-dPFC) connectivity. Two complementary analytic methods (cotwin control analysis; biometric modeling) were used to disentangle the genetic/shared environmental risk towards AAU from possible alcohol exposure effects on theta dynamics.& para;& para;Results: AAU was negatively associated with adult cognitive control-related theta-band MFC power and MFC-dPFC functional connectivity. Genetic influences primarily underlie these associations.& para;& para;Conclusions: Findings provide strong evidence that genetic factors underlie the comorbidity between AAU and diminished cognitive control-related theta dynamics in adulthood.& para;& para;Significance: Conflict-related theta-band dynamics appear to be candidate brain-based endophenotypes/mechanisms for AAU.

Such a frequency-specific power attenuation of the SMR occurs in the alpha and beta frequency bands and is spatially registered at primary somatosensory and motor cortices. Here, we hypothesized that resting-state fluctuations of the SMR in the alpha and beta frequency bands also covary with resting-state sensorimotor cortical activity, without involving task-related neural dynamics. The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural regions whose activities were correlated with the simultaneously recorded SMR power fluctuations. The SMR power fluctuations were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and correlated with blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals obtained from the entire brain. Our findings show that the alpha and beta power components of the SMR correlate with activities of the pericentral area. Furthermore, brain regions with correlations between BOLD signals and the alpha-band SMR fluctuations were located posterior to those with correlations between BOLD signals and the beta-band SMR. These results are consistent with those of event-related studies of SMR modulation induced by sensory input or motor output. Our findings may help to understand the role of the sensorimotor cortex activity in contributing to the amplitude modulation of SMR during the resting state. This knowledge may be applied to the diagnosis of pathological conditions in the pericentral areas or the refinement of brain-computer interfaces using SMR in the future.

The relationship between music and brain such as cortical entrainment to periodic tune, periodic beat, and music have been well investigated. It has also been reported that the cerebral cortex responded more strongly to the periodic rhythm of unfamiliar music than to that of familiar music. However, previous works mainly used simple and artificial auditory stimuli like pure tone or beep. It is still unclear how the brain response is influenced by the familiarity of music. To address this issue, we analyzed electroencelphalogram(EEG) to investigate the relationship between cortical response and familiarity of music using melodies produced by piano sounds as simple natural stimuli. The cross-correlation function averaged across trials, channels, and participants showed two pronounced peaks at time lags around 70 and 140 ms. At the two peaks the magnitude of the cross-correlation values were significantly larger when listening to unfamiliar and scrambled music compared to those when listening to familiar music. Our findings suggest that the response to unfamiliar music is stronger than that to familiar music. One potential application of our findings would be the discrimination of listeners' familiarity with music, which provides an important tool for assessment of brain activity.

The aim of the study was to assess the possibility to influence the neural circuits of the wake-sleep transition in awake subjects via a bilateral transcranial alternating current stimulation at 5 Hz (theta-tACS) on fronto-temporal areas. 25 healthy volunteers participated in two within-subject sessions (theta-tACS and sham), one week apart and in counterbalanced order. We assessed the stimulation effects on cortical EEG activity (28 derivations) and self-reported sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale). theta-tACS induced significant increases of the theta activity in temporo-parieto-occipital areas and centro-frontal increases in the alpha activity compared to sham but failed to induce any online effect on sleepiness. Since the total energy delivered in the sham condition was much less than in the active theta-tACS, the current data are unable to isolate the specific effect of entrained theta oscillatory activity per se on sleepiness scores. On this basis, we concluded that theta-tACS modulated theta and alpha EEG activity with a topography consistent with high sleep pressure conditions. However, no causal relation can be traced on the basis of the current results between these rhythms and changes on sleepiness.

One current hypothesis, the interhemispheric miscommunication theory, is based on findings from fMRI, DTI and EEG, but there is only limited evidence so far concerning underlying functional coupling mechanisms. Here we report a 64-channel EEG study using lagged phase synchronization analysis and eLORETA source estimation to examine the functional connectivity between bilateral auditory cortices in the gamma-band in 26 schizophrenia patients (13 with and 13 without AVH) and 26 matched healthy controls (HC) while performing a dichotic listening task. We found a significantly reduced right-ear-advantage (REA) in AVH but not in non-AVH patients compared to HC. The major finding was significantly stronger gamma-band connectivity between bilateral auditory cortices during conscious perception of left (versus right) ear syllables in patients with AVH compared to HC and patients without AVH. A significant positive correlation was found between this connectivity alteration and the AVH symptom score in schizophrenia patients. These findings provide further support for the interhemispheric miscommunication hypothesis of AVH pathophysiology by indicating that aberrant gamma-band coupling between auditory cortices is related to the emergence of AVH in schizophrenia.

Applying the electroencephalogram (EEG) operational synchrony analysis to extract three modules of the self-referential brain network in 12 medication-free depressive outpatients and 10 control subjects we have found an increase in the strength of EEG synchrony within all three modules in depressive patients (though non-significant for the right module). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis that used 3 factors (values of synchrony strength for all three modules) as input indicated that combined increase in the strength of synchrony in all three modules was positively associated with severity of depression. Taken together the findings of this study suggest that depression is primarily associated with hypersynchrony in all three modules of the brain self-referential network (the anterior module been responsible for "witnessing observation and first person perspective", the left posterior module been responsible for "reflective agency and narration" and the right posterior module been responsible for "bodily representational-emotional agency"), thus contributing to excessive self-focus, rumination, and body tension.

Virtual reality (VR) has proved to be a valuable tool to improve neurorehabilitation training. The aim of our pilot randomized clinical trial was to understand the neurophysiological basis of motor function recovery induced by the association between RAGT (by using Lokomat device) and VR (an animated avatar in a 2D VR) by studying electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations. Methods: Twenty-four patients suffering from a first unilateral ischemic stroke in the chronic phase were randomized into two groups. One group performed 40 sessions of Lokomat with VR (RAGT + VR), whereas the other group underwent Lokomat without VR (RAGT-VR). The outcomes (clinical, kinematic, and EEG) were measured before and after the robotic intervention. Results: As compared to the RAGT-VR group, all the patients of the RAGT + VR group improved in the Rivermead Mobility Index and Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment. Moreover, they showed stronger event-related spectral perturbations in the high-gamma. and beta bands and larger fronto-central cortical activations in the affected hemisphere. Conclusions: The robotic-based rehabilitation combined with VR in patients with chronic hemiparesis induced an improvement in gait and balance. EEG data suggest that the use of VR may entrain several brain areas (probably encompassing the mirror neuron system) involved in motor planning and learning, thus leading to an enhanced motor performance.

Local and interregional alpha EEG dynamics dissociate between memory for search and memory for recognition	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual working memory; Search template; Alpha oscillations; EEG; Functional connectivity; Top-down control	VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VOLUME-CONDUCTION	Attention during visual search is thought to be guided by an active visual working memory (VWM) representation of the search target. We tested the hypothesis that a VWM representation used for searching a target among competing information (a "search template") is distinct from VWM representations used for simple recognition tasks, without competition. We analyzed EEG from 20 human participants while they performed three different VWM-based visual detection tasks. All tasks started with identical lateralized VWM cues, but differed with respect to the presence and nature of competing distractors during the target display at test, where participants performed a simple recognition task without distractors, or visual search in pop-out (distinct) and serial (non-distinct) search displays. Performance was worst for non-distinct search, and best for simple recognition. During the one second delay period between cue and test, we observed robust suppression of EEG dynamics in the alpha (8-14 Hz) band over parieto-occipital sites contralateral to the relevant VWM item, both in terms of local power as well as interregional phase synchrony within a posterior-parietal network. Importantly, these lateralization dynamics were more strongly expressed prior to search compared to simple recognition. Furthermore, before the VWM cue, alpha phase synchrony between prefrontal and mid-posterior parietal sites was strongest for non-distinct search, reflecting enhanced anticipatory control prior to VWM encoding. Directional connectivity analyses confirmed this effect to be in an anterior-to-posterior direction. Together, these results provide evidence for frontally mediated top-down control of VWM in preparation of visual search.	[van Driel, Joram; Gunseli, Eren; Meeter, Martijn; Olivers, Christian N.

The trainability of brain rhythm using a neurofeedback system is uncertainty because various experimental designs are used in previous studies. The current study aimed to develop a portable wireless NFT system for alpha rhythm and to validate effect of the NFT system on memory with a sham-controlled group. Methods: The proposed system contained an EEG signal analysis device and a smartphone with wireless Bluetooth low-energy technology. Instantaneous 1-s EEG power and contiguous 5-min EEG power throughout the training were developed as feedback information. The training performance and its progression were kept to boost usability of our device. Participants were blinded and randomly assigned into either the control group receiving random 4-Hz power or Alpha group receiving 8-12-Hz power. Working memory and episodic memory were assessed by the backward digital span task and word-pair task, respectively. Results: The portable neurofeedback system had advantages of a tiny size and long-term recording and demonstrated trainability of alpha rhythm in terms of significant increase of power and duration of 8-12 Hz. Moreover, accuracies of the backward digital span task and word-pair task showed significant enhancement in the Alpha group after training compared to the control group. Conclusions: Our tiny portable device demonstrated success trainability of alpha rhythm and enhanced two kinds of memories. The present study suggest that the portable neurofeedback system provides an alternative intervention for memory enhancement.

To investigate these hypotheses, behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) indicators of partial report task processing were assessed in twenty-four healthy young men who randomly received a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist (0.8 mg/kg dextromethorphan, DXM) or a placebo, and concurrently accomplished a stress induction (MAST) or control protocol in three consecutive sessions. Saliva samples served to quantify cortisol responses to the MAST, whereas a passive auditory oddball paradigm was implemented to verify the impact of DXM on the EEG-derived mismatch negativity component (MMN). DXM administration significantly increased MMN amplitudes but not salivary cortisol concentrations. By contrast, concurrent MAST exposure significantly reduced MMN latencies but also increased cortisol concentrations. With regard to EEG indicators, DXM administration reduced visually "evoked" (30Hz to 50Hz) and "induced" occipital gamma-band activity (70Hz to 100Hz), which was partly compensated by additional MAST exposure. However, neither the interventions nor EEG activity were significantly associated with behavioral partial report sensitivities. In summary, the present data suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission across the NMDAR is only one among many determinants of intact visual perception. Accordingly, therapeutic doses of DXM and their inhibitory modulation by stress probably yield more pronounced electroencephalographic as compared with behavioural effects.

Error-related oscillatory activity is modulated by novelty seeking in the reward condition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Temperament and character inventory; Cloninger; Stroop task; Theta; Alpha	CHARACTER INVENTORY TCI; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG DYNAMICS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; ALPHA; TEMPERAMENT; PERSONALITY; REINFORCEMENT; PUNISHMENT	Behavioural research has revealed the influence of motivation conditions on cognitive task performance and demonstrated that these influences are modulated by temperament factors. Modern neuroimaging methods enable analysis of neuropsychological mechanisms through which individual differences in reinforcement sensitivity may influence cognitive functioning. In the study, fifty-six participants were scored on the Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory to assess punishment and reward sensitivity. Then, subjects participated in an EEG experiment using the numerical Stroop task under different motivational conditions. In one condition, they were punished for erroneous responses; in the other, they were rewarded for correct performance. We analysed event related changes in EEG spectral power to investigate the influence of temperamentally driven differences on error-related oscillatory brain activity. In agreement with previous findings, after incorrect responses an increase in frontocentral theta (3-7 Hz) and a decrease in occipital alpha (10-11 Hz) power were observed. Moreover, a multivariate regression analysis showed that these spectral markers were modulated by temperamental trait Novelty Seeking in the reward condition. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate such a relationship between individual differences and error-related oscillatory activity. This neuronal pattern may explain why participants that score high on Novelty Seeking trait are highly motivated and strongly engaged in a task when a reward might be earned. Thus, in conclusion we emphasise that to understand an individual's response to errors, it is necessary to account simultaneously for motivational conditions as well as temperament traits.

One of the current limitations of the standard training assessment procedures is the lack of information about the amount of cognitive resources requested by the user for the correct execution of the proposed task. In fact, even if the task is accomplished achieving the maximum performance, by the standard training assessment methods, it would not be possible to gather and evaluate information about cognitive resources available for dealing with unexpected events or emergency conditions. Therefore, a metric based on the brain activity (neurometric) able to provide the Instructor such a kind of information should be very important. As a first step in this direction, the Electroencephalogram (EEG) and the performance of 10 participants were collected along a training period of 3 weeks, while learning the execution of a new task. Specific indexes have been estimated from the behavioral and EEG signal to objectively assess the users' training progress. Furthermore, we proposed a neurometric based on a machine learning algorithm to quantify the user's training level within each session by considering the level of task execution, and both the behavioral and cognitive stabilities between consecutive sessions. The results demonstrated that the proposed methodology and neurometric could quantify and track the users' progresses, and provide the Instructor information for a more objective evaluation and better tailoring of training programs.

However, the EMG frequency spectrum overlies the higher EEG oscillations and the NFB trainings focusing on these frequencies is hindered by the problem of EMG load in the information fed back to the subjects. In such a complex signal, it is highly probable that the most controllable component will form the basis for operant conditioning. This might cause different effects in the case of various training protocols and therefore needs to be carefully assessed before designing training protocols and algorithms. In the current experiment a group of healthy adults (n = 14) was trained by professional trainers to up-regulate their beta1 (15-22 Hz) band for eight sessions. The control group (n = 18) underwent the same training regime but without rewards for increasing beta. In half of the participants trained to up-regulate beta1 band (n = 7) a systematic increase in tonic EMG activity was identified offline, implying that muscle activity became a foundation for reinforcement in the trainings. The remaining participants did not present any specific increase of the trained beta1 band amplitude. The training was perceived effective by both trainers and the trainees in all groups. These results indicate the necessity of proper control of muscle activity as a requirement for the genuine EEG-NFB training, especially in protocols that do not aim at the participants' relaxation. The specificity of the information fed back to the participants should be of highest interest to all therapists and researchers, as it might irreversibly alter the results of the training.

Why don't you like me? Midfrontal theta power in response to unexpected peer rejection feedback	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Feedback; Phase synchrony; Social rejection; Source localization; Theta power	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; SOCIAL EXCLUSION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; OSTRACISM DISTRESS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN; DYNAMICS	Social connectedness theory posits that the brain processes social rejection as a threat to survival. Recent electrophysiological evidence suggests that midfrontal theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations in the EEG provide a window on the processing of social rejection. Here we examined midfrontal theta dynamics (power and inter-trial phase synchrony) during the processing of social evaluative feedback. We employed the Social Judgment paradigm in which 56 undergraduate women (mean age=19.67 years) were asked to communicate their expectancies about being liked vs. disliked by unknown peers. Expectancies were followed by feedback indicating social acceptance vs. rejection. Results revealed a significant increase in EEG theta power to unexpected social rejection feedback. This EEG theta response could be source-localized to brain regions typically reported during activation of the saliency network (i.e., dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, inferior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and the supplementary motor area). Theta phase dynamics mimicked the behavior of the time-domain averaged feedback-related negativity (FRN) by showing stronger phase synchrony for feedback that was unexpected vs. expected. Theta phase, however, differed from the FRN by also displaying stronger phase synchrony in response to rejection vs. acceptance feedback. Together, this study highlights distinct roles for midfrontal theta power and phase synchrony in response to social evaluative feedback. Our findings contribute to the literature by showing that midfrontal theta oscillatory power is sensitive to social rejection but only when peer rejection is unexpected, and this theta response is governed by a widely distributed neural network implicated in saliency detection and conflict monitoring.

Methodology/approach - During teamwork the rapid electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) oscillations that emerge on the scalp were transformed into symbolic data streams which provided historical details at a second-by-second resolution of how the team perceived the evolving task and how they adjusted their dynamics to compensate for, and anticipate new task challenges. Key to this approach are the different strategies that can be used to reduce the data dimensionality, including compression, abstraction and taking advantage of the natural redundancy in biologic signals. Findings - The framework emerging is that teams continually enter and leave organizational neurodynamic partnerships with each other, so-called metastable states, depending on the evolving task, with higher level dynamics arising from mechanisms that naturally integrate over faster microscopic dynamics. Practical implications - The development of quantitative measures of the momentary dynamics of teams is anticipated to significantly influence how teams are assembled, trained, and supported. The availability of such measures will enable objective comparisons to be made across teams, training protocols, and training sites. They will lead to better understandings of how expertise is developed and how training can be modified to accelerate the path toward expertise. Originality/value - The innovation of this study is the potential it raises for developing globally applicable quantitative models of team dynamics that will allow comparisons to be made across teams, tasks, and training protocols.

J	Scholz, S; Schneider, SL; Rose, M				Scholz, Sebastian; Schneider, Signe Luisa; Rose, Michael			Differential effects of ongoing EEG beta and theta power on memory formation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PRESTIMULUS THETA; ALPHA-BAND; PREDICT; SYNCHRONIZATION; DISCRIMINATION; PERSPECTIVE; INHIBITION	Recently, elevated ongoing pre-stimulus beta power (13-17 Hz) at encoding has been associated with subsequent memory formation for visual stimulus material. It is unclear whether this activity is merely specific to visual processing or whether it reflects a state facilitating general memory formation, independent of stimulus modality. To answer that question, the present study investigated the relationship between neural pre-stimulus oscillations and verbal memory formation in different sensory modalities. For that purpose, a within-subject design was employed to explore differences between successful and failed memory formation in the visual and auditory modality. Furthermore, associative memory was addressed by presenting the stimuli in combination with background images. Results revealed that similar EEG activity in the low beta frequency range (13-17 Hz) is associated with subsequent memory success, independent of stimulus modality. Elevated power prior to stimulus onset differentiated successful from failed memory formation. In contrast, differential effects between modalities were found in the theta band (3-7 Hz), with an increased oscillatory activity before the onset of later remembered visually presented words. In addition, pre stimulus theta power dissociated between successful and failed encoding of associated context, independent of the stimulus modality of the item itself. We therefore suggest that increased ongoing low beta activity reflects a memory promoting state, which is likely to be moderated by modality-independent attentional or inhibitory processes, whereas high ongoing theta power is suggested as an indicator of the enhanced binding of incoming interlinked information.

Neural correlates of lexical decisions in Parkinson's disease revealed with multivariate extraction of cortico-subthalamic interactions	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Basal ganglia; Beta; Deep brain stimulation; Language; Oscillations; STN	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; FIELD POTENTIAL RECORDINGS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MUSCULAR COHERENCE; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; BETA-ACTIVITY; NUCLEUS; MOTOR	Objective: Neural interactions between cortex and basal ganglia are pivotal for sensorimotor processing. Specifically, coherency between cortex and subthalamic structures is a frequently studied phenomenon in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, it is unknown whether cortico-subthalamic coherency might also relate to cognitive aspects of task performance, e.g., language processing. Furthermore, standard coherency studies are challenged by how to efficiently handle multi-channel recordings. Methods: In eight patients with Parkinson's disease treated with deep brain stimulation, simultaneous recordings of surface electroencephalography and deep local field potentials were obtained from bilateral subthalamic nuclei, during performing a lexical decision task. A recent multivariate coherency measure (maximized imaginary part of coherency, MIC) was applied, simultaneously accounting for multi-channel recordings. Results: Cortico-subthalamic synchronization (MIC) in 14-35 Hz oscillations positively correlated with accuracy in lexical decisions across patients, but not in 7-13 Hz oscillations. In contrast to multivariate MIC, no significant correlation was obtained when extracting cortico-subthalamic synchronization by "standard" bivariate coherency. Conclusions: Cortico-subthalamic synchronization may relate to non-motor aspects of task performance, here reflected in lexical accuracy. Significance: The results tentatively suggest the relevance of cortico-subthalamic interactions for lexical decisions. Multivariate coherency might be effective to extract neural synchronization from multi-channel recordings. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In this magnetoencephalography study, we show that during visual working memory maintenance, temporal cortex regions, which exhibit enhanced PAC, interact with prefrontal cortex via enhanced low-frequency phase synchronization. Healthy human participants were engaged in a visual delayed match-to-sample task with pictures of natural objects. During the delay period, we observed increased spectral power of beta (20-28 Hz) and gamma (40-94 Hz) bands as well as decreased power of theta/alpha band (7-9 Hz) oscillations in visual sensory areas. Enhanced PAC between the phases of theta/alpha and the amplitudes of beta oscillations was found in the left inferior temporal cortex (IT), an area known to be involved in visual object memory. Furthermore, the IT was functionally connected to the prefrontal cortex by increased low-frequency phase synchronization within the theta/alpha band. Together, these results point to a mechanism in which the combination of PAC and long-range phase synchronization subserves enhanced large-scale brain communication. They suggest that distant brain regions might coordinate their activity in the low-frequency range to engage local stimulus-related processing in higher frequencies via the combination of long-range, within-frequency phase synchronization and local cross-frequency PAC.

Effect of Temperature on Heart Rate Variability in Neonatal ICU Patients With Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						heart rate variability; hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; neonatal intensive care unit; temperature; therapeutic hypothermia	THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; INTERVAL VARIABILITY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; NEWBORNS; INFANTS; EEG; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY; ASPHYXIA	Objective: To determine whether measures of heart rate variability are related to changes in temperature during rewarming after therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Level 4 neonatal ICU in a free-standing academic children's hospital. Patients: Forty-four infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Interventions: Continuous electrocardiogram data from 2 hours prior to rewarming through 2 hours after completion of rewarming (up to 10 hr) were analyzed. Measurements and Main Results: Median beat-to-beat interval and measures of heart rate variability were quantified including beat-to-beat interval sd, low and high frequency relative spectral power, detrended fluctuation analysis short and long a exponents (alpha(S) and alpha(L)), and root mean square short and long time scales. The relationships between heart rate variability measures and esophageal/axillary temperatures were evaluated. Heart rate variability measures low frequency, alpha(S), and root mean square short and long time scales were negatively associated, whereas alpha(L) was positively associated, with temperature (p < 0.01). These findings signify an overall decrease in heart rate variability as temperature increased toward normothermia. Conclusions: Measures of heart rate variability are temperature dependent in the range of therapeutic hypothermia to normothermia. Core body temperature needs to be considered when evaluating heart rate variability metrics as potential physiologic biomarkers of illness severity in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.

The study design is pre-test/post-test Control Group (CG), and analyses were limited to those randomized to the neurofeedback intervention. The sample were ADHD students below 15 years of age (7-14 years), of whom 10 completed the 5-week training assessment in the experimental group (EG), whereas 9 completed the assessment in the CG, students from elementary and secondary schools referred to a Chinese psychiatry clinic. The average age of the sample was 13.48 years in the EG. The findings showed the beneficial effects of neurofeedback training, which improved in ADHD students. These findings revealed that most of the working memory function measurements exhibited significant differences between the EG and CG. A neurofeedback training programme enhances the working memory function in ADHD students.

Here using the VCI templates, we investigated the hypothesis that internal carotid artery-intima-media thickness (ICA-IMT) is associated with EEG spectrum intensity (sNAT) and spectrum steepness (vNAT). Methods: A total of 221 community-dwelling elderly subjects were recruited. Four groups were classified according to quartiles of ICA-IMT as assessed by ultrasonography: control group A, normal (<= 0.9 mm); group B, mild atherosclerosis (1-1.1 mm); group C, moderate atherosclerosis (1.2-1.8 mm); and group D, severe atherosclerosis (>= 1.9 mm). EEG markers of power ratio index (PRI), and the binary likelihood of being in the VCI group vs. the that of being in control group A (sL(x): VCI-A, vL(x): VCI-A) were assessed, respectively. Differences in mean total scores for PRI, sL(x): VCI-A, vL(x): VCI-A, between control group A and the other groups were compared using Dunnett's test, respectively. Results: The mean total scores of the PRI were 3.25, 3.00, 2.77, and 2.26 for groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. There was a significant decrease in the PRI in group D compared with group A (P = 0.0066). Themean total scores of the sL(x): VCI-A were -0.14, -0.11, -0.1, and -0.03 for groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. The sL(x): VCI-A in group D was significantly higher compared to that in group A (P < 0.0001). The mean total scores of the vL(x): VCI-A were -0.04,-0.01, 0.01, and 0.06 for group A, B, C, and D, respectively. The vL(x): VCI-A in group D and group C was significantly higher compared to that in group A, respectively (P < 0.0001, P = 0.02). Conclusion: Community-dwelling elderly subjects in the increased carotid atherosclerosis of ICA-IMT (>= 1.9 mm) were at greatest risk of an EEG change as assessed by NAT.

Various paradigms were designed to improve BCI performance. However, the relationship between control objects and SSVEP paradigm has been neglected. In this study, we proposed a new object-oriented SSVEP-BCI paradigm. This paradigm used continuous action scene of controlled object to replace traditional stimulus to stimulate the generation of SSVEP, which improve SSVEP recognition accuracy and realize the more user-friendly BCI system of "what you see is what you get". The SSVEP-BCI system for controlling a 2DOFs prosthesis hand was customized as an example and four healthy subjects were recruited for our experiments. Firstly, Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was analyzed in frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Results show that significantly strong SSVEP was elicited. Then canonical correlation analysis (CCA) algorithm was used for SSVEP recognition. Experimental results show that the mean recognition accuracy and ITR (mean +/- standard deviation) in short time window (1-2s) reached 87.66 +/- 2.09% and 28.51 +/- 5.63 bits/min respectively, which was comparable or even better than the performances of conventional four-choice SSVEP-based BCIs. Finally, the paradigm is universal and can he applied to various SSVEP-BCI fields. Taken together, these results suggest that the proposed paradigm is a promising option in BCI applications.

Intracranial studies provide a unique opportunity to link the all-encompassing range of high-frequency patterns with holistic perception. We tested whether the functional topography of HFAs (up to 250Hz) is related to perceptual decision-making. Human intracortical data were recorded (6 subjects; > 250channels) during an ambiguous object-recognition task. We found a spatial topography of HFAs reflecting processing anterior dorsal and ventral streams, linked to decision independently of the type of processed object/stimulus category. Three distinct regional fingerprints could be identified, with lower gamma frequency patterns (< 45Hz) dominating in the anterior semantic ventral object processing and dorsoventral integrating networks and evolving later, during perceptual decision phases, than early sensory posterior patterns (60-250Hz). This suggests that accurate object recognition/ perceptual decision-making is related to distinct spatiotemporal signatures in the low gamma frequency range.

Optimization of Checkerboard Spatial Frequencies for Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential Brain-Computer Interfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs); canonical correlation analysis; checkerboard stimuli; steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)	ADAPTATION; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; NEURONS	Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are oscillations of the electroencephalogram (EEG) which aremainly observed over the occipital area that exhibit a frequency corresponding to a repetitively flashing visual stimulus. SSVEPs have proven to be very consistent and reliable signals for rapid EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) control. There is conflicting evidence regarding whether solid or checkerboard-patterned flashing stimuli produce superior BCI performance. Furthermore, the spatial frequency of checkerboard stimuli can be varied for optimal performance. The present study performs an empirical evaluation of performance for a 4-class SSVEP-based BCI when the spatial frequency of the individual checkerboard stimuli is varied over a continuum ranging from a solid background to single-pixel checkerboard patterns. The results indicate that a spatial frequency of 2.4 cycles per degree can maximize the information transfer rate with a reduction in subjective visual irritation compared to lower spatial frequencies. This important finding on stimulus design can lead to improved performance and usability of SSVEP-based BCIs.

Here, we developed a miniature probe integrating a photoacoustic sensor and micro-electrodes to simultaneously record the dynamics of blood flow and total hemoglobin inside a single capillary and the activities of surrounding neurons with high spatiotemporal resolution in freely-moving rats. In the somatosensory cortex of rats, we observed: 1) early hemodynamic response prior to the changes in local field potential during pentylenetetrazol-induced localized and generalized seizure onsets in both freely-moving and anesthetized rats; and 2) different hemodynamic and neural responses to generalized seizure onsets between freely-moving and anaesthetized rats. These findings suggest that this high-resolution hybrid technique will enable a wide range of new studies of behaviors and brain disorders in small animals.

As more neural correlates of behavior are identified in freely moving animals, this three-fold subdivision becomes too simplistic. During wakefulness, ensembles of global and local cortical activities, together with peripheral parameters such as pupillary diameter and sympathovagal balance, define various degrees of arousal. It remains unclear the extent to which sleep also forms a continuum of brain states-within which the degree of resilience to sensory stimuli and arousability, and perhaps other sleep functions, vary gradually-and how peripheral physiological states co-vary. Research advancing the methods to monitor multiple parameters during sleep, as well as attributing to constellations of these functional attributes, is central to refining our understanding of sleep as a multifunctional process during which many beneficial effects must be executed. Identifying novel parameters characterizing sleep states will open opportunities for novel diagnostic avenues in sleep disorders. We present a procedure to describe dynamic variations of mouse non-REM sleep states via the combined monitoring and analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG)/electrocorticogram (ECoG), electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using standard polysomnographic recording techniques. Using this approach, we found that mouse non-REM sleep is organized into cycles of coordinated neural and cardiac oscillations that generate successive 25-s intervals of high and low fragility to external stimuli. Therefore, central and autonomic nervous systems are coordinated to form behaviorally distinct sleep states during consolidated non-REM sleep. We present surgical manipulations for polysomnographic (i.e., EEG/EMG combined with ECG) monitoring to track these cycles in the freely sleeping mouse, the analysis to quantify their dynamics, and the acoustic stimulation protocols to assess their role in the likelihood of waking up. Our approach has already been extended to human sleep and promises to unravel common organizing principles of non-REM sleep states in mammals.	[Fernandez, Laura M.

Conflicting results of corticomuscular coherence studies in essential tremor suggest an intermittent corticomuscular coupling. On the basis of the literature, we hypothesized that corticomuscular coupling is influenced by bilateral motor synchronization and "cognitive states" such as awareness of tremor. In the present study, we investigated 1) the existence of intermittent corticomuscular coherence (CMC) in essential tremor and 2) factors that influence CMC strength. In 18 essential tremor patients and 18 healthy controls, who mimicked tremor, we simultaneously recorded 64-channel EEG and 6-channel bipolar surface EMG from right and left wrist extensors and flexors. Right-sided (mimicked) hand tremor was recorded with and without a cognitive arithmetic task and with left-sided (mimicked) hand tremor. CMC values per task were compared within and between groups. Changes in CMC strength during tasks were calculated. Our main findings are 1) significant CMC around the (mimicked) tremor frequency across all tasks in both groups; 2) significant differences in CMC between unilateral tasks, with the highest values during the cognitive task only in the essential tremor group; and 3) significant fluctuations of CMC strength over time, independent of the tremor intensity, only in the essential tremor group. Our results suggest a limited role, and certainly not a continuous steering role, of sensorimotor cortical neurons in the generation of tremor. In clinical practice, these findings might help to standardize tremor registration and the interpretation of the analysis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The part of the motor cortex involved in essential tremor is uncertain. The current electrophysiological study is the first to assess corticomuscular coherence systematically. The study shows a dynamic nature of corticomuscular coherence and a possible influence of cognitive states. The results elucidate the involvement of the motor cortex in tremor and help interpret the varying results in the literature. In clinical practice, the findings may guide in standardizing tremor registration and its interpretation.

Functional and effective whole brain connectivity using magnetoencephalography to identify monozygotic twin pairs	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GENETIC INFLUENCES; MEG; HERITABILITY; EEG; INTERFERENCE; LOCALIZATION; ORGANIZATION	Resting-state functional connectivity patterns are highly stable over time within subjects. This suggests that such 'functional fingerprints' may have strong genetic component. We investigated whether the functional (FC) or effective (EC) connectivity patterns of one monozygotic twin could be used to identify the co-twin among a larger sample and determined the overlap in functional fingerprints within monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs using resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG). We included 32 cognitively normal MZ twin pairs from the Netherlands Twin Register who participate in the EMIF-AD preclinAD study (average age 68 years). Combining EC information across multiple frequency bands we obtained an identification rate over 75%. Since MZ twin pairs are genetically identical these results suggest a high genetic contribution to MEG-based EC patterns, leading to large similarities in brain connectivity patterns between two individuals even after 60 years of life or more.

Frequency-specific modulation of connectivity in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex by different forms of movement initiation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP); Coherence; Ipsilateral activity; Self-initiated; Visually-cued	SEQUENTIAL FINGER MOVEMENTS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; INTERHEMISPHERIC INTERACTIONS; HAND MOVEMENTS; DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES; ALPHA-BAND; EEG; STIMULATION	A consistent finding in motor EEG research is a bilateral attenuation of oscillatory activity over sensorimotor regions close to the onset of an upcoming unilateral hand movement. In contrast, little is known about how movement initiation affects oscillatory activity, especially in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the moving hand. We here investigated the neural mechanisms modulating oscillatory activity in the ipsilateral motor cortex prior to movement onset under the control of two different initiating networks, namely, Self-initiated and Visually-cued actions. During motor preparation, a contralateral preponderance of power over sensorimotor cortex (SM) was observed in a and beta bands during Visually-cued movements, whereas power changes were more bilateral during Self-initiated movements. Coherence between ipsilateral SM (iSM) and contralateral SM (cSM) in the a-band was significantly increased compared to the respective baseline values, independent of the context of movement initiation. However, this context-independent cSM-iSM coherence modulated the power changes in iSM in a context-dependent manner, that is, a stronger cSM-iSM coherence correlated with a larger decrease in high-beta power over iSM in the Self-initiated condition, in contrast to a smaller decrease in a power in the Visually-cued condition. In addition, the context-dependent coherence between SMA and iSM in the alpha-band and delta-theta-band for the Self-initiated and Visually-cued condition, respectively, exhibited a similar context-dependent modulation for power changes. Our findings suggest that the initiation of regional oscillations over iSM reflects changes in the information flow with the contralateral sensorimotor and premotor areas dependent upon the context of movement initiation. Importantly, the interaction between regional oscillations and network-like oscillatory couplings indicates different frequency-specific inhibitory mechanisms that modulate the activity in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex dependent upon how the movement is initiated.

J	Sinkiewicz, D; Friesen, L; Ghoraani, B				Sinkiewicz, Daniel; Friesen, Lendra; Ghoraani, Behnaz			A novel method for extraction of neural response from single channel cochlear implant auditory evoked potentials	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						Time frequency analysis; Auditory evoked potentials; Artifact suppression; Electroencephalography; Cochlear implant	RECOGNITION; ARTIFACT; LISTENERS; SOUND	Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEP) are used to evaluate cochlear implant (CI) patient auditory pathways, but the CI device produces an electrical artifact, which obscures the relevant information in the neural response. Currently there are multiple methods, which attempt to recover the neural response from the contaminated CAEP, but there is no gold standard, which can quantitatively confirm the effectiveness of these methods. To address this crucial shortcoming, we develop a wavelet-based method to quantify the amount of artifact energy in the neural response. In addition, a novel technique for extracting the neural response from single channel CAEPs is proposed. The new method uses matching pursuit (MP) based feature extraction to represent the contaminated CAEP in a feature space, and support vector machines (SVM) to classify the components as normal hearing (NH) or artifact. The NH components are combined to recover the neural response without artifact energy, as verified using the evaluation tool. Although it needs some further evaluation, this approach is a promising method of electrical artifact removal from CAEPs. (C) 2016 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Albeit they have been hailed to (re-)establish communication in persons suffering from severe motor- and/or communication disabilities, only recently BCI applications have been challenging other assistive technologies. Owing to their considerably increased performance and the advent of affordable technological solutions, BCI technology is expected to trigger a paradigm shift not only in assistive technology but also in the way we will interface with technology. However, the flipside of the quest for accuracy and speed is most evident in EEG-based visual BCI where it has led to a gamut of increasingly complex classifiers, tailored to the needs of specific stimulation paradigms and use contexts. In this contribution, we argue that spatiotemporal beamforming can serve several synchronous visual BCI paradigms. We demonstrate this for three popular visual paradigms even without attempting to optimizing their electrode sets. For each selectable target, a spatiotemporal beamformer is applied to assess whether the corresponding signal-of-interest is present in the preprocessed multichannel EEG signals. The target with the highest beamformer output is then selected by the decoder (maximum selection). In addition to this simple selection rule, we also investigated whether interactions between beamformer outputs could be employed to increase accuracy by combining the outputs for all targets into a feature vector and applying three common classification algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of spatiotemporal beamforming with maximum selection is at par with that of the classification algorithms and interactions between beamformer outputs do not further improve that accuracy.

We compared processing of salient stimuli (subject's own names [SONS] and angry voice [AV] stimuli) to processing of unfamiliar names (UNs) and neutral voice (NV) stimuli across different vigilance stages (i.e. wakefulness as well as sleep stages N1 and N2) by means of event-related oscillatory responses during wakefulness and a subsequent afternoon nap. Our findings suggest that emotional prosody and self-relevance drew more attentional resources during wakefulness with specifically AV stimuli being processed more strongly. During NI, SONs were more arousing than UNs irrespective of prosody. Moreover, emotional and self-relevant stimuli evoked stronger responses also during N2 sleep suggesting a 'sentinel processing mode' of the brain during this state of naturally occurring unconsciousness. Finally, this initial preferential processing of salient stimuli during N2 sleep seems to be followed by an inhibitory sleep-protecting process, which is reflected by a K-complex-like response.

Understanding the factors promoting or suppressing IS would increase our comprehension of epilepsy and possibly open new avenues for therapy. Sleep strongly influences epileptic activity, and the modulatory effects of the different sleep stages on IS have been studied for decades. However, several aspects are still disputed, in particular the role of sleep spindles and slow waves in the activation of IS during Non-REM sleep. Here, we correlate the rate of IS with quantitative measures derived from stereo-EEG during one Non-REM cycle in 10 patients suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy due to type 2 focal cortical dysplasia. We show that the IS rate (ISR) is positively correlated with sigma power (a surrogate for sleep-spindle density) but negatively correlated with delta power (surrogate for slow wave activity). In addition, we present two new indices for quantifying the spatial and temporal instability of sleep. We found that both instability indices are correlated with a high ISR. The main contribution of this study is to confirm the suppressive effect of stable deep sleep on IS. This result might influence future guidelines for therapy of patients suffering from epilepsy and sleep disorders.

Kinetic and kinematic factors have been proved to be able to change EEG patterns during motor execution and motor imagery. However, to our knowledge, there is still no literature reporting an effective online MI-BCI using kinetic factor regulated EEG oscillations. This study proposed a novel MI-BCI paradigm in which users can online output multiple commands by imagining clenching their right hand with different force loads. Methods: Eleven subjects participated in this study. During the experiment, they were asked to imagine clenching their right hands with two different force loads (30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and 10% MVC). Multi-Common spatial patterns (Multi-CSPs) and support vector machines (SVMs) were used to build the classifier for recognizing three commands corresponding to high load MI, low load MI and relaxed status respectively. EMG were monitored to avoid voluntary muscle activities during the BCI operation. The event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) method was used to analyse EEG variation during multiple load MI tasks. Results: All subjects were able to drive BCI systems using motor imagery of different force loads in online experiments. We achieved an average online accuracy of 70.9%, with the highest accuracy of 83.3%, which was much higher than the chance level (33%). The event-related desynchronization (ERD) phenomenon during high load tasks was significantly higher than it was during low load tasks both in terms of intensity at electrode positions C3 (p < 0.05) and spatial distribution. Conclusions: This paper demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed MI-BCI paradigm based on multi-force loads on the same limb through online studies. This paradigm could not only enlarge the command set of MI-BCI, but also provide a promising approach to rehabilitate patients with motor disabilities.

J	Milton, A; Pleydell-Pearce, C				Milton, Alex; Pleydell-Pearce, Christopher			Exploring the relationship of phase and peak-frequency EEG alpha-band and beta-band activity to temporal judgments of stimulus duration	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neuronal oscillations; phase; frequency; temporal perception	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTS; VARIABILITY; PERCEPTION; MECHANISM	Pre-stimulus phase has been shown to influence temporal judgments concerning order, causality and simultaneity. One hypothesis is that phase cycles frame discrete perceptual snapshots over time. Yet, existing studies have explored the effect of pre-stimulus phase on fine-grained temporal judgments whereas no study has shown whether pre-stimulus phase influences sub-second temporal judgments lasting several phase cycles. If effects of phase on fine-grained temporal judgments reflect perceptual framing, then the perception of longer intervals might show some dependency on the frequency of phase cycles. Higher frequencies should promote increased temporal resolution and discrimination. We tested the relationship between the phase and frequency of oscillations and temporal judgments for longer durations. Participants judged the relative duration of two successive intervals lasting several phase cycles each. Pre-stimulus alpha-band and beta-band phase was associated with subsequent temporal judgments, although not sensitivity, therein providing evidence that pre-stimulus phase is related to temporal judgments that span a longer time-scale than has been previously demonstrated. Although we report evidence that peak-frequency of the alpha-band is related to one measure of task performance, this study does not provide evidence that higher peak frequencies of alpha- or beta-band activity are related to improved duration discrimination of longer intervals.

Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization hypothesis for mammalian sleep	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Review							ASTROCYTE-DERIVED ADENOSINE; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; NMDA-RECEPTOR; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MICE LACKING; BIOCHEMICAL REGULATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NETWORK MECHANISMS; SLOW OSCILLATION; PHASE SYNDROME	The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep/wake cycles in mammals are elusive. In this regulation, at least two mechanisms with fast and slow time scales are involved. In the faster time scale, a state of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep can be microscopically characterized by the millisecond-to-second-order electrical behavior of neurons, namely slow-wave oscillations described by electrophysiology. In the slower time scale, the total duration of NREM sleep is homeostatically regulated by sleep pressure (the need for sleep), which is usually sustained for hours or even days and can be macroscopically described by electroencephalogram (EEG). The longer dynamics of sleep regulation are often explained by the accumulation of sleep-inducing substances (SISs). However, we still do not have a concrete model to connect fast, microscopic dynamics and slow, macroscopic dynamics. In this review, we introduce a recent Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization hypothesis, in which the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization of cortical-membrane potential induces slow-wave oscillation. Slow dynamics of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway might be regulated by recently identified sleep-promoting kinases as well as classical SISs. Therefore, cortical Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization may be a fundamental mechanism connecting fast neural activity to the slow dynamics of sleep pressure. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Propofol, Sevoflurane, and Ketamine Induce a Reversible Increase in Delta-Gamma and Theta-Gamma Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Frontal Cortex of Rat	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anesthesia; ketamine; phase-amplitude coupling; power spectrum; propofol; sevoflurane	INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION-TRANSFER; EEG CHANGES; FREQUENCY; CONSCIOUSNESS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ANESTHESIA; CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN	Studies from human and non-human species have demonstrated a breakdown of functional corticocortical connectivity during general anesthesia induced by anesthetics with diverse molecular, neurophysiological, and pharmacological profiles. Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in long-range neural communication, and by corollary, functional connectivity, might be influenced by cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between the phase of slow oscillations and the amplitude of local fast oscillations. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between slow oscillations and alpha rhythm during general anesthesia reveal distinct patterns depending on the anesthetic. In this study, we analyzed the effect of three clinically used anesthetics (propofol: n = 6, sevoflurane: n = 10, and ketamine: n = 8) with distinct molecular mechanisms on changes in PAC in the frontal cortex of rat. The loss of righting reflex was used as a surrogate for unconsciousness. PAC was calculated using the modulation index (MI) algorithm between delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-10 Hz), low gamma (25-55 Hz), and high gamma (65-125 Hz) bands. A linear mixed model with fixed effects was used for statistical comparisons between waking, anesthetized, and post-anesthesia recovery epochs. All three anesthetics increased the coupling between delta and low gamma (p < 0.0001) as well as between theta and low gamma (p < 0.0001) oscillations, which returned to baseline waking levels during the post-anesthetic recovery period. In addition, a reversible reduction in high gamma power (p < 0.0001) was a consistent change during anesthesia induced by all three agents. The changes in delta-high gamma and theta-high gamma PAC as well as power spectral changes in delta, theta, and low gamma bandwidths did not show a uniform response across the three anesthetics. These results encourage the study of alternative PAC patterns as drug-invariant markers of general anesthesia in humans.

J	Rufener, KS; Ruhnau, P; Heinze, HJ; Zaehle, T				Rufener, Katharina S.; Ruhnau, Philipp; Heinze, Hans-Jochen; Zaehle, Tino			Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) Shapes the Processing of Rapidly Changing Auditory Information	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS); auditory processing; auditory temporal resolution; stochastic resonance; resonance frequency	STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SPEECH; PERCEPTION; FREQUENCY; PITCH; ENHANCEMENT; WINDOWS; GAMMA; THETA	Neural oscillations in the gamma range are the dominant rhythmic activation pattern in the human auditory cortex. These gamma oscillations are functionally relevant for the processing of rapidly changing acoustic information in both speech and non-speech sounds. Accordingly, there is a tight link between the temporal resolution ability of the auditory system and inherent neural gamma oscillations. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) has been demonstrated to specifically increase gamma oscillation in the human auditory cortex. However, neither the physiological mechanisms of tRNS nor the behavioral consequences of this intervention are completely understood. In the present study we stimulated the human auditory cortex bilaterally with tRNS while EEG was continuously measured. Modulations in the participants' temporal and spectral resolution ability were investigated by means of a gap detection task and a pitch discrimination task. Compared to sham, auditory tRNS increased the detection rate for near-threshold stimuli in the temporal domain only, while no such effect was present for the discrimination of spectral features. Behavioral findings were paralleled by reduced peak latencies of the P50 and N1 component of the auditory event-related potentials (ERP) indicating an impact on early sensory processing. The facilitating effect of tRNS was limited to the processing of near-threshold stimuli while stimuli clearly below and above the individual perception threshold were not affected by tRNS. This non-linear relationship between the signal-to-noise level of the presented stimuli and the effect of stimulation further qualifies stochastic resonance (SR) as the underlying mechanism of tRNS on auditory processing. Our results demonstrate a tRNS related improvement in acoustic perception of time critical auditory information and, thus, provide further indices that auditory tRNS can amplify the resonance frequency of the auditory system.

Methods: The seizure prediction system was developed based on the extraction of correlation dimension, correlation entropy, noise level, Lempel-Ziv complexity, largest Lyapunov exponent, and nonlinear interdependence from segments of intracranial EEG. Results: Our results showed an average sensitivity of 86.7% and 92.9%, an average false prediction rate of 0.126 and 0.096/h, and an average minimum prediction time of 14.3 and 33.3 min, respectively, using seizure occurrence periods of 30 and 50 min and a seizure prediction horizon of 10 s. Two-third of the analyzed seizures showed significantly increased complexity in periods prior to the seizures in comparison with baseline. In four patients, strong bidirectional connectivities between epileptic contacts and the surrounding areas were observed. However, in five patients, unidirectional functional connectivities in preictal periods were observed from remote areas to epileptogenic zones. Conclusions: Overall, preictal periods in patients with focal hippocampal epilepsy were characterized with patient-specific changes in univariate and bivariate nonlinear measures. Significance: The spatio-temporal characterization of preictal periods may help to better understand the mechanism underlying seizure generation in patients with focal hippocampal epilepsy.

Diminished modulation of preparatory sensorimotor mu rhythm predicts attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder severity	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Alpha activity; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; inhibition; magnetoencephalography; mu rhythm	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; ADULT ADHD; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BASAL GANGLIA; ALPHA; EEG; MOVEMENT; PREVALENCE; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Background. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by problems in regulating attention and in suppressing disruptive motor activity, i.e. hyperactivity and impulsivity. We recently found evidence that aberrant distribution of posterior band oscillations (8-12 Hz) is associated with attentional problems in ADHD. The sensorimotor cortex also produces strong 8-12 Hz band oscillations, namely the rhythm, and is thought to have a similar inhibitory function. Here, we now investigate whether problems in distributing band oscillations in ADHD generalize to the rhythm in the sensorimotor domain. Method. In a group of adult ADHD (n = 17) and healthy control subjects (n = 18; aged 21-40 years) oscillatory brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography during a visuo-spatial attention task. Subjects had to anticipate a target with unpredictable timing and respond by pressing a button. Results. Preparing a motor response, the ADHD group failed to increase hemispheric lateralization with relatively higher power in sensorimotor regions not engaged in the task, as the controls did (F-1,F-33 = 8.70, p = 0.006). Moreover, the ADHD group pre-response lateralization not only correlated positively with accuracy (r(s) = 0.64, p = 0.0052) and negatively with intra-individual reaction time variability (r(s) = -0.52, p = 0.033), but it also correlated negatively with the score on an ADHD rating scale (r(s) = -0.53, p = 0.028). Conclusions. We suggest that ADHD is associated with an inability to sufficiently inhibit task-irrelevant sensorimotor areas by means of modulating oscillatory activity. This could explain disruptive motor activity in ADHD. These results provide further evidence that impaired modulation of band oscillations is involved in the pathogenesis of ADHD.

Neurophysiological evidence of a feedforward model of the action and its outcome has been associated with attenuation of the N1 wave of auditory evoked responses elicited by self-generated sounds, such as talking and singing or playing a musical instrument. Moreover, neural oscillations at beta-band frequencies have been related to predicting the sound outcome after action initiation. We hypothesized that a newly learned actionperception association would immediately modify interpretation of the sound during subsequent listening. Nineteen healthy young adults (7 female, 12 male) participated in three magnetoencephalographic recordings while first passively listening to recorded sounds of a bell ringing, then actively striking the bell with a mallet, and then again listening to recorded sounds. Auditory cortex activity showed characteristic P1-N1-P2 waves. The N1 was attenuated during sound making, while P2 responses were unchanged. In contrast, P2 became larger when listening after sound making compared with the initial naive listening. The P2 increase occurred immediately, while in previous learning-by-listening studies P2 increases occurred on a later day. Also, reactivity of beta-band oscillations, as well as theta coherence between auditory and sensorimotor cortices, was stronger in the second listening block. These changes were significantly larger than those observed in control participants (eight female, five male), who triggered recorded sounds by a key press. We propose that P2 characterizes familiarity with sound objects, whereas beta-band oscillation signifies involvement of the action-perception cycle, and both measures objectively indicate functional neuroplasticity in auditory perceptual learning.

But the use of prosthetic limbs and artificial organs are still not commercially available in most of the countries. Recently developed some other brainwave based systems are mostly expensive, immobile or task specific. In order to overcome these problems, analogous to the pen-drive, we have focused on developing a low cost control unit namely "Brain-drive" which transforms ones thoughts into output digital electric signal. Certain thoughts (mental tasks) with hard eye blinking (neural driven physical outcome) develops certain action potential, no matter the eye blinking is visible or not, it creates a significant change in electroencephalogram (EEG) or brain signal. Single channel EEG signal is collected from frontal lobe as it plays a vital role in voluntary movement using a wearable Mindwave Mobile from Neurosky. The EEG data thus recorded is preprocessed to reduce the effect of noise and artifacts and then analyzed in time domain. A grid of cells are displayed on a monitor in front of the subject, which is connected to individual digital output pin onboard an embedded system. To select a cell, a user just needs to look and generate a sustainable eye blink which can easily be identified from the raw value of brainwave. Since eye blinking can be both conscious and involuntary, automatic periodic eye blink of very low frequency oscillation is removed to avoid unwanted selection of command. Unlike webcam based eye blink detector, Brain-Drive captures the signal for blink rather than the visual output of blinking. The system can be trained for person specific customized performance, considering special needs of a disabled or handicapped people who cannot communicate with the outside world using voice, motion or other methods. With the help of cognitive command, the 'Brain-Drive' can be used to control wheelchair, home appliances and even industrial machines.

Methods: An EEG paradigm was used, in which intact and scrambled faces were displayed on a screen. First, time-frequency transforms were conducted on the patients' data alone. These oscillations were then compared to the frontal activity of six control participants. Results: Post stimulus oscillatory modulations (synchronisation in theta and alpha frequency bands) of both intact and scrambled faces at frontal scalp sites were observed in TN. These modulations were different for correct and incorrect responses. A more important increase in the theta band for incorrect responses was observed. The oscillatory rhythms highlighted in blindsight and in frontal regions differ from the ones observed in control participants. Conclusion: Despite the destruction of the visual cortex, oscillatory rhythms are not cancelled out but are shifted to anterior regions, revealing the activity of an alternate pathway for residual visual function. Significance: The results provide evidence for a top-down cognitive control process in blindsight. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

One challenge is the limited knowledge on what would be effective neuronal targets for an intervention, combined with limited knowledge on the neuronal mechanisms of NIBS. Motivated on the one hand by recent evidence that oscillatory activities in neural systems play a role in orchestrating brain functions and dysfunctions, in particular those of neurological disorders specific of elderly patients, and on the other hand that NIBS techniques may be used to interact with these brain oscillations in a controlled way, we here explore the potential of modulating brain oscillations as an effective strategy for clinical NIBS interventions. We first review the evidence for abnormal oscillatory profiles to be associated with a range of neurological disorders of elderly (e.g., Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, epilepsy), and for these signals of abnormal network activity to normalize with treatment, and/or to be predictive of disease progression or recovery. We then ask the question to what extent existing NIBS protocols have been tailored to interact with these oscillations and possibly associated dysfunctions. Our review shows that, despite evidence for both reliable neurophysiological markers of specific oscillatory dis-functionalities in neurological disorders and NIBS protocols potentially able to interact with them, there are few applications of NIBS aiming to explore clinical outcomes of this interaction. Our review article aims to point out oscillatory markers of neurological, which are also suitable targets for modification by NIBS, in order to facilitate in future studies the matching of technical application to clinical targets.

Use of phase-locking value in sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interface: zero-phase coupling and effects of spatial filters	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Phase-locking value (PLV); Spatial filters; Zero phase	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; EVENT-RELATED COHERENCE; VOLUME CONDUCTION; EEG; COMMUNICATION; AMPLITUDE; ELECTRODE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONY	Phase-locking value (PLV) is a potentially useful feature in sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interface (BCI). However, volume conduction may cause spurious zero-phase coupling between two EEG signals and it is not clear whether PLV effects are independent of spectral amplitude. Volume conduction might be reduced by spatial filtering, but it is uncertain what impact this might have on PLV. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore whether zero-phase PLV is meaningful and how it is affected by spatial filtering. Both amplitude and PLV feature were extracted in the frequency band of 10-15 Hz by classical methods using archival EEG data of 18 subjects trained on a two-target BCI task. The results show that with right ear-referenced data, there is meaningful long-range zero-phase synchronization likely involving the primary motor area and the supplementary motor area that cannot be explained by volume conduction. Another novel finding is that the large Laplacian spatial filter enhances the amplitude feature but eliminates most of the phase information seen in ear-referenced data. A bipolar channel using phase-coupled areas also includes both phase and amplitude information and has a significant practical advantage since fewer channels required.

Based on a motor learning theoretical context and on the failure of neuroelectric brain-computer interface (BCI) communication attempts in CLIS, we here report BCI communication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and an implicit attentional processing procedure. Four patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-two of them in permanent CLIS and two entering the CLIS with-out reliable means of communication - learned to answer personal questions with known answers and open questions all requiring a "yes"or "no" thought using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fNIRS. Three patients completed more than 46 sessions spread over several weeks, and one patient (patient W) completed 20 sessions. Online fNIRS classification of personal questions with known answers and open questions using linear support vector machine (SVM) resulted in an above-chance-level correct response rate over 70%. Electroencephalographic oscillations and electrooculographic signals did not exceed the chance-level threshold for correct communication despite occasional differences between the physiological signals representing a "yes" or "no" response. However, electro-encephalogram (EEG) changes in the theta-frequency band correlated with inferior communication performance, probably because of decreased vigilance and attention. If replicated with ALS patients in CLIS, these positive results could indicate the first step towards abolition of complete locked-in states, at least for ALS.

Slow wave sleep (SWS), the deepest sleep stage hallmarked by electroencephalographic slow oscillations (SOs), appears of particular relevance here. SWS is associated with a unique endocrine milieu comprising minimum cortisol and high aldosterone, growth hormone (GH), and prolactin levels, thereby presumably fostering efficient adaptive immune responses. Yet, whether SWS causes these changes is unclear. Here we enhance SOs in men by auditory closed-loop stimulation, i.e., by delivering tones in synchrony with endogenous SOs. Stimulation intensifies the hormonal milieu characterizing SWS (mainly by further reducing cortisol and increasing aldosterone levels) and reduces T and B cell counts, likely reflecting a redistribution of these cells to lymphoid tissues.

In conclusion, closed-loop stimulation of SOs is an easy-to-use tool for probing SWS functions, and might also bear the potential to ameliorate conditions like depression and aging, where disturbed sleep coalesces with specific hormonal and immunological dysregulations.

The abnormal interactions between large-scale functional brain networks result in cognitive and perceptual deficits. The present study investigated event-related functional connectivity networks to compare facial processing in individuals with and without schizophrenia. Faces and tables were presented to participants, and event-related phase synchrony, represented by the phase lag index (PLI), was calculated. In addition, cortical oscillatory dynamics may be useful for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the disparate cognitive and functional impairments in schizophrenic patients. Therefore, the dynamic graph theoretical networks related to facial processing were compared between individuals with and without schizophrenia. Our results showed that event-related phase synchrony was significantly reduced in distributed networks, and normalized clustering coefficients were significantly increased in schizophrenic patients relative to those of the controls. The present data suggest that schizophrenic patients have specific alterations, indicated by increased local connectivity in gamma oscillations during facial processing.

Training of support afferentation in postmenopausal women	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Stabilometry; Alpha-EEG; Frontal EMG; Sitting; Standing; Forefoot plantar sensitivity training	EEG-ALPHA RHYTHMS; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; POSTURAL STABILITY; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; BALANCE; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; GAIT; RISK	We have recently shown a diminishing of the Menopause Index in old-aged women who underwent special training directed at the enhancement of support afferentation by increasing the plantar forefoot sensitivity (Bazanova et al., 2015). Based on these results we hypothesized, that purposeful training of support afferentation through stimulation of plantar graviceptors by Aikido practice will decrease excessive postural and psychoemotional tension not only in rest condition, but during cognitive and manual task performance too. Fluency of cognitive and motor task performance, EEG alpha power as an index of neuronal efficiency of cognitive control, amount of alpha power suppression as a visual activation measure and EMG power of forehead muscles as a sign of psychoemotional tension were compared in three groups of post-menopausal women: i) 8 years training with forefeet support afferentation with Aikido practice (A), ii) 8 years fitness training (F) and iii) no dedicated fitness training for past 8 years (N). Simultaneous stabilometry, EEG, and frontal EMG recording were performed in sitting and standing up position in eyes closed and eyes open condition. Recording done at rest and while performing cognitive and finger motor tasks. We compared studied parameters between groups with one- and two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, followed by post hoc two-tailed unpaired t-tests. The fluency of tasks performance, EMG and alpha-EEG-activity displayed similar values in all groups in a sitting position. Center of pressure (CoP) sway length, velocity and energy demands for saving balance increased when standing up, more in group N than in groups F and A (all contrasts p values < 0.002, eta(2) > 0.89). Post hoc t-tests showed increased fluency in standing in both Aikido (p < 0.01) and Fitness (p < 0.05) subjects in relation to untrained subjects. Increasing fluency in motor task performance was in parallel with enhancing the EEG alpha-2-power and decreasing EMG power only in A group (eta(2) > 0.77). Fluency in motor task and alpha EEG power decreased, but frontal EMG power increased in response to standing in untrained women (group N) and did not change in F group. Post hoc t-tests showed that EEG amount of alpha-2 power suppression in response to visual activation and frontal EMG power was lower in A than F and N groups (p < 0.004) during motor task performance in the standing position. These results were interpreted as showing that training of forefoot plantar surface sensitivity in postmenopausal women decreases levels of psychoemotional tension and increases cognitive control caused by the psychomotor and postural challenges. Thus, Aikido training aimed at learning coordination between manual task performance and balance control by increasing the plantar support zones sensation decreases the cost of maintained vertical position and dependence of motor coordination on visual contribution.

Bidirectional Frontoparietal Oscillatory Systems Support Working Memory	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN; EEG; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; LESION	The ability to represent and select information in working memory provides the neurobiological infrastructure for human cognition. For 80 years, dominant views of working memory have focused on the key role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) [1-8]. However, more recent work has implicated posterior cortical regions [9-12], suggesting that PFC engagement during working memory is dependent on the degree of executive demand. We provide evidence from neurological patients with discrete PFC damage that challenges the dominant models attributing working memory to PFC-dependent systems. We show that neural oscillations, which provide a mechanism for PFC to communicate with posterior cortical regions [13], independently subserve communications both to and from PFC-uncovering parallel oscillatory mechanisms for working memory. Fourteen PFC patients and 20 healthy, age-matched controls performed a working memory task where they encoded, maintained, and actively processed information about pairs of common shapes. In controls, the electroencephalogram( EEG) exhibited oscillatory activity in the low-theta range over PFC and directional connectivity from PFC to parieto-occipital regions commensurate with executive processing demands. Concurrent alpha-beta oscillations were observed over parieto-occipital regions, with directional connectivity from parieto-occipital regions to PFC, regardless of processing demands. Accuracy, PFC low-theta activity, and PFC / parieto-occipital connectivity were attenuated in patients, revealing a PFC-independent, alpha-beta system. The PFC patients still demonstrated task proficiency, which indicates that the posterior alpha-beta system provides sufficient resources for workingmemory. Taken together, our findings reveal neurologically dissociable PFC and parieto-occipital systems and suggest that parallel, bidirectional oscillatory systems form the basis of working memory.

We compared eyes-open and closed group oscillatory envelope activity in networks obtained through temporal independent component analysis, and calculated whole-brain node-based amplitude and phase connectivity.& para;& para;Results: In bilateral parietotemporal areas, oscillatory envelope amplitude increased with healthy ageing, whereas both local amplitude and node-to-global connectivity decreased with AD. AD-related decreases were spatially specific and restricted to the alpha and beta bands. A significant proportion of the variance in areas of peak group difference was explained by cognitive integrity, in addition to group. None of the groups differed in phase connectivity. Results were highly similar for eyes-open and closed resting-state.& para;& para;Conclusions: These results support the disconnection syndrome hypothesis and suggest that AD shows distinct and unique patterns of disrupted neural functioning, rather than accelerated healthy ageing.& para;& para;Significance: Whole-brain assessments show that disrupted regional oscillatory envelope amplitude and connectivity in the alpha and beta bands play a key role in AD.

A growing body of evidence suggests that rhythmic neural activity in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz) tracks the spatial locus of covert attention, which suggests that alpha activity is integral to spatial attention. However, extant work has not provided a compelling test of another key prediction: that alpha activity tracks the temporal dynamics of covert spatial orienting. In the current study, we examined the time course of spatially specific alpha activity after central cues and during visual search. Critically, the time course of this activity tracked trial-by-trial variations in orienting latency during visual search. These findings provide important new evidence for the link between rhythmic brain activity and covert spatial attention, and they highlight a powerful approach for tracking the spatial and temporal dynamics of this core cognitive process.

Electrophysiological signatures of phonological and semantic maintenance in sentence repetition	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Language; Short-term memory; Working memory; Beta oscillations; Theta oscillations	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORD LISTS; LANGUAGE; THETA; EEG; ALPHA	Verbal short-term memory comprises resources for phonological rehearsal, which have been characterized anatomically, and for maintenance of semantic information, which are less understood. Sentence repetition tasks tap both processes interactively. To distinguish brain activity involved in phonological vs. semantic maintenance, we recorded magnetoencephalography during a sentence repetition task, incorporating three manipulations emphasizing one mechanism over the other. Participants heard sentences or word lists and attempted to repeat them verbatim after a 5-second delay. After MEG, participants completed a cued recall task testing how much they remembered of each sentence. Greater semantic engagement relative to phonological rehearsal was hypothesized for 1) sentences vs. word lists, 2) concrete vs. abstract sentences, and 3) well recalled vs. poorly recalled sentences. During auditory perception and the memory delay period, we found highly left-lateralized activation in the form of 8-30 Hz event-related desynchronization. Compared to abstract sentences, concrete sentences recruited posterior temporal cortex bilaterally, demonstrating a neural signature for the engagement of visual imagery in sentence maintenance. Maintenance of arbitrary word lists recruited right hemisphere dorsal regions, reflecting increased demands on phonological rehearsal. Sentences that were ultimately poorly recalled in the post-test also elicited extra right hemisphere activation when they were held in short-term memory, suggesting increased demands on phonological resources. Frontal midline theta oscillations also reflected phonological rather than semantic demand, being increased for word lists and poorly recalled sentences. These findings highlight distinct neural resources for phonological and semantic maintenance, with phonological maintenance associated with stronger oscillatory modulations.

Phase-coherence classification: A new wavelet-based method to separate local field potentials into local (in)coherent and volume-conducted components	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Wavelet analysis; Coherence; Volume conduction; Local field potential; Parkinson's disease; Phase coupling	HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; MOVEMENT-RELATED CHANGES; HIGH-FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; BRAIN; MODULATION	Background: Local field potentials (LFP) reflect the integrated electrophysiological activity of large neuron populations and may thus reflect the dynamics of spatially and functionally different networks. New method: We introduce the wavelet-based phase-coherence classification (PCC), which separates LFP into volume-conducted, local incoherent and local coherent components. It allows to compute power spectral densities for each component associated with local or remote electrophysiological activity. Results: We use synthetic time series to estimate optimal parameters for the application to LFP from within the subthalamic nucleus of eight Parkinson patients. With PCC we identify multiple local tremor clusters and quantify the relative power of local and volume-conducted components. We analyze the electrophysiological response to an apomorphine injection during rest and hold. Here we show medication-induced significant decrease of incoherent activity in the low beta band and increase of coherent activity in the high beta band. On medication significant movement-induced changes occur in the high beta band of the local coherent signal. It increases during isometric hold tasks and decreases during phasic wrist movement. Comparison with existing methods: The power spectra of local PCC components is compared to bipolar recordings. In contrast to bipolar recordings PCC can distinguish local incoherent and coherent signals. We further compare our results with classification based on the imaginary part of coherency and the weighted phase lag index. Conclusions: The low and high beta band are more susceptible to medication- and movement-related changes reflected by incoherent and local coherent activity, respectively. PCC components may thus reflect functionally different networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Segments of ECG signals are fed into dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to generate frequency sub-bands. Three statistical moment parameters are then developed from the DT-CWT outputs. The suitability of these statistical moments in distinguishing normal and apneic ECG signals is investigated through extensive analyses. The overall algorithmic detection accuracy of the scheme is determined for various machine learning classifiers. Sleep apnea classification is done using logistic boosting (LogitBoost). Until now this is for the first time LogitBoost has been implemented for automated sleep apnea detection. We also performed cross validation for classification model evaluation and optimal parameter selection. Results suggest that the detection accuracy of the apnea screening scheme presented in this work is comparable to extant sleep apnea screening systems of the literature. It can be anticipated that upon its implementation, the detection scheme proposed in this work will take us one step closer to sleep apnea monitoring device implementation and eradicate the onus of the physicians.

In this pilot study, we aimed to determine whether pre-treatment sleep spindle density predicts treatment response to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. Methods: Twenty-four participants with chronic primary insomnia participated in a 6-week cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia performed in groups of 4-6 participants. Treatment response was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index measured at pre- and post-treatment, and at 3- and 12-months' follow-up assessments. Secondary outcome measures were extracted from sleep diaries over 7 days and overnight polysomnography, obtained at pre- and post-treatment. Spindle density during stage N2-N3 sleep was extracted from polysomnography at pre-treatment. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis assessed whether sleep spindle density predicted response to cognitive-behavioral therapy. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, and education level, lower spindle density at pre-treatment predicted poorer response over the 12-month follow-up, as reflected by a smaller reduction in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index over time. Reduced spindle density also predicted lower improvements in sleep diary sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset immediately after treatment. There were no significant associations between spindle density and changes in the Insomnia Severity Index or polysomnography variables over time. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that inter-individual differences in sleep spindle density in insomnia may represent an endogenous biomarker predicting responsiveness to cognitive-behavioral therapy. Insomnia with altered spindle activity might constitute an insomnia subtype characterized by a neurophysiological vulnerability to sleep disruption associated with impaired responsiveness to cognitive-behavioral therapy.

This activity can be measured through the analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and is particularly interesting for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. The most common approach for classification consists of analyzing the signal during the course of the motor task within a frequency range including the alpha band, which attempts to detect the Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) characteristics of the physiological phenomenon. However, to discriminate right-hand KMI and left-hand KMI, this scheme can lead to poor results on subjects for which the lateralization is not significant enough. To solve this problem, we propose that the signal be analyzed at the end of the motor imagery within a higher frequency range, which contains the EventRelated Synchronization (ERS). This study found that 6 out of 15 subjects have a higher classification rate after the KMI than during the KMI, due to a higher lateralization during this period. Thus, for this population we can obtain a significant improvement of 13% in classification taking into account the users lateralization profile.

The role of high-frequency oscillations in epilepsy surgery planning	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						*Decision Making; Electroencephalography [*methods]; Epilepsy [*surgery]; Seizures [surgery]; Treatment Outcome; Humans	HUMAN TEMPORAL-LOBE; INTERICTAL FAST RIPPLES; SEIZURE-ONSET ZONE; INTRACRANIAL EEG; UNPROVOKED SEIZURES; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; EPILEPTOGENIC ZONE; RESECTION; NETWORK	Background Epilepsy is a serious brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Approximately two-thirds of seizures can be controlled with antiepileptic medications (Kwan 2000). For some of the others, surgery can completely eliminate or significantly reduce the occurrence of disabling seizures. Localization of epileptogenic areas for resective surgery is far from perfect, and new tools are being investigated to more accurately localize the epileptogenic zone (the zone of the brain where the seizures begin) and improve the likelihood of freedom from postsurgical seizures. Recordings of pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may be one such tool. Objectives To assess the ability of HFOs to improve the outcomes of epilepsy surgery by helping to identify more accurately the epileptogenic areas of the brain. Search methods For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (25 July 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 25 July 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 25 July 2016), CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost, 25 July 2016), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, 25 July 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (25 July 2016), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (25 July 2016). Selection criteria We included studies that provided information on the outcomes of epilepsy surgery for at least six months and which used high-frequency oscillations in making decisions about epilepsy surgery. Data collection and analysis The primary outcome of the review was the Engel Class Outcome System (class I = no disabling seizures, II = rare disabling seizures, III = worthwhile improvement, IV = no worthwhile improvement). Secondary outcomes were responder rate, International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) epilepsy surgery outcome, frequency of adverse events from any source and quality of life outcomes. We intended to analyse outcomes via an aggregated data fixed-effect model meta-analysis. Main results Two studies representing 11 participants met the inclusion criteria. Both studies were small non-randomised trials, with no control group and no blinding. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. The combination of these two studies resulted in 11 participants who prospectively used ictal HFOs for epilepsy surgery decision making. Results of the postsurgical seizure freedom Engel class I to IV outcome were determined over a period of 12 to 38 months (average 23.4 months) and indicated that six participants had an Engel class I outcome (seizure freedom), two had class II (rare disabling seizures), three had class III (worthwhile improvement). No adverse effects were reported. Neither study compared surgical results guided by HFOs versus surgical results guided without HFOs. Authors' conclusions No reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of using HFOs in epilepsy surgery decision making at present.

However, in those patients, sensory functions such as proprioception are at least partly preserved. The aim of this study was to investigate whether afferent feedback interferes with the BCI-based detection of efferent motor commands during execution of movements. Methods: Brain activity of 13 able-bodied subjects (age: 29.1 +/- 4.8 years; 11 males) was compared between a motor task (MT) consisting of an isometric, isotonic grip and a somatosensory electrical stimulation (SS) of the fingertips. Modulation of the mu rhythm (8-13 Hz) was investigated to identify changes specifically related to the generation of efferent commands. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to investigate the activation pattern on a single-trial basis. Classifiers were trained with MT vs. REST (periods without MT/SS) and tested with SS and vice versa to quantify the impact of afferent feedback on the classification results. Results: Few differences in the spatial pattern between MT and SS were found in the modulation of the mu rhythm. All were characterized by event-related desynchronization (ERD) peaks at electrodes C3, C4, and CP3. Execution of the MT was associated with a significantly stronger ERD in the majority of sensorimotor electrodes [C3 (p < 0.01); CP3 (p < 0.05); C4 (p < 0.01)]. Classification accuracy of MT vs. REST was significantly higher than SS vs. REST (77% and 63%; p < 10 8). Classifiers trained on MT vs. REST were able to classify SS trials significantly above chance even though no motor commands were present during SS. Classifiers trained on SS performed better in classifying MT instead of SS. Conclusion: Our results challenge the notion that the modulation of the mu rhythm is a robust phenomenon for detecting efferent commands when afferent feedback is present. Instead, they indicate that the mu ERD caused by the processing of afferent feedback generates ERD patterns in the sensorimotor cortex that are masking the ERD patterns caused by the generation of efferent commands. Thus, processing of afferent feedback represents a considerable source of false positives when the mu rhythm is used for the detection of efferent commands.

However, traditional frequency -coded SSVEP BCIs require the user to gaze directly at the selected flicker stimulus, which is liable to cause fatigue or even photic epileptic seizures. The spatially coded SSVEP BCI we present in this article addresses this issue. It uses a single flicker stimulus that appears always in the extrafoveal field of view, yet it allows the user to control four control channels. We demonstrate the embedding of this novel SSVEP stimulation paradigm in the user interface of an online BCI for navigating a 2-dimensional computer game. Offline analysis of the training data reveals an average classification accuracy of 96.9 +/- 1.64%, corresponding to an information transfer rate of 30.1 1.8 bits/min. In online mode, the average classification accuracy reached 87.9 +/- 11.4%, which resulted in an ITR of 23.8 +/- 6.75 bits/min. We did not observe a strong relation between a subject's offline and online performance. Analysis of the online performance over time shows that users can reliably control the new BCI paradigm with stable performance over at least 30 minutes of continuous operation.

Likewise, specific brain regions are deeply involved in vagally-mediated emotional processing and regulation. Nevertheless, although the brain-heart interplay has been studied during visual emotion elicitation, directional interactions have not been investigated so far. To fill this gap, in this study we investigate brain-heart dynamics during emotional elicitation in healthy subjects through measures of Granger causality (GC) between the two physiological systems. Data were gathered from 22 healthy volunteers who underwent pleasant/unpleasant affective elicitation using pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Neutral emotional stimuli were elicited as well. High density electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were processed to obtain time-varying maps of cortical activation, whereas the associated instantaneous cardiovascular dynamics was estimated through inhomogeneous point-process models. Concerning the information transfer brain-to-heart, GE highlighted significant valence-dependent lateralization with respect to resting states. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, the study of heart-to-brain dynamics considering EEG oscillations in the gamma band (30-45 Hz) highlighted differential information transfer between neutral and positive elicitations directed to the prefrontal cortex.

Phase Synchronization Analysis of Natural Wake and Sleep States in Healthy Individuals Using a Novel Ensemble Phase Synchronization Measure	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Multichannel phase synchronization; EEG; Delta; Theta; Alpha; Beta; Sleep; Wake	OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE; CORTEX	Purpose: Electrical activity in the brain is presumed to arise from a combination of tonic asynchronous neuronal firing during wake and a synchronized, burst-pause firing of large number of neurons during sleep. This study aims to compare the phase synchronization index (SI) across multiple channels during wake and various sleep stages on scalp electroencephalographic recordings. Methods: Forty healthy subjects were subjected to overnight polysomnography using 8-channel electroencephalography. Electroencephalographic phase synchronization during awake, non-rapid eye movement (N1, N2, N3), and rapid eye movement sleep states was studied using ensemble measure (multichannel measure across all the eight channels based on Hilbert transformation between any two pairs). Results: With the progression of states of wakefulness to nonrapid eye movement sleep, there was progressive increase in phase SI in delta band while SI decreased in alpha band (P < 0.001). The SI in delta band during rapid eye movement was comparable with that of awake state P < 0.001). In theta band, SI tends to decrease in N2 and increase in N3 P < 0.001). In beta band, there was progressive increase in SI from awake to non-rapid eye movement stages that decreased in rapid eye movement stage P < 0.001). Conclusions: This is the first study that has used an ensemble measure to assess the long-range cortical phase synchronization during awake and various sleep stages. The findings support the previous view of increased delta synchrony during non-rapid eye movement sleep and alpha synchrony during wakefulness. Rapid eye movement stage was characterized by marked desynchrony in all frequency bands. These findings suggest the possible role of cortical synchronization in influencing the occurrence of epileptic activity during sleep and awake states.

Acute dosing of vortioxetine strengthens event-related brain activity associated with engagement of attention and cognitive functioning in rats	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Vortioxetine; Rat; Electrophysiology; P300 event-related potential; Neuronal oscillation; Phase-locking factor	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; MULTIMODAL ANTIDEPRESSANT VORTIOXETINE; AUDITORY CHANGE-DETECTION; GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; LU AA21004; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; 5-HT DEPLETION; PHASE-LOCKING; DOUBLE-BLIND	Studies of the antidepressant vortioxetine have demonstrated beneficial effects on cognitive dysfunction associated with depression. To elucidate how vortioxetine modulates neuronal activity during cognitive processing we investigated the effects of vortioxetine (3 and 10 mg/kg) in rats performing an auditory oddball (deviant target) task. We investigated neuronal activity in target vs non-target tone responses in vehicle-treated animals using electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Furthermore, we characterized task performance and EEG changes in target tone responses of vortioxetine vs controls. Quantification of event-related potentials (ERPs) was supplemented by analyses of spectral power and inter-trial phase-locking. The assessed brain regions included prelimbic cortex, the hippocampus, and thalamus. As compared to correct rejection of non-target tones, correct target tone responses elicited increased EEG power in all regions. Additionally, neuronal synchronization was increased in vehicle treated rats during both early and late ERP responses to target tones. This indicates a significant consistency of local phases across trials during high attentional load. During early sensory processing, vortioxetine increased both thalamic and frontal synchronized gamma band activity and EEG power in all brain regions measured. Finally, vortioxetine increased the amplitude of late hippocampal P3-like ERPs, the rodent correlate of the human P300 ERP. These findings suggest differential effects of vortioxetine during early sensory registration and late endogenous processing of auditory discrimination. Strengthened P3 like ERP response may relate to the pro-cognitive profile of vortioxetine in rodents. Further investigations are warranted to explore the mechanism by which vortioxetine increases network synchronization during attentive and cognitive processing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A computer simulation and electrophysiological investigation	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Panic disorder; EEG; Gamma coherence; Information processing; Working memory	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION TASK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL MRI; COHERENCE; AGORAPHOBIA; EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Panic disorder (PD) is characterized by repeated and unexpected attacks of intense anxiety, which are not restricted to a determined situation or circumstance. The coherence function has been used to investigate the communication among brain structures through the quantitative EEG (qEEG). The objective of this study is to analyze if there is a difference in frontoparietal gamma coherence (GC) between panic disorder patients (PDP) and healthy controls (HC) during the Visual oddball paradigm; and verify if high levels of anxiety (produced by a computer simulation) affect PDP's working memory. Nine PDP (9 female with average age of 48.8, SD: 11.16) and ten HC (1 male and 9 female with average age of 38.2, SD: 13.69) were enrolled in this study. The subjects performed the visual oddball paradigm simultaneously to the EEG record before and after the presentation of computer simulation (CS). A two-way ANOVA was applied to analyze the factors Group and the Moment for each pair of electrodes separately, and another one to analyze the reaction time variable. We verified a F3-P3 GC increased after the CS movie, demonstrating the left hemisphere participation during the anxiety processing. The greater GC in HC observed in the frontal and parietal areas (P3-Pz, F4-F8 and Fp2-F4) points to the participation of these areas with the expected behavior. The greater GC in PDP for F7-F3 and F4-P4 pairs of electrodes assumes that it produces a prejudicial "noise" during information processing, and can be associated to interference on the communication between frontal and parietal areas. This "noise" during information processing is related to PD symptoms, which should be better known in order to develop effective treatment strategies. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, there has been relatively little research on brain dynamics in prodromal AD. As a consequence, its neural substrates remain unclear. Methods: In the present research, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from patients with dementia due to AD, subjects with MCI due to AD and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed using relative power (RP) in conventional EEG frequency bands and a novel parameter useful to explore the spatio-temporal fluctuations of neural dynamics: the spectral flux (SF). Results: Our results suggest that dementia due to AD is associated with a significant slowing of EEG activity and several significant alterations in spectral fluctuations at low (i.e. theta) and high (i.e. beta and gamma) frequency bands compared to HC (p < 0.05). Furthermore, subjects with MCI due to AD exhibited a specific frequency-dependent pattern of spatio-temporal abnormalities, which can help identify neural mechanisms involved in cognitive impairment preceding AD. Classification analyses using linear discriminant analysis with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure showed that the combination of RP and within-electrode SF at the beta band was useful to obtain a 77.3 % of accuracy to discriminate between HC and AD patients. In the case of comparison between HC and MCI subjects, the classification accuracy reached a value of 79.2 %, combining within-electrode SF at beta and gamma bands. SF has proven to be a useful measure to obtain an original description of brain dynamics at different stages of AD. Conclusion: Consequently, SF may contribute to gain a more comprehensive understanding into neural substrates underlying MCI, as well as to develop potential early AD biomarkers.

Nootropic and Antihypoxic Properties of Novel Derivatives of 1,2-Dihydro-3H-1,4-Benzodiazepin-2-one	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						benzodiazepins; memory; learning; antihypoxic activity; power of the EEG rhythms		Among eight recently synthesized 3-phthalimidoacyloxy- and phthalimidoacyloxyethoxy-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones, three compounds that enhanced the indices of cognitive functions in albino rats by 24-43%, as compared with those in control animals, were found. In the Morris water maze test, these agents used in doses of 10 mg/kg positively influenced the index of long-term memory in contrast to the hormone leptin (10 nM) that enhanced the index of short-term memory but did not influence long-term memory. Pyracetam enhanced the indices of both short-term memory and long-term memory, but only in a much greater dose (400 mg/kg). Injections of the above-mentioned three tested compounds into rats resulted in a decrease in the power of the delta EEG rhythm and also in rises in the powers of theta and (especially) beta oscillations. All eight tested compounds (in doses 10 mg/kg) demonstrated clearly pronounced antihypoxic effects under conditions of acute hypoxia in a closed space test in experiments on mice. Two compounds showed the maximum efficiency; those increased the survival time of mice by 76% and 50%, respectively, as compared with the control. Therefore, the eight tested compounds demonstrate, along with high antihypoxic efficiency, a specific aspect of pharmacological activity somewhat unusual for benzodiazepins; these compounds improve the long-term memory and learning capability and exert specific effects on the EEG characteristics. These compounds are characterized by low toxicity; their LD50 exceeds 550 mg/kg.	[Andronati, S. A.; Karaseva, T. L.; Krivenko, Ya. R.; Pavlovsky, V.

Prestimulus alpha-band power biases visual discrimination confidence, but not accuracy	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article							SPATIAL ATTENTION; RELATIVE BLINDSIGHT; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DECISION; CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; NETWORK; PHASE; VARIABILITY	The magnitude of power in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) prior to the onset of a near threshold visual stimulus predicts performance. Together with other findings, this has been interpreted as evidence that alpha-band dynamics reflect cortical excitability. We reasoned, however, that non-specific changes in excitability would be expected to influence signal and noise in the same way, leaving actual discriminability unchanged. Indeed, using a two-choice orientation discrimination task, we found that discrimination accuracy was unaffected by fluctuations in prestimulus alpha power. Decision confidence, on the other hand, was strongly negatively correlated with prestimulus alpha power. This finding constitutes a clear dissociation between objective and subjective measures of visual perception as a function of prestimulus cortical excitability. This dissociation is predicted by a model where the balance of evidence supporting each choice drives objective performance but only the magnitude of evidence supporting the selected choice drives subjective reports, suggesting that human perceptual confidence can be suboptimal with respect to tracking objective accuracy.

The achievement of multiple instances of control with the same type of mental strategy represents a way to improve flexibility of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Here we test the hypothesis that pure visual motion imagery of an external actuator can be used as a tool to achieve three classes of electroencephalographic (EEG) based control, which might be useful in attention disorders. Approach. We hypothesize that different numbers of imagined motion alternations lead to distinctive signals, as predicted by distinct motion patterns. Accordingly, a distinct number of alternating sensory/perceptual signals would lead to distinct neural responses as previously demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We anticipate that differential modulations should also be observed in the EEG domain. EEG recordings were obtained from twelve participants using three imagery tasks: imagery of a static dot, imagery of a dot with two opposing motions in the vertical axis (two motion directions) and imagery of a dot with four opposing motions in vertical or horizontal axes (four directions). The data were analysed offline. Main results. An increase of alpha-band power was found in frontal and central channels as a result of visual motion imagery tasks when compared with static dot imagery, in contrast with the expected posterior alpha decreases found during simple visual stimulation. The successful classification and discrimination between the three imagery tasks confirmed that three different classes of control based on visual motion imagery can be achieved. The classification approach was based on a support vector machine (SVM) and on the alpha-band relative spectral power of a small group of six frontal and central channels. Patterns of alpha activity, as captured by single-trial SVM closely reflected imagery properties, in particular the number of imagined motion alternations. Significance. We found a new mental task based on visual motion imagery with potential for the implementation of multiclass (3) BCIs. Our results are consistent with the notion that frontal alpha synchronization is related with high internal processing demands, changing with the number of alternation levels during imagery. Together, these findings suggest the feasibility of pure visual motion imagery tasks as a strategy to achieve multiclass control systems with potential for BCI and in particular, neurofeedback applications in non-motor (attentional) disorders.

Behavioral state classification in epileptic brain using intracranial electrophysiology	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						intracranial EEG; behavioral states; sleep staging; machine learning; classification	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; LONG-TERM; SLEEP; EEG; STIMULATION; RECORDINGS; PREDICTION; SPINDLES; INSIGHTS; CORTEX	Objective. Automated behavioral state classification can benefit next generation implantable epilepsy devices. In this study we explored the feasibility of automated awake (AW) and slow wave sleep (SWS) classification using wide bandwidth intracranial EEG (iEEG) in patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Approach. Data from seven patients (age $34\pm 12$ , 4 women) who underwent intracranial depth electrode implantation for iEEG monitoring were included. Spectral power features (0.1600 Hz) spanning several frequency bands from a single electrode were used to train and test a support vector machine classifier. Main results. Classification accuracy of 97.8 +/- 0.3% (normal tissue) and 89.4 +/- 0.8% (epileptic tissue) across seven subjects using multiple spectral power features from a single electrode was achieved. Spectral power features from electrodes placed in normal temporal neocortex were found to be more useful (accuracy 90.8 +/- 0.8%) for sleep-wake state classification than electrodes located in normal hippocampus (87.1 +/- 1.6%). Spectral power in high frequency band features (Ripple (80250 Hz), Fast Ripple (250600 Hz)) showed comparable performance for AW and SWS classification as the best performing Berger bands (Alpha, Beta, low Gamma) with accuracy ?90% using a single electrode contact and single spectral feature. Significance. Automated classification of wake and SWS should prove useful for future implantable epilepsy devices with limited computational power, memory, and number of electrodes. Applications include quantifying patient sleep patterns and behavioral state dependent detection, prediction, and electrical stimulation therapies.

Exploring potential social influences on brain potentials during anticipation of tactile stimulation	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Mu rhythm; Somatosensory anticipation; CNV	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; SOMATOSENSORY ACTIVATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SENSORY CORTEX; VARIATION CNV; EEG; PAIN; TOUCH	This study explored interpersonal influences on electrophysiological responses during the anticipation of tactile stimulation. It is well-known that broad, negative-going potentials are present in the event-related potential (ERP) between a forewarning cue and a tactile stimulus. It has also been shown that the alpha range mu rhythm shows a lateralized desynchronization over central electrode sites during anticipation of tactile stimulation of the hand. The current study used a tactile discrimination task in which a visual cue signaled that an upcoming stimulus would either be delivered 1500 ms later to the participant's hand, to a task partner's hand, or to neither person. For the condition in which participants anticipated the tactile 'stimulation to their own hand, a negative potential (contingent negative variation, CNV) was observed in the ERP at central sites in the 1000 ms prior to the tactile stimulus. Significant mu rhythm desynchronization was also present in the same time window. The magnitudes of the ERPs and of the mu desynchronization were greater in the contralateral than in the ipsilateral hemisphere prior to right hand stimulation. Similar ERP and EEG changes were not present when the visual cue indicated that stimulation would be delivered to the task partner or to neither person. The absence of social influences during anticipation of tactile stimulation, and the relationship between the two brain signatures of anticipatory attention (CNV and mu rhythm) are discussed.

Thirty-eight adolescent participants (mean age of 15.7 +/- 1.5 years) completed easy and hard working memory tasks under low- and high-stress conditions. We analyzed the accuracy and reaction time (RT) of working memory performance and inter- and intrahemispheric electroencephalogram coherences during memory encoding. Working memory accuracy was higher, and RT shorter, in the easy versus the hard task. RT was shorter under the high-stress (TENS) versus low-stress (no-TENS) condition, while there was no difference in memory accuracy between the two stress conditions. For electroencephalogram coherence, we found higher interhemispheric coherence in all bands but only at frontal electrode sites in the easy versus the hard task. On the other hand, intrahemispheric coherence was higher in the left hemisphere in the easy (versus hard task) and higher in the right hemisphere (with one exception) in the hard (versus easy task). Inter- and intracoherences were higher in the low- versus high-stress condition. Significant interactions between task difficulty and stress condition were observed in coherences of the beta frequency band. The difference in coherence between low- and high-stress conditions was greater in the hard compared with the easy task, with lower coherence under the high-stress condition relative to the low-stress condition. Stress seemed to cause a decrease in cortical network communications between memory-relevant cortical areas as task difficulty increased.

EEG-based effective connectivity was computed using phase slope index (PSI) over 171 combinations of 19 electrodes of the EEG signals for six distinct frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta, and gamma). Graph theory approach was applied to characterize patterns of effective connectivity from estimated PSI by determining total in-degree and out-degree flows at nodal regions of interest. The effective connectivity showed that increased interactions exist between anterior-posterior brain regions for higher frequency bands (alpha1, alpha2, beta, and gamma) with concurrent decrease interactions found in lower frequency bands (delta and theta) during learning content with black-and-white visualizations compared to colored visualizations. Further, graph theory analysis using a degree of connectivity demonstrated that significant higher out-degree information flows from right parietal to bilateral frontal areas in the delta; from left frontal to midline parietal and right posterior regions in the alpha1, alpha2 and beta during learning with colored visualizations. While significant higher out-degree information flows from (midline and right) parietal to frontal regions observed in alpha1, alpha2, and beta when learning content with black-and-white visualizations. To conclude, the results indicate that content's color effect on brain's interaction and visual working memory potentially improves learning with top-down processing influences on selective attention and visual information for memory encoding.

A benchmark framework based on realistic simulations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HZ; MACROELECTRODES; EEG	High-frequency oscillations (HFO) have been suggested as biomarkers of epileptic tissues. While visual marking of these short and small oscillations is tedious and time-consuming, automatic HFO detectors have not yet met a large consensus. Even though detectors have been shown to perform well when validated against visual marking, the large number of false detections due to their lack of robustness hinder their clinical application. In this study, we developed a validation framework based on realistic and controlled simulations to quantify precisely the assets and weaknesses of current detectors. We constructed a dictionary of synthesized elements-HFOs and epileptic spikes-from different patients and brain areas by extracting these elements from the original data using discrete wavelet transform coefficients. These elements were then added to their corresponding simulated background activity (preserving patient- and region- specific spectra). We tested five existing detectors against this benchmark. Compared to other studies confronting detectors, we did not only ranked them according their performance but we investigated the reasons leading to these results. Our simulations, thanks to their realism and their variability, enabled us to highlight unreported issues of current detectors: (1) the lack of robust estimation of the background activity, (2) the underestimated impact of the 1/f spectrum, and (3) the inadequate criteria defining an HFO. We believe that our benchmark framework could be a valuable tool to translate HFOs into a clinical environment.

SEPARATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF RHYTHM COMPONENTS OF LOCAL FIELD POTENTIAL SIGNALS IN AWAKE MICE USING ENSEMBLE EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-APPLICATIONS BASIS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Local field potential; Signal decomposition; Power spectral analysis; Intrinsic mode function; Notch filter	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; HILBERT SPECTRUM; EEG; HIPPOCAMPUS; ARTIFACTS; NETWORKS; WHISKING; REMOVAL; CORTEX; WAVES	Decomposition of local field potential (LFP) signals with different oscillatory rhythms is useful for analysis of various neuronal activities in mice. In this paper, we first removed the power-line interference with high signal fidelity by using a notch filter with in finite impulse response. Next, we applied the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method to separate the LFP signal into low-frequency, Delta, Theta, Beta, Gamma, Ripple, and high-frequency oscillations, in the form of different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The LFP signal components with different frequency bands were identified and then reconstructed from the IMFs within the same frequency range by analyzing their power spectral ratios (PSRs). Then, normalized autocorrelation functions of the resting respiratory signal and the reconstructed Delta oscillations were computed to estimate the corresponding power spectral densities by means of the Fourier transform. The results of LFP signal decomposition and oscillatory rhythm reconstruction demonstrated the effectiveness of the EEMD and PSR analysis methods. The coherence analysis results indicate that the primary periodicity peak of the Delta LFP component is de finitely linked to that of resting respiration in an awake mouse. Our major contribution is to establish a novel LFP signal separation and identification procedure by combining the EEMD method with appropriate parameter setting and the power spectral analysis approach.

The primary purpose of this investigation is to identify effective biomarkers of sustained attention and demonstrate adaptive force control tasks can improve attention skill. 128-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data was collected from 14 participants during the haptic training: a five-consecutive-day force control task with one, two, three and four fingers. The EEG recordings were then divided into four-second epochs for analysis. We used tolerance, variance and duration of the forces of involved fingers to design a score (called 'integrated parameter') to measure the performance level of each four-second epoch. Those epochs with a high score (called 'good epochs') and a low score (called 'bad epochs') were selected for comparison. Two different brain connectivity patterns were calculated to classify the good and bad epochs. Discriminative connections were extracted and kernel support vector machine was applied to find relevant frequency bands and brain areas that can effectively separate the two types of epochs. The results showed that enhanced connection strength located at frontal and partial lobes in gamma band and reduced connection strength at frontal-parietal regions in alpha band during good epochs. Furthermore, executive control network showed significant improvement after training. It indicates that force control tasks may not only improve the behavioral performance, but also the sustained attention from different sensory channel.

One use of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in rehabilitation is the detection of movement intention. In this paper we investigate for the first time the instantaneous phase of movement related cortical potential (MRCP) and its application to the detection of gait intention. Approach. We demonstrate the utility of MRCP phase in two independent datasets, in which 10 healthy subjects and 9 chronic stroke patients executed a self-initiated gait task in three sessions. Phase features were compared to more conventional amplitude and power features. Main results. The neurophysiology analysis showed that phase features have higher signal-to-noise ratio than the other features. Also, BCI detectors of gait intention based on phase, amplitude, and their combination were evaluated under three conditions: session-specific calibration, intersession transfer, and intersubject transfer. Results show that the phase based detector is the most accurate for session-specific calibration (movement intention was correctly detected in 66.5% of trials in healthy subjects, and in 63.3% in stroke patients). However, in intersession and intersubject transfer, the detector that combines amplitude and phase features is the most accurate one and the only that retains its accuracy (62.5% in healthy subjects and 59% in stroke patients) w.r.t. session-specific calibration. Significance. MRCP phase features improve the detection of gait intention and could be used in practice to remove time-consuming BCI recalibration.

Blindfolding during wakefulness causes decrease in sleep slow wave activity	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						Humans; slow wave sleep; synaptic plasticity	CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; LOCAL SLEEP; HOMEOSTASIS; EEG; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; MATURATION; DYNAMICS; STANDARD; CHILDREN	Slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4Hz) represents the predominant EEG oscillatory activity during slow wave sleep (SWS). Its amplitude is considered in part a reflection of synaptic potentiation in cortical networks due to encoding of information during prior waking, with higher amplitude indicating stronger potentiation. Previous studies showed that increasing and diminishing specific motor behaviors produced corresponding changes in SWA in the respective motor cortical areas during subsequent SWS. Here, we tested whether this relationship can be generalized to the visual system, that is, whether diminishing encoding of visual information likewise leads to a localized decrease in SWA over the visual cortex. Experiments were performed in healthy men whose eyes on two different days were or were not covered for 10.5 h before bedtime. The subject's EEG was recorded during sleep and, after sleep, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded. SWA during nonrapid eye movement sleep (NonREM sleep) was lower after blindfolding than after eyes open (P < 0.01). The decrease in SWA that was most consistent during the first 20 min of NonREM sleep, did not remain restricted to visual cortex regions, with changes over frontal and parietal cortical regions being even more pronounced. In the morning after sleep, the N75-P100 peak-to-peak-amplitude of the VEP was significantly diminished in the blindfolded condition. Our findings confirm a link between reduced wake encoding and diminished SWA during ensuing NonREM sleep, although this link appears not to be restricted to sensory cortical areas.

Multiple visual objects are sampled sequentially	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							ATTENTION; ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; FEEDFORWARD; MECHANISMS; DEPLOYMENT; FEEDBACK; HZ	When acting in a complex visual environment, it is essential to be able to flexibly allocate attention to parts of the visual scene that may contain goal-relevant information. The paper by Jia et al. provides novel evidence that our brains sequentially sample different objects in a visual scene. The results were obtained using "temporal response functions," in which unique electroencephalographic (EEG) signals corresponding to the processing of 2 continuously presented objects were isolated in an object-specific way. These response functions were dominated by 10-Hz alpha-band activity. Crucially, the different objects were sequentially sampled at a rate of about 2 Hz. These findings provide important neurophysiological insights into how our visual system operates in complex environments.

In the current study, mind wandering was induced through completion of the same task for 5 days, consisting of a 20-min monotonous freeway-driving scenario, a cognitive depletion task, and a repetition of the 20-min driving scenario driven in the reverse direction. Participants were periodically probed with auditory tones to self-report whether they were mind wandering or focused on the driving task. Self-reported mind wandering frequency was high, and did not statistically change over days of participation. For measures of driving performance, participant labeled periods of mind wandering were associated with reduced speed and reduced lane variability, in comparison to periods of on task performance. For measures of electrophysiology, periods of mind wandering were associated with increased power in the alpha band of the electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as a reduction in the magnitude of the P3a component of the event related potential (ERP) in response to the auditory probe. Results support that mind wandering has an impact on driving performance and the associated change in driver's attentional state is detectable in underlying brain physiology. Further, results suggest that detecting the internal cognitive state of humans is possible in a continuous task such as automobile driving. Identifying periods of likely mind wandering could serve as a useful research tool for assessment of driver attention, and could potentially lead to future in-vehicle safety countermeasures.

This study took a step further by investigating brain mechanisms in response to other types of creative behavior, involving more "real-life" creativity demands in the context of emotion regulation and well-being. Specifically, functional patterns of EEG alpha activity were investigated while participants were required to generate as many and as different ways as possible to reappraise presented anger-eliciting situations in a manner that reduces their anger. Cognitive reappraisal involves some of the same cognitive processes as in conventional verbal creativity tasks, inasmuch as it requires an individual to inhibit or disengage from an emotional event, to shift attention between different perspectives, and to flexibly adopt new solutions. To examine whether alpha oscillations during cognitive reappraisal are different from those during conventional creative ideation, the EEG was also assessed during performance of the Alternative Uses task, requiring individuals to generate as many and as original uses of an object as possible. While cognitive reappraisal was associated with a similar pattern of alpha power as observed in conventional verbal creative ideation, the former yielded significantly stronger alpha power increases at prefrontal sites, along with lower alpha increases at more posterior cortical sites, indicating higher cognitive control and less spontaneous imaginative thought processes in the generation of effective strategies to regulate an ongoing negative emotional state.

Comparison of linear spatial filters for identifying oscillatory activity in multichannel data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Neural oscillations; EEG; Spatial filtering; Eigendecomposition; Dimensionality reduction; Data analysis	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; EEG DYNAMICS; MECHANISMS; ERRORS; THETA	Background: Large-scale synchronous neural activity produces electrical fields that can be measured by electrodes outside the head, and volume conduction ensures that neural sources can be measured by many electrodes. However, most data analyses in M/EEG research are univariate, meaning each electrode is considered as a separate measurement. Several multivariate linear spatial filtering techniques have been introduced to the cognitive electrophysiology literature, but these techniques are not commonly used; comparisons across filters would be beneficial to the field. New method: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and compare the performance of several linear spatial filtering techniques, with a focus on those that use generalized eigendecomposition to facilitate dimensionality reduction and signal-to-noise ratio maximization. Results: Simulated and empirical data were used to assess the accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio, and interpretability of the spatial filter results. When the simulated signal is powerful, different spatial filters provide convergent results. However, more subtle signals require carefully selected analysis parameters to obtain optimal results. Comparison with existing methods: Linear spatial filters can be powerful data analysis tools in cognitive electrophysiology, and should be applied more often; on the other hand, spatial filters can latch onto artifacts or produce uninterpretable results. Conclusions: Hypothesis-driven analyses, careful data inspection, and appropriate parameter selection are necessary to obtain high-quality results when using spatial filters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These brain processes collectively known as working memory (WM) are associated with modulations of rhythmic brain activity across multiple brain areas and frequencies. Yet, it is not clear whether and, if so, how-intrinsic resting-state neuronal oscillations are related to individual WM capacities, as measured by standard neuropsychological tests. We addressed this question by probing the correlation between resting-state brain activity, recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG), and verbal and visuo-spatial WM indices obtained from the standardized Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV). To this end, 5-min eyes-open resting-state MEG data were acquired in 28 healthy participants. Source-reconstructed spectral power estimates were then computed in standard frequency bands and their correlation with neuropsychological indices across individuals was assessed using Pearson correlation and cluster-level statistics. We found statistically significant positive correlations between spectral amplitudes measured at rest and standardized scores on both verbal and visuo-spatial WM performance. The correlation clusters primarily involved key medial and dorsolateral components within the parietal and prefrontal regions. In addition, while the correlation in some clusters was frequency selective (e.g., alpha-band oscillations), other areas showed correlations with WM across a wide range of frequencies reflecting a broadband effect. These results provide the first evidence for a positive correlation between neuromagnetic signals measured at rest and WM performance separately assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests. Our results advance our understanding of the link between WM capacities and intrinsic oscillatory dynamics networks. They also suggest that individual differences in baseline spectral power might need to be taken into account when probing differences in brain responses during the execution of WM tasks.

Nevertheless, it is questionable whether these patterns are reliable over time in different measures of interaction and whether this reliability of the measures is the same across different patient populations. In order to address this topic we examined 22 patients with mild cognitive impairment, five patients with subjective cognitive complaints, six patients with right-lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy, seven patients with left lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy, and 20 healthy controls. We calculated 14 measures of interaction from two EEG-recordings separated by 2 weeks. In order to characterize test-retest reliability, we correlated these measures for each group and compared the correlations between measures and between groups. We found that both measures of interaction as well as groups differed from each other in terms of reliability. The strongest correlation coefficients were found for spectrum, coherence, and full frequency directed transfer function (average rho > 0.9). In the delta (2-4 Hz) range, reliability was lower for mild cognitive impairment compared to healthy controls and left lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy. In the beta (13-30 Hz), gamma (3180 Hz), and high gamma (81-125 Hz) frequency ranges we found decreased reliability in subjective cognitive complaints compared to mild cognitive impairment. In the gamma and high gamma range we found increased reliability in left lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy patients compared to healthy controls. Our results emphasize the importance of documenting reliability of measures of interaction, which may vary considerably between measures, but also between patient populations. We suggest that studies claiming clinical usefulness of measures of interaction should provide information on the reliability of the results. In addition, differences between patient groups in reliability of interactions in the EEG indicate the potential of reliability to serve as a new biomarker for pathological memory decline as well as for epilepsy. While the brain concert of information flow is generally variable, high reliability, and thus, low variability may reflect abnormal firing patterns.

It is believed that MI training efficiency could be improved by using the brain-computer interface (BCI) technology providing real-time feedback on person's mental attempts. While BCI is indeed a convenient and motivating tool for practicing MI, it is not clear whether it could be used for predicting or measuring potential positive impact of the training. In this study, we are trying to establish whether the proficiency in BCI control is associated with any of the neurophysiological or psychological correlates of motor imagery, as well as to determine possible interrelations among them. For that purpose, we studied motor imagery in a group of 19 healthy BCI-trained volunteers and performed a correlation analysis across various quantitative assessment metrics. We examined subjects' sensorimotor event-related EEG events, corticospinal excitability changes estimated with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), BCI accuracy and self-assessment reports obtained with specially designed questionnaires and interview routine. Our results showed, expectedly, that BCI performance is dependent on the subject's capability to suppress EEG sensorimotor rhythms, which in turn is correlated with the idle state amplitude of those oscillations. Neither BCI accuracy nor the EEG features associated with MI were found to correlate with the level of corticospinal excitability increase during motor imagery, and with assessed imagery vividness. Finally, a significant correlation was found between the level of corticospinal excitability increase and kinesthetic vividness of imagery (KVIQ-20 questionnaire). Our results suggest that two distinct neurophysiological mechanisms might mediate possible effects of motor imagery: the non-specific cortical sensorimotor disinhibition and the focal corticospinal excitability increase. Acquired data suggests that BCI-based approach is unreliable in assessing motor imagery due to its high dependence on subject's innate EEG features (e.g. resting mu-rhythm amplitude). Therefore, employment of additional assessment protocols, such as TMS and psychological testing, is required for more comprehensive evaluation of the subject's motor imagery training efficiency.

However, only a few studies examined how emotion and attention interact in voice processing. We investigated neutral, happy (laughs) and angry (growls) vocalizations in a modified oddball task. Participants silently counted the targets in each block and rated the valence and arousal of the vocalizations. A combined event-related potential and time-frequency analysis focused on the P3 and pre-stimulus alpha power to capture attention effects in response to unexpected events. Whereas an early differentiation between emotionally salient and neutral vocalizations was reflected in the P3a response, the P3b was selectively enhanced for happy voices. The P3b modulation was predicted by pre-stimulus frontal alpha desynchronization, and by the perceived pleasantness of the targets. These findings indicate that vocal emotions may be differently processed based on task relevance and valence. Increased anticipation and attention to positive vocal cues (laughter) may reflect their high social relevance.

In two experiments similar to the multiple object tracking (MOT) task, we asked observers to monitor continuously one or several targets as they moved unpredictably for a semi-random period. After all objects disappeared, observers were immediately prompted to report the perceived final position of one queried target. Precision of these position reports declined with attentional load, and reports tended to best resemble positions occupied by the queried target between 0 and 30 ms in the past. Measurement of event-related potentials showed a contralateral delay activity over occipital scalp, maximal in the right hemisphere. The peak power-spectral frequency of observers' eyes-closed resting occipital alpha oscillations reliably predicted performance, such that lower-frequency alpha was associated with superior spatial localisation. Slower resting alpha might be associated with a cognitive style that depends less on memory related processing and instead emphasises attention to changing stimuli.

The locus coeruleus and raphe nucleus fire during waking and slow wave sleep, with the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) firing during both waking and REM sleep, the states manifesting arousal-related EEG activity. Two important discoveries in the PPN in the last 10 years are, 1) that some PPN cells are electrically coupled, and 2) every PPN cell manifests high threshold calcium channels that allow them to oscillate at beta/gamma band frequencies. The role of arousal in drug abuse is considered here in terms of the effects of drugs of abuse on these two mechanisms. Drug abuse and the perception of withdrawal/relapse are mediated by neurobiological processes that occur only when we are awake, not when we are asleep. These relationships focus on the potential role of arousal, more specifically of RAS electrical coupling and gamma band activity, in the addictive process as well as the relapse to drug use.

Neuroimaging of Human Balance Control: A Systematic Review	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						static and dynamic balance control; temporal and spatial dynamics of brain activation; mechanical perturbation; sensory degradation; susceptibility to cognitive dual tasks; movement artifacts	DUAL-TASK INTERFERENCE; PREPARATORY CORTICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; STRIDE-TIME VARIABILITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TREADMILL WALKING; POSTURAL CONTROL; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; (DE)SYNCHRONIZATION ERD/ERS; REFLEX RESPONSES	This review examined 83 articles using neuroimaging modalities to investigate the neural correlates underlying static and dynamic human balance control, with aims to support future mobile neuroimaging research in the balance control domain. Furthermore, this review analyzed the mobility of the neuroimaging hardware and research paradigms as well as the analytical methodology to identify and remove movement artifact in the acquired brain signal. We found that the majority of static balance control tasks utilized mechanical perturbations to invoke feet-in-place responses (27 out of 38 studies), while cognitive dual-task conditions were commonly used to challenge balance in dynamic balance control tasks (20 out of 32 studies). While frequency analysis and event related potential characteristics supported enhanced brain activation during static balance control, that in dynamic balance control studies was supported by spatial and frequency analysis. Twenty-three of the 50 studies utilizing EEG utilized independent component analysis to remove movement artifacts from the acquired brain signals. Lastly, only eight studies used truly mobile neuroimaging hardware systems. This review provides evidence to support an increase in brain activation in balance control tasks, regardless of mechanical, cognitive, or sensory challenges. Furthermore, the current body of literature demonstrates the use of advanced signal processing methodologies to analyze brain activity during movement. However, the static nature of neuroimaging hardware and conventional balance control paradigms prevent full mobility and limit our knowledge of neural mechanisms underlying balance control.

Specifically, we examined whether the pattern of motor activation elicited by verbs depends on the larger sentential context. A robust N400 congruence effect confirmed the contextual manipulation of action plausibility, a form of semantic congruency. Importantly, this study showed that: (1) Action verbs elicited more mu power decrease than non-action verbs when sentences described plausible actions. Action verbs thus elicited more motor activation than non-action verbs. (2) In contrast, when sentences described implausible actions, mu activity was present but the difference between the verb types was not observed. The increased processing associated with a larger N400 thus coincided with mu activity in sentences describing implausible actions. Altogether, context-dependent motor activation appears to play a functional role in deriving context-sensitive meaning.	[Lam, Kevin J.

Topological Filtering of Dynamic Functional Brain Networks Unfolds Informative Chronnectomics: A Novel Data-Driven Thresholding Scheme Based on Orthogonal Minimal Spanning Trees (OMSTs)	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; resting state; graph theory; phase locking value; dynamic functional connectivity; minimal spanning tree; topological filtering	SMALL-WORLD; CONNECTIVITY DYNAMICS; STATE; EEG; FREQUENCY; MODELS; ORGANIZATION; HEALTH; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECONFIGURATION	The human brain is a large-scale system of functionally connected brain regions. This system can be modeled as a network, or graph, by dividing the brain into a set of regions, or "nodes," and quantifying the strength of the connections between nodes, or "edges," as the temporal correlation in their patterns of activity. Network analysis, a part of graph theory, provides a set of summary statistics that can be used to describe complex brain networks in a meaningful way. The large-scale organization of the brain has features of complex networks that can be quantified using network measures from graph theory. The adaptation of both bivariate (mutual information) and multivariate (Granger causality) connectivity estimators to quantify the synchronization between multichannel recordings yields a fully connected, weighted, (a)symmetric functional connectivity graph (FCG), representing the associations among all brain areas. The aforementioned procedure leads to an extremely dense network of tens up to a few hundreds of weights. Therefore, this FCG must be filtered out so that the "true" connectivity pattern can emerge. Here, we compared a large number of well-known topological thresholding techniques with the novel proposed data-driven scheme based on orthogonal minimal spanning trees (OMSTs). OMSTs filter brain connectivity networks based on the optimization between the global efficiency of the network and the cost preserving its wiring. We demonstrated the proposed method in a large EEG database (N = 101 subjects) with eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) tasks by adopting a time-varying approach with the main goal to extract features that can totally distinguish each subject from the rest of the set. Additionally, the reliability of the proposed scheme was estimated in a second case study of fMRI resting-state activity with multiple scans. Our results demonstrated clearly that the proposed thresholding scheme outperformed a large list of thresholding schemes based on the recognition accuracy of each subject compared to the rest of the cohort (EEG). Additionally, the reliability of the network metrics based on the fMRI static networks was improved based on the proposed topological filtering scheme. Overall, the proposed algorithm could be used across neuroimaging and multimodal studies as a common computationally efficient standardized tool for a great number of neuroscientists and physicists working on numerous of projects.

Beta-band activity represents the recent past during episodic encoding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Episodic memory; Memory search; Clustering; Computational model	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FREE-RECALL; WORKING-MEMORY; TEMPORAL CONTEXT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; MODEL; RETRIEVAL; SEARCH; GAMMA	While much research has focused on understanding how individual stimuli are encoded in episodic memory, less is known about how a series of events is bound into a coherent episode. Cognitive models of episodic memory propose that information about presented stimuli is integrated into a composite representation reflecting one's past experience, allowing events separated in time to become associated. Recent evidence suggests that neural oscillatory activity may be critically involved in this process. To examine how oscillatory activity contributes to binding of information across events, we measured scalp EEG as participants studied categorized lists of people, places, and objects. We assessed their memory for the lists using free recall, allowing us to characterize the temporal and semantic organization of the studied items in memory. Using pattern classification, we identified EEG activity during encoding at a range of frequencies and scalp locations that was sensitive to the category of presented stimuli. In the beta band (1625 Hz) at right posterior electrodes, we observed activity that was also sensitive to the category of recently presented stimuli. This neural activity showed two characteristics consistent with a representation of the recent past: It became stronger when multiple items from the same category were presented in succession, and it contained a fading trace of the previous category after a category shift. When items were separated by an inter-item distraction task, this integrative beta-band activity was disrupted. Distraction also led to decreased semantic organization of the studied materials without affecting their temporal organization; this suggests that distraction disrupts the integration of semantic information over time, preventing encoding of items in terms of the semantic context of earlier items. Our results provide evidence that beta-band activity is involved in maintaining information about recent events, allowing construction of a coherent representation of a temporally extended episode in memory.

A Prospective, Multicenter, Single-Blind Study Assessing Indices of SNAP II Versus BIS VISTA on Surgical Patients Undergoing General Anesthesia	JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS			English	Article						Bispectral index; SNAP II; BIS VISTA; EEG monitoring	BISPECTRAL INDEX; INTRAOPERATIVE AWARENESS; PROPOFOL; PREVENTION	Background: Traditionally, anesthesiologists have relied on nonspecific subjective and objective physical signs to assess patients' comfort level and depth of anesthesia. Commercial development of electrical monitors, which use low- and high-frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, have been developed to enhance the assessment of patients' level of consciousness. Multiple studies have shown that monitoring patients' consciousness levels can help in reducing drug consumption, anesthesia-related adverse events, and recovery time. This clinical study will provide information by simultaneously comparing the performance of the SNAP II (a single-channel EEG device) and the bispectral index (BIS) VISTA (a dual-channel EEG device) by assessing their efficacy in monitoring different anesthetic states in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to establish the range of index values for the SNAP II corresponding to each anesthetic state (preinduction, loss of response, maintenance, first purposeful response, and extubation). The secondary objectives will assess the range of index values for BIS VISTA corresponding to each anesthetic state compared to published BIS VISTA range information, and estimate the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity for both devices. Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective, double-arm, parallel assignment, single-blind study involving patients undergoing elective surgery that requires general anesthesia. The study will include 40 patients and will be conducted at the following sites: The Ohio State University Medical Center (Columbus, OH); Northwestern University Prentice Women's Hospital (Chicago, IL); and University of Miami Jackson Memorial Hospital (Miami, FL). The study will assess the predictive value of SNAP II versus BIS VISTA indices at various anesthetic states in patients undergoing general anesthesia (preinduction, loss of response, maintenance, first purposeful response, and extubation). The SNAP II and BIS VISTA electrode arrays will be placed on the patient's forehead on opposite sides. The hemisphere location for both devices' electrodes will be equally alternated among the patient population. The index values for both devices will be recorded and correlated with the scorings received by performing the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Continuum of Depth of Sedation, at different stages of anesthesia. Results: Enrollment for this study has been completed and statistical data analyses are currently underway. Conclusions: The results of this trial will provide information that will simultaneously compare the performance of SNAP II and BIS VISTA devices, with regards to monitoring different anesthesia states among patients.

However, when awakened from sleep, we sometimes recall dreams and sometimes recall no experiences. Traditionally, dreaming has been identified with rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep, characterized by wake-like, globally 'activated', high-frequency electroencephalographic activity. However, dreaming also occurs in non-REM (NREM) sleep, characterized by prominent low-frequency activity. This challenges our understanding of the neural correlates of conscious experiences in sleep. Using high-density electroencephalography, we contrasted the presence and absence of dreaming in NREM and REM sleep. In both NREM and REM sleep, reports of dream experience were associated with local decreases in low-frequency activity in posterior cortical regions. High-frequency activity in these regions correlated with specific dream contents. Monitoring this posterior 'hot zone' in real time predicted whether an individual reported dreaming or the absence of dream experiences during NREM sleep, suggesting that it may constitute a core correlate of conscious experiences in sleep.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the glucose metabolic profile using F-18-FDG PET/CT imaging in patients with epilepsy. Methods: One hundred pediatric epilepsy patients who underwent F-18-FDG PET/CT, MRI, and electroencephalography examinations were included. Fifteen age-matched controls were also included. F-18-FDG PET images were analyzed by visual assessment combined with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. The absolute asymmetry index (jAIj) was calculated in patients with regional abnormal glucose metabolism. Results: Visual assessment combined with SPM analysis of F-18-FDG PET images detected more patients with abnormal glucose metabolism than visual assessment only. The jAIj significantly positively correlated with seizure frequency (P < 0.01) but negatively correlated with the time since last seizure (P < 0.01) in patients with abnormal glucose metabolism. The only significant contributing variable to the vertical bar AI vertical bar was the time since last seizure, in patients both with hypometabolism (P = 0.001) and with hypermetabolism (P = 0.005). For patients with either hypometabolism (P < 0.01) or hypermetabolism (P = 0.209), higher jAIj values were found in those with drug resistance than with seizure remission. In the post-1-y follow-up PET studies, a significant change of jAIj (%) was found in patients with clinical improvement compared with those with persistence or progression (P < 0.01). Conclusion: F-18-FDG PET imaging with visual assessment combined with SPM analysis could provide cerebral glucose metabolic profiles in nonsurgical epilepsy patients. jAIj might be used for evaluation of clinical severity and progress in these patients. Patients with a prolonged period of seizure freedom may have more subtle (or no) metabolic abnormalities on PET. The clinical value of PET might be enhanced by timing the scan closer to clinical seizures.

Literature suggests a correlation between JA and neural circuitries, although this link is still largely unexplored in ASD. In this pilot study, we aimed at investigating the neural correlates of responding and initiating JA in high-functioning children with ASD and evaluating the changes in brain function and visual pattern after six months of rehabilitative treatment using an integrated EEG/eye-tracking system. Our results showed that initiating and responding JA subtend both overlapping (i.e. frontal and temporal) and specialized (i.e. parietal for responding JA and occipital for initiating JA) neural circuitries. In addition, in a subgroup of subjects, we observed trends of changes in both brain activity and connectivity after rehabilitative treatment in both the two tasks, which were correlated with modifications in gaze measures. These preliminary results, if confirmed in a larger sample, suggest the feasibility of using the proposed multimodal approach to characterise JA-related brain circuitries and visual pattern in ASD individuals and to monitor longitudinal changes in response to rehabilitative intervention.

They have been associated with sleep-dependent memory consolidation and sleep stability in humans and rodents. Occurrence, frequency, amplitude and duration of sleep spindles co-vary with age, sex and psychiatric conditions. Spindle analogue activity in dogs has been qualitatively described, but never quantified and related to function. In the present study we used an adjusted version of a detection method previously validated in children to test whether detections in the dogs show equivalent functional correlates as described in the human literature. We found that the density of EEG transients in the 9-16 Hz range during non-REM sleep relates to memory and is characterized by sexual dimorphism similarly as in humans. The number of transients/minute was larger in the learning condition and for female dogs, and correlated with the increase of performance during recall. It can be concluded that in dogs, automatic detections in the 9-16 Hz range, in particular the slow variant (< 13 Hz), are functional analogues of human spindles.

We examined whether violation of non-local dependencies manifest in event related potentials (ERP) for Western and Iranian excerpts by recording EEG while participants passively listened to sequences of modified/original excerpts. We also investigated oscillatory and synchronization properties of brain responses during processing of hierarchical structures. For the Western excerpt, subjective ratings of conclusiveness were marginally significant and the difference in the ERP components fell short of significance. However, ERP and behavioral results showed that while listening to culturally familiar music, subjects comprehended whether or not the hierarchical syntactic structure was fulfilled. Irregularities in the hierarchical structures of the Iranian excerpt elicited an early negativity in the central regions bilaterally, followed by two later negativities from 450-700 to 750-950 ms. The latter manifested throughout the scalp. Moreover, violations of hierarchical structure in the Iranian excerpt were associated with (i) an early decrease in the long range alpha phase synchronization, (ii) an early increase in the oscillatory activity in the beta band over the central areas, and (iii) a late decrease in the theta band phase synchrony between left anterior and right posterior regions. Results suggest that rhythmic structures and melodic fragments, representative of Iranian music, created a familiar context in which recognition of complex non-local syntactic structures was feasible for Iranian listeners. Processing of neural responses to the Iranian excerpt indicated neural mechanisms for processing of hierarchical syntactic structures in music at different levels of cortical integration.

Increase in Beta-Band Activity during Preparation for Overt Speech in Patients with Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; speech production; brain rhythms; beta-band; EEG	SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; EEG; DYSARTHRIA; VOICE; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; COMMUNICATION	Speech impairment is a frequent and often serious symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by a disorder of phonation, articulation and prosody. While research on the pathogenesis of the prominent limb motor symptoms has made considerable progress in recent years, the pathophysiology of PD speech impairment is still incompletely understood. To investigate the neural correlates of speech production in PD, EEG was recorded in 14 non-demented patients with idiopathic PD and preserved verbal fluency on regular dopaminergic medication (8 women; mean age +/- SD: 69.5 +/- 8.0 years). The control group consisted of 15 healthy age-matched individuals (7 women; age: 69.7 +/- 7.0 years). All participants performed a visually-cued, overt speech production task; required utterances were papapa and pataka. During the preparatory phase of speech production, in a time window of 200-400 ms after presentation of the visual cue, beta-power was significantly increased in PD patients compared to healthy controls. Previous research has shown that the physiological decrease of beta-power preceding limb movement onset is delayed and smaller in PD patients off medication and normalizes under dopaminergic treatment. By contrast, our study demonstrates that beta-power during preparation for speech production is higher in patients on dopaminergic therapy than controls. Thus, our results suggest that the mechanisms that regulate beta-activity preceding limb movement and speech production differ in PD. The pathophysiological role of this increase in beta-power during speech preparation needs to be determined.

J	Hinault, T; Lemaire, P				Hinault, Thomas; Lemaire, Patrick			Aging, rule-violation checking strategies, and strategy combination: An EEG study in arithmetic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; Arithmetic; EEG; Rule violation; Strategy	ODD-EVEN RULE; SEQUENTIAL MODULATIONS; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; BAND POWER; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; OLDER; TASK; DIFFICULTY	In arithmetic, rule-violation checking strategies are used while participants solve problems that violate arithmetic rules, like the five rule (i.e., products of problems including five as an operand end with either five or zero; e.g., 5 x 14 = 70) or the parity rule (i.e., when at least one of the two operands is even, the product is also even; otherwise the product is odd; e.g., 4 x 13 = 52). When problems violate both rules, participants use strategy combination and have better performance on both-rule than on one-rule violation problems (i.e., five or parity rule). Aging studies found that older adults efficiently use one-rule violation checking strategies but have difficulties to combine two strategies. To better understand these aging effects, we used EEG and found important age-related changes while participants used rule-violation checking strategies. We compared participants' performance while they verified arithmetic problems that differ in number and type of violated rule. More specifically, both-rule violation problems elicited larger negativity than one-rule violation problems between 600 and 800 ms. Five-rule violation problems differed from parity-rule violation problems between 1100 and 1200 ms. Moreover, rule-violation checking strategies and strategy combination involved delta, theta, and lower alpha frequencies. Age-related changes in ERPs and frequency were associated with less efficient strategy combination. Moreover, efficient use of one-rule violation checking strategies in older adults was associated with changes in ERPs and frequency. These findings contribute to further our understanding of age-related changes and invariance in arithmetic strategies, and in combination of arithmetic strategies.

Neuro-electrophysiological tools have been widely used in heroin addiction studies. Previous studies indicated that chronic heroin abuse would result in abnormal functional organization of the brain, while few heroin addiction studies have applied the effective connectivity tool to analyze the brain functional system (BFS) alterations induced by heroin abuse. The present study aims to identify the abnormality of resting-state heroin abstinent BFS using source decomposition and effective connectivity tools. Approach. The resting-state electroencephalograph (EEG) signals were acquired from 15 male heroin abstinent (HA) subjects and 14 male non-addicted (NA) controls. Multivariate autoregressive models combined independent component analysis (MVARICA) was applied for blind source decomposition. Generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC) was applied for effective brain connectivity analysis. Effective brain networks of both HA and NA groups were constructed. The two groups of effective cortical networks were compared by the bootstrap method. Abnormal causal interactions between decomposed source regions were estimated in the 1-45 Hz frequency domain. Main results. This work suggested: (a) there were clear effective network alterations in heroin abstinent subject groups; (b) the parietal region was a dominant hub of the abnormally weaker causal pathways, and the left occipital region was a dominant hub of the abnormally stronger causal pathways. Significance. These findings provide direct evidence that chronic heroin abuse induces brain functional abnormalities. The potential value of combining effective connectivity analysis and brain source decomposition methods in exploring brain alterations of heroin addicts is also implied.

Methods: We studied 31 consecutive patients with medically intractable focal (temporal and extratemporal) epilepsies who were examined by either intracerebral or subdural electrodes. Automated detection was used to detect HFO. The characteristics (rate, amplitude, and duration) of HFO were statistically compared within three groups: the seizure onset zone (SOZ), the irritative zone (IZ), and areas outside the IZ and SOZ (nonSOZ/nonIZ). Results: In all patients, fast ripples (FR) and ripples (R) were significantly more frequent and shorter in the SOZ than in the nonSOZ/nonIZ region. In the group of patients with favorable surgical outcomes, the relative amplitude of FR was higher in the SOZ than in the IZ and nonIZ/nonSOZ regions; in patients with poor outcomes, the results were reversed. The relative amplitude of R was significantly higher in the SOZ, with no difference between patients with poor and favorable surgical outcomes. Conclusions: FR are more frequent, shorter, and have higher relative amplitudes in the SOZ area than in other regions. The study suggests a worse prognosis in patients with higher amplitudes of FR outside the SOZ. Significance: Various HFO parameters, especially of FR, differ in epileptic and non-epileptic regions. The amplitude and duration may be as important as the frequency band and rate of HFO in marking the seizure onset region or the epileptogenic area and may provide additional information on epileptogenicity.

A choice between two similarly valued alternatives creates psychological tension (cognitive dissonance) that is reduced by a postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives. We measured EEG of human subjects during rest and free-choice paradigm. Our study demonstrates that choices associated with stronger cognitive dissonance trigger a larger negative frontocentral evoked response similar to error-related negativity, which has in turn been implicated in general performance monitoring. Furthermore, the amplitude of the evoked response is correlated with the reevaluation of the alternatives. We also found a link between individual neural dynamics (long-range temporal correlations) of the frontocentral cortices during rest and follow-up neural and behavioral effects of cognitive dissonance. Individuals with stronger resting-state long-range temporal correlations demonstrated a greater postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives and larger evoked brain responses associated with stronger cognitive dissonance. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive dissonance is reflected in both resting-state and choice-related activity of the prefrontal cortex as part of the general performance-monitoring circuitry.

Such information can potentially be exploited to make devices and interfacesmore user aware. In this line of research, we took a further step by studying neural correlates of different levels of cognitive processes and developing a method that allows to quantify how deeply presented information is processed in the brain. Methods/Approach : Seventeen participants took part in an EEG study in which we evaluated different levels of cognitive processing (no processing, shallow, and deep processing) within three distinct domains (memory, language, and visual imagination). Our investigations showed gradual differences in the amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERPs) and in the extend and duration of event-related desynchronization (ERD) which both correlate with task difficulty. We performed multi-modal classification to map the measured correlates of neurocognitive processing to the corresponding level of processing. Results : Successful classification of the neural components was achieved, which reflects the level of cognitive processing performed by the participants. The results show performances above chance level for each participant and a mean performance of 70-90% for all conditions and classification pairs. Significance : The successful estimation of the level of cognition on a single-trial basis supports the feasibility of user-state adaptation based on ongoing neural activity. There is a variety of potential use cases such as: a user-friendly adaptive design of an interface or the development of assistance systems in safety critical workplaces.

However, its mechanism relating to phase synchronization of cortical oscillations is still unknown, which hinders the development of predicting and preventing vigilant attentional deficit. This study utilized psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) to elicit vigilance decrement. High and low levels of vigilant attention were represented by short and long reaction time, respectively. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was collected and phase synchronization between prefrontal and parietal cortices was analyzed by using debiased weighted phase lag index (dWPLI). The result suggests that vigilant attention of high level has earlier timing of theta (4-8Hz) phase synchronization, compared with that of low level. We concluded that phase synchronization may relate closely with the variation of vigilant attention.

Diagnostic utility of brain activity flow patterns analysis in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); brain networks; Brain Network Activation (BNA); diagnostics; event-related potentials (ERPs); Go/NoGo; response inhibition; spatio-temporal parcellation analysis	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; GO/NOGO TASK; STOP-SIGNAL; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; CHILDREN; ADHD; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS	Background. A previous small study suggested that Brain Network Activation (BNA), a novel ERP-based brain network analysis, may have diagnostic utility in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study we examined the diagnostic capability of a new advanced version of the BNA methodology on a larger population of adults with and without ADHD. Method. Subjects were unmedicated right-handed 18- to 55-year-old adults of both sexes with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD. We collected EEG while the subjects were performing a response inhibition task (Go/NoGo) and then applied a spatio-temporal Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis of the EEG data. This analysis produced a display of qualitative measures of brain states (BNA scores) providing information on cortical connectivity. This complex set of scores was then fed into a machine learning algorithm. Results. The BNA analysis of the EEG data recorded during the Go/NoGo task demonstrated a high discriminative capacity between ADHD patients and controls (AUC = 0.92, specificity = 0.95, sensitivity = 0.86 for the Go condition; AUC = 0.84, specificity = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.76 for the NoGo condition). Conclusions. BNA methodology can help differentiate between ADHD and healthy controls based on functional brain connectivity. The data support the utility of the tool to augment clinical examinations by objective evaluation of electro-physiological changes associated with ADHD. Results also support a network-based approach to the study of ADHD.

Empirical validation of directed functional connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Directed connectivity; Effective connectivity; fMRI; MEG; Memory	GRANGER CAUSALITY; DEFAULT MODE; FMRI; EEG; RESPONSES; MEG; NETWORKS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; REACTIVATION	Mapping directions of influence in the human brain connectome represents the next phase in understanding its functional architecture. However, a host of methodological uncertainties have impeded the application of directed connectivity methods, which have primarily been validated via "ground truth" connectivity patterns embedded in simulated functional MRI (fMRI) and magneto-/electro-encephalography (MEG/EEG) datasets. Such simulations rely on many generative assumptions, and we hence utilized a different strategy involving empirical data in which a ground truth directed connectivity pattern could be anticipated with confidence. Specifically, we exploited the established "sensory reactivation" effect in episodic memory, in which retrieval of sensory information reactivates regions involved in perceiving that sensory modality. Subjects performed a paired associate task in separate fMRI and MEG sessions, in which a ground truth reversal in directed connectivity between auditory and visual sensory regions was instantiated across task conditions. This directed connectivity reversal was successfully recovered across different algorithms, including Granger causality and Bayes network (IMAGES) approaches, and across fMRI ("raw" and deconvolved) and source-modeled MEG. These results extend simulation studies of directed connectivity, and offer practical guidelines for the use of such methods in clarifying causal mechanisms of neural processing.

J	Vukovic, N; Shtyrov, Y				Vukovic, Nikola; Shtyrov, Yury			Cortical networks for reference-frame processing are shared by language and spatial navigation systems	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EXTRASTRIATE BODY AREA; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; NEURAL BASIS; COGNITIVE STRATEGIES; VIRTUAL-REALITY; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; MOTOR SYSTEMS; BRAIN; EEG	To help us live in the three-dimensional world, our brain integrates incoming spatial information into reference frames, which are based either on our own body (egocentric) or independent from it (allocentric). Such frames, however, may be crucial not only when interacting with the visual world, but also in language comprehension, since even the simplest utterance can be understood from different perspectives. While significant progress has been made in elucidating how linguistic factors, such as pronouns, influence reference frame adoption, the neural underpinnings of this ability are largely unknown. Building on the neural reuse framework, this study tested the hypothesis that reference frame processing in language comprehension involves mechanisms used in navigation and spatial cognition. We recorded EEG activity in 28 healthy volunteers to identify spatiotemporal dynamics in (1) spatial navigation, and (2) a language comprehension task (sentence-picture matching). By decomposing the EEG signal into a set of maximally independent activity patterns, we localised and identified a subset of components which best characterised perspective-taking in both domains. Remarkably, we find individual co-variability across these tasks: people's strategies in spatial navigation are also reflected in their construction of sentential perspective. Furthermore, a distributed network of cortical generators of such strategy-dependent activity responded not only in navigation, but in sentence comprehension. Thus we report, for the first time, evidence for shared brain mechanisms across these two domains - advancing our understanding of language's interaction with other cognitive systems, and the individual differences shaping comprehension.

While conscious perception is robustly associated with sustained, recurrent interactions between widespread cortical regions, subcortical regions, including the striatum, influence cortical activity. Here, we examined whether the ventral striatum, given its ability to modulate cortical information flow, contributes to conscious perception. Using intracranial EEG, we recorded ventral striatum activity while 7 patients performed an attentional blink task in which they had to detect two targets (T1 and T2) in a stream of distractors. Typically, when T2 follows T1 within 100-500 ms, it is often not perceived (i.e., the attentional blink). We found that conscious T2 perception was influenced and signaled by ventral striatal activity. Specifically, the failure to perceive T2 was foreshadowed by a T1-induced increase in alpha and low beta oscillatory activity as early as 80 ms after T1, indicating that the attentional blink to T2 may be due to very early T1-driven attentional capture. Moreover, only consciously perceived targets were associated with an increase in theta activity between 200 and 400 ms. These unique findings shed new light on the mechanisms that give rise to the attentional blink by revealing that conscious target perception may be determined by T1 processing at a much earlier processing stage than traditionally believed. More generally, they indicate that ventral striatum activity may contribute to conscious perception, presumably by gating cortical information flow.

The evaluation of directed connectivity on the propagation of brain activity has largely been based on simulated data or toymodels, where various hidden properties of neurophysiological data may not be fully recapitulated. In this study, directionality was unequivocally manipulated in the freely moving rat in a unique dataset, where normal oscillatory interactions between the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) and hippocampus (HPC) were attenuated by temporary medial septal (MS) inactivation, and replaced by electrical stimulation of the fornix to evaluate the performance of several directed connectivity assessment methods. The directed transfer function, partial directed coherence, directed coherence, pair-wise Geweke-Granger causality, phase slope index, and phase transfer entropy, all found SuM to HPC theta propagation when the MS is inactivated, and HPC activity was driven by peaks of simultaneously recorded SuM theta. As expected from theoretical expectations and simulated data, signal features including coupling strength, signal-to-noise ratio, and stationarity all weakly affected directed connectivity measures. We conclude that all the examined directed connectivity estimates correctly identify artificially imposed uni-directionality of brain oscillations in freely moving animals. Non-auto-regressive modeling basedmethods appear to be themost robust, and are least affected by inherent features in data such as signal-to-noise ratio and stationarity.

Material and Methods During the last six years we have been completed well controlled clinical trials based on the criteria of the American Academy of orofacial pain. The study over the 600 patients (300 women and 300 men), mean age of 47 years have been developed. Patients have been selected on the main clinical sign of TMJ pain and have been divided into four main groups according to the type of PDT method. Based on the action spectra, various wavelengths have been used for TMJ Photodynamic Therapy. Constant dose and time of exposition, as well as various range of frequencies have been applied. In this way the Laser biostimulation response has been directly proportional to the total energy dose, depending of light intensity. Physiological and clinical effects of the followed "active regions"- 660 - 680, 760 - 780, 810 - 830 and 904 - 987 nm have been valued by method of comparative analysis. Methods applied: LLLT - TENS - red surface laser acupuncture (LA), PIPBM - LA, Laser bioenergetics approach, Complex therapeutic program (CTP). Results evaluation will be demonstrated by comparative digital ortopantomograph analysis, EEG brain maps, VAS, a metric analysis of the level of the maximum active Mandible opening and EPST through electrophysiological signal evaluation of the patient's body.

Methods: We have recorded stimulation-evoked HFOs and DRs in 16 epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluation using the stereoelectroencephalographic method. To evaluate converging and complementary information provided by the biomarkers, we analyzed them individually and for logical "and"/"or" combinations between them. 3D maps of the biomarkers' distributions by recording location (inbound maps) and by stimulation location (outbound maps) were created to analyze their relationship with the epileptogenic structures. Results: HFOs occur less frequently than DRs, by 18.7%, when counting by recording contacts, and more frequently, by 7.4%, when counting by stimulation contacts. 40.6% of the contacts exhibiting HFOs also exhibit DRs, and 44.1% of the contacts exhibiting DRs also exhibit HFOs. When combining biomarkers, there was a tradeoff between increased seizure onset zone (SOZ) sensitivity, from 21.3% to 73%, and decreased specificity, from 87.2% to 34.3%. Conclusions: There is a moderate similarity in the information provided by the DRs and HFOs. Significance: The biomarkers complement each other, but there is a tradeoff between different metrics for SOZ localization. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

A challenge in communication settings is that the relevant content and irrelevant inputs may emanate from a common source, such as a talkative conversationalist. An open question is how the WM system deals with such interference. Will the distracters become inadvertently filtered before processing for meaning because the primary WM operations deplete all available processing resources? Or are they suppressed post perceptually, through an active control process? We tested these alternative hypotheses by measuring magnetoencephalography (MEG), EEG, and functional MRI (fMRI) during a phonetic auditory continuous performance task. Contextual WM maintenance load was manipulated by adjusting the number of "filler" letter sounds in-between cue and target letter sounds. Trial-to-trial variability of pre-and post-stimulus activations in fMRI-informed cortical MEG/EEG estimates was analyzed within and across 14 subjects using generalized linear mixed effect (GLME) models. High contextual WM maintenance load suppressed left auditory cortex (AC) activations around 250-300 ms after the onset of irrelevant phonetic sounds. This effect coincided with increased 10-14 Hz alpha-range oscillatory functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left AC. Suppression of AC responses to irrelevant sounds during active maintenance of the task context also correlated with increased pre-stimulus 7-15 Hz alpha power. Our results suggest that under high auditory WM load, irrelevant sounds are suppressed through a "late" active suppression mechanism, which prevents short-term consolidation of irrelevant information without affecting the initial screening of potentially meaningful stimuli. The results also suggest that AC alpha oscillations play an inhibitory role during auditory WM processing.

Such processing has been suggested to be reflected by EEG Mu rhythm (8-13 Hz in sensorimotor regions). However, it remains unclear whether Mu rhythm is modulated by the social nature of coordination information in interactive actions (i.e., inter-dependency). This study used a novel manipulation of social coordination information: in a computer-based task, participants viewed a replay of two chasers chasing a common target coordinately (coordinated chase) or independently (solo chase). Simultaneously, to distinguish the potential effect of social coordination information from that of object-directed goal information, a control version of each condition was created by randomizing one chaser's movement. In a second experiment, we made the target invisible to participants to control for low-level properties. Watching replays of coordinated chases induced stronger Mu suppression than solo chases, although both involved a common target. These effects were not explained by attention mechanisms or low-level physical patterns (e.g., the degree of physical synchronization). Therefore, the current findings suggest that processing social coordination information can be reflected by Mu rhythm. This function of Mu rhythm may characterize the activity of human mirror neuron system.

Effects of musical expertise on oscillatory brain activity in response to emotional sounds	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Sound processing; Emotion; Speech; Music; Vocal expression; Musical expertise; EEG; Oscillations	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; UNPLEASANT MUSIC; SPEECH PROSODY; BAND ACTIVITY; LANGUAGE; VOCALIZATIONS; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; PLASTICITY; AMYGDALA	Emotions can be conveyed through a variety of channels in the auditory domain, be it via music, non-linguistic vocalizations, or speech prosody. Moreover, recent studies suggest that expertise in one sound category can impact the processing of emotional sounds in other sound categories as they found that musicians process more efficiently emotional musical and vocal sounds than non-musicians. However, the neural correlates of these modulations, especially their time course, are not very well understood. Consequently, we focused here on how the neural processing of emotional information varies as a function of sound category and expertise of participants. Electroencephalogram (EEG) of 20 non-musicians and 17 musicians was recorded while they listened to vocal (speech and vocalizations) and musical sounds. The amplitude of EEG-oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma band was quantified and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to identify underlying components of brain activity in each band. Category differences were found in theta and alpha bands, due to larger responses to music and speech than to vocalizations, and in posterior beta, mainly due to differential processing of speech. In addition, we observed greater activation in frontal theta and alpha for musicians than for non-musicians, as well as an interaction between expertise and emotional content of sounds in frontal alpha. The results reflect musicians' expertise in recognition of emotion-conveying music, which seems to also generalize to emotional expressions conveyed by the human voice, in line with previous accounts of effects of expertise on musical and vocal sounds processing.

J	Benedetto, A; Morrone, MC				Benedetto, Alessandro; Morrone, Maria Concetta			Saccadic Suppression Is Embedded Within Extended Oscillatory Modulation of Sensitivity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						action and perception; contrast sensitivity; eye movements; saccadic suppression; sensorimotor integration; visual oscillations	VISUAL-PERCEPTION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; PHASE; TIME; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; CONTRAST; MOTION; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	Action and perception are intimately coupled systems. One clear case is saccadic suppression, the reduced visibility around the time of saccades, which is important in mediating visual stability; another is the oscillatory modulation of visibility synchronized with hand action. To suppress effectively the spurious retinal motion generated by the eye movements, it is crucial that saccadic suppression and saccadic onset be temporally synchronous. However, the mechanisms that determine this temporal synchrony are unknown. We investigated the effect of saccades on contrast discrimination sensitivity over a long period stretching over >1 s before and after saccade execution. Human subjects made horizontal saccades at will to two stationary saccadic targets separated by 20 degrees. At a random interval, a brief Gabor patch was displayed between the two fixations in either the upper or lower visual field and the subject had to detect its location. Strong saccadic suppression was measured between -50 and 50 ms from saccadic onset. However, the suppression was systematically embedded in a trough of oscillations of contrast sensitivity that fluctuated rhythmically in the delta range (at similar to 3 Hz), commencing similar to 1 s before saccade execution and lasting for up to 1 s after the saccade. The results show that saccadic preparation and visual sensitivity oscillations are coupled and the coupling might be instrumental in temporally aligning the initiation of the saccade with the visual suppression.

The mechanism of burst generation and synchronization in S1 is not yet understood. Using models of single-neuron responses fitted to unit recordings from macaque monkeys, we show that these synchronized bursts are the consequence of correlated synaptic inputs combined with a refractory mechanism. In the presence of noise these models reproduce also the observed trial-to-trial response variability, where individual bursts represent one of many stereotypical temporal spike patterns. When additional slower and global excitability fluctuations are introduced the single-neuron spike patterns are correlated with the population activity, as demonstrated in experimental data. The underlying biophysical mechanism of S1 responses involves thalamic inputs arriving through depressing synapses to cortical neurons in a high-conductance state. Our findings show that a simple feedforward processing of peripheral inputs could give rise to neuronal responses with nontrivial temporal and population statistics. We conclude that neural systems could use refractoriness to encode variable cortical states into stereotypical short-term spike patterns amenable to processing at neuronal time scales (tens of milliseconds).

Intervention before the onset of seizure manifestations could be envisioned with accurate seizure forecasting. Although efforts for better prediction have been made, the translation of current approaches to clinical applications is still not possible. While early findings have been optimistic, the absence of statistical validation and reproducibility has raised doubts about the existence of a preictal state. Analysis and algorithmic studies are providing evidence that transition to the ictal state is not random, with build-up leading to seizures. We have reviewed the general framework of reliable algorithmic seizure prediction studies, discussing each component of the whole block diagram. We have explored steps along the pathway, from signal acquisition to adequate performance evaluation that should be taken into account in the design of an efficient seizure advisory/intervention system. The present review has established that there is potential for improvement and optimization in the seizure prediction framework. New databases, higher sampling frequencies, adequate preprocessing, electrode selection, and machine-learning considerations are all elements of the prediction scheme that should be assessed to achieve more realistic, better-than-chance performances.

Results show notable hemispheric lateralization as phase synchronization values between channels are significant and high in right hemisphere for all emotions. Left frontal electrodes are also found to have control over emotion in terms of functional connectivity. Besides significant inter-hemisphere phase locking values are observed between left and right frontal regions, specifically between left anterior frontal and right mid-frontal, inferior-frontal and anterior frontal regions; and also between left and right mid frontal regions. ANOVA analysis for stimulus types show that stimulus types are not separable for emotions having high valence. PLV values are significantly different only for negative emotions or neutral emotions between audio only/video only and audio only/audio + video stimuli. Finding no significant difference between video only and audio + video stimuli is interesting and might be interpreted as that video content is the most effective part of a stimulus.
