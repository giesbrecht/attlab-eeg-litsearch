In recent studies, reconstruction of speech from single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) data has been used to decode which talker a listener is attending to in a two-talker situation. It is currently unclear how this generalizes to more complex sound environments. Behaviorally, speech perception is robust to the acoustic distortions that listeners typically encounter in everyday life, but it is unknown whether this is mirrored by a noise-robust neural tracking of attended speech. Here we used advanced acoustic simulations to recreate real-world acoustic scenes in the laboratory. In virtual acoustic realities with varying amounts of reverberation and number of interfering talkers, listeners selectively attended to the speech stream of a particular talker. Across the different listening environments, we found that the attended talker could be accurately decoded from single-trial EEG data irrespective of the different distortions in the acoustic input. For highly reverberant environments, speech envelopes reconstructed from neural responses to the distorted stimuli resembled the original clean signal more than the distorted input. With reverberant speech, we observed a late cortical response to the attended speech stream that encoded temporal modulations in the speech signal without its reverberant distortion. Single-trial attention decoding accuracies based on 40-50 s long blocks of data from 64 scalp electrodes were equally high (80-90% correct) in all considered listening environments and remained statistically significant using down to 10 scalp electrodes and short (<30-s) unaveraged EEG segments. In contrast to the robust decoding of the attended talker we found that decoding of the unattended talker deteriorated with the acoustic distortions. These results suggest that cortical activity tracks an attended speech signal in a way that is invariant to acoustic distortions encountered in real-life sound environments. Noise-robust attention decoding additionally suggests a potential utility of stimulus reconstruction techniques in attention-controlled brain-computer interfaces.

The two questions of interest are the cortical localization of different oscillatory activities, and the directional effective flow of oscillatory activity between regions of interest, in the task condition compared to resting state. In particular, theta and alpha activity are of interest here, due to their important role in attention processing. Methods: We adapted mental arithmetic as an attention ask in this study. Eyes closed 61-channel EEG was recorded in 14 participants during resting and in a mental arithmetic task ("serial sevens subtraction"). Functional localization and connectivity analyses were based on cortical signals of electric neuronal activity estimated with sLORETA (standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography). Functional localization was based on the comparison of the cortical distributions of the generators of oscillatory activity between task and resting conditions. Assessment of effective connectivity was based on the iCoh (isolated effective coherence) method, which provides an appropriate frequency decomposition of the directional flow of oscillatory activity between brain regions. Nine regions of interest comprising nodes from the dorsal and ventral attention networks were selected for the connectivity analysis. Results: Cortical spectral density distribution comparing task minus rest showed significant activity increase in medial prefrontal areas and decreased activity in left parietal lobe for the theta band, and decreased activity in parietal-occipital regions for the alphal band. At a global level, connections among right hemispheric nodes were predominantly decreased during the task condition, while connections among left hemispheric nodes were predominantly increased. At more detailed level, decreased flow from right inferior frontal gyrus to anterior cingulate cortex for theta, and low and high alpha oscillations, and increased feedback (bidirectional flow) between left superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus, were observed during the arithmetic task. Conclusions: Task related medial prefrontal increase in theta oscillations possibly corresponds to frontal midline theta, while parietal decreased alphal activity indicates the active role of this region in the numerical task. Task related decrease of intracortical right hemispheric connectivity support the notion that these nodes need to disengage from one another in order to not interfere with the ongoing numerical processing. The bidirectional feedback between left frontal-temporal-parietal regions in the arithmetic task is very likely to be related to attention network working memory function. Significance: The methods of analysis and the results presented here will hopefully contribute to clarify the roles of the different EEG oscillations during sustained attention, both in terms of their functional localization and in terms of how they integrate brain function by supporting information flow between different cortical regions. The methodology presented here might be clinically relevant in evaluating abnormal attention function. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Cortical slow oscillations (SO; 0.5-1 Hz) and thalamocortical spindle activity (12-15 Hz) during sleep, and their temporal coordination, are considered critical for memory formation. We investigated the potential of slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS), applied during a daytime nap in a sleep-state-dependent manner, to modulate these activity patterns and sleep-related memory consolidation in nine male and seven female human patients with MCI. Stimulation significantly increased overall SO and spindle power, amplified spindle power during SO up-phases, and led to stronger synchronization between SO and spindle power fluctuations in EEG recordings. Moreover, visual declarative memory was improved by so-tDCS compared with sham stimulation and was associated with stronger synchronization. These findings indicate a well-tolerated therapeutic approach for disordered sleep physiology and memory deficits in MCI patients and advance our understanding of offline memory consolidation.

Alpha Power Predicts Persistence of Bistable Perception	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE TASK; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; DIVERGENT THINKING; FREQUENCY BAND; ONE NIGHT; BRAIN; ATTENTION; INHIBITION	Perception is strongly affected by the intrinsic state of the brain, which controls the propensity to either maintain a particular perceptual interpretation or switch to another. To understand the mechanisms underlying the spontaneous drive of the brain to explore alternative interpretations of unchanging stimuli, we repeatedly recorded high-density EEG after normal sleep and after sleep deprivation while participants observed a Necker cube image and reported the durations of the alternating representations of their bistable perception. We found that local alpha power around the parieto-occipital sulcus within the first second after the emergence of a perceptual representation predicted the fate of its duration. An experimentally induced increase in alpha power by means of sleep deprivation increased the average duration of individual representations. Taken together, these findings show that high alpha power promotes the stability of a perceptual representation and suppresses switching to the alternative. The observations support the hypothesis that synchronization of alpha oscillations across a wide neuronal network promotes the maintenance and stabilization of its current perceptual representation. Elevated alpha power could also be key to the poorly understood cognitive deficits, that typically accompany sleep deprivation, such as the loss of mental flexibility and lapses of responsiveness.

Using MEG to Understand the Progression of Light Sleep and the Emergence and Functional Roles of Spindles and K-Complexes	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep; spindles; K-complexes; magnetoencephalography(MEG); magnetic field tomography(MFT)	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SUBGENUAL CINGULATE CORTEX; EPILEPTIC SPIKE ACTIVITY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; LOBE EPILEPSY; NREM SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; EEG; BRAIN	We used tomographic analysis of MEG signals to characterize regional spectral changes in the brain at sleep onset and during light sleep. We identified two key processes that may causally link to loss of consciousness during the quiet or "core" periods of NREM1. First, active inhibition in the frontal lobe leads to delta and theta spectral power increases. Second, activation suppression leads to sharp drop of spectral power in alpha and higher frequencies in posterior parietal cortex. During NREM2 core periods, the changes identified in NREM1 become more widespread, but focal increases also emerge in alpha and low sigma band power in frontal midline cortical structures, suggesting reemergence of some monitoring of internal and external environment. Just before spindles and K-complexes (KCs), the hallmarks of NREM2, we identified focal spectral power changes in pre-frontal cortex, mid cingulate, and areas involved in environmental and internal monitoring, i.e., the rostral and sub-genual anterior cingulate. During both spindles and KCs, alpha and low sigma bands increases. Spindles emerge after further active inhibition (increase in delta power) of the frontal areas responsible for environmental monitoring, while in posterior parietal cortex, power increases in low and high sigma bands. KCs are correlated with increase in alpha power in the monitoring areas. These specific regional changes suggest strong and varied vigilance changes for KCs, but vigilance suppression and sharpening of cognitive processing for spindles. This is consistent with processes designed to ensure accurate and uncorrupted memory consolidation. The changes during KCs suggest a sentinel role: evaluation of the salience of provoking events to decide whether to increase processing and possibly wake up, or to actively inhibit further processing of intruding influences. The regional spectral patterns of NREM1, NREM2, and their dynamic changes just before spindles and KCs reveal an edge effect facilitating the emergence of spindles and KCs and defining the precise loci where they might emerge. In the time domain, the spindles are seen in widespread areas of the cortex just as reported from analysis of intracranial data, consistent with the emerging consensus of a differential topography that depends on the kind of memory stored.

The theta EROs occurring in the P3 response, important indicators of neurocognitive function, were elicited during the evaluation of task-relevant target stimuli in visual and auditory oddball tasks. Associations between the theta EROs and genotypic variants of 4 KCNJ6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to vary with age, sex, scalp location, and task modality. Three of the four KCNJ6 SNPs studied here were found to be significantly associated with the same theta EROs in adults in a previous family genome wide association study. Since measures of the P3 response have been found to be a useful endophenotypes for the study of a number of clinical and behavioral disorders, studies of genetic effects on its development in adolescents and young adults may illuminate neurophysiological factors contributing to the onset of these conditions.

Recent clues suggest that the j-function might display a physical counterpart, equipped with a quantifiable real component and a hidden imaginary one, currently undetectable by our senses and instruments. Here we evaluate whether the real part of the modular function can be spotted in the electric activity of the human brain. We assessed EEGs from five healthy males, eyes-closed and resting state, and superimposed the electric traces with the bidimensional curves predicted by the j-function. We found that the two trajectories matched in more than 85% of cases, independent from the subtending electric rhythm and the electrode location. Therefore, the real part of the j-function's peculiar wave is ubiquitously endowed all over normal EEGs paths. We discuss the implications of such correlation in neuroscience and neurology, highlighting how the j-function might stand for the one of the basic oscillations of the brain, and how the still unexplored imaginary part might underlie several physiological and pathological nervous features.

Age and gender dependency of physiological networks in sleep	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						polysomnography; time delay stability; physiological network; sleep; age; gender	HEART; EEG	Recently, time delay stability analysis of biosignals has been successfully applied as a multivariate time series analysis method to assess the human physiological network in young adults. The degree of connectivity between different network nodes is described by the so-called link strength. Based on polysomnographic recordings (PSGs), it could be shown that the network changes with the sleep stage. Here, we apply the method to a large set of healthy controls spanning six decades of age. As it is well known, that the overall sleep architecture is dependent both on age and on gender, we particularly address the question, if these changes are also found in the network dynamics. We find moderate dependencies of the network on gender. Significantly higher link strengths up to 13% are found in women for some links in different frequency bands of central and occipital regions in REM and light sleep (N2). Higher link strengths are found in men consistently in cardio-cerebral links in N2, but not significant. Age dependency is more pronounced. In particular a significant overall weakening of the network with age is found for wakefulness and non-REM sleep stages. The largest overall decrease is observed in N2 with 0.017 per decade. For individual links decrease rates up to 0.08 per decade are found, in particular for intra-brain links in non-REM sleep. Many of them show a significant decrease with age. Non-linear regression employing an artificial neural network can predict the age with a mean absolute error (MAE) of about five years, suggesting that an age-resolution of about a decade would be appropriate in normative data for physiological networks.

Inter-Ictal Seizure Onset Zone Localization Using Unsupervised Clustering and Bayesian Filtering	2017 8TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAY 25-28, 2017	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, EMBS			HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; FOCAL HUMAN EPILEPSY; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; TEMPORAL-LOBE	Surgical removal of seizure-generating brain tissue can cure epilepsy in patients who do not respond to medications. However, identifying seizure-generating regions is difficult and fails in many cases. In this paper, we report a fully unsupervised and automated approach to seizure focus localization using a Bayesian filter. This method uses a spectral domain feature, Power in Bands (PIB). PIB is extracted from inter-ictal (non-seizure) intracranial EEG recordings of patients with focal epilepsy to differentiate normal and abnormal brain regions. This study was carried out using data collected from 34 patients with focal epilepsy at the Mayo Clinic. Experiments show that using a Bayesian filter for capturing temporal properties of the iEEGs recorded from epileptic brains remarkably improves localization accuracy (AUC: 0.63 -> 0.72). Our study also reaffirms that high-frequency oscillations and inter-ictal spikes are useful inter-ictal biomarkers of the epileptic brain, and PIB, which could be implemented with relatively low computational burden, performs as well as the standard bio-markers when used in this setting. We conclude that the technique of extracting spectral features from inter-ictal iEEGs and capturing their temporal properties via a Bayesian filter markedly improves our ability to localize seizure onset zones.

Five-year-old participants (n = 27) underwent EEG recording while engaged in a color identification task. Each trial began with an emotional prime. Response times indicated whether emotional primes facilitated or interfered with performance. Related effects were detected in theta-band power over parietal-occipital cortex, early in the response epoch (<500 ms). Children in the emotion facilitation group showed greater theta synchronization for negative stimuli. The opposite trend was observed in the interference group. Results suggest a role for theta oscillations in children's adaptive response to emotional content in cognitive performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Generally, this component has an amplitude significantly smaller in patients at high risk of developing the disease than in low risk ones, being a major endophenotype of the disease. In this work, we propose an alternative system to automatically classify P300 signals of individuals with high risk and low risk, composed by two modules: a discrete wavelet transform that extracts features and an artificial neural network module which identifies the patterns. After training, 97.36 % of correct classification was obtained in the database from Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism.

Epileptic focus localization is a important factor for successful epilepsy surgery. The intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) is the most used signal for detecting epileptic focus. The iEEG signals are obtained from a publicly available database that consists of 7,500 signal pairs. To this dataset, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been successfully applied to detect the epileptic focus. However, the EMD method is not suitable for iEEG signal pairs. In this paper, a method for the classification of focal and non-focal iEEG signals using bivariate EMD (BEMD) is presented. The bivariate iEEG signals are decomposed the into signal components of the same frequency band. Various entropy measures calculated from the IMFs of the iEEG signals. Then, some or all of the entropies are chosen as features, which are discriminated into focal or non-focal iEEG by using the support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to differentiate the focal from non-focal iEEG signals with an average classification accuracy of 86.89%.

Helen			Does sleep benefit memory consolidation in children with focal epilepsy?	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Sleep; Cognition; Children; Interictal epileptiform discharges	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; CHILDHOOD; PERFORMANCE; HOMEOSTASIS; DISORDER	Objective: Children with epilepsy have high rates of both cognitive impairment and sleep disruption. It is thus assumed that sleep-dependent memory consolidation is vulnerable to ongoing epileptic activity, but direct evidence of this is limited. Methods: We performed a within-subject comparison of memory retention across intervals of wake or overnight sleep. Healthy children (n = 21, 6-16 years, 12 female) and children with focal epilepsy (n = 22, 6-16 years, 9 female) performed verbal and visuospatial memory tasks under each condition. Sleep was assessed with electroencephalography (EEG) polysomnography during the overnight interval. Interictal discharges were quantified manually. Results: Memory retention was greater in the sleep condition in both the verbal (F-1,F-39 = 10.8, p = 0.002, Cohen's d = 0.67) and the visuospatial (F-1,F-36 = 4.23, p = 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.40) tasks, with no significant interaction of group by condition in either task. Across the total sample, gain in memory retention with sleep in the verbal task correlated with duration of slow wave sleep (r = 0.4, p = 0.01). In patients, sleepdependent memory consolidation was negatively correlated with interictal discharge rate in both the verbal (rho = -0.49, p = 0.04) and visuospatial (rho = -0.45, p = 0.08) tasks. On post hoc analysis, a longer history of epilepsy (r = 0.53, p = 0.01) and a temporal (t(10) = 1.8, p = 0.1, Cohen's d = 0.86) rather than an extratemporal seizure focus (t(10) = 0.8, p = 0.4, Cohen's d = 0.30) was associated with greater contribution of sleep to verbal memory retention. Significance: We have demonstrated that memory consolidation in children with focal epilepsy benefits from sleep, showing the same correlation with slow wave sleep as in healthy children, but an inverse relationship with the interictal discharge load during sleep. This mechanism appears to be increasingly recruited with longer duration of illness, indicating a resilient homeostatic function which may be harnessed to aid learning.

Previous research has established that such paradigms, such as the mismatch response or mismatch negativity, are useful for examining auditory processes in young children and infants across various sleep and attention states. The extent to which oddball ERP responses may reflect subtle discrimination effects, such as speech discrimination, is largely unknown, especially in infants that have not yet acquired speech and language. Results: Mismatch responses for three contrasts (non-speech, vowel, and consonant) were computed as a spectral-temporal probability function in 24 infants, and analyzed at the group level by a modified multidimensional scaling. Immediately following an onset gamma response (30-50 Hz), the emergence of a beta oscillation (12-30 Hz) was temporally coupled with a lower frequency theta oscillation (2-8 Hz). The spectral-temporal probability of this coupling effect relative to a subsequent theta modulation corresponds with discrimination difficulty for non-speech, vowel, and consonant contrast features. Discussion: The theta modulation effect suggests that unexpected sounds are encoded as a probabilistic measure of surprise. These results support the notion that auditory discrimination is driven by the development of brain networks for predictive processing, and can be measured in infants during sleep. The results presented here have implications for the interpretation of discrimination as a probabilistic process, and may provide a basis for the development of single-subject and single-trial classification in a clinically useful context. Conclusion: An infant's brain is processing information about the environment and performing computations, even during sleep. These computations reflect subtle differences in acoustic feature processing that are necessary for language-learning. Results from this study suggest that brain responses to deviant sounds in an oddball paradigm follow a cascade of oscillatory modulations. This cascade begins with a gamma response that later emerges as a beta synchronization, which is temporally coupled with a theta modulation, and followed by a second, subsequent theta modulation. The difference in frequency and timing of the theta modulations appears to reflect a measure of surprise. These insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms of auditory discrimination provide a basis for exploring the clinically utility of the MMRTF and other auditory oddball responses.

It has been hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (<0.1 Hz) are driven by underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much faster timescales (>5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. The two driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's alpha rhythm (8 - 12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope. We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two different coupling modes where either alpha oscillations were synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS). Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity within the stimulated RSN compared with phase-synchronized or no tACS. This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.

J	Medina-Ceja, L; Garcia-Barba, C				Medina-Ceja, Laura; Garcia-Barba, Carla			The glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX and MPEP decrease fast ripple events in rats treated with kainic acid	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						CNQX; Fast ripples; Hippocampus; Kainic acid; MPEP; Status epilepticus	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR-5 ANTAGONIST; AMPA RECEPTORS; KAINATE RECEPTORS; STATUS-EPILEPTICUS; PRINCIPAL NEURONS; NMDA RECEPTOR; 80-500 HZ; HIPPOCAMPAL; SEIZURE	Fast ripples (FR) are high frequency oscillations (250-600 Hz) that have been associated with epilepsy. FR are assumed to be generated in small areas of the hippocampus (1 mm(3)) that contain pathologically interconnected glutamate pyramidal cell clusters. Additionally, a relation between glutamate neurotransmission and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainite (AMPA/KA) and metabotropic mGluR5 receptors is well established. Therefore, we hypothesized that antagonism of these glutamate receptors would decrease FR activity. For this propose, we induced status epilepticus with a kainic acid injection in the posterior right hippocampus and performed intracranial EEG recordings to detect and evaluate the presence of FR 15 days after the injection. The glutamate AMPA/KA receptor antagonist CNQX (10 mg/kg) and the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (20 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally, and the effects of the drugs were evaluated for a period of three hours after their administration. The results show a decrease in the number of FR in the first hour after drug administration in both cases (CNQX, p = 0.0125; MPEP, p = 0.0132) and a return to basal values in the third hour of the experiment, but not significant differences in the number of oscillations per event of FR, and the frequency and duration of each event of FR. We therefore conclude that blockade of AMPA/KA and mGluR5 receptors transiently decreases the generation of FR; however, the mechanisms by which this effect is achieved are to be further analyzed in future experiments.

J	Luke, R; Wouters, J				Luke, Robert; Wouters, Jan			Kalman Filter Based Estimation of Auditory Steady State Response Parameters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Auditory steady state responses; cochlear implants; evoked responses; Kalman filter; objective measures	HEARING THRESHOLDS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ADULTS	Auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) are brain responses to modulated or repetitive stimuli that can be captured in the EEG recording. ASSRs can be used as an objectivemeasure to clinicallydetermine frequency specific hearing thresholds, to quantify the sensitivity of the auditory system to modulation, and have been related to speech intelligibility. However, the detection of ASSRs is difficult due to the low signal to noise ratio of the responses. Moreover, minimizing measurement time is important for clinical applications. Traditionally ASSRs are analyzed using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based methods. We present a Kalman filter based ASSR analysis procedure and illustrate several benefits over traditional DFT based methods. We show on a data set of 320 measurements that the proposedmethod reaches valid amplitude estimates significantly faster than the state of the art DFT method. Further, we provide two extensions to the proposed method. First, we demonstrate information can be incorporated from multiple recording electrodes by extending the system model. Secondly, we extend the model to incorporate artifacts from cochlear implant (CI) stimulation and demonstrate electrically evoked auditory steady state responses (EASSRs) can be accurately measured.

J	Li, GS; Cleland, TA				Li, Guoshi; Cleland, Thomas A.			A coupled-oscillator model of olfactory bulb gamma oscillations	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							BIOPHYSICAL MODEL; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL ASSEMBLIES; NETWORK MODEL; MITRAL CELLS; SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS; ODOR DISCRIMINATION; GRANULE CELLS; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG	The olfactory bulb transforms not only the information content of the primary sensory representation, but also its underlying coding metric. High-variance, slow-timescale primary odor representations are transformed by bulbar circuitry into secondary representations based on principal neuron spike patterns that are tightly regulated in time. This emergent fast timescale for signaling is reflected in gamma-band local field potentials, presumably serving to efficiently integrate olfactory sensory information into the temporally regulated information networks of the central nervous system. To understand this transformation and its integration with interareal coordination mechanisms requires that we understand its fundamental dynamical principles. Using a biophysically explicit, multiscale model of olfactory bulb circuitry, we here demonstrate that an inhibition-coupled intrinsic oscillator framework, pyramidal resonance interneuron network gamma (PRING), best captures the diversity of physiological properties exhibited by the olfactory bulb. Most importantly, these properties include global zero-phase synchronization in the gamma band, the phase-restriction of informative spikes in principal neurons with respect to this common clock, and the robustness of this synchronous oscillatory regime to multiple challenging conditions observed in the biological system. These conditions include substantial heterogeneities in afferent activation levels and excitatory synaptic weights, high levels of uncorrelated background activity among principal neurons, and spike frequencies in both principal neurons and interneurons that are irregular in time and much lower than the gamma frequency. This coupled cellular oscillator architecture permits stable and replicable ensemble responses to diverse sensory stimuli under various external conditions as well as to changes in network parameters arising from learning-dependent synaptic plasticity.

Neural mechanisms of rhythm-based temporal prediction: Delta phase-locking reflects temporal predictability but not rhythmic entrainment	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TIME; EXPECTATION; ATTENTION; DISCRIMINATION; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; REPRESENTATION	Predicting the timing of upcoming events enables efficient resource allocation and action preparation. Rhythmic streams, such as music, speech, and biological motion, constitute a pervasive source for temporal predictions. Widely accepted entrainment theories postulate that rhythm-based predictions are mediated by synchronizing low-frequency neural oscillations to the rhythm, as indicated by increased phase concentration (PC) of low-frequency neural activity for rhythmic compared to random streams. However, we show here that PC enhancement in scalp recordings is not specific to rhythms but is observed to the same extent in less periodic streams if they enable memory-based prediction. This is inconsistent with the predictions of a computational entrainment model of stronger PC for rhythmic streams. Anticipatory change in alpha activity and facilitation of electroencephalogram (EEG) manifestations of response selection are also comparable between rhythm-and memory-based predictions. However, rhythmic sequences uniquely result in obligatory depression of preparation-related premotor brain activity when an on-beat event is omitted, even when it is strategically beneficial to maintain preparation, leading to larger behavioral costs for violation of prediction. Thus, while our findings undermine the validity of PC as a sign of rhythmic entrainment, they constitute the first electrophysiological dissociation, to our knowledge, between mechanisms of rhythmic predictions and of memory-based predictions: the former obligatorily lead to resonance-like preparation patterns (that are in line with entrainment), while the latter allow flexible resource allocation in time regardless of periodicity in the input. Taken together, they delineate the neural mechanisms of three distinct modes of preparation: continuous vigilance, interval-timing-based prediction and rhythmbased prediction.

Using magnetoencephalography, we sought to determine whether spontaneous brain oscillations could disambiguate the perceived order of auditory and visual events presented in close temporal proximity, that is, at the individual's perceptual order threshold (Point of Subjective Simultaneity [PSS]). Two neural responses were found to index an individual's temporal order perception when contrasting brain activity as a function of perceived order (i.e., perceiving the sound first vs. perceiving the visual event first) given the same physical audiovisual sequence. First, average differences in prestimulus auditory alpha power indicated perceiving the correct ordering of audiovisual events irrespective of which sensory modality came first: a relatively low alpha power indicated perceiving auditory or visual first as a function of the actual sequence order. Additionally, the relative changes in the amplitude of the auditory (but not visual) evoked responses were correlated with participant's correct performance. Crucially, the sign of the magnitude difference in prestimulus alpha power and evoked responses between perceived audiovisual orders correlated with an individual's PSS. Taken together, our results suggest that spontaneous oscillatory activity cannot disambiguate subjective temporal order without prior knowledge of the individual's bias toward perceiving one or the other sensory modality first. Altogether, our results suggest that, under high perceptual uncertainty, the magnitude of prestimulus alpha (de)synchronization indicates the amount of compensation needed to overcome an individual's prior in the serial ordering and temporal sequencing of information.

J	Canakci, S; Toy, MF; Inci, AF; Liu, X; Kuzum, D				Canakci, Sadullah; Toy, Muhammed Faruk; Inci, Ahmet Fatih; Liu, Xin; Kuzum, Duygu			Computational analysis of network activity and spatial reach of sharp wave-ripples	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; INTERNEURONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; ORIGIN; MEMORY; MODEL; EEG	Network oscillations of different frequencies, durations and amplitudes are hypothesized to coordinate information processing and transfer across brain areas. Among these oscillations, hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-Rs) are one of the most prominent. SPW-Rs occurring in the hippocampus are suggested to play essential roles in memory consolidation as well as information transfer to the neocortex. To-date, most of the knowledge about SPW-Rs comes from experimental studies averaging responses from neuronal populations monitored by conventional microelectrodes. In this work, we investigate spatiotemporal characteristics of SPW-Rs and how microelectrode size and distance influence SPWR recordings using a biophysical model of hippocampus. We also explore contributions from neuronal spikes and synaptic potentials to SPW-Rs based on two different types of network activity. Our study suggests that neuronal spikes from pyramidal cells contribute significantly to ripples while high amplitude sharp waves mainly arise from synaptic activity. Our simulations on spatial reach of SPW-Rs show that the amplitudes of sharp waves and ripples exhibit a steep decrease with distance from the network and this effect is more prominent for smaller area electrodes. Furthermore, the amplitude of the signal decreases strongly with increasing electrode surface area as a result of averaging. The relative decrease is more pronounced when the recording electrode is closer to the source of the activity. Through simulations of field potentials across a high-density microelectrode array, we demonstrate the importance of finding the ideal spatial resolution for capturing SPW-Rs with great sensitivity. Our work provides insights on contributions from spikes and synaptic potentials to SPWRs and describes the effect of measurement configuration on LFPs to guide experimental studies towards improved SPW-R recordings.

However, untangling the neuronal mechanisms that subserve these baseline alterations requires measurement of their electrophysiological underpinnings. This systematic review specifically investigates the contributions of resting-state Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in elucidating abnormal neural organization in SZ patients.& para;& para;Method: A systematic literature review of resting-state MEG studies in SZ was conducted. This literature is discussed in relation to findings from resting-state fMRI and EEG, as well as to task-based MEG research in SZ population. Importantly, methodological limitations are considered and recommendations to overcome current limitations are proposed.& para;& para;Results: Resting-state MEG literature in SZ points towards altered local and long-range oscillatory network dynamics in various frequency bands. Critical methodological challenges with respect to experiment design, and data collection and analysis need to be taken into consideration.& para;& para;Conclusion: Spontaneous MEG data show that local and global neural organization is altered in SZ patients. MEG is a highly promising tool to fill in knowledge gaps about the neurophysiology of SZ. However, to reach its fullest potential, basic methodological challenges need to be overcome.& para;& para;Significance: MEG-based resting-state power and connectivity findings could be great assets to clinical and translational research in psychiatry, and SZ in particular.

To elucidate this issue, we compared heterotopic and normotopic cortex using quantitative signal analysis on stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) recordings. Methods: Clinically relevant biomarkers of epileptogenicity during ictal (epileptogenicity index; EI) and interictal recordings (high-frequency oscillation and spike) were evaluated in 19 patients undergoing SEEG. These biomarkers were then compared between heterotopic cortex and neocortical regions. Seizures were classified as normotopic, heterotopic, or normoheterotopic according to respective values of quantitative analysis (EI >= 0.3). Results: A total of 1,246 contacts were analyzed: 259 in heterotopic tissue (heterotopic cortex), 873 in neocortex in the same lobe of the lesion (local neocortex), and 114 in neocortex distant from the lesion (distant neocortex). No significant difference in EI values, high-frequency oscillations, and spike rate was found comparing local neocortex and heterotopic cortex at a patient level, but local neocortex appears more epileptogenic (p < 0.001) than heterotopic cortex analyzing EI values at a seizure level. According to EI values, seizures were mostly normotopic (48.5%) or normoheterotopic (45.5%); only 6% were purely heterotopic. A good long-term treatment response was obtained in only two patients after thermocoagulation and surgical disconnection. Significance: This is the first quantitative SEEG study providing insight into the mechanisms generating seizures in nodular heterotopia. We demonstrate that both the heterotopic lesion and particularly the normotopic cortex are involved in the epileptogenic network. This could open new perspectives on multitarget treatments, other than resective surgery, aimed at modifying the epileptic network.

The present study investigated the role of frontal theta power in detecting the mismatched information in VWM in a delayed matching task. A control task required to compare two simultaneously presented visual figures was also designed as a contrast to exclude the possibility that frontal theta activity just reflecting the non-memory-related behavioral conflicts. To better characterize the control mechanisms shaped by the frontal theta oscillation in human VWM, colored shapes were adopted as materials while both the task-relevant shape feature and task-irrelevant color feature could be mismatched. We found that the response times of participants were significantly delayed under the relevant-and irrelevant-mismatch conditions in both tasks and the conjunction-mismatch condition in delayed matching task. While our EEG data showed that increased frontal theta power was only observed under the relevant-and conjunction-mismatch conditions in the delayed matching task, but not the control task. These findings suggest that the frontal distributed theta activity observed here reflects the detection of mismatched information during the comparison stage of VWM, rather than the response-related conflicts. Furthermore, it is consistent with the proposal that theta-band oscillation can act as a control mechanism in working memory function so that the target-mismatched information in VWM could be successfully tracked. We also propose a possible processing structure to explain the neural dynamics underlying the mismatch detection process in VWM.

Whether the decoding process is bounded by the capacity of theta rhythm to follow syllabic rhythms in speech, or constrained by a more endogenous top-down mechanism, e.g., involving beta activity, is unknown. We addressed the dynamics of auditory decoding in speech comprehension by challenging syllable tracking and speech decoding using comprehensible and incomprehensible time-compressed auditory sentences. We recorded EEGs in human participants and found that neural activity in both theta and gamma ranges was sensitive to syllabic rate. Phase patterns of slow neural activity consistently followed the syllabic rate (4 - 14 Hz), even when this rate went beyond the classical theta range (4-8 Hz). The power of theta activity increased linearly with syllabic rate but showed no sensitivity to comprehension. Conversely, the power of beta ( 14 - 21 Hz) activity was insensitive to the syllabic rate, yet reflected comprehension on a single-trial basis. Wefound different long-range dynamics for theta and beta activity, with beta activity building up in time while more contextual information becomes available. This is consistent with the roles of theta and beta activity in stimulus-driven versus endogenous mechanisms. These data show that speech comprehension is constrained by concurrent stimulus-driven theta and low-gamma activity, and by endogenous beta activity, but not primarily by the capacity of theta activity to track the syllabic rhythm.

Involuntary orienting of attention to a sound desynchronizes the occipital alpha rhythm and improves visual perception	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha oscillation; Desynchronization; Involuntary attention; Voluntary attention; Crossmodal cueing; Visual discrimination	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; AUDIOVISUAL LINKS; CORTEX; EEG; DISCRIMINATION	Directing attention voluntarily to the location of a visual target results in an amplitude reduction (desynchronization) of the occipital alpha rhythm (8-14 Hz), which is predictive of improved perceptual processing of the target. Here we investigated whether modulations of the occipital alpha rhythm triggered by the involuntary orienting of attention to a salient but spatially non-predictive sound would similarly influence perception of a subsequent visual target. Target discrimination was more accurate when a sound preceded the target at the same location (validly cued trials) than when the sound was on the side opposite to the target (invalidly cued trials). This behavioral effect was accompanied by a sound-induced desynchronization of the alpha rhythm over the lateral occipital scalp. The magnitude of alpha desynchronization over the hemisphere contralateral to the sound predicted correct discriminations of validly cued targets but not of invalidly cued targets. These results support the conclusion that cue-induced alpha desynchronization over the occipital cortex is a manifestation of a general priming mechanism that improves visual processing and that this mechanism can be activated either by the voluntary or involuntary orienting of attention. Further, the observed pattern of alpha modulations preceding correct and incorrect discriminations of valid and invalid targets suggests that involuntary orienting to the non-predictive sound has a rapid and purely facilitatory influence on processing targets on the cued side, with no inhibitory influence on targets on the opposite side.

The aim of this paper was to characterize brain non-stationarity during an auditory oddball task in schizophrenia (SCH). The level of non-stationarity was measured in the baseline and response windows of relevant tones in SCH patients and healthy controls. Approach. Event-related potentials were recorded from 28 SCH patients and 51 controls. Non-stationarity was estimated in the conventional electroencephalography frequency bands by means of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Relative power (RP) was also computed to assess a possible complementarity with KLD. Main results. Results showed a widespread statistically significant increase in the level of non-stationarity from baseline to response in all frequency bands for both groups. Statistically significant differences in nonstationarity were found between SCH patients and controls in beta-2 and in the alpha band. SCH patients showed more non-stationarity in the left parieto-occipital region during the baseline window in the beta-2 band. A leave-one-out cross validation classification study with feature selection based on binary stepwise logistic regression to discriminate between SCH patients and controls provided a positive predictive value of 72.73% and negative predictive value of 78.95%. Significance. KLD can characterize transient neural reorganization during an attentional task in response to novelty and relevance. Our findings suggest anomalous reorganization of neural dynamics in SCH during an oddball task. The abnormal frequency-dependent modulation found in SCH patients during relevant tones is in agreement with the hypothesis of aberrant salience detection in SCH. The increase in non-stationarity in the alpha band during the active task supports the notion that this band is involved in top-down processing. The baseline differences in the beta-2 band suggest that hyperactivation of the default mode network during attention tasks may be related to SCH symptoms. Furthermore, the classification improved when features from both KLD and RP were used, supporting the idea that these measures can be complementary.

Anterior Thalamic High Frequency Band Activity Is Coupled with Theta Oscillations at Rest	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cross-frequency coupling; phase amplitude coupling; anterior thalamic nucleus; theta; gamma; high frequency band; resting state; intracranial EEG	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DEFAULT-MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MEMORY FORMATION; STATE NETWORKS; WORKING-MEMORY	Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between slow and fast brain rhythms, in the form of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), is proposed to enable the coordination of neural oscillatory activity required for cognitive processing. PAC has been identified in the neocortex and mesial temporal regions, varying according to the cognitive task being performed and also at rest. PAC has also been observed in the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) during memory processing. The thalamus is active during the resting state and has been proposed to be involved in switching between task-free cognitive states such as rest, in which attention is internally-focused, and externally-focused cognitive states, in which an individual engages with environmental stimuli. It is unknown whether PAC is an ongoing phenomenon during the resting state in the ATN, which is modulated during different cognitive states, or whether it only arises during the performance of specific tasks. We analyzed electrophysiological recordings of ATN activity during rest from seven patients who received thalamic electrodes implanted for treatment of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. PAC was identified between theta (4-6 Hz) phase and high frequency band (80-150 Hz) amplitude during rest in all seven patients, which diminished during engagement in tasks involving an external focus of attention. The findings are consistent with the proposal that theta-gamma coupling in the ATN is an ongoing phenomenon, which is modulated by task performance.

Many studies have found that the top-down set can be tuned to a category level. However, it is unclear whether the category-specific top-down set involving a central search task can exist outside the current area of attentional focus. To directly probe the neural responses inside and outside the current focus of attention, we recorded continuous EEG to measure the contralateral ERP components for central targets and the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) oscillations associated with a flickering checkerboard placed on the visual periphery. The relationship of color categories between targets and non-targets was manipulated to investigate the effect of category-specific top-down set. Results showed that when the color categories of targets and non-targets in the central search arrays were the same, larger SSVEP oscillations were evoked by target color peripheral checkerboards relative to the non-target color ones outside the current attentional focus. However, when the color categories of targets and non-targets were different, the peripheral checkerboards in two different colors of the same category evoked similar SSVEP oscillations, indicating the effects of category-specific top-down set. These results firstly demonstrate that the category-specific top-down set can affect the neural responses of peripheral distractors. The results could support the idea of a global selection account and challenge the attentional window account in selective attention. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Meisel, C; Bailey, K; Achermann, P; Plenz, D				Meisel, Christian; Bailey, Kimberlyn; Achermann, Peter; Plenz, Dietmar			Decline of long-range temporal correlations in the human brain during sustained wakefulness	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; NEURAL DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; WAKING; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; HOMEOSTASIS; COMPUTATION	Sleep is crucial for daytime functioning, cognitive performance and general well-being. These aspects of daily life are known to be impaired after extended wake, yet, the underlying neuronal correlates have been difficult to identify. Accumulating evidence suggests that normal functioning of the brain is characterized by long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in cortex, which are supportive for decision-making and working memory tasks. Here we assess LRTCs in resting state human EEG data during a 40-hour sleep deprivation experiment by evaluating the decay in autocorrelation and the scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis from EEG amplitude fluctuations. We find with both measures that LRTCs decline as sleep deprivation progresses. This decline becomes evident when taking changes in signal power into appropriate consideration. In contrast, the presence of strong signal power increases in some frequency bands over the course of sleep deprivation may falsely indicate LRTC changes that do not reflect the underlying long-range temporal correlation structure. Our results demonstrate the importance of sleep to maintain LRTCs in the human brain. In complex networks, LRTCs naturally emerge in the vicinity of a critical state. The observation of declining LRTCs during wake thus provides additional support for our hypothesis that sleep reorganizes cortical networks towards critical dynamics for optimal functioning.

Here we explored if the temporal synchronization between slow waves and spindle activity during slow wave sleep (SWS) in humans was modulated by preceding functional activations during pre-sleep learning. We activated differentially the left and right hemisphere before sleep by using a lateralized variant of serial response time task (SRTT) and verified these inter-hemispheric differences by analysing alpha and beta electroencephalographic (EEG) activities during learning. The stability and timing of coupling between positive and negative phases of slow waves and sleep spindle activity during SWS were quantified. Spindle activity was temporally synchronized with both positive (up-state) and negative (down-state) slow half waves. Synchronization of only the fast spindle activity was laterally asymmetric after learning, corresponding to hemisphere-specific activations before sleep. However, the down state was associated with decoupling, whereas the up-state was associated with increased coupling of fast spindle activity over the pre-activated hemisphere. These observations provide original evidence that (1) the temporal grouping of fast spindles by slow waves is a dynamic property of human SWS modulated by functional pre-sleep activation patterns, and (2) fast spindles synchronized by slow waves are functionally distinct.

We developed a new model of MCD-associated epileptic spasms by treating rats prenatally with methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) to induce cortical malformations and postnatally with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) to induce spasms. To produce cortical malformations to infant rats, two dosages of MAM (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) were injected to pregnant rats at gestational day 15. In prenatally MAM-exposed rats and the controls, spasms were triggered by single (6 mg/kg on postnatal day 12 (P12) or 10 mg/kg on P13 or 15 mg/kg on P15) or multiple doses (P12, P13, and P15) of NMDA. In prenatally MAM-exposed rats with single NMDA-provoked spasms at P15, we obtain the intracranial electroencephalography and examine the pretreatment response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or vigabatrin. Rat pups prenatally exposed to MAM exhibited a significantly greater number of spasms in response to single and multiple postnatal NMDA doses than vehicle-exposed controls. Vigabatrin treatment prior to a single NMDA dose on P15 significantly suppressed spasms in MAM group rats (p < 0.05), while ACTH did not. The MAM group also showed significantly higher fast oscillation (25-100 Hz) power during NMDA-induced spasms than controls (p = 0.047). This new model of MCD-based epileptic spasms with corresponding features of human spasms will be valuable for future research of the developmental epilepsy.

In the current EEG study we investigated whether the brain's response to a simple auditory sensory change was altered in patients with PTSD relative to trauma-exposed matched controls who did not develop the disorder. Thirteen male PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls matched for age and educational level were presented with regular auditory pure tones (1000 Hz, 200 ms duration), with 11% of the tones deviating in both duration (50 ms) and frequency (1200 Hz) while watching a silent movie. Relative to the controls, patients who had developed PTSD showed enhanced mismatch negativity (MMN), increased theta power (5-7 Hz), and stronger suppression of upper alpha activity (13-15 Hz) after deviant vs. standard tones. Behaviourally, the alpha suppression in PTSD correlated with decreased spatial working memory performance suggesting it might reflect enhanced stimulus-feature representations in auditory memory. These results taken together suggest that PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls can be distinguished by enhanced involuntary attention to changes in sensory patterns.

However, the strong spatial correlations from background spontaneous activity might mask the local evoked activity and lead to spurious connectivity results in connectivity analysis for event-related EEG and MEG. In this paper, we applied normalized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) preprocessing, Minimum Norm Estimation (MNE) and Granger causal connectivity analysis to identify stimulus-elicited neural sources and measure the effective connectivity among the sources for left somatosensory MEG responses of five healthy subjects. After normalized PCA preprocessing our results demonstrated increased coherences between channels with somatosensory evoked response at major physiological frequency bands, including Alpha and Beta band for somatosensory evoked response. The sources were located at contralateral primary somatosensory cortex, contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex and cingulate cortex.

Compare with the results without normalized PCA preprocessing, our results are consistent with established connections between somatosensory regions and previous source modeling studies, which provides validation of the proposed approach.

People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) are often over-or under-reactive to stimulation, leading to a wide range of behavioral symptoms. This altered sensitivity may be caused by disrupted sensory processing, signal integration and/or gating, and is often being neglected. Here, we review translational experimental approaches that are used to investigate sensory processing in humans with ASD and FXS, and in relevant rodent models. This includes electroencephalographic measurement of event related potentials, neural oscillations and mismatch negativity, as well as habituation and pre-pulse inhibition of startle. We outline robust evidence of disrupted sensory processing in individuals with ASD and FXS, and in respective animal models, focusing on the auditory sensory domain. Animal models provide an excellent opportunity to examine common mechanisms of sensory pathophysiology in order to develop therapeutics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The advanced analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals induced by brain stimulation paradigms may provide an appropriate approach to differentiate patients with DoC, besides the clinical assessment. Objective: This study was performed with an objective of identifying residual brain network perturbations following an innovative, non-invasive audiovisual stimulation protocol, which could be related to behavioral responsiveness in patients with DoC. Methods: The study comprised of ten healthy controls (HC), seven patients with Minimally Conscious State (MCS), and nine patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS). Both synchronous as well as asynchronous transorbital and transauricolar alternating current were employed as stimuli and their effects were measured in terms of functional and effective connectivity. Results: A more noticeable deterioration of long range connectivity patterns were found in patients with UWS than in those with MCS, with an exception of two patients with UWS, who showed connectivity values similar to those of MCS patients. Conclusion: The audiovisual stimulation paradigm used in the present study may be employed as a supportive bedside tool for improving the differential diagnosis in patients with DoC.

Automatic epileptic seizure detection is important to help neurologists to interpret the electroencephalogram signal readings, particularly the signals recorded in the ictal or seizure attack, which are more crucial than those recorded in the inter-ictal (between the attacks). Time frequency (t-f) analysis methods, wavelet transform, and linear discriminant analysis are the most common modalities used for epileptic seizure detection. The main objective of this work is to compare between ten different test cases of the EEC signal detection methods over twenty patients considering the sensitivity, specificity, and the accuracy. The analysis has been conducted in three levels: Firstly, the EEC is filtered by a discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Secondly, five features which are relative energy, fluctuation index, variance, energy and autocorrelation are calculated; and finally, these features are applied as inputs to the support vector machine (SVM) to detect the occurrence of epilepsy. Due to the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity (i.e. as a sensitivity is improved, the specificity is degraded and vice versa), a new technique which is sensitivity-specificity product is proposed in this work. Simulation results on different test cases have shown that the maximum sensitivity-specificity product occurs when only four features are included (i.e. relative energy, fluctuation index, energy, and autocorrelation) and the fifth feature (i.e. the variance) is excluded.

We here demonstrate that metabotropic glutamate receptors of subtype 5 (mGluR5) contribute to the molecular machinery governing sleep-wake homeostasis. Using positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electroencephalography in humans, we find that increased mGluR5 availability after sleep loss tightly correlates with behavioral and electroencephalographic biomarkers of elevated sleep need. These changes are associated with altered cortical myo-inositol and glycine levels, suggesting sleep loss-induced modifications downstream of mGluR5 signaling. Knock-out mice without functional mGluR5 exhibit severe dysregulation of sleep-wake homeostasis, including lack of recovery sleep and impaired behavioral adjustment to a novel task after sleep deprivation. The data suggest that mGluR5 contribute to the brain's coping mechanisms with sleep deprivation and point to a novel target to improve disturbed wakefulness and sleep.

This was the purpose of the present study. Aspects of the electroencephalogram were used to assess both cognitive workload and attentional reserve. Specifically, spectral measures of cortical activation were used to assess cognitive workload, while amplitudes of the event-related potential from the presentation of unattended "novel" sounds were used to assess attentional reserve. The relationship between these two families of measures was assessed using canonical correlation. Twenty-seven participants performed a flight simulator task under three levels of challenge. Verification of manipulation was performed using self-report measures of task demand, objective task performance, and heart rate variability using electrocardiography. Results revealed a strong, negative relationship between the spectral measures of cortical activation, believed to be representative of cognitive workload, and ERP amplitudes, believed to be representative of attentional reserve. This finding provides support for the theoretical and intuitive notion that cognitive workload and attentional reserve are inversely related. The practical implications of this result include improved state classification using advanced machine learning techniques, enhanced personnel selection/recruitment/placement, and augmented learning/training.

Half of them had a literary formation (Humanist; university students of literature) while the other half of is attending other university courses (Not Humanist). The study applied the electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms variations, the heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) during the listening of the excerpts. The neurometric indexes here employed were the Approach Withdrawal (AW), the Cerebral Effort (CE) and the Emotional indexes (EI). Results for the comparisons of the estimated AW, CE and EI related to the perception of the canticas showed as the Humanist group reported higher AW and EI values when compared to the Not Humanist sample (p < 0.03 and p < 0.01, respectively). Results suggest that the perception of the aesthetic experience is significantly modulated by the previous specific knowledge experienced by the participants. Finally, results of this kind of research could find application in the implementation of software and devices based on symbiotic relation with the perspective reader or listener of a literature opera, in order to personalize and maximize the fruition of them.

Although we reported that the magnitude of CMC varies among individuals, the physiological mechanisms underlying this variation are still unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the associations between CMC and intracortical inhibition (ICI) in the primary motor cortex (M1)/recurrent inhibition (RI) in the spinal cord, which probably affect oscillatory neural activities. Firstly, we quantified ICI from changes in motor-evoked potentials induced by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in M1 during tonic isometric voluntary contraction of the first dorsal interosseous. ICI showed a significant, negative correlation with the strength of EEG beta-oscillation, but not with the magnitude of CMC across individuals. Next, we quantified RI from changes in H-reflexes induced by paired-pulse electrical nerve stimulation to the posterior tibial nerve during isometric contraction of the soleus muscle. We observed a significant, positive correlation between RI and peak CMC across individuals. These results suggest that the local inhibitory interneuron networks in cortical and spinal levels are associated with the oscillatory activity in corticospinal loop.

The rationale for the present study was to extend the research on IAPF in the cognitive domain to IAPF in the sport domain. Specifically, the purpose of the present study was twofold: (a) to explore whether baseline IAPF is related to performance in an ice hockey shooting task and (b) to explore whether a shooting task has an effect on IAPF variability. The present investigation is one of the first studies to examine links between IAPF and sport performance. Study results did not show significant changes in IAPF when comparing baseline IAPF and pre-to post-task IAPF across three performance levels. The findings support previous literature in the cognitive domain suggesting that IAPF is a stable neurophysiological marker. Future research should consider the following methodological suggestions: (a) measuring IAPF during sport performance instead of at a resting state, (b) changing the pre-performance resting baseline instructions to take into account sport-specific mental preparation, (c) exploring an expert-novice paradigm to accentuate performance ability differences between groups (d) comparing tasks with different levels of complexity, and (e) analyzing the possible correlation between IAPF and performance on different days.

Unified neural field theory of brain dynamics underlying oscillations in Parkinson's disease and generalized epilepsies	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Neural field theory; Parkinson's disease; Epilepsy; Cortex; Thalamus; Basal ganglia	NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FIRING RATES; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; NEURONAL DISCHARGE	The mechanisms underlying pathologically synchronized neural oscillations in Parkinson's disease (PD) and generalized epilepsies are explored in parallel via a physiologically-based neural field model of the corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system. The basal ganglia (BG) are approximated as a single effective population and their roles in the modulation of oscillatory dynamics of the corticothalamic (CT) system. and vice versa are analyzed. In addition to normal EEG rhythms, enhanced activity around 4 Hz and 20 Hz exists in the model, consistent with the characteristic frequencies observed in PD. These rhythms result from resonances in loops formed between the BG and CT populations, analogous to those that underlie epileptic oscillations in a previous CF model, and which are still present in the combined CTBG system. Dopamine depletion is argued to weaken the dampening of these loop resonances in PD, and network connections then explain the significant coherence observed between BG, thalamic, and cortical population activity around 4-8 Hz and 20 Hz. Parallels between the afferent and efferent connection sites of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and BG predict low dopamine to correspond to a reduced likelihood of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, which agrees with experimental findings. Furthermore, the model predicts an increased likelihood of absence (petit mal) seizure resulting from pathologically low dopamine levels in accordance with experimental observations. Suppression of absence seizure activity is demonstrated when afferent and efferent BG connections to the CT system are strengthened, which is consistent with other CTBG modeling studies. The BG are demonstrated to have a suppressive effect on activity of the CTBG system near tonic-clonic seizure states, which provides insight into the reported efficacy of current treatments in BG circuits. Sleep states of the TRN are also found to suppress pathological PD activity in accordance with observations. Overall, the findings demonstrate strong parallels between coherent oscillations in generalized epilepsies and PD, and provide insights into possible comorbidities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

They can be labelled with the novel radiotracer [In-111]MICA-401. As the first step in exploring the applicability of [In-111]MICA-401 in tracing the mechanisms of postinjury ECM reorganization in vivo, we performed in vitro and ex vivo studies, assessing [In-111]MICA-401 distribution in the brain in two animal models: kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (KASE) and controlled cortical impact (CCI)-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: In the KASE model, in vitro autoradiography with [In-111]MICA-401 was performed at 7 days and 12 weeks post-SE. To assess seizure burden, rats were monitored using video-electroencephalography (EEG) for 1 month before the 12-week time point. In the CCI model, in vitro autoradiography was performed at 4 days and ex vivo autoradiography at 7 days post-TBI. Results: At 7 days post-SE, in vitro autoradiography revealed significantly decreased [In-111]MICA-401 binding in hippocampal CA3 subfield and extrahippocampal temporal lobe (ETL). In the chronic phase, when animals had developed spontaneous seizures, specific binding was decreased in CA3 and CA1/CA2 subfields of hippocampus, dentate gyrus, ETL, and parietal cortex. Of interest, KASE rats with the highest frequency of seizures had the lowest hippocampal [In-111]MICA-401 binding (r = -0.76, p <= 0.05). Similarly, at 4 days post-TBI, in vitro [In-111]MICA-401 binding was significantly decreased in medial and lateral perilesional cortex and ipsilateral dentate gyrus. Ex vivo autoradiography at 7 days post-TBI, however, revealed increased tracer uptake in perilesional cortex and hippocampus, which was likely related to tracer leakage due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Significance: Strong association of reduced [In-111]MICA-401 binding with seizure burden in the KASE model suggests that analysis of reduced levels of active uPA/KLK8 represents a novel biomarker candidate to be explored as a biomarker for epilepsy severity. However, limited BBB permeability of [In-111]MICA-401 currently limits its application in vivo.

Multivariate regression methods for estimating velocity of ictal discharges from human microelectrode recordings	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						epilepsy; traveling waves; multiunit activity; high gamma activity; EEG; human microelectrode recordings	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; EPILEPTOGENIC FOCI; VECTOR-FIELDS; BRAIN-SLICES; IN-VIVO; PROPAGATION; NEOCORTEX; EEG	Objective. Epileptiform discharges, an electrophysiological hallmark of seizures, can propagate across cortical tissue in a manner similar to traveling waves. Recent work has focused attention on the origination and propagation patterns of these discharges, yielding important clues to their source location and mechanism of travel. However, systematic studies of methods for measuring propagation are lacking. Approach. We analyzed epileptiform discharges in microelectrode array recordings of human seizures. The array records multiunit activity and local field potentials at 400 micron spatial resolution, from a small cortical site free of obstructions. We evaluated several computationally efficient statistical methods for calculating traveling wave velocity, benchmarking them to analyses of associated neuronal burst firing. Main results. Over 90% of discharges met statistical criteria for propagation across the sampled cortical territory. Detection rate, direction and speed estimates derived from a multiunit estimator were compared to four field potential-based estimators: negative peak, maximum descent, high gamma power, and cross-correlation. Interestingly, the methods that were computationally simplest and most efficient (negative peak and maximal descent) offer non-inferior results in predicting neuronal traveling wave velocities compared to the other two, more complex methods. Moreover, the negative peak and maximal descent methods proved to be more robust against reduced spatial sampling challenges. Using least absolute deviation in place of least squares error minimized the impact of outliers, and reduced the discrepancies between local field potential-based and multiunit estimators. Significance. Our findings suggest that ictal epileptiform discharges typically take the form of exceptionally strong, rapidly traveling waves, with propagation detectable across millimeter distances. The sequential activation of neurons in space can be inferred from clinically-observable EEG data, with a variety of straightforward computation methods available. This opens possibilities for systematic assessments of ictal discharge propagation in clinical and research settings.

J	Fan, DG; Liao, FC; Wang, QY				Fan, Denggui; Liao, Fucheng; Wang, Qingyun			The pacemaker role of thalamic reticular nucleus in controlling spike-wave discharges and spindles	CHAOS			English	Article							GENERALIZED PENICILLIN EPILEPSY; ABSENCE SEIZURES; SLEEP SPINDLES; DYNAMICS; RATS; OSCILLATION; NETWORK; EEG; DISINHIBITION; TRANSITION	Absence epilepsy, characterized by 2-4 Hz spike-wave discharges (SWDs), can be caused by pathological interactions within the thalamocortical system. Cortical spindling oscillations are also demonstrated to involve the oscillatory thalamocortical rhythms generated by the synaptic circuitry of the thalamus and cortex. This implies that SWDs and spindling oscillations can share the common thalamocortical mechanism. Additionally, the thalamic reticular nucleus (RE) is hypothesized to regulate the onsets and propagations of both the epileptic SWDs and sleep spindles. Based on the proposed single-compartment thalamocortical neural field model, we firstly investigate the stimulation effect of RE on the initiations, terminations, and transitions of SWDs. It is shown that the activations and deactivations of RE triggered by single-pulse stimuli can drive the cortical subsystem to behave as the experimentally observed onsets and self-abatements of SWDs, as well as the transitions from 2-spike and wave discharges (2-SWDs) to SWDs. In particular, with increasing inhibition from RE to the specific relay nucleus (TC), rich transition behaviors in cortex can be obtained through the upstream projection path, RE -> TC -> Cortex. Although some of the complex dynamical patterns can be expected from the earlier single compartment thalamocortical model, the effect of brain network topology on the emergence of SWDs and spindles, as well as the transitions between them, has not been fully investigated. We thereby develop a spatially extended 3-compartment coupled network model with open-/closed-end connective configurations, to investigate the spatiotemporal effect of RE on the SWDs and spindles. Results show that the degrees of activations of RE1 can induce the rich spatiotemporal evolution properties including the propagations from SWDs to spindles within different compartments and the transitions between them, through the RE1 -> TC1 -> Cortex(1) and Cortex(1) -> Cortex(2) -> Cortex(3) projecting paths, respectively. Overall, those results imply that RE possesses the pacemaker function in controlling SWDs and spindling oscillations, which computationally provide causal support for the involvement of RE in absence seizures and sleep spindles.

Neural Correlates of Explicit Versus Implicit Facial Emotion Processing in ASD	JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						ERP; Facial emotion recognition; Intentional processing; Autism; ASD	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; ASPERGERS-SYNDROME; BAND OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN; CHILDREN; ATTENTION; COHERENCE	The underlying neural mechanisms of implicit and explicit facial emotion recognition (FER) were studied in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to matched typically developing controls (TDC). EEG was obtained from N = 21 ASD and N = 16 TDC. Task performance, visual (P100, N170) and cognitive (late positive potential) event-related-potentials, as well as coherence were compared across groups. TDC showed a task-dependent increase and a stronger lateralization of P100 amplitude during the explicit task and task-dependent modulation of intra-hemispheric coherence in the beta band. In contrast, the ASD group showed no task dependent modulation. Results indicate disruptions in early visual processing and top-down attentional processes as contributing factors to FER deficits in ASD.

Previous studies indicate that spindles originate thalamically and downstates cortically, loosely grouping spindle occurrence. However, the mechanisms whereby the thalamus and cortex interact in generating these sleep phenomena remain poorly understood. Using bipolar depth recordings, we report here a sequence wherein: (1) convergent cortical downstates lead thalamic downstates; (2) thalamic downstates hyperpolarize thalamic cells, thus triggering spindles; and (3) thalamic spindles are focally projected back to cortex, arriving during the down-to-upstate transition when the cortex replays memories. Thalamic intrinsic currents, therefore, may not be continuously available during non-REM sleep, permitting the cortex to control thalamic spindling by inducing downstates. This archetypical cortico-thalamo-cortical sequence could provide the global physiological context for memory consolidation during non-REM sleep.

Several measures of connectivity estimation have already been employed to characterize functional brain networks from multivariate electrophysiological data. However, understanding the properties of each measure that lead to a better description of the real topology and capture the complex phenomena present in the brain remains challenging. In this work we compared four nonlinear connectivity measures and show that each method characterizes distinct features of brain interactions. The results suggest an invariance of global network parameters from different behavioral states and that more complete description may be reached considering local features, independently of the connectivity measure employed. Our findings also point to future perspectives in connectivity studies that combine distinct and complementary dependence measures in assembling higher dimensions manifolds.

Theoretical research has shown how neural networks can operate at different dynamic ranges that correspond to specific types of information processing. Here we present a data analysis framework that uses a linearized model of these dynamic states in order to decompose the measured neural signal into a series of components that capture both rhythmic and non-rhythmic neural activity. The method is based on stochastic differential equations and Gaussian process regression. Through computer simulations and analysis of magnetoencephalographic data, we demonstrate the efficacy of the method in identifying meaningful modulations of oscillatory signals corrupted by structured temporal and spatiotemporal noise. These results suggest that the method is particularly suitable for the analysis and interpretation of complex temporal and spatiotemporal neural signals.	[Ambrogioni, Luca; van Gerven, Marcel A.

These methods aim at functional motor rehabilitation using Brain-machine interfaces to constitute an alternate pathway from the brain to the muscles. Even in patients with absence of residual finger movements, recovery could be achieved. The extent to which these interventions are affected by individual lesion topology is yet to be understood. In this study EEG was measured in 30 chronic stroke patients during movement attempts of the paretic arm. We show that the magnitude of the event-related desynchronization was smaller in patients presenting lesions with involvement of the motor cortex. This could have important implications on the design of new rehabilitation schemes for these patients, which might benefit from carefully tailored interventions.

We have proposed Smith Predictor with improved filter for Nonlinear Hypnosis Control technique (SPNHC) to study the problem of internal body transport delay, BIS monitor calculation delay and disturbance influence in automatic drug delivery. This delay and disturbance produce high oscillation in BIS (Bispectral index derived from EEG) signal. This is the main cause of increasing patient discomfort during and after surgery due to over/under sedation. So, proposed advanced control system with time delay compensation improves the patient safety and health during/after operation and also reduces clinical expenses. Results are obtained for variable instrumental delay and surgical stimulation during surgery. Proposed method is also validated with real data.

J.; Fries, Pascal; Schmid, Michael C.; Deco, Gustavo			Linear distributed source modeling of local field potentials recorded with intra-cortical electrode arrays	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; IN-VIVO; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; NOISE; RESPONSES; CORTEX; EEG	Planar intra-cortical electrode (Utah) arrays provide a unique window into the spatial organization of cortical activity. Reconstruction of the current source density (CSD) underlying such recordings, however, requires "inverting" Poisson's equation. For inter-laminar recordings, this is commonly done by the CSD method, which consists in taking the second-order spatial derivative of the recorded local field potentials (LFPs). Although the CSD method has been tremendously successful in mapping the current generators underlying inter-laminar LFPs, its application to planar recordings is more challenging. While for inter-laminar recordings the CSD method seems reasonably robust against violations of its assumptions, is it unclear as to what extent this holds for planar recordings. One of the objectives of this study is to characterize the conditions under which the CSD method can be successfully applied to Utah array data. Using forward modeling, we find that for spatially coherent CSDs, the CSD method yields inaccurate reconstructions due to volume-conducted contamination from currents in deeper cortical layers. An alternative approach is to "invert" a constructed forward model. The advantage of this approach is that any a priori knowledge about the geometrical and electrical properties of the tissue can be taken into account. Although several inverse methods have been proposed for LFP data, the applicability of existing electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) inverse methods to LFP data is largely unexplored. Another objective of our study therefore, is to assess the applicability of the most commonly used EEG/MEG inverse methods to Utah array data. Our main conclusion is that these inverse methods provide more accurate CSD reconstructions than the CSD method. We illustrate the inverse methods using event-related potentials recorded from primary visual cortex of a macaque monkey during a motion discrimination task.

Impaired theta-gamma coupling during working memory performance in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						DLPFC; Schizophrenia; Theta-gamma coupling; Working memory	OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; INCREASES; DYNAMICS	Background: Working memory deficits represent a core feature of schizophrenia. These deficits have been associated with dysfunctional dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) cortical oscillations. Theta-gamma coupling describes the modulation of gamma oscillations by theta phasic activity that has been directly associated with the ordering of information during working memory performance. Evaluating theta-gamma coupling may provide greater insight into the neural mechanisms mediating working memory deficits in this disorder. Methods: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 38 healthy controls performed the verbal N-Back task administered at 4 levels, while EEG was recorded. Theta (4-7 Hz)-gamma(30-50 Hz) coupling was calculated for target and non-target correct trials for each working memory load. The relationship between theta-gamma coupling and accuracy was determined. Results: Theta-gamma coupling was significantly and selectively impaired during correct responses to target letters among schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. A significant and positive relationship was found between theta-gamma coupling and 3-Back accuracy in controls, while this relationship was not observed in patients. Conclusions: These findings suggest that impaired theta-gamma coupling contribute to working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia. Future work is needed to evaluate the predictive utility of theta-gamma coupling as a neurophysiological marker for functional outcomes in this disorder. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A remaining challenge for epilepsy surgery is the prospective classification of tissue sampled by individual electrode contacts. We analysed long-term invasive recordings of 20 consecutive patients who subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery. HFOs were defined prospectively by a previously validated, automated algorithm in the ripple (80-250 Hz) and the fast ripple (FR, 250-500 Hz) frequency band. Contacts with the highest rate of ripples co-occurring with FR over several five-minute time intervals designated the HFO area. The HFO area was fully included in the resected area in all 13 patients who achieved seizure freedom (specificity 100%) and in 3 patients where seizures reoccurred (negative predictive value 81%). The HFO area was only partially resected in 4 patients suffering from recurrent seizures (positive predictive value 100%, sensitivity 57%). Thus, the resection of the prospectively defined HFO area proved to be highly specific and reproducible in 13/13 patients with seizure freedom, while it may have improved the outcome in 4/7 patients with recurrent seizures. We thus validated the clinical relevance of the HFO area in the individual patient with an automated procedure. This is a prerequisite before HFOs can guide surgical treatment in multicentre studies.

MEG Based Functional Connectivity: Application of ICA to Alleviate Signal Leakage	IRBM			English	Article						MEG; Functional connectivity; ICA; Inverse solution; Signal leakage	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; EEG; ALGORITHM; DYNAMICS	Background: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides a promising, non-invasive medium for characterizing high temporal brain dynamics and functional connectivity (FC) networks. MEG based studies often include a source space signal reconstruction from the sensor data. However, spatial filters or inverse solutions that are used for source signal reconstruction induce a linear interaction between the source signals, and this phenomenon is often termed as a signal leakage. Therefore, the observed FC between the source signals may be partially or entirely due to signal leakage. In the present study, we demonstrated the usefulness of independent component analysis (ICA) to orthogonalize reconstructed source signals to suppress signal leakage before FC computation. We also compared the ICA based orthogonalization approach to commonly used linear regression, and orthogonalization in complex domain (Hipp orthogonalization) approaches. Methods: We used band-limited (i.e. alpha and beta frequency bands) amplitude time series correlation as a measure of FC. Before FC computation, the seed and test voxel time series were orthogonalized using ICA, linear regression and Hipp orthogonalization methods to suppress the signal leakage. We performed an evaluation using simulated MEG data and real resting state MEG data. Results: Analysis of simulated MEG data indicates that ICA based orthogonalization approach effectively suppressed the spurious FC due to signal leakage where the false positive rate was as per expectation. Analysis of real resting MEG signal showed that ICA based orthogonalization efficiently suppress the spurious FC for test voxels located nearby to the seed voxel where the signal leakage is very much likely. However, it didn't suppress the actual FC for test voxels located remotely from the seed voxel where the signal leakage is unlikely. Conclusion: ICA based orthogonalization offers a straightforward and efficient alternative tool to alleviate the spurious FC due to signal leakage in reconstructed MEG source signals.

However, it is not clear yet how group membership influences brain activity when a recipient evaluates the fairness of asset distribution. In this study, subjects participated as recipients in an Ultimatum Game with alleged members of both an experimentally induced ingroup and outgroup. They either received extremely unequal, moderately unequal, or equal offers from proposers while electroencephalogram was recorded. Behavioral results showed that the acceptance rates for unequal offers were higher when interacting with ingroup partners than with outgroup partners. Analyses of event related potentials revealed that proposers' group membership modulated offer evaluation at earlier processing stages. Feedback-related negativity was more negative for extremely and moderately unequal offers compared to equal offers in the ingroup interaction whereas it did not show differential responses to different offers in the outgroup interaction. Analyses of event related oscillations revealed that the theta power (4-6 Hz) was larger for moderately unequal offers than equal offers in the ingroup interaction whereas it did not show differential responses to different offers in the outgroup interaction. Thus, early mechanisms of fairness evaluation are strongly modulated by the ingroup/ outgroup membership of the interaction partner.

Electroencephalographic Evidence of Altered Top-Down Attentional Modulation in Fibromyalgia Patients During a Working Memory Task	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Fibromyalgia; Working memory; n-Back; Attention; Theta; Alpha	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; CHRONIC PAIN; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; FUNCTIONAL ROLES; EEG DYNAMICS; THETA	Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic syndrome involving widespread pain of unclear pathophysiology. FM patients frequently complain about cognitive symptoms that interfere with their daily life activities. Several studies have reported attentional deficits and working memory impairment in FM patients. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in these alterations are still poorly understood. In this study we recorded electroencephalographic activity in 32 women with FM and 30 matched controls while they performed a 2-back working memory task. We analyzed behavioural data, posterior alpha and midfrontal theta frequency power, and theta phase synchronization between midfrontal locations and the remaining scalp-recorded areas. Task performance was similar in patients and controls; however, time-frequency analysis showed a smaller decrease in the amplitude of the posterior alpha (related to attentional processing) and a smaller increase in midfrontal theta power (related to mental effort) in FM patients than in healthy controls. The FM patients also showed lower functional connectivity between midfrontal locations and rest of the scalp-recorded areas in the theta band (related to information transfer across distant brain regions when top-down control is required). To our knowledge, this is the first study relating alterations in oscillatory activity and impaired connectivity to attentional working memory complaints in FM patients. Reduced power in the theta band during performance of the task suggests that the medial frontal cortex may play an important role in the attentional deficits reported in FM.

At the same time, there are few reports on the effects of white matter damage that can be visualized in a typical MRI scan, on the brain function of schizophrenic patients. The aim of this study was to identify the specific features of the neuropsychological and neurophysiological functioning of a female patient with first-onset schizophrenia and comorbid white matter damage, which discriminated her from a healthy control and from a patient with an identical psychiatric diagnosis, but having no structural brain changes seen in an MRI scan. Identification of those features may help understand the role of subcortical brain dysfunctions in the aetiology and clinical picture of schizophrenia. Case study: The investigation encompassed clinical, neuropsychological and neurophysiological assessment of two schizophrenic patients, of whom one had comorbid white matter damage imaged by structural MRI, and a healthy control. A number of areas of cognitive functioning were examined, including the speed of information processing and executive and memory functions. Results: The study was conducted using EEG coherence analysis, power spectral density, and energy evaluation of neuronal activity with the Matching Pursuit algorithm. The study showed that, despite the fact that there were no differences in the psychopathological pictures of the schizophrenic patients, the neuropsychological and neurophysiological differences between them were substantial and related to the profile of cognitive impairments and the specific features of the brain function of the patient with abnormalities in the white matter: that patient's EEG showed discoherence in the anterior part of the brain, reduced diversity of the dominant frequency of neuronal activity, and pathologically increased energy parameters for low-frequency bands. Conclusions: Comorbidity of white matter damage with schizophrenia has a potentially significant effect on cerebral activity giving rise to specific information processing deficits. Further research in this area should be conducted with a view to determining biomarkers of mental diseases and improving the validity of clinical psychiatric diagnosis.

However, much less is known about the functional connectivity within this neural network and its modulation according to manipulations of task complexity. Here, we assessed neural activity via high density electroencephalography, focussing on changes of activity in the beta frequency band (similar to 15-30 Hz) across the motor network in 26 young adult participants (19-29 years old). We investigated how network connectivity was modulated with task difficulty and errors of performance during a bimanual visuomotor movement consisting of dial rotation according to three different ratios of speed: an isofrequency movement (1:1), a non-isofrequency movement with the right hand keeping the fast pace (1:3), and the converse ratio with the left hand keeping the fast pace (3:1). To quantify functional coupling, we determined neural synchronization which might be key for the timing of the activity within brain regions during task execution. Individual source activity with realistic head models was reconstructed at seven regions of interest including frontal and parietal areas, among which we estimated phase-based connectivity. Partial least squares analysis revealed a significant modulation of connectivity with task difficulty, and significant correlations between connectivity and errors in performance, in particular between sensorimotor cortices. Our findings suggest that modulation of long-range synchronization is instrumental for coping with increasing task demands in bimanual coordination.	[Rueda-Delgado, L.

However, in humans the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying balance control are still unclear. Specifically, although previous studies have identified a number of cortical regions that become significantly activated during real or imagined balancing, the interactions within and between the relevant cortical regions remain to be investigated. The working hypothesis of this study is that cortical networks contribute to an optimization of balance control, and that this contribution can be revealed by partial directed coherence-a time-variant, frequency-selective and directed functional connectivity analysis tool. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 37 subjects during single-leg balancing on a stable as well as an unstable surface. Results of this study show that in the transition from balancing on a stable surface to an unstable surface, two topographically delimitable connectivity networks (weighted directed networks) are established; one associated with the alpha and one with the theta frequency band. The theta network sequence can be described as a set of subnetworks (modules) comprising the frontal, central and parietal cortex with individual temporal and spatial developments within and between those modules. In the alpha network, the occipital electrodes O1 and O2 act as a source, and the interactions propagate predominantly in the directions from occipital to parietal and to centro-parietal areas. These important findings indicate that balance control is supported by at least two functional cortical networks.

We describe here a novel, region-specific focal seizure pattern that mimics seizure activity observed in a subpopulation of patients submitted to presurgical monitoring with intracerebral electrodes. Distinctive seizure-like events (SLEs) are induced in the olfactory regions by acute treatment of both tangential brain slices and the isolated guinea pig brain with the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine. Analysis of field potentials, intracellular activities, and extracellular potassium changes demonstrates that SLEs in the piriform cortex initiate in the superficial layer 1 lacking principal neurons with an activity-dependent increase of extracellular potassium. SLE progression (but not onset) does not require the participation of synaptic transmission and is mediated by diffusion of potassium to deep cortical layers. The novel seizure pattern here described is not observed in other cortical regions; it is proposed to rely on the peculiar organization of the superficial piriform cortex layers, which are characterized by unmyelinated axons and perisynaptic astroglial envelopes. This study reveals a sequence of ictogenic events in the olfactory cortex that were never described before in other cortical structures and supports the notion that altered potassium homeostasis and unmyelinated fibers may represent a potential vehicle for focal ictogenesis.

This is particularly true for brain networks, as the brain functioning is thought to be based on a modular organization. In the last decades, many clustering algorithms were developed with the aim to identify communities in networks of different nature. However, there is still no agreement about which one is the most reliable, and to test and compare these algorithms under a variety of conditions would be beneficial to potential users. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis between six different clustering algorithms, analyzing their performances on a ground-truth consisting of simulated networks with properties spanning a wide range of conditions. Results show the effect of factors like the noise level, the number of clusters, the network dimension and density on the performances of the algorithms and provide some guidelines about the use of the more appropriate algorithm according to the different conditions. The best performances under a wide range of conditions were obtained by Louvain and Leicht & Newman algorithms, while Ronhovde and Infomap proved to be more appropriate in very noisy conditions. Finally, as a proof of concept, we applied the algorithms under exam to brain functional connectivity networks obtained from EEG signals recorded during a sustained movement of the right hand, obtaining a clustering of scalp electrodes which agrees with the results of the simulation study conducted.

A normal hearing adult sample (n= 15) performed an active oddball task at three consecutive time points (TPs) arranged at two week intervals, and during which EEG was recorded. The stimuli comprised of syllables consisting of a natural fricative (/sh/,/s/,/f/) embedded between two /a/ sounds, as well as morphed transitions of the two syllables that served as deviants. Perceptual and cognitive modulations as reflected in the onset and the mean global field power (GFP) of N2b- and P3b-related microstates across four weeks were investigated. We found that the onset of P3b-like microstates, but not N2b-like microstates decreased across TPs, more strongly for difficult deviants leading to similar onsets for difficult and easy stimuli after repeated exposure. The mean GFP of all N2b-like and P3b-like microstates increased more in spectrally strong deviants compared to weak deviants, leading to a distinctive activation for each stimulus after learning. Our results indicate that longitudinal training of auditory-related cognitive mechanisms such as stimulus categorization, attention and memory updating processes are an indispensable part of successful auditory learning. This suggests that future studies should focus on the potential benefits of cognitive processes in auditory training. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite many reports of enhanced brain activity during multisensory conditions, it remains unclear which dynamic processes implement the multisensory benefit for an upcoming decision in the human brain. Specifically, it remains difficult to attribute perceptual benefits to specific processes, such as early sensory encoding, the transformation of sensory representations into a motor response, or to more unspecific processes such as attention. We combined an audio-visual motion discrimination task with the single-trial mapping of dynamic sensory representations in EEG activity to localize when and where multisensory congruency facilitates perceptual accuracy. Our results show that a congruent sound facilitates the encoding of motion direction in occipital sensory - as opposed to parieto-frontal - cortices, and facilitates later - as opposed to early (i.e. below 100 ms) - sensory activations. This multisensory enhancement was visible as an earlier rise of motion-sensitive activity in middle-occipital regions about 350 ms from stimulus onset, which reflected the better discriminability of motion direction from brain activity and correlated with the perceptual benefit provided by congruent multisensory information. This supports a hierarchical model of multisensory integration in which the enhancement of relevant sensory cortical representations is transformed into a more accurate choice.

This implies that embedding incongruous information in newly formed relational structures would have little effect on their previous emotive properties. Alternatively, Relational Frame Theory highlights the importance of contextualized stimulus-stimulus relations, where the structure of a relational series is key in determining the function of its elements. To see whether series membership can mitigate dissonance' when a salient element is employed, the present investigation trained and tested a seven-term relational series (X>A>B>C>D>E>Y) using blurred faces as stimuli. Specifically, Stimuli X, A, B, D, E and Y were blurred unfamiliar faces and Stimulus C constituted of the participant's own blurred face, assumed to be more salient than the former. To assess how the valences of the related stimuli were transformed by relational series membership, self-report ratings and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were collected before and after training the X>A>B>C>D>E>Y series. These pre vs. post contrasts revealed that, for unfamiliar faces, stimulus valence transformed as a function of relational structure. Conversely, the lack of difference in pre vs. post contrasts of Stimulus C, which maintained a high valence, suggest that relational series membership may not suffice to mitigate emotionally dissonant information.

The objective was to explore spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in subjects with a first-ever seizure and patients with new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and to find characteristic biomarkers for seizure recurrence after the first seizure. Methods: We examined 17 first-seizure subjects, 19 patients with new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and 18 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical investigation and received electroencephalography and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The BOLD time series were analyzed in terms of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs). Results: We found significantly stronger amplitudes (higher fALFFs) in patients with NOE relative to first-seizure subjects and healthy controls. The frequency range of 73-198 mHz (slow-3 subband) appeared most useful for discriminating patients with NOE from first-seizure subjects. The ReHo measure did not show any significant differences. Significance: The fALFF appears to be a noninvasive measure that characterizes spontaneous BOLD fluctuations and shows stronger amplitudes in the slow-3 subband of patients with NOE relative first-seizure subjects and healthy controls. A larger study population with follow-up is required to determine whether fALFF holds promise as a potential biomarker for identifying subjects at increased risk to develop epilepsy.

Evaluation of cognitive behavior among deaf subjects with video game as intervention	COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Video game; Cognitive enhancement; EEG; Mean reaction time (mRT); Stroop test; Draw-A-Person test	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; ADAPTIVE AUTOMATION SYSTEM; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR; VIOLENT; ALPHA; THETA; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION	Previous research on video gaming mainly focused on negative impact on users. In this study, the positive impact of action video gaming among congenitally deaf subjects is investigated. Subjects possessed high level of visual information processing capacity. A 96 h of action video game play resulted in the improvement of mean reaction time (mRT) (post = 413.21 ms, pre = 453.39 ms) and certain cognitive functions. Higher heart rate variability (HRV) subjects demonstrated faster and significant improvement in mRT (p < 0.0045) after intervention. The alpha and beta EEG band powers were found increased in parietal (6.33%, 4.28%) and occipital (8.38%, 38%) lobes respectively. The theta band power increased in frontal (32%) and parietal (13%) lobes. These results can reflect enhancement in certain cognitive performances such as visual perception, attention, memory, and motor skills. The ratio index beta/(alpha + theta) increased in frontal and occipital lobes while beta/theta increased in frontal and temporal lobes. These results may also suggest improvements in attention processing capacity and neural activity. These results implies improvements in certain aspects of cognition among deaf subjects. However, to validate these results a further study on larger number of samples with advanced computerized cognitive battery testing can be employed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seven out of 25 Sprague-Dawley rats experiencing 1 h of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) began treatment with allopregnanolone (9.6-12.8 mg/kg/day) on the following day. On day 4 after SE, video-depth EEG recordings from the hippocampal CA3 subfield and the entorhinal cortex were initiated and continued for 12 consecutive days. We found that 66.7% (12/18) of untreated animals exhibited seizures compared to 28.6% (2/7) of allopregnanolone-treated animals. Interictal spikes occurred less frequently in the CA3 subfield of allopregnanolone-treated rats (n = 4) than in untreated animals presenting (n = 4) or not presenting (n = 4) with spontaneous seizures (p < 0.05), and were less frequent in the entorhinal cortex compared to both untreated groups (p < 0.05). Finally, allopregnanolone-treated rats had significantly lower rates of interictal spikes with fast ripples (250-500 Hz) compared to untreated animals but only in CA3 (p < 0.05). Our findings show that allopregnanolone reduces the frequency of interictal spikes and fast ripples in CA3, a structure that plays an important role in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. Neurosteroids may therefore influence pathological network activity leading to spontaneous seizures following pilocarpine-induced SE. Recordings after termination of allopregnanolone treatment will be however required to establish whether allopregnanolone exerts disease-modifying properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using recordings of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), this study investigated how selective attention facilitates the cortical representation of target speech under a simulated "cocktail-party" listening condition with speech-on-speech masking. The result shows that the cortical representation of target-speech signals under the multiple-people talking condition was specifically improved by selective attention relative to the non-selective-attention listening condition, and the beta-band activity was most strongly modulated by selective attention. Moreover, measured with the Granger Causality value, selective attention to the single target speech in the mixed-speech complex enhanced the following four causal connectivities for the beta-band oscillation: the ones (1) from site FT7 to the right motor area, (2) from the left frontal area to the right motor area, (3) from the central frontal area to the right motor area, and (4) from the central frontal area to the right frontal area. However, the selective-attention-induced change in beta-band causal connectivity from the central frontal area to the right motor area, but not other beta-band causal connectivities, was significantly correlated with the selective-attention-induced change in the cortical beta-band representation of target speech. These findings suggest that under the "cocktail-party" listening condition, the beta-band oscillation in EEGs to target speech is specifically facilitated by selective attention to the target speech that is embedded in the mixed-speech complex. The selective attention-induced unmasking of target speech may be associated with the improved beta-band functional connectivity from the central frontal area to the right motor area, suggesting a top-down attentional modulation of the speech-motor process.

Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes mainly from studies investigating neuronal activity on a short time-scale of seconds. However, a key aspect of criticality is presence of scale-free temporal dependencies occurring across a wide range of time-scales. Indeed, robust long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) are found in neuronal oscillations during conscious states, but it is not known how LRTCs are affected by loss of consciousness. To further test a relation between critical dynamics and consciousness, we investigated LRTCs in electrocorticography signals recorded from four macaque monkeys during resting wakefulness and general anesthesia induced by various anesthetics (ketamine, medetomidine, or propofol). Detrended Fluctuation Analysis was used to estimate LRTCs in amplitude fluctuations (envelopes) of band-pass filtered signals. We demonstrate two main findings. First, during conscious states all lateral cortical regions are characterized by significant LRTCs of alpha-band activity (7-14 Hz). LRTCs are stronger in the eyes-open than eyes-closed state, but in both states they form a spatial gradient, with anterior brain regions exhibiting stronger LRTCs than posterior regions. Second, we observed a substantial decrease of LRTCs during loss of consciousness, the magnitude of which was associated with the baseline (i.e. pre-anesthesia) state of the brain. Specifically, brain regions characterized by strongest LRTCs during a wakeful baseline exhibited greatest decreases during anesthesia (i.e. "the rich got poorer"), which consequently disturbed the posterior-anterior gradient. Therefore, our results suggest that general anesthesia affects mainly brain areas characterized by strongest LRTCs during wakefulness, which might account for lack of capacities for extensive temporal integration during loss of consciousness.

J	Nguyen, T; Kuntzelman, K; Miskovic, V				Nguyen, Thomas; Kuntzelman, Karl; Miskovic, Vladimir			Entrainment of visual steady-state responses is modulated by global spatial statistics	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						entrainment; image amplitude; image statistics; spatial structure; steady-state visual evoked response	NATURAL IMAGE STATISTICS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; NEURAL SIGNATURE; SIMPLE CELLS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULI; PERCEPTION; FLICKER; SCENES	The rhythmic delivery of visual stimuli evokes large-scale neuronal entrainment in the form of steady-state oscillatory field potentials. The spatiotemporal properties of stimulus drive appear to constrain the relative degrees of neuronal entrainment. Specific frequency ranges, for example, are uniquely suited for enhancing the strength of stimulus-driven brain oscillations. When it comes to the nature of the visual stimulus itself, studies have used a plethora of inputs ranging from spatially unstructured empty fields to simple contrast patterns (checkerboards, gratings, stripes) and complex arrays (human faces, houses, natural scenes). At present, little is known about how the global spatial statistics of the input stimulus influence entrainment of scalp-recorded electrophysiological signals. In this study, we used rhythmic entrainment source separation of scalp EEG to compare stimulus-driven phase alignment for distinct classes of visual inputs, including broadband spatial noise ensembles with varying second-order statistics, natural scenes, and narrowband sine-wave gratings delivered at a constant flicker frequency. The relative magnitude of visual entrainment was modulated by the global properties of the driving stimulus. Entrainment was strongest for pseudo-naturalistic broadband visual noise patterns in which luminance contrast is greatest at low spatial frequencies (a power spectrum slope characterized by 1/f(-2)). NEW & NOTEWORTHY Rhythmically modulated visual stimuli entrain the activity of neuronal populations, but the effect of global stimulus statistics on this entrainment is unknown. We assessed entrainment evoked by 1) visual noise ensembles with different spectral slopes, 2) complex natural scenes, and 3) narrowband sinusoidal gratings. Entrainment was most effective for broadband noise with naturalistic luminance contrast. This reveals some global properties shaping stimulus-driven brain oscillations in the human visual system.

Development and genetics of brain temporal stability related to attention problems in adolescent twins	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Twin study; Temporal dynamics; Brain maturation; ADHD	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RATING-SCALES; RANGE; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; ADHD	The brain continuously develops and reorganizes to support an expanding repertoire of behaviors and increasingly complex cognition. These processes may, however, also result in the appearance or disappearance of specific neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention problems. To investigate whether brain activity changed during adolescence, how genetics shape this change, and how these changes were related to attention problems, we measured EEG activity in 759 twins and siblings, assessed longitudinally in four waves (12, 14, 16, and 18 years of age). Attention problems were assessed with the SWAN at waves 12,14, and 16. To characterize functional brain development, we used a measure of temporal stability (TS) of brain oscillations over the recording time of 5 min reflecting the tendency of a brain to maintain the same oscillatory state for longer or shorter periods. Increased TS may reflect the brain's tendency to maintain stability, achieve focused attention, and thus reduce "mind wandering" and attention problems. The results indicate that brain TS is increased across the scalp from 12 to 18. TS showed large individual differences that were heritable. Change in TS (alpha oscillations) was heritable between 12 and 14 and between 14 and 16 for the frontal brain areas. Absolute levels of brain TS at each wave were positively correlated with attention problems but not significantly. High and low attention problems subjects showed different developmental trajectories in TS, which was significant in a cluster of frontal leads. These results indicate that trajectories in brain TS development are a biomarker for the developing brain. TS in brain oscillations is highly heritable, and age-related change in TS is also heritable in selected brain areas. These results suggest that high and low attention problems subjects are at different stages of brain development. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Smit, Dirk J.

When listeners attempt to process and retain acoustically degraded speech, alpha power enhances. It is unclear whether these alpha modulations reflect the degree of acoustic degradation per se or the degradation-driven demand to a listener's attentional control. Using an irrelevant-speech paradigm and measuring the electroencephalogram (EEG), the current experiment demonstrates that the neural alpha response to speech is a surprisingly clear proxy of top-down control, entirely driven by the listening goals of attending versus ignoring degraded speech. While (n = 23) listeners retained the serial order of 9 to-be-recalled digits, one to-be-ignored sentence was presented. Distractibility of the to-be-ignored sentence parametrically varied in acoustic detail (noise-vocoding), with more acoustic detail of distracting speech increasingly disrupting listeners' serial memory recall. Where previous studies had observed decreases in parietal and auditory alpha power with more acoustic detail (of target speech), alpha power here showed the opposite pattern and increased with more acoustic detail in the speech distractor. In sum, the neural alpha response reflects almost exclusively a listener's goal, which is decisive for whether more acoustic detail facilitates comprehension (of attended speech) or enhances distraction (of ignored speech).

The parallel, event-based data processing in SpiNNaker makes it viable for building massively parallel neuro-computational frameworks. The LGN model has 140 neurons representing a "basic building block" for larger modular architectures. The motivation of this work is to simulate biologically plausible LGN dynamics on SpiNNaker. Synaptic layout of the model is consistent with biology. The model response is validated with existing literature reporting entrainment in steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-brain oscillations corresponding to periodic visual stimuli recorded via electroencephalography (EEG). Periodic stimulus to the model is provided by: a synthetic spike-train with inter-spike-intervals in the range 10-50 Hz at a resolution of 1 Hz; and spike-train output from a state-of-the-art electronic retina subjected to a light emitting diode flashing at 10, 20, and 40 Hz, simulating real-world visual stimulus to the model. The resolution of simulation is 0.1 ms to ensure solution accuracy for the underlying differential equations defining Izhikevichs neuron model. Under this constraint, 1 s of model simulation time is executed in 10 s real time on SpiNNaker; this is because simulations on SpiNNaker work in real time for time-steps dt >= 1 ms. The model output shows entrainment with both sets of input and contains harmonic components of the fundamental frequency. However, suppressing the feed-forward inhibition in the circuit produces subharmonics within the gamma band (> 30 Hz) implying a reduced information transmission fidelity. These model predictions agree with recent lumped-parameter computational model-based predictions, using conventional computers. Scalability of the framework is demonstrated by a multi-node architecture consisting of three "nodes," where each node is the " basic building block" LGN model. This 420 neuron model is tested with synthetic periodic stimulus at 10 Hz to all the nodes. The model output is the average of the outputs from all nodes, and conforms to the above-mentioned predictions of each node. Power consumption for model simulation on SpiNNaker is << 1 W.

Three database searches were conducted: PubMed, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. Studies from the last decade that used physiological measures of cognitive workload in older adults (mean age > 65 years-old) were reviewed. The cognitive workload of healthy older individuals was compared with the cognitive workload of younger adults, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The most common measures of cognitive workload included: electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, pupillometry, and heart rate variability. These physiological measures consistently showed greater cognitive workload in healthy older adults compared to younger adults when performing the same task. The same was observed in patients with MCI compared to healthy older adults. Behavioral performance declined when the available cognitive resources became insufficient to cope with the cognitive demands of a task, such as in AD. These findings may have implications for clinical practice and future cognitive interventions.

Notably, the aging ST, which largely influences older adults' cognitive ability, mental and physical health, did not receive much attention. In order to investigate these issues, electroencephalogram (EEG) data were obtained from older adults during a modified Stroop task using neutral words, positive and negative self-concept words in aging ST vs. neutral control conditions. Results showed longer reaction times (RTs) for identifying colors of words under the aging ST compared to the neutral condition. More importantly, the negative self-concept elicited more positive late P300 amplitudes and enhanced theta band activities compared to the positive self-concept or neutral words under the aging ST condition, whereas no difference was found between these self-concepts and neutral words in the control condition. Furthermore, the aging ST induced smaller theta band synchronization and enhanced alpha band synchronization compared to the control condition. Moreover, we also observed valence differences in self-concepts where the negative self-concept words reduced early P150/N170 complex relative to neutral words. These findings suggest that priming ST could activate negative self-concepts as current working self-concept, and that this influence occurred during a late neural time course.

Experience-dependent modulation of alpha and beta during action observation and motor imagery	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Motor imagery; Action observation; Dance; Plasticity; Alpha; Beta; Sensorimotor; Expertise; Familiarity	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; ACTION OBSERVATION NETWORK; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BAND OSCILLATIONS; MENTAL-IMAGERY; DANCE; MOVEMENTS; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION	Background: EEG studies investigating the neural networks that facilitate action observation (AO) and kinaesthetic motor imagery (KMI) have shown reduced, or desynchronized, power in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands relative to rest, reflecting efficient activation of task-relevant areas. Functional modulation of these networks through expertise in dance has been established using fMRI, with greater activation among experts during AO. While there is evidence for experience-dependent plasticity of alpha power during AO of dance, the influence of familiarity on beta power during AO, and alpha and beta activity during KMI, remain unclear. The purpose of the present study was to measure the impact of familiarity on confidence ratings and EEG activity during (1) AO of a brief ballet sequence, (2) KMI of this same sequence, and (3) KMI of non-dance movements among ballet dancers, dancers from other genres, and non-dancers. Results: Ballet dancers highly familiar with the genre of the experimental stimulus demonstrated higher individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF), greater alpha desynchronization, and greater task-related beta power during AO, as well as faster iAPF during KMI of non-dance movements. While no between-group differences in alpha or beta power were observed during KMI of dance or non-dance movements, all participants showed significant desynchronization relative to baseline, and further desynchronization during dance KMI relative to non-dance KMI indicative of greater cognitive load. Conclusions: These findings confirm and extend evidence for experience-dependent plasticity of alpha and beta activity during AO of dance and KMI. We also provide novel evidence for modulation of iAPF that is faster when tuned to the specific motor repertoire of the observer. By considering the multiple functional roles of these frequency bands during the same task (AO), we have disentangled the compounded contribution of familiarity and expertise to alpha desynchronization for mediating task engagement among familiar ballet dancers and reflecting task difficulty among unfamiliar non-dance subjects, respectively. That KMI of a complex dance sequence relative to everyday, non-dance movements recruits greater cognitive resources suggests it may be a more powerful tool in driving neural plasticity of action networks, especially among the elderly and those with movement disorders.

In heterologous systems, LTG inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which contribute to kainic-acid-(KA) induced epilepsy in vivo. To gain insight into the role of R-type currents in LTG drug action in vivo, we compared the effects of LTG to topiramate and lacosamide in Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice and controls on KA-induced seizures. Methods: Behavioral seizure rating and quantitative electrocorticography were performed after injection of 20 mg/kg [and 30 mg/kg] KA. One hour before KA injection, mice were pretreated with either 30 mg/kg LTG, 50 mg/kg topiramate (TPM) or 30 mg/kg lacosamide (LSM). Results: Ablation of Ca(v)2.3 reduced total seizure scores by 28.6% (p= 0.0012) and pretreatment with LTG reduced seizure activity of control mice by 23.2% (p= 0.02). In Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice LTG pretreatment increased seizure activity by 22.1% (p= 0.018) and increased the percentage of degenerated CA1 pyramidal neurons (p= 0.02). All three tested AEDs reduced seizure activity in control mice, however only the non-calcium channel modulating AED, LSM had an anticonvulsive effect in Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice. Furthermore LTG altered electrocorticographic parameters differently in the two genotypes, decreasing relative power of ictal spikes in control mice compared to Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice. Conclusion: These findings give first in vivo evidence for an essential role for Ca(v)2.3 in LTG pharmacology and shed light on a paradoxical effect of LTG in their absence. Furthermore, LTG appears to promote ictal activity in Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice resulting in increased neurotoxicity in the CA1 region. This paradoxical mechanism, possibly reflecting rebound hyperexcitation of pyramidal CA1 neurons after increased inhibition, may be key in understanding LTG-induced seizure aggravation, observed in clinical practice.

In this study, we provide an analysis of efficacy, side effects and seizure outcomes after VNS implantation for patients with DRE. Method: We retrospectively examined 17 adult cases (M/F: 12/5) with DRE that received VNS treatment in our center from 2001 to May 2014 and analyzed the following parameters: age of patient receiving VNS, seizure frequency before and after VNS as well as treatment duration and etiological parameters of epilepsy. Results: The well response rate was 58.8% (10/17). The mean age at the time of receiving VNS was 17.4 years, seizure frequency before and after VNS were 28.5/16.4. Epilepsy was caused by a structural or metabolic disorder of the brain: neoplasm, infarct, trauma, mesial temporal sclerosis and encephalitis, in eleven patients (64.7%). The well response rate was (7/11) 63.6% in this group. The well response rate was 50% (3/6) in the genetic or unknown etiology group. The EEG lateralization has the best predictive value for efficacy (p:0.007). In 2 patients with focal motor seizures, 75% and 86.6% seizure reductions were achieved whereas the percentage was 66.7% in the patient with startle epilepsy. Conclusions: VNS is a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for DRE, the best results observed in patient with focal motor and startle epilepsy. Patients with bilateral epileptiform abnormality were seen to have better prognosis with VNS.

Evidence for causal top-down frontal contributions to predictive processes in speech perception	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PRIMARY-PROGRESSIVE-APHASIA; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INTERACTIVE PROCESSES; SENSORY ATTENUATION; DEGRADED SPEECH; BROCAS AREA; EEG; LANGUAGE; OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION	Perception relies on the integration of sensory information and prior expectations. Here we show that selective neurodegeneration of human frontal speech regions results in delayed reconciliation of predictions in temporal cortex. These temporal regions were not atrophic, displayed normal evoked magnetic and electrical power, and preserved neural sensitivity to manipulations of sensory detail. Frontal neurodegeneration does not prevent the perceptual effects of contextual information; instead, prior expectations are applied inflexibly. The precision of predictions correlates with beta power, in line with theoretical models of the neural instantiation of predictive coding. Fronto-temporal interactions are enhanced while participants reconcile prior predictions with degraded sensory signals. Excessively precise predictions can explain several challenging phenomena in frontal aphasias, including agrammatism and subjective difficulties with speech perception. This work demonstrates that higher-level frontal mechanisms for cognitive and behavioural flexibility make a causal functional contribution to the hierarchical generative models underlying speech perception.

Here, magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded in the resting state is used to discriminate between healthy subjects and patients with either idiopathic generalized epilepsy or frontal focal epilepsy. Signal features extracted from interictal periods without any epileptiform activity are used to train a machine learning algorithm to draw a diagnosis. This is potentially relevant to patients without frequent or easily detectable spikes. To analyze the data, we use an up-to-date machine learning algorithm and explore the benefits of including different features obtained from the MEG data as inputs to the algorithm. We find that the relative power spectral density of the MEG time-series is sufficient to distinguish between healthy and epileptic subjects with a high prediction accuracy. We also find that a combination of features such as the phase locked value and the relative power spectral density allow to discriminate generalized and focal epilepsy, when these features are calculated over a filtered version of the signals in certain frequency bands. Machine learning algorithms are currently being applied to the analysis and classification of brain signals. It is, however, less evident to identify the proper features of these signals that are prone to be used in such machine learning algorithms. Here, we evaluate the influence of the input feature selection on a clinical scenario to distinguish between healthy and epileptic subjects. Our results indicate that such distinction is possible with a high accuracy (86%), allowing the discrimination between idiopathic generalized and frontal focal epilepsy types.

Whereas some studies have reported that BOLD signals measured in visual cortex are tightly linked to neural activity in the narrow band gamma (NBG) range, others have found a weak correlation between the two. To elucidate the mechanisms behind these conflicting findings, we hypothesized that BOLD reflects the strength of synaptic inputs to cortex, whereas NBG is more dependent on how well these inputs are correlated. To test this, we measured NBG, BOLD, and cerebral blood flow responses to stimuli that either correlate or decorrelate neural activity in human visual cortex. Next, we simulated a recurrent network model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that reproduced in detail the experimental NBG and BOLD data. Results show that the visually evoked BOLD response was solely predicted by the sum of local inputs, whereas NBG was critically dependent on how well these inputs were correlated. In summary, the NBG-BOLD relationship strongly depends on the nature of sensory input to cortex: stimuli that increase the number of correlated inputs to visual cortex will increase NBG and BOLD in a similar manner, whereas stimuli that increase the number of decorrelated inputs will dissociate the two. The NBG-BOLD relationship is therefore not fixed but is rather highly dependent on input correlations that are both stimulus- and state-dependent.

Early and late components of EEG delay activity correlate differently with scene working memory performance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALPHA-ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; SHORT-TERM; THETA; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MAINTENANCE; DYNAMICS; CORTEX	Sustained and elevated activity during the working memory delay period has long been considered the primary neural correlate for maintaining information over short time intervals. This idea has recently been reinterpreted in light of findings generated from multiple neural recording modalities and levels of analysis. To further investigate the sustained or transient nature of activity, the temporal-spectral evolution (TSE) of delay period activity was examined in humans with high density EEG during performance of a Sternberg working memory paradigm with a relatively long six second delay and with novel scenes as stimuli. Multiple analyses were conducted using different trial window durations and different baseline periods for TSE computation. Sensor level analyses revealed transient rather than sustained activity during delay periods. Specifically, the consistent finding among the analyses was that high amplitude activity encompassing the theta range was found early in the first three seconds of the delay period. These increases in activity early in the delay period correlated positively with subsequent ability to distinguish new from old probe scenes. Source level signal estimation implicated a right parietal region of transient early delay activity that correlated positively with working memory ability. This pattern of results adds to recent evidence that transient rather than sustained delay period activity supports visual working memory performance. The findings are discussed in relation to synchronous and desynchronous intra-and inter-regional neural transmission, and choosing an optimal baseline for expressing temporal-spectral delay activity change.

But it is not known how these signals integrate with each other and how this depends on the perceived stimuli's predictability. 'Predictive coding' theories describe this integration in terms of how well top-down predictions fit with bottom-up sensory input. Identifying neural markers for such signal integration is therefore essential for the study of perception and predictive coding theories. To achieve this, we combined EEG methods that preferentially tag different levels in the visual hierarchy. Importantly, we examined intermodulation components as a measure of integration between these signals. Our results link the different signals to core aspects of predictive coding, and suggest that top-down predictions indeed integrate with bottom-up signals in a manner that is modulated by the predictability of the sensory input, providing evidence for predictive coding and opening new avenues to studying such interactions in perception.

Inhibitory control, a core executive function, is demanded by the Stroop task. This study aimed to assess the interaction between electroencephalographic activity and HRV of 50 healthy undergraduate students while performing a computerized version of the Stroop task with three stages (paradigmatic congruent - CS - and incongruent - IS - stages in addition to a stage in which words were phonetically similar to color names - PSS). Behavioral results suggested a Stroop interference effect among the stages, with greater difficulty in IS followed by PSS. A pattern of cortical activation in a frontoparietal gradient with left lateralization and involvement of the prefrontal, temporal and occipital cortices was found especially in IS and PSS, which might be correlated to executive control of behavior, inhibitory control, mental representation of words, preparation of the verbal response, and processing of visual stimuli. Mean power of brain activity (mu V) was higher for IS and PSS for all tested frequency oscillations. HRV parameters of SDNN and pNN50 were smaller in PSS compared to the other stages, while rMSSD was higher for CS, suggesting higher mental stress for IS and PSS. During PSS, LF/HF ratio was negatively correlated with EEG power in frontal, central and temporal regions whilst rMSSD was positively correlated with activity in frontal and parietal regions. Therefore, marked prefrontal cortex activity was associated with parasympathetic dominance, which is in line with the integrated inhibitory neural network model. In summation, the execution of the Stroop task required increased recruitment of prefrontal cortical areas and led to high mental stress, but, as it was associated with parasympathetic dominance of HRV control, conflict was solved and subjects behaved successfully.

Persistent aberrant cortical phase-amplitude coupling following seizure treatment in absence epilepsy models	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						comodulogram; stargazer; tottering	OSCILLATIONS; MOUSE; STARGAZER; ATTENTION; MUTANT; POWER; MICE; WAVE	In childhood absence epilepsy, cortical seizures are brief and intermittent; however there are extended periods without behavioural or electrographic ictal events. This genetic disorder is associated with variable degrees of cognitive dysfunction, but no consistent functional biomarkers that might provide insight into interictal cortical function have been described. Previous work in monogenic mouse models of absence epilepsy have shown that the interictal EEG displays augmented beta/gamma power in homozygous stargazer (stg/stg) mice bearing a presynaptic AMPA receptor defect, but not homozygous tottering (tg/tg) mice with a P/Q type calcium channel mutation. To further evaluate the interictal EEG, we quantified phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in stg/stg, stg/+, tg/tg and wild-type (+/+) mice. We found distinct gene-linked patterns of aberrant PAC in stg/stg and tg/tg mice compared to +/+ and stg/+ mice. Treatment with ethosuximide significantly blocks seizures in both stg/stg and tg/tg, but the abnormal PAC remains. Stg/+ mice are seizure free with normal baseline beta/gamma power and normal theta-gamma PAC, but like stg/stg mice, beta/gamma power is significantly reduced by NMDA receptor blockade, a treatment that paradoxically enhances seizures in stg/stg mice. Stg/+ mice, therefore, have a latent cortical network phenotype that is veiled by NMDA-mediated neurotransmission. Altogether, these findings reveal gene-linked quantitative electrographic biomarkers in the absence of epileptiform activity and provide a potential network correlate for persistent cognitive deficits in absence epilepsy despite effective treatment.

Neurofeedback is a promising noninvasive approach for modifying human brain oscillation and can be utilized in developing skills for self-regulation of brain activity. So far, the effectiveness of neurofeedback has been evaluated with regard to not only its application in clinical populations but also the enhancement of performance in general. However, reviews of the application of neurofeedback training in the sports domain are absent, although this application goes back to 1991, when it was first applied in archery. Sport scientists have shown an increasing interest in this topic in recent years. This article provides an overview of empirical studies examining the effects of neurofeedback in sports and evaluates these studies against cardinal and methodological criteria. Furthermore, it includes guidelines and suggestions for future evaluations of neurofeedback training in sports. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Schneider, D; Barth, A; Wascher, E				Schneider, Daniel; Barth, Anna; Wascher, Edmund			On the contribution of motor planning to the retroactive cuing benefit in working memory: Evidence by mu and beta oscillatory activity in the EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Working memory; Attention; Retro-cue; Alpha oscillation; Mu/beta suppression; Motor planning	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ORIENTING ATTENTION; RETRO-CUES; MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; ALPHA; INFORMATION; DYNAMICS; INTERFERENCE	Attention can be allocated toward mental representations in working memory also after the initial encoding of information has been completed. It was shown that focusing on only one item within working memory transfers this representation into a protected state, reducing its susceptibility to interference by incoming signals. The present study investigated the nature of this retroactive cue (retro-cue) benefit by means of oscillatory activity in the EEG. In a working memory task with a retro-cue indicating one, two or three memory representations as relevant and a block-wise distractor display presented after the retro-cue, participants had to remember the orientation of a colored bar. On behavioral level, we found that the interfering effect of the distractor display on memory performance could be prevented when a retro-cue reduced the number of attended representations in working memory. However, only the one-item retro-cue led to an overall increase in task performance compared to a condition without a retro-cue. The neural basis of this special representational status was investigated by means of oscillatory parameters in the EEG and a clustering approach on level of the independent components (ICs) in the signal. The retroactive reduction of attended working memory representations was reflected in a suppression of alpha power over right parietal and parieto-occipital sites. In addition, we found that an IC cluster representing oscillatory activity in the mu/beta range (10-12 Hz and 20-24 Hz) with a source in sensorimotor cortex revealed a power suppression already prior to the memory probe following the one-item retro-cue. This suggests that the retro-cue benefit results in large parts from the possibility to focus attention on one particular item in working memory and initiate motor planning processes already ahead of the probe stimulus indicating the respective response.

Retrospective cueing studies indicate that selective attention can be directed to memory representations in WM improving performance. While most of the work has explored the neural substrates of orienting attention based on a spatial retro-cue, behavioral studies show that a feature other than location can also improve WM performance. In the present work we explored the oscillatory underpinnings of orienting attention to a relevant representation held in WM guided by a feature value. We recorded EEG data in a group of 36 healthy human subjects (20 females) performing a WM task in which they had to memorize the orientation of four rectangles of different colors. After a maintenance period, a cue was presented indicating the color of the relevant item. We showed that directing attention to a memory item based on its color resulted in a modulation of posterior alpha activity, which appears as more desynchronization in the contralateral than in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Alpha lateralization is considered a neurophysiological marker of external and internal spatial attention. We propose that current findings support the idea that selection of a memory item based on a non-location feature could be accomplished by a spatial attentional mechanism. Moreover, using a centrally presented color retro-cue allowed us to surpass the confounds inherent to the use of spatial retro-cues, supporting that the observed lateralized alpha results from an endogenous attentional mechanism.

For instance, when two streams of stimuli are presented left and right, the second target (T2) is better identified in the left visual field (LVF) than in the right visual field (RVF). Recently, it has been shown that this bias is related to weaker stimulus-driven orienting of attention toward the RVF: The RVF disadvantage was reduced with salient task-irrelevant valid cues and increased with invalid cues. Here we studied if also endogenous orienting of attention may compensate for this unequal distribution of stimulus-driven attention. Explicit information was provided about the location of T1 and T2. Effectiveness of the cue manipulation was confirmed by EEG measures: decreasing alpha power before stream onset with informative cues, earlier latencies of potentials evoked by T1-preceding distractors at the right than at the left hemisphere when T1 was cued left, and decreasing T1- and T2-evoked N2pc amplitudes with informative cues. Importantly, informative cues reduced (though did not completely abolish) the LVF advantage, indicated by improved identification of right T2, and reflected by earlier N2pc latency evoked by right T2 and larger decrease in alpha power after cues indicating right T2. Overall, these results suggest that endogenously driven attention facilitates stimulus-driven orienting of attention toward the RVF, thereby partially overcoming the basic LVF bias in spatial attention.

For a successful interaction, related brain activities and events should be reliably detected; using various approaches including machine learning techniques. To this end, a variety of characteristic signal features as well as different types of classifiers can be used. One possible application of such an interaction is for epilepsy patients. A novel approach for the group of patients with difficult to treat epilepsy is the application of electrical stimulation in the early stages of the seizure generation in a closed-loop manner which can be realized in an implant. Herein, we show results of studies on the detection of epileptic seizure patterns in human intracranial long-term recordings and their dependence on selection parameters which have to be chosen for the realization in an implant. Random forest classifier is shown to allow an energy-efficient implementation of algorithm which uses a set of time and frequency domain features for seizure detection. In this study, we searched for further possibilities to optimize the performance of our algorithm and made it more robust to signal variations for online applications. In this regard, we studied the effects of detection time window, raw data normalization, feature scaling and electrode montages on performance of random forest classifier. Results of this optimization process indicate a decrease of detection delay, which is crucial to successful seizure suppression, and increased sensitivity; while preserving the false positive detections low compared to presently available closedloop intervention in epilepsy.

During insight, connections between previously unrelated concepts are made and new patterns arise at the perceptual level while new solutions to apparently insolvable problems suddenly emerge to consciousness. Given its unpredictable nature, the definition, and behavioral and neurophysiological measurement of insight problem solving represent a major challenge in contemporary cognitive neuroscience. Numerous attempts have been made, yet results show limited consistency across experimental approaches. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of available neuroscience of insight, including: i) a discussion about the theoretical definition of insight and an overview of the most widely accepted theoretical models, including those debating its relationship with creativity and intelligence; ii) an overview of available tasks used to investigate insight; iii) an ad-hoc quantitative meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating the Eureka moment, using activation likelihood estimation maps; iv) a review of electroencephalographic evidence in the time and frequency domains, as well as v) an overview of the application of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to causally assess the neurobiological basis of insight as well as enhance insight-related cognition.

According to existing literature, hippocampal dentate spikes are prominent, short-duration (<30 ms), large-amplitude (similar to 2-4 mV) fluctuations in hilar local-field potentials that take place during awake immobility and sleep. Interestingly, previous studies indicate that during dentate spikes dentate gyrus granule cells increase their firing while firing of CA1 pyramidal cells are suppressed, thus resulting in momentary uncoupling of the two hippocampal subregions. To date, the behavioural significance of dentate spikes is unknown. Here, to study the possible role of dentate spikes in learning, we trained adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in trace eyeblink classical conditioning. For 1 h immediately following each conditioning session, one group of animals received hippocampal stimulation via the ventral hippocampal commissure (vHC) contingent on dentate spikes to disrupt the uncoupling between the dentate gyrus and the CA1 subregions. A yoked control group was stimulated during immobility, irrespective of brain state, and another control group was not stimulated at all. As a result, learning was impaired only in the group where vHC stimulation was administered contingent on dentate spikes. Our results suggest dentate spikes and/or the associated uncoupling of the dentate gyrus and the CA1 play a significant role in memory consolidation. Dentate spikes could possibly reflect reactivation and refinement of a memory trace within the dentate gyrus triggered by input from the entorhinal cortex.

In the present study, participants were instructed to perform an audio-visual spatial attention task. They were asked to attend to either the left or the right hemifield and to respond to deviant transient either auditory or visual stimuli. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by two task irrelevant pattern reversing checkerboards flickering at 10 and 15 Hz in the left and the right hemifields, respectively, were used to continuously monitor the locus of spatial attention. The amplitude and phase of the SSVEPs were extracted for single trials and were separately analyzed. Sustained attention to one hemifield (spatial attention) as well as to the auditory modality (intermodal attention) increased the inter-trial phase locking of the SSVEP responses, whereas briefly presented visual and auditory stimuli decreased the single-trial SSVEP amplitude between 200 and 500 ms post-stimulus. This transient change of the single-trial amplitude was restricted to the SSVEPs elicited by the reversing checkerboard in the spatially attended hemifield and thus might reflect a transient re-orienting of attention towards the brief stimuli. Thus, the present results demonstrate independent, but interacting neural mechanisms of sustained and transient attentional orienting.

Large-scale computational models of a motoneuron pool and the muscle it innervates have been used as tools to advance the knowledge of how neural elements may influence force control. Here, we present a frequency domain analysis of a NARX model fitted to a large-scale neuromuscular model by the means of generalized frequency response functions (GFRF). The results of such procedures indicated that the computational neuromuscular-model was capable of transforming an oscillatory synaptic input (e.g., at 20 Hz) into a constant mean muscle force output. The nonlinearity uncovered by the GFRFs of the NARX model was responsible for the demodulation of an oscillatory input (e.g., a beta band oscillation coming from the brain and forming the input to the motoneuron pool). This suggests a manner by which brain rhythms descending as command signals to the spinal cord and acting on a motoneuron pool can regulate a maintained muscle force. In addition to the scientific aspects of these results, they provide new interpretations that may further neural engineering applications associated with quantitative neurological diagnoses and robotic systems for artificial limbs.

Since electrical and chemical synapses exist within the same networks of inhibitory cells, delayed inhibitory and fast electrical synapses are coupled in the simulations. The effects of hybrid synapses in promoting synchronous activity in neural networks are investigated with short and long time delays. The distinct frequency bands observed in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography signals are determined using the raster plots of neural networks. For quantitative comparison of activities in networks, the degree of synchrony in the network is calculated. The influences of several network parameters such as inhibitory synaptic strength, electrical synaptic strength, synaptic time constant, and time delay on the network activity are investigated. It is observed that the coupling of electrical and chemical synapses promotes multiple synchronous behaviors in the network. Another important finding is that even though the synchronization measure is highly dependent on inhibitory synaptic strengths at low electrical synaptic strength and synaptic time constant, not much dependence on inhibitory synaptic strengths is observed at high electrical synaptic strength.

Characterizing Computer Access Using a One-Channel EEG Wireless Sensor	SENSORS			English	Article						cerebral palsy; attention; brain computer interface; wireless EEG sensor; linear discriminant analysis	INTERFACE BCI; ATTENTION; COMMUNICATION; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNALS	This work studies the feasibility of using mental attention to access a computer. Brain activity was measured with an electrode placed at the Fp1 position and the reference on the left ear; seven normally developed people and three subjects with cerebral palsy (CP) took part in the experimentation. They were asked to keep their attention high and low for as long as possible during several trials. We recorded attention levels and power bands conveyed by the sensor, but only the first was used for feedback purposes. All of the information was statistically analyzed to find the most significant parameters and a classifier based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was also set up. In addition, 60% of the participants were potential users of this technology with an accuracy of over 70%. Including power bands in the classifier did not improve the accuracy in discriminating between the two attentional states. For most people, the best results were obtained by using only the attention indicator in classification. Tiredness was higher in the group with disabilities (2.7 in a scale of 3) than in the other (1.5 in the same scale); and modulating the attention to access a communication board requires that it does not contain many pictograms (between 4 and 7) on screen and has a scanning period of a relatively high t(scan) approximate to 10 s. The information transfer rate (ITR) is similar to the one obtained by other brain computer interfaces (BCI), like those based on sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) or slow cortical potentials (SCP), and makes it suitable as an eye-gaze independent BCI.

Intrinsic neural activity differences among psychotic illnesses	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						biomarkers; bipolar disorder; diagnosis; EEG; psychosis; schizophrenia; steady-state	TO-NOISE RATIO; STEADY-STATE; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; DOPAMINE; PHASE	Individuals with psychosis have been reported to show either reduced or augmented brain responses under seemingly similar conditions. It is likely that inconsistent baseline-adjustment methods are partly responsible for this discrepancy. Using steady-state stimuli during a pro/antisaccade task, this study addressed the relationship between nonspecific and stimulus-related neural activity, and how these activities are modulated as a function of cognitive demands. In 98 psychosis probands (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis), neural activity was assessed during baseline and during a 5-s period in preparation for the pro/antisaccade task. To maximize the ability to identify meaningful differences between psychosis subtypes, analyses were conducted as a function of subgrouping probands by standard clinical diagnoses and neurobiological features. These psychosis "biotypes" were created using brain-based biomarkers, independent of symptomatology (Clementz et al., 2016). Psychosis probands as a whole showed poor antisaccade performance and diminished baseline oscillatory phase synchrony. Psychosis biotypes differed on both behavioral and brain measures, in ways predicted from Clementz et al. (2016). Two biotype groups showed similarly deficient behavior and baseline synchrony, despite diametrically opposed neural activity amplitudes. Another biotype subgroup was more similar to healthy individuals on behavioral and brain measures, despite the presence of psychosis. This study provides evidence that (a) consideration of baseline levels of activation and synchrony will be essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural response differences in psychosis, and (b) distinct psychosis subgroups exhibit reduced versus augmented intrinsic neural activity, despite cognitive performance and clinical similarities.

Changes in Dimensionality and Fractal Scaling Suggest Soft-Assembled Dynamics in Human EEG	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						dynamical systems; soft-assembly; repetition priming; fractal scaling; dimensionality; self-organization; coordination	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; TIME-SERIES; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; PHASE-RESET; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; HUMAN HEARTBEAT; BRAIN; BEHAVIOR; OSCILLATIONS; COMPLEXITY	Humans are high-dimensional, complex systems consisting of many components that must coordinate in order to perform even the simplest of activities. Many behavioral studies, especially in themovement sciences, have advanced the notion of soft-assembly to describe how systems with many components coordinate to perform specific functions while also exhibiting the potential to re-structure and then perform other functions as task demands change. Consistent with this notion, within cognitive neuroscience it is increasingly accepted that the brain flexibly coordinates the networks needed to cope with changing task demands. However, evaluation of various indices of soft-assembly has so far been absent from neurophysiological research. To begin addressing this gap, we investigated task-related changes in two distinct indices of soft-assembly using the established phenomenon of EEG repetition suppression. In a repetition priming task, we assessed evidence for changes in the correlation dimension and fractal scaling exponents during stimulus-locked event-related potentials, as a function of stimulus onset and familiarity, and relative to spontaneous non-task-related activity. Consistent with predictions derived from soft-assembly, results indicated decreases in dimensionality and increases in fractal scaling exponents from resting to pre-stimulus states and following stimulus onset. However, contrary to predictions, familiarity tended to increase dimensionality estimates. Overall, the findings support the view from soft-assembly that neural dynamics should become increasingly ordered as external task demands increase, and support the broader application of soft-assembly logic in understanding human behavior and electrophysiology.

A direct comparison of both components is challenging because of the huge discrepancy in experimental designs and stimulus choice between language and 'classic' P300 experiments. In the present study, we develop a new approach to mimic the interplay of sequential position as well as categorical and relational information in natural language syntax (word category and agreement) in a non-linguistic target detection paradigm using musical instruments. Participants were instructed to (covertly) detect target tones which were defined by instrument change and pitch rise between subsequent tones at the last two positions of four-tone sequences. We analysed the EEG using event-related averaging and time-frequency decomposition. Our results show striking similarities to results obtained from linguistic experiments. We found a P300 that showed sensitivity to sequential position and a late positivity sensitive to stimulus type and position. A time-frequency decomposition revealed significant effects of sequential position on the theta band and a significant influence of stimulus type on the delta band. Our results suggest that the detection of non-linguistic targets defined via complex feature conjunctions in the present study and the detection of syntactic anomalies share the same underlying processes: attentional shift and memory based matching processes that act upon multi-feature conjunctions. We discuss the results as supporting domain-general accounts of the P600 during natural language comprehension. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Trace Amine-Associated Receptor vertical bar Regulates Wakefulness and EEG Spectral Composition	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MOUSE MODEL; SLEEP; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DECREASES; BRAIN; RAT	Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) agonists have been shown to have procognitive, antipsychotic-like, anxiolytic, weightreducing, glucose-lowering, and wake-promoting activities. We used Taar1 knockout (KO) and overexpressing (OE) mice and TAAR1 agonists to elucidate the role of TAAR1 in sleep/wake. EEG, EMG, body temperature (Tb), and locomotor activity (LMA) were recorded in Taar1 KO, OE, and WT mice. Following a 24 h recording to characterize basal sleep/wake parameters, mice were sleep deprived (SD) for 6 h. In another experiment, mice were given three doses of the TAAR1 partial agonist RO5263397, caffeine, or vehicle p. o. Baseline wakefulness was modestly increased in OE compared with WT mice. Baseline theta (4.5-9 Hz) and low gamma (30-60 Hz) activity was elevated in KO compared with OE mice in NREM and REM sleep. Following SD, both KO and OE mice exhibited a homeostatic sleep rebound. In WT mice, RO5263397 increased waking and reduced NREM and REM sleep, decreased gamma power during wake and NREM, and decreased Tb without affecting LMA; these effects were absent in KO mice and potentiated in OE mice. In contrast, caffeine increased wake time, NREM gamma power, and LMA in all strains compared with vehicle; this effect was attenuated in KO and potentiated in OE mice. TAAR1 overexpression modestly increases wakefulness, whereas TAAR1 partial agonism increases wakefulness and also reduces NREM and also REM sleep. These results indicate a modulatory role for TAAR1 in sleep/wake and cortical activity and suggest TAAR1 as a novel target for wake-promoting therapeutics.

Although understanding residual function is necessary for appropriate rehabilitation, the extent of its effects on cognitive improvement remains unknown. This study evaluated cognitive function in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities after early brain injuries due to cerebral hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia. We focused on neural responses to hearing the subject's own name (SON). According to previous studies, differences in response to SON are associated with several types of cognitive dysfunction. Methods: We examined healthy subjects (aged 21.4 +/- 1.10 years; control) and patients with a previous brain injury (aged 13-27 years at the time of our analysis) resulting in periventricular leukomalacia or a cerebral hemorrhage during the perinatal period or childhood. We recorded EEG responses to the SON and to other Japanese words, obtaining EEG-evoked potentials with wavelet transformations. Results: Compared with healthy controls, beta power (not alpha power) revealed differences in response to SON by patients with brain injury, especially those with cerebral hemorrhage. Conclusions: We suggest that alpha and beta power differences reflect different cognitive functions and that the SON response reveals more than one process. Beta powers may reflect the intellectual disability of cognitive function in response to self-relevant stimuli, especially in patients with cerebral hemorrhage. Meanwhile, alpha powers did not differ from those of the healthy controls, suggesting that the patients perhaps paid attention to their own names.

Theta band power increases in the posterior hippocampus predict successful episodic memory encoding in humans	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						theta; episodic memory; anterior hippocampus; posterior hippocampus; subsequent memory effect	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; SPATIAL NAVIGATION; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS; HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; DENTATE GYRUS; HERA MODEL; DORSAL	Functional differences in the anterior and posterior hippocampus during episodic memory processing have not been examined in human electrophysiological data. This is in spite of strong evidence for such differences in rodent data, including greater place cell specificity in the dorsal hippocampus, greater sensitivity to the aversive or motivational content of memories in ventral regions, connectivity analyses identifying preferential ventral hippocampal connections with the amygdala, and gene expression analyses identifying a dorsal-ventral gradient. We asked if memory-related oscillatory patterns observed in human hippocampal recordings, including the gamma band and slow-theta (2.5-5Hz) subsequent memory effects, would exhibit differences along the longitudinal axis and between hemispheres. We took advantage of a new dataset of stereo electroencephalography patients with simultaneous, robotically targeted anterior, and posterior hippocampal electrodes to directly compare oscillatory subsequent memory effects during item encoding. This same data set allowed us to examine left-right connectivity and hemispheric differences in hippocampal oscillatory patterns. Our data suggest that a power increase during successful item encoding in the 2.5-5Hz slow-theta frequency range preferentially occurs in the posterior hippocampus during the first 1,000ms after item presentation, while a gamma band power increase is stronger in the dominant hemisphere. This dominant-nondominant pattern in the gamma range appears to reverse during item retrieval, however. Intrahippocampal phase coherence was found to be stronger during successful item encoding. Our phase coherence data are also consistent with existing reports of a traveling wave for theta oscillations propagating along the septotemporal (longitudinal) axis of the human hippocampus. We examine how our findings fit with theories of functional specialization along the hippocampal axis.

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of how attention is allocated during eye fixations are not completely understood. The current study explored the use of EEG alpha-band oscillations to investigate the spatial distribution of attention during reading. We reanalyzed two data sets, focusing on the lateralization of alpha activity at posterior scalp sites. In each experiment, participants read short lists of German nouns in two paradigms: either by freely moving their eyes (saccadic reading) or by fixating the screen center while the text moved passively from right to left at the same average speed (RSVP paradigm). In both paradigms, upcoming words were either visible or masked, and foveal processing load was manipulated by varying the words' lexical frequencies. Posterior alpha lateralization revealed a sustained rightward bias of attention during saccadic reading, but not in the RSVP paradigm. Interestingly, alpha lateralization was not influenced by word frequency (foveal load) or preview during the preceding fixation. Hence, alpha did not reflect transient attention shifts within a given fixation. However, in both experiments, we found that in the saccadic reading condition a stronger alpha lateralization shortly before a saccade predicted shorter fixations on the subsequently fixated word. These results indicate that alpha lateralization can serve as a measure of attention deployment and its link to oculomotor behavior in reading.

Owing to an increase in the use of mass media, which is used to distribute high levels of empathy-inducing content, media plays a key role in individual and social empathy induction. We investigated empathy induction in cartoons using eye movement, EEG and behavioral measures to explore whether empathy factors correlate with character drawing styles. Two different types of empathy-inducing cartoons that consisted of three stages and had the same story plot were used. One had an iconic style' while the other was realistic style. Fifty participants were divided into two groups corresponding to the individual cartoon drawing styles and were presented with only one type of drawing style. We found that there were no significant differences of empathy factors between iconic and realistic style. However, the Induced Empathy Score (IES) had a close relationship with subsequent attentional processing (total fixation length for gaze duration). Furthermore, iconic style suppressed the fronto-central area more than realistic style in the gamma power band. These results suggest that iconic cartoons have the advantage of abstraction during empathy induction, because the iconic cartoons induced the same level of empathy as realistic cartoons while using the same story plot (top-down process), even though lesser time and effort were required by the cartoon artist to draw them.

Long-Range Temporal Correlations Reflect Treatment Response in the Electroencephalogram of Patients with Infantile Spasms	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Detrended fluctuation analysis; Pediatric epilepsy; West Syndrome; Hypsarrhythmia; Network; Synchrony	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; WEST-SYNDROME; NEURONAL NETWORKS; HUMAN EEG; HYPSARRHYTHMIA; OSCILLATIONS	Infantile spasms syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy in which prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation are critical to therapeutic response. Diagnosis of the disease heavily depends on the identification of characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns, including hypsarrhythmia. However, visual assessment of the presence and characteristics of hypsarrhythmia is challenging because multiple variants of the pattern exist, leading to poor inter-rater reliability. We investigated whether a quantitative measurement of the control of neural synchrony in the EEGs of infantile spasms patients could be used to reliably distinguish the presence of hypsarrhythmia and indicate successful treatment outcomes. We used autocorrelation and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) to measure the strength of long-range temporal correlations in 21 infantile spasms patients before and after treatment and 21 control subjects. The strength of long-range temporal correlations was significantly lower in patients with hypsarrhythmia than control patients, indicating decreased control of neural synchrony. There was no difference between patients without hypsarrhythmia and control patients. Further, the presence of hypsarrhythmia could be classified based on the DFA exponent and intercept with 92% accuracy using a support vector machine. Successful treatment was marked by a larger increase in the DFA exponent compared to those in which spasms persisted. These results suggest that the strength of long-range temporal correlations is a marker of pathological cortical activity that correlates with treatment response. Combined with current clinical measures, this quantitative tool has the potential to aid objective identification of hypsarrhythmia and assessment of treatment efficacy to inform clinical decision-making.

In particular, neuronal habituation processes have been shown to be altered in FXS patients. Yet, while such deficits have been primarily explored using auditory stimuli, less is known in the visual modality. Here, we investigated the putative alteration of repetition suppression using faces in FXS patients compared to controls that had the same age distribution. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were acquired while participants were presented with 18 different faces, each repeated ten times successively. The repetition suppression effect was probed by comparing the brain responses to the first and second presentation, based on task-evoked event related potentials (ERP) as well as on task-induced oscillatory activity. We found different patterns of habituation for controls and patients both in ERP and oscillatory power. While the N170 was not affected by face repetition in controls, it was altered in FXS patients. Conversely, while a repetition suppression effect was observed in the theta band (4-8 Hz) over frontal and parieto-occipital areas in controls, it was not seen in FXS patients. These results provide the first evidence for diminished ERP and oscillatory habituation effects in response to face repetitions in FXS. These findings extend previous observations of impairments in learning mechanisms and may be linked to deficits in the maturation processes of synapses caused by the mutation. The present study contributes to bridging the gap between animal models of synaptic plasticity dysfunctions and human research in FXS.

The correlation is most pronounced for the anterior brain region (Delta C-A). The correlation is not driven by birth size, education, speed of processing, or intelligence. The sensitivity of Delta C-A for detecting low memory capacity is 90%. Cerebral rhythmic activity and oscillations are important pathways of communication between cortical cell assemblies and may be key factors in memory. We asked whether memory performance is related to gamma coherence in a non-task sensory steady-state stimulation. We investigated 40 healthy males born in 1953 who were part of a Danish birth cohort study. Coherence was measured in the gamma range in response to a single-sensory visual stimulation (36Hz) and a double-sensory combined audiovisual stimulation (auditive: 40Hz; visual: 36Hz). The individual difference in coherence (Delta C) between the bimodal and monomodal stimulation was calculated for each subject and used as the main explanatory variable. Delta C in total brain were significantly negatively correlated with long-term verbal recall. This correlation was pronounced for the anterior region. In addition, the correlation between Delta C and long-term memory was robust when controlling for working memory, as well as a wide range of potentially confounding factors, including intelligence, length of education, speed of processing, visual attention and executive function. Moreover, we found that the difference in anterior coherence (Delta C-A) is a better predictor of memory than power in multivariate models. The sensitivity of Delta C-A for detecting low memory capacity is 92%. Finally, Delta C-A was also associated with other types of memory: verbal learning, visual recognition, and spatial memory, and these additional correlations were also robust enough to control for a range of potentially confounding factors. Thus, the Delta C is a predictor of memory performance may be useful in cognitive neuropsychological testing.

If the number of objects to be estimated is small, typically around 1-4 items, observers are able to give very fast and precise judgments with high confidence-an effect that is called subitizing. Due to its speed and effortless nature subitizing has usually been assumed to be preattentive, putting it into the same category as other low level visual features like color or orientation. More recently, however, a number of studies have suggested that subitizing might be dependent on attentional resources. In our current study we investigated the potentially preattentive nature of visual numerical perception in the subitizing range by means of EEG. We presented peripheral, task irrelevant sequences of stimuli consisting of a certain number of circular patches while participants were engaged in a demanding, non-numerical detection task at the fixation point drawing attention away from the number stimuli. Within a sequence of stimuli of a given number of patches (called "standards") we interspersed some stimuli of different numerosity ("oddballs"). We compared the evoked responses to visually identical stimuli that had been presented in two different conditions, serving as standard in one condition and as oddball in the other. We found significant visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) responses over parieto-occipital electrodes. In addition to the event-related potential (ERP) analysis, we performed a time-frequency analysis (TFA) to investigate whether the vMMN was accompanied by additional oscillatory processes. We found a concurrent increase in evoked theta power of similar strength over both hemispheres. Our results provide clear evidence for a preattentive processing of numerical visual information in the subitizing range.

Using frequency-tagging, we investigated whether facilitation by spatial attention and audiovisual synchrony rely on similar neural processes. Participants attended to one of two flickering Gabor patches (14.17 and 17 Hz) located in opposite lower visual fields. Gabor patches further "pulsed" (i.e. showed smooth spatial frequency variations) at distinct rates (3.14 and 3.63 Hz). Frequency-modulating an auditory stimulus at the pulse-rate of one of the visual stimuli established audio-visual synchrony. Flicker and pulsed stimulation elicited stimulus-locked rhythmic electrophysiological brain responses that allowed tracking the neural processing of simultaneously presented Gabor patches. These steady-state responses (SSRs) were quantified in the spectral domain to examine visual stimulus processing under conditions of synchronous vs. asynchronous tone presentation and when respective stimulus positions were attended vs. unattended. Strikingly, unique patterns of effects on pulse-and flicker driven SSRs indicated that spatial attention and audiovisual synchrony facilitated early visual processing in parallel and via different cortical processes. We found attention effects to resemble the classical top-down gain effect facilitating both, flicker and pulse-driven SSRs. Audio-visual synchrony, in turn, only amplified synchrony-producing stimulus aspects (i.e. pulse-driven SSRs) possibly highlighting the role of temporally co-occurring sights and sounds in bottom-up multisensory integration.

A novel method linking neural connectivity to behavioral fluctuations: Behavior-regressed connectivity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Connectivity; Regression; Behavior; Wpli; EEG; BCI	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; EEG; REAL; OSCILLATIONS; VARIABILITY; MODULATION	Background: During an experimental session, behavioral performance fluctuates, yet most neuroimaging analyses of functional connectivity derive a single connectivity pattern. These conventional connectivity approaches assume that since the underlying behavior of the task remains constant, the connectivity pattern is also constant. New method: We introduce a novel method, behavior-regressed connectivity (BRC), to directly examine behavioral fluctuations within an experimental session and capture their relationship to changes in functional connectivity. This method employs the weighted phase lag index (WPLI) applied to a window of trials with a weighting function. Using two datasets, the BRC results are compared to conventional connectivity results during two time windows: the one second before stimulus onset to identify predictive relationships, and the one second after onset to capture task-dependent relationships. Results: In both tasks, we replicate the expected results for the conventional connectivity analysis, and extend our understanding of the brain-behavior relationship using the BRC analysis, demonstrating subject-specific BRC maps that correspond to both positive and negative relationships with behavior. Comparison with Existing Method(s): Conventional connectivity analyses assume a consistent relationship between behaviors and functional connectivity, but the BRC method examines performance variability within an experimental session to understand dynamic connectivity and transient behavior. Conclusion: The BRC approach examines connectivity as it covaries with behavior to complement the knowledge of underlying neural activity derived from conventional connectivity analyses. Within this framework, BRC may be implemented for the purpose of understanding performance variability both within and between participants. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Bader, M; Schroger, E; Grimm, S				Bader, Maria; Schroeger, Erich; Grimm, Sabine			How regularity representations of short sound patterns that are based on relative or absolute pitch information establish over time: An EEG study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEMORY-TRACE FORMATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; COMPLEX-SOUND; HUMAN BRAIN; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; FEATURE CONJUNCTIONS	The recognition of sound patterns in speech or music (e.g., a melody that is played in different keys) requires knowledge about pitch relations between successive sounds. We investigated the formation of regularity representations for sound patterns in an event-related potential (ERP) study. A pattern, which consisted of six concatenated 50 ms tone segments differing in fundamental frequency, was presented 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 times and then replaced by another pattern by randomly changing the pitch of the tonal segments (roving standard paradigm). In an absolute repetition condition, patterns were repeated identically, whereas in a transposed condition, only the pitch relations of the tonal segments of the patterns were repeated, while the entire patterns were shifted up or down in pitch. During ERP measurement participants were not informed about the pattern repetition rule, but were instructed to discriminate rarely occurring targets of lower or higher sound intensity. EPRs for pattern changes (mismatch negativity, MMN; and P3a) and for pattern repetitions (repetition positivity, RP) revealed that the auditory system is able to rapidly extract regularities from unfamiliar complex sound patterns even when absolute pitch varies. Yet, enhanced RP and P3a amplitudes, and improved behavioral performance measured in a post-hoc test, in the absolute as compared with the transposed condition suggest that it is more difficult to encode patterns without absolute pitch information. This is explained by dissociable processing of standards and deviants as well as a back propagation mechanism to early sensory processing stages, which is effective after less repetitions of a standard stimulus for absolute pitch.

Development of HCI system using bio signal e.g. Electrooculogram (EOG), Electromyogram (EMG), Electroencephalogram (EEG), Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) etc. are attracted more and more attention of researchers all over the world in recent years because through this it is possible to get acquainted with advanced technologies of artificial intelligence. This paper presents the design and implementation of a fully functional Electrooculogram (EOG) based human computer interface. In this work we have designed and implemented necessary hardware and software for EOG signal acquisition along with controlling hardware such as wheelchair, robotic arm, mobile robot etc., and move computer mouse cursor simultaneously using EOG signal. This interface has three portion: EOG signal acquisition and amplification, analog to digital conversion, and real time hardw are and mouse cursor movement. Eye movement is detected by measuring potential difference between cornea and retina using five Ag-Agcl disposable electrodes. Frequency range of EOG signal is considered as 0.3 to 15Hz, so this frequency range is taken using an active high and low pass filter so that accurate EOG signal can be achieved. The analog output of the EOG signal from filter is converted into digital signal by using an Arduino. Arduino serialize the EOG data for calibration and provides a threshold reference point which is used for controlling Hardw are. The Classification module e.g. Support Vector machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classify live data with respect to the horizontal and vertical data. This works as a binary classifier and choose optimal hyper-plane between two variables. According to each update on the eye position, cursor automatically accelerated in particular direction. PyMouse module in python is used for this task. Eye gesture based Hardware like robot, wheelchair etc. control and mouse cursor movement are the principle outcome of this research work.

Comparing the Effects of 10-Hz Repetitive TMS on Tasks of Visual STM and Attention	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PREDICTS INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ALPHA-BAND POWER; WORKING-MEMORY; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS	Numerous studies have demonstrated that visual STM (VSTM) and attention are tightly linked processes that share a number of neuroanatomical substrates. Here, we used repetitive TMS (rTMS) along with simultaneous EEG to examine the causal relationship between intraparietal sulcus functioning and performance on tasks of attention and VSTM. Participants performed two tasks in which they were required to attend to or remember colored items over a brief interval, with 10-Hz rTMS applied on some of the trials. Although no overall behavioral changes were observed across either task, rTMS did affect individual performance on both the attention and VSTM tasks in a manner that was predicted by individual differences in baseline performance. Furthermore, rTMS also affected ongoing oscillations in the alpha and beta bands, and these changes were related to the observed change in behavioral performance. The results reveal a causal relationship between intraparietal sulcus activity and tasks measuring both visual attention and VSTM.

A new description of epileptic seizures based on dynamic analysis of a thalamocortical model	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CORTICAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; CLOSED-LOOP; NONLINEAR RESONANCES; HUMAN EEG; STIMULATION; FREQUENCY; CHAOS; ENTRAINMENT	Increasing evidence suggests that the brain dynamics can be interpreted from the viewpoint of nonlinear dynamical systems. The aim of this paper is to investigate the behavior of a thalamocortical model from this perspective. The model includes both cortical and sensory inputs that can affect the dynamic nature of the model. Driving response of the model subjected to various harmonic stimulations is considered to identify the effects of stimulus parameters on the cortical output. Detailed numerical studies including phase portraits, Poincare maps and bifurcation diagrams reveal a wide range of complex dynamics including period doubling and chaos in the output. Transition between different states can occur as the stimulation parameters are changed. In addition, the amplitude jump phenomena and hysteresis are shown to be possible as a result of the bending in the frequency response curve. These results suggest that the jump phenomenon due to the brain nonlinear resonance can be responsible for the transitions between ictal and interictal states.	[Haghighi, H. Sohanian; Markazi, A. H.

Specifically a hybrid method, LPPsymb, including LPP quantifiers and related symbolic dynamics was proposed. LPP has been applied to investigate the autonomic response to pleasant and unpleasant pictures extracted from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). IAPS pictures are standardized in terms of level of arousal, i.e. the intensity of the evoked emotion, and valence, i.e. the level of pleasantness/unpleasantness, according to the Circumplex model of Affects (CMA). Twenty-two healthy subjects were enrolled in the experiment, which comprised four sessions with increasing arousal level. Within each session valence increased from positive to negative. An ad-hoc pattern recognition algorithm using a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) procedure based on a Quadratic Discriminant Classifier (QDC) was implemented. Our pattern recognition system was able to classify pleasant and unpleasant sessions with an accuracy of 71.59 %. Therefore, we can suggest the use of the LPPsymb for emotion recognition.

Although zebrafish exhibit more significant larval-adult duality than any other animal, most electrophysiological studies using zebrafish are biased by using larvae these days. The results of larval studies not only differ from those conducted with adults but also are unable to delicately manage electroencephalographic montages due to their small size. Hence, we enabled non-invasive long-term multichannel electroencephalographic recording on adult zebrafish using custom-designed electrodes and perfusion system. First, we exploited demonstration of long-term recording on pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure models, and the results were quantified. Second, we studied skin-electrode impedance, which is crucial to the quality of signals. Then, seizure propagations and gender differences in adult zebrafish were exhibited for the first time. Our results provide a new pathway for future neuroscience research using zebrafish by overcoming the challenges for aquatic organisms such as precision, serviceability, and continuous water seepage.

Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the neural mechanisms mediating anxiety symptoms. We used unbiased, multimodal, data-driven, whole-brain measures of neural activity (magnetoencephalography) and connectivity (fMRI) to identify the regions of the brain that contribute most prominently to sustained anxiety. We report that a single brain region, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), shows both elevated neural activity and global brain connectivity during threat. The IPS plays a key role in attention orienting and may contribute to the hypervigilance that is a common symptom of pathological anxiety. Hyperactivation of this region during elevated state anxiety may account for the paradoxical facilitation of performance on tasks that require an external focus of attention, and impairment of performance on tasks that require an internal focus of attention.

Starting from a network model of Kuramoto phase oscillators, which evolve adaptively according to homophilic and homeostatic adaptive principles, we give evidence that the increase of synchronization within groups of nodes (and the corresponding formation of synchronous clusters) causes also the defragmentation of the wavelet energy spectrum of the macroscopic signal. Our methodology is then applied to getting a glance into the microscopic interactions occurring in a neurophysiological system, namely, in the thalamocortical neural network of an epileptic brain of a rat, where the group electrical activity is registered by means of multichannel EEG. We demonstrate that it is possible to infer the degree of interaction between the interconnected regions of the brain during different types of brain activities and to estimate the regions' participation in the generation of the different levels of consciousness.

Beta band oscillations (13-30 Hz) in neural local field potentials (LFPs) have been associated with these motor symptoms. Here, three PD patients implanted with a therapeutic deep brain neural stimulator that can also record and wirelessly stream neural data played a neurofeedback game where they modulated their beta band power fromsensorimotor cortical areas. Patients' beta band power was streamed in real-time to update the position of a cursor that they tried to drive into a cued target. After playing the game for 1-2 hours each, all three patients exhibited above chance-level performance regardless of subcortical stimulation levels. This study, for the first time, demonstrates using an invasive neural recording system for at-home neurofeedbacktraining.

This abnormal electroencephalographic response has been associated with hyperexcitability of the visuo-motor system. Here, we evaluate if intrinsic dysfunction of this network is present in brain activity at rest, independently of any stimulus and of any paroxysmal electroencephalographic activity. To address this issue, we investigated the haemodynamic correlates of the spontaneous alpha rhythm, which is considered the hallmark of the brain resting state, in photosensitive patients and in people without photosensitivity. Second, we evaluated the whole-brain functional connectivity of the visual thalamic nuclei in the various populations of subjects under investigation. Forty-four patients with epilepsy and 16 healthy control subjects underwent an electroencephalography-correlated functional magnetic resonance imaging study, during an eyes-closed condition. The following patient groups were included: (i) genetic generalized epilepsy with photosensitivity, 16 subjects (mean age 25 +/- 10 years); (ii) genetic generalized epilepsy without photosensitivity, 13 patients (mean age 25 +/- 11 years); (iii) focal epilepsy, 15 patients (mean age 25 +/-9 years). For each subject, the posterior alpha power variations were convolved with the standard haemodynamic response function and used as a regressor. Within-and between-groups second level analyses were performed. Whole brain functional connectivity was evaluated for two thalamic regions of interest, based on the haemodynamic findings, which included the posterior thalamus (pulvinar) and the medio-dorsal thalamic nuclei. Genetic generalized epilepsy with photosensitivity demonstrated significantly greater mean alpha-power with respect to controls and other epilepsy groups. In photosensitive epilepsy, alpha-related blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes demonstrated lower decreases relative to all other groups in the occipital, sensory-motor, anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortices. Coherently, the same brain regions demonstrated abnormal connectivity with the visual thalamus only in epilepsy patients with photosensitivity. As predicted, our findings indicate that the cortical-subcortical network generating the alpha oscillation at rest is different in people with epilepsy and visual sensitivity. This difference consists of a decreased alpharelated inhibition of the visual cortex and sensory-motor networks at rest. These findings represent the substrate of the clinical manifestations (i. e. myoclonus) of the photoparoxysmal response. Moreover, our results provide the first evidence of the existence of a functional link between the circuits that trigger the visual sensitivity phenomenon and those that generate the posterior alpha rhythm.

Pairing sound with vagus nerve stimulation modulates cortical synchrony and phase coherence in tinnitus: An exploratory retrospective study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PHANTOM SOUND; THALAMOCORTICAL DYSRHYTHMIA; AUDITORY-CORTEX; ACTIVATION; PLASTICITY; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; DISTRESS; BEHAVIOR	Recent research has shown that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with tones or with rehabilitative training can help patients to achieve reductions in tinnitus perception or to expedite motor rehabilitation after suffering an ischemic stroke. The rationale behind this treatment is that VNS paired with experience can drive neural plasticity in a controlled and therapeutic direction. Since previous studies observed that gamma activity in the auditory cortex is correlated with tinnitus loudness, we assessed resting-state source-localized EEG before and after one to three months of VNS-tone pairing in chronic tinnitus patients. VNS-tone pairing reduced gamma band activity in left auditory cortex. VNStone pairing also reduced the phase coherence between the auditory cortex and areas associated with tinnitus distress, including the cingulate cortex. These results support the hypothesis that VNS-tone pairing can direct therapeutic neural plasticity. Targeted plasticity therapy might also be adapted to treat other conditions characterized by hypersynchronous neural activity.

But which is the best approach to music use: strategic (the same piece of music used consistently across consecutive advertising campaigns) or tactical (consecutive advertising campaigns using different pieces of background music)? The present study monitored electrical brain responses of participants while they were presented with existing TV and radio adverts with strategic, tactical, or no music. Adverts with strategic music were liked more, found more familiar, and more impactful for radio than TV adverts. The neural correlates of music usage were characterized by the beta- and gamma-band oscillations, especially in the frontal regions, reflecting an enhanced preferential engagement. Further, adverts with strategic music were associated with a larger frontal asymmetry, suggesting for a potentially positive affective response. Furthermore, we observed an increased and sustained neural effect of strategic versus tactical music use in radio adverts. Together these findings offer novel indications for an optimum use of background music to promote advert effectiveness.

However, our learning experience is highly overlapping in content (i.e., shares commonelements), and memories of these events are organized in an intricate network of overlapping associated events. It remains to be explored whether and how selective memory reactivation during sleep has an impact on these overlapping memories acquired during awake time. Here, we test in a group of adult women and men the prediction that selective memory reactivation during sleep entails the reactivation of associated events and that this may lead the brain to adaptively regulate whether these associated memories are strengthened or pruned from memory networks on the basis of their relative associative strength with the shared element. Our findings demonstrate the existence of efficient regulatory neural mechanisms governing how complex memory networks are shaped during sleep as a function of their associative memory strength.

During REM sleep, the brain exhibits prominent activity in the 58 Hz (theta) frequency range. How REM sleep onset and theta waves are regulated is poorly understood. Astrocytes, a non-neuronal cell type in the brain, respond to cholinergic signals by elevating their intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The goal of this study was to assess the sleep architecture of mice with attenuated IP3 mediated Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes. Vigilance states and cortical electroencephalograph power were measured in wild type mice and mice with attenuated IP3/Ca2+ signaling. Attenuating IP3/Ca2+ signaling specifically in astrocytes caused mice to spend more time in REM sleep and enter this state more frequently during their inactive phase. These mice also exhibited greater power in the theta frequency range. These data suggest a role for astrocytic IP3/Ca2+ signaling in modulating REM sleep and the associated physiological state of the cortex.

J	van Diepen, RM; Mazaheri, A				van Diepen, Rosanne Maria; Mazaheri, Ali			Cross-sensory modulation of alpha oscillatory activity: suppression, idling, and default resource allocation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; EEG; oscillations; visual cortex	SPATIAL ATTENTION; BAND; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; INCREASES; EXCITABILITY; LOCATIONS; REFLECT; PREDICT	Alpha oscillations (similar to 10Hz) have been suggested to have an inhibitory influence on stimulus processing within the context of attention being coordinated across space, with an increase in the power of alpha activity occurring in spatially irrelevant regions. However, with respect to cross-sensory attention (distribution of attention to different sensory modalities) an increase in alpha activity from baseline has not yet been definitively linked to active inhibition of distraction. In the current study, we examined the role of top-down alpha modulation in facilitating and suppressing stimulus processing between the visual and auditory domain. We utilized two cross-sensory paradigms, one containing distractors while the other paradigm only contained targets, in order to separate distractor related activity. We found a cue induced increase from baseline for the power of occipital alpha activity in posterior cortex when participants anticipated the occurrence of auditory targets combined with visual distractors. Interestingly, there was no increase in alpha power observed in the condition where auditory targets occurred without distractors. These findings suggest that the increase in alpha activity from baseline reflects top-down drive processes serving to inhibit distracting input. However, we found that there was no significant difference in the absolute occipital alpha power between when participants were expecting a visual distractor, and the session where no visual distractors were present. We account for these findings by suggesting that an increase in alpha power in the anticipation of visual distractors, rather than being exclusively inhibitory, could also signal the re-allocation of resources in the sensory systems.

A Simple Statistical Method for the Automatic Detection of Ripples in Human Intracranial EEG	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						HFO; Epilepsy; Ripple; Electrocorticogram; Depth electrode	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; 80-500 HZ; EPILEPSY; RESECTION; SPIKES; HFOS	High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of epileptic tissue, but detection of these electrographic events remains a challenge. Automatic detectors show encouraging results, but they typically require optimization of multiple parameters, which is a barrier to good performance and broad applicability. We therefore propose a new automatic HFO detection algorithm, focusing on simplicity and ease of implementation. It requires tuning of only an amplitude threshold, which can be determined by an iterative process or directly calculated from statistics of the rectified filtered data (i.e. mean plus standard deviation). The iterative approach uses an estimate of the amplitude probability distribution of the background activity to calculate the optimum threshold for identification of transient high amplitude events. We tested both the iterative and non-iterative approaches using a dataset of visually marked HFOs, and we compared the performance to a commonly used detector based on the root-mean-square. When the threshold was optimized for individual channels via ROC curve, all three methods were comparable. The iterative detector achieved a sensitivity of 99.6%, false positive rate (FPR) of 1.1%, and false detection rate (FDR) of 37.3%. However, in an eight-fold cross-validation test, the iterative method had better sensitivity than the other two methods (80.0% compared to 64.4 and 65.8%), with FPR and FDR of 1.3, and 49.4%, respectively. The simplicity of this algorithm, with only a single parameter, will enable consistent application of automatic detection across research centers and recording modalities, and it may therefore be a powerful tool for the assessment and localization of epileptic activity.

Cinematic Operation of the Cerebral Cortex Interpreted via Critical Transitions in Self-Organized Dynamic Systems	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cinematic theory of cognition; AM pattern; criticality; phase transition; Freeman K set; Hebbian assembly; graph theory; neuropercolation	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; NETWORKS; CONSCIOUSNESS; INFORMATION; ORIGIN; PHASE; MODEL; NEUROPERCOLATION; OSCILLATIONS	Measurements of local field potentials over the cortical surface and the scalp of animals and human subjects reveal intermittent bursts of beta and gamma oscillations. During the bursts, narrow-band metastable amplitude modulation (AM) patters emerge for a fraction of a second and ultimately dissolve to the broad-band random background activity. The burst process depends on previously learnt conditioned stimuli (CS), thus different AM patterns may emerge in response to different CS. This observation leads to our cinematic theory of cognition when perception happens in discrete steps manifested in the sequence of AM patterns. Our article summarizes findings in the past decades on experimental evidence of cinematic theory of cognition and relevant mathematical models. We treat cortices as dissipative systems that self-organize themselves near a critical level of activity that is a non-equilibrium metastable state. Criticality is arguably a key aspect of brains in their rapid adaptation, reconfiguration, high storage capacity, and sensitive response to external stimuli. Self-organized criticality (SOC) became an important concept to describe neural systems. We argue that transitions from one AM pattern to the other require the concept of phase transitions, extending beyond the dynamics described by SOC. We employ random graph theory (RGT) and percolation dynamics as fundamental mathematical approaches to model fluctuations in the cortical tissue. Our results indicate that perceptions are formed through a phase transition from a disorganized (high entropy) to a well-organized (low entropy) state, which explains the swiftness of the emergence of the perceptual experience in response to learned stimuli.

Coordination of Slow Waves With Sleep Spindles Predicts Sleep-Dependent Memory Consolidation in Schizophrenia	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep spindles; slow waves; schizophrenia; motor; procedural learning; memory consolidation	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; RIPPLES; PERFORMANCE; COHERENCE; DEFICITS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; ESZOPICLONE	Study Objectives: Schizophrenia patients have correlated deficits in sleep spindle density and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In addition to spindle density, memory consolidation is thought to rely on the precise temporal coordination of spindles with slow waves (SWs). We investigated whether this coordination is intact in schizophrenia and its relation to motor procedural memory consolidation. Methods: Twenty-one chronic medicated schizophrenia patients and 17 demographically matched healthy controls underwent two nights of polysomnography, with training on the finger tapping motor sequence task (MST) on the second night and testing the following morning. We detected SWs (0.5-4 Hz) and spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We measured SW-spindle phase-amplitude coupling and its relation with overnight improvement in MST performance. Results: Patients did not differ from controls in the timing of SW-spindle coupling. In both the groups, spindles peaked during the SW upstate. For patients alone, the later in the SW upstate that spindles peaked and the more reliable this phase relationship, the greater the overnight MST improvement. Regression models that included both spindle density and SW-spindle coordination predicted overnight improvement significantly better than either parameter alone, suggesting that both contribute to memory consolidation. Conclusion: Schizophrenia patients show intact spindle-SW temporal coordination, and these timing relationships, together with spindle density, predict sleep-dependent memory consolidation. These relations were seen only in patients suggesting that their memory is more dependent on optimal spindle-SW timing, possibly due to reduced spindle density. Interventions to improve memory may need to increase spindle density while preserving or enhancing the coordination of NREM oscillations.

Neuroplasticity of Language in Left-Hemisphere Stroke: Evidence Linking Subsecond Electrophysiology and Structural Connections	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						context; disconnection; neuroplasticity; oscillations; production; splenium; tapetum	BETA OSCILLATIONS; APHASIA RECOVERY; WHITE-MATTER; BRAIN; MOTOR; EEG; MEG; NETWORKS; CORTEX; MEMORY	The understanding of neuroplasticity following stroke is predominantly based on neuroimaging measures that cannot address the subsecond neurodynamics of impaired language processing. We combined behavioral and electrophysiological measures and structural-connectivity estimates to characterize neuroplasticity underlying successful compensation of language abilities after left-hemispheric stroke. We recorded the electroencephalogram from patients with stroke lesions to the left temporal lobe and from matched controls during context-driven word retrieval. Participants heard lead-in sentences that either constrained the final word ("He locked the door with the") or not ("She walked in here with the"). The last word was shown as a picture to be named. Individual-participant analyses were conducted, focusing on oscillatory power as a subsecond indicator of a brain region's functional neurophysiological computations. All participants named pictures faster following constrained than unconstrained sentences, except for two patients, who had extensive damage to the left temporal lobe. Left-lateralized alpha-beta oscillatory power decreased in controls pre-picture presentation for constrained relative to unconstrained contexts. In patients, the alpha-beta power decreases were observed with the same time course as in controls but were lateralized to the intact right hemisphere. The right lateralization depended on the probability of white-matter connections between the bilateral temporal lobes. The two patients who performed poorly behaviorally showed no alpha-beta power decreases. Our findings suggest that incorporating direct measures of neural activity into investigations of neuroplasticity can provide important neural markers to help predict language recovery, assess the progress of neurorehabilitation, and delineate targets for therapeutic neuromodulation.

However, it still remains unclear when and how a cortical system integrates and retains information across sensory modalities during learning. Here we investigated the neural dynamics underlying crossmodal associations and memory by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) when human participants performed visuotactile (crossmodal) and visuo-visual (unimodal) paired associate (PA) learning tasks. In a trial of the tasks, the participants were required to explore and learn the relationship (paired or non-paired) between two successive stimuli. EEG recordings revealed dynamic ERP changes during participants' learning of paired-associations. Specifically, (1) the frontal N400 component showed learning-related changes in both unimodal and crossmodal tasks but did not show any significant difference between these two tasks, while the central P400 displayed both learning changes and task differences; (2) a late posterior negative slow wave (LPN) showed the learning effect only in the crossmodal task; (3) alpha-band oscillations appeared to be involved in cross modal working memory. Additional behavioral experiments suggested that these ERP components were not relevant to the participants' familiarity with stimuli per se. Further, by shortening the delay length (from 1300 ms to 400 ms or 200 ms) between the first and second stimulus in the cross modal task, declines in participants' task performance were observed accordingly. Taken together, these results provide insights into the cortical plasticity (induced by PA learning) of neural networks involved in crossmodal associations in working memory. (C) 2017 IBRO.

In the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL), a heuristic animal model of schizophrenia, brain oscillation changes similar to those of schizophrenic patients have been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of short-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamic reticular nucleus on electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) activity in the NVHL. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were used and the model was prepared by excitotoxicity damage of the ventral hippocampus on postnatal day 7 (PD-7). Chronic bilateral stainless steel electrodes were implanted in the TRN, thalamic dorsomedial nucleus and prelimbic area at PD-90. Rats were classified as follows: sham and NVHL groups, both groups received bilateral DBS in the TRN for one hour (100 Hz, 100 is pulses, 200 mu A). All animals showed a sudden behavioral arrest accompanied by widespread symmetric bilateral spike wave discharges, this activity was affected by DBS-TRN. Additionally, the power spectra of 0.5-100 Hz and the coherence of 0.5-4.5 and 35-55 Hz frequencies were modified by DBS-TRN. Our results suggest that DBS in the TRN may modify functional connectivity between different parts of the thalamo-cortical network. Additionally, our findings may suggest a beneficial effect of DBS-TRN on some pre-clinical aberrant oscillatory activities in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. (C) 2017 'IBRO.

To clarify how this variance affects actual motor function, this study examined associations between the corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and force steadiness. Methods: CMC was calculated between scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) over the sensorimotor cortex and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from the tibialis anterior muscle during tonic isometric voluntary ankle dorsiflexion at 30% of maximal effort in 22 healthy individuals. We calculated the maximal peak of CMC (CMCmax), and examined its relations to some measures of force fluctuation, such as the coefficient of variation (ForceCV), the sum of the power spectral density within 1-4 Hz (Force delta- PSD), 5-14 Hz (Force alpha-PSD), and 15-35 Hz (Force beta-PSD) bands of force signal. Results: In all participants showing significant CMC, CMCmax was observed within the beta-band. CMCmax was varied across participants (range, 0.084-0.451), and was correlated significantly and positively with ForceCV (r = 0.602, p = 0.003), Force beta-PSD (r = 0.637, p = 0.001), Force alpha-PSD (r = 0.647, p = 0.001), and Force alpha-PSD (r = 0.518, p = 0.014). Conclusion: The magnitude of the CMC between EEG over the sensorimotor cortex and EMG of contracting muscle is associated with the amount of force fluctuation during tonic isometric voluntary ankle dorsiflexion in healthy humans. Significance: CMC may influence an individual's ability to stabilize their muscle force output. (c) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the Taylor illusion, the size of an afterimage projected on one's hand changes according to proprioceptive signals conveying hand position. Here, we assessed whether the Taylor illusion does not just depend on the physical hand position, but also on bodily self-consciousness as quantified through illusory hand ownership. Relying on the somatic rubber hand illusion, we manipulated hand ownership, such that participants embodied a rubber hand placed next to their own hand. We found that an afterimage projected on the participant's hand drifted depending on illusory ownership between the participants' two hands, showing an implication of self-representation during the Taylor illusion. Oscillatory power analysis of electroencephalographic signals showed that illusory hand ownership was stronger in participants with stronger alpha suppression over left sensorimotor cortex, whereas the Taylor illusion correlated with higher beta/gamma power over frontotemporal regions. Higher gamma connectivity between left sensorimotor and inferior parietal cortex was also found during illusory hand ownership. These data show that afterimage drifts in the Taylor illusion do not only depend on the physical hand position but also on subjective ownership, which itself is based on the synchrony of somatosensory signals from the two hands. The effect of ownership on afterimage drifts is associated with beta/gamma power and gamma connectivity between frontoparietal regions and the visual cortex. Together, our results suggest that visual percepts are not only influenced by bodily context but are self-grounded, mapped on a self-referential frame.

While recent studies offer novel insights into the mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and discover potential preventive treatments, the lack of PIE biomarkers hinders the clinical implementation of such treatments. Here we explored the biomarker potential of different electrographic features in five models of PIE. Electrocorticographic or intrahippocampal recordings of epileptogenesis (from the insult to the first spontaneous seizure) from two laboratories were analyzed in three mouse and two rat PIE models. Time, frequency, and fractal and nonlinear properties of the signals were examined, in addition to the daily rate of epileptiform spikes, the relative power of five frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, low gamma, and high gamma) and the dynamics of these features over time. During the latent pre-seizure period, epileptiform spikes were more frequent in epileptic compared with nonepileptic rodents; however, this feature showed limited predictive power due to high inter-and intra-animal variability. While nondynamic rhythmic representation failed to predict epilepsy, the dynamics of the theta band were found to predict PIE with a sensitivity and specificity of > 90%. Moreover, theta dynamics were found to be inversely correlated with the latency period (and thus predict the onset of seizures) and with the power change of the high-gamma rhythm. In addition, changes in theta band power during epileptogenesis were associated with altered locomotor activity and distorted circadian rhythm. These results suggest that changes in theta band during the epileptogenic period may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for epileptogenesis, able to predict the future onset of spontaneous seizures.

The functional role of post-movement beta oscillations in motor termination	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; MEG; Movement; PMBR; Cortex	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG; MEG; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; LOCALIZATION; FREQUENCY	Shortly after movement termination, there is a strong increase or resynchronization of the beta rhythm (15-30 Hz) across the sensorimotor network of humans, known as the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). This response has been associated with active inhibition of the motor network following the completion of a movement, sensory afferentation of the sensorimotor cortices, and other functions. However, studies that have directly probed the role of the PMBR in movement execution have reported mixed results, possibly due to differences in the amount of total motor output and/or movement complexity. Herein, we used magnetoencephalography during an isometric-force control task to examine whether alterations in the timing of motor termination demands modulate the PMBR, independent of differences in the motor output itself. Briefly, we manipulated the amount of time between the cue to initiate the force and the cue to terminate the force, such that participants were either forced to terminate quickly or slowly. We also performed a control experiment to test for temporal predictability effects. Our results indicated that the PMBR was stronger immediately following movement termination in the prefrontal cortices, supplementary motor area, left postcentral gyrus, paracentral lobule, and parietal cortex when participants were forced to terminate more quickly. These results were not attributable to the temporal predictability of each condition. These findings support the notion that the PMBR response at least partially serves motor inhibition, independent of the parameters within the motor output itself, and that particular nodes of the motor network may be differentially modulated by motor termination.

Proactive Control: Neural Oscillatory Correlates of Conflict Anticipation and Response Slowing	ENEURO			English	Article						Bayesian model; Electroencephalogram (EEG); neural oscillation; proactive control; stop-signal task	STOP-SIGNAL TASK; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HUMAN BRAIN; INHIBITORY CONTROL; PREDICTION ERROR; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS	Proactive control allows us to anticipate environmental changes and adjust behavioral strategy. In the laboratory, investigators have used a number of different behavioral paradigms, including the stop-signal task (SST), to examine the neural processes of proactive control. Previous functional MRI studies of the SST have demonstrated regional responses to conflict anticipation-the likelihood of a stop signal or P(stop) as estimated by a Bayesian model-and reaction time (RT) slowing and how these responses are interrelated. Here, in an electrophysiological study, we investigated the time-frequency domain substrates of proactive control. The results showed that conflict anticipation as indexed by P(stop) was positively correlated with the power in low-theta band (3-5 Hz) in the fixation (trial onset)-locked interval, and go-RT was negatively correlated with the power in delta-theta band (2-8 Hz) in the go-locked interval. Stimulus prediction error was positively correlated with the power in the low-beta band (12-22 Hz) in the stop-locked interval. Further, the power of the P(stop) and go-RT clusters was negatively correlated, providing a mechanism relating conflict anticipation to RT slowing in the SST. Source reconstruction with beamformer localized these time-frequency activities close to brain regions as revealed by functional MRI in earlier work. These are the novel results to show oscillatory electrophysiological substrates in support of trial-by-trial behavioral adjustment for proactive control.

For those medications that do work, they only suppress seizures. They treat the symptoms, but do not modify the underlying disease, forcing patients to take these drugs with significant side effects, often for the rest of their lives. A major limitation in our ability to advance new therapeutics that permanently prevent, reduce the frequency of, or cure epilepsy comes from a lack of understanding of the disease coupled with a lack of reliable biomarkers that can predict who has or who will get epilepsy. MethodsThe main goal of this report is to present a number of approaches for identifying reliable biomarkers from observing patients with brain disorders that have a high probability of producing epilepsy. ResultsA given biomarker, or more likely a profile of biomarkers, will have both a quantity and a time course during epileptogenesis that can be used to predict who will get the disease, to confirm epilepsy as a diagnosis, to identify coexisting pathologies, and to monitor the course of treatments. SignificanceAdditional studies in patients and animal models could identify common and clinically valuable biomarkers to successfully translate animal studies into new and effective clinical trials.

No treatments are approved for the core diagnostic symptoms of ASD. To enable the earliest stages of therapeutic discovery and development for ASD, robust and reproducible behavioral phenotypes and biological markers are essential to establish in preclinical animal models. The goal of this study was to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioral phenotypes that are replicable between independent cohorts in a mouse model of ASD. The larger goal of our strategy is to empower the preclinical biomedical ASD research field by generating robust and reproducible behavioral and physiological phenotypes in animal models of ASD, for the characterization of mechanistic underpinnings of ASD-relevant phenotypes, and to ensure reliability for the discovery of novel therapeutics. Genetic disruption of the SHANK3 gene, a scaffolding protein involved in the stability of the postsynaptic density in excitatory synapses, is thought to be responsible for a relatively large number of cases of ASD. Therefore, we have thoroughly characterized the robustness of ASD-relevant behavioral phenotypes in two cohorts, and for the first time quantified translational EEG activity in Shank3B null mutant mice. Methods: In vivo physiology and behavioral assays were conducted in two independently bred and tested full cohorts of Shank3B null mutant (Shank3B KO) and wildtype littermate control (WT) mice. EEG was recorded via wireless implanted telemeters for 7 days of baseline followed by 20 min of recording following pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) challenge. Behaviors relevant to the diagnostic and associated symptoms of ASD were tested on a battery of established behavioral tests. Assays were designed to reproduce and expand on the original behavioral characterization of Shank3B KO mice. Two or more corroborative tests were conducted within each behavioral domain, including social, repetitive, cognitive, anxiety-related, sensory, and motor categories of assays. Results: Relative to WT mice, Shank3B KO mice displayed a dramatic resistance to PTZ seizure induction and an enhancement of gamma band oscillatory EEG activity indicative of enhanced inhibitory tone. These findings replicated in two separate cohorts. Behaviorally, Shank3B KO mice exhibited repetitive grooming, deficits in aspects of reciprocal social interactions and vocalizations, and reduced open field activity, as well as variable deficits in sensory responses, anxiety-related behaviors, learning and memory. Conclusions: Robust animal models and quantitative, replicable biomarkers of neural dysfunction are needed to decrease risk and enable successful drug discovery and development for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Complementary to the replicated behavioral phenotypes of the Shank3B mutant mouse is the new identification of a robust, translational in vivo neurophysiological phenotype. Our findings provide strong evidence for robustness and replicability of key translational phenotypes in Shank3B mutant mice and support the usefulness of this mouse model of ASD for therapeutic discovery.

We thus performed spectral decompositions of ongoing neural activities within the somatosensory and visual areas while human participants performed a complex visuomotor task. In this task, participants followed the outline of irregular polygons with a pen-controlled cursor. At unpredictable times, the motion of the cursor deviated 120 degrees with respect to the actual pen position creating an incongruence between visual and somatosensory inputs, thus increasing the importance of visual feedback to control the movement as suggested in previous studies. We found that alpha and beta power significantly decreased in the visual cortex during sensory incongruence when compared to unperturbed conditions. This result is in line with an increased gain of visual inputs during sensory incongruence. In parallel, we also found a simultaneous decrease of gamma and beta power in sensorimotor areas which has not been reported previously. The gamma desynchronization suggests a reduced integration of somatosensory inputs for controlling movements with sensory incongruence while beta ERD could be more specifically linked to sensorimotor adaptation processes.

From the point of view of anyone operating complex mechanical systems, i.e., those comprising independent components that are required to interact precisely in time, it follows that the precise timing of such a system is essential - not only essential but measurable, and scalable. It must also be reliable over observations to bring about consistent behavior, whatever that behavior is. The catastrophic consequence of an absence of such precision, for instance that required to govern the interference engine in many automobiles, is indicative of how important timing is for the function of dynamical systems at all levels of operation. The dynamics and temporal considerations combined indicate that it is necessary to consider the operating characteristic of any dynamical, cognitive brain system in terms, superficially at least, of oscillation frequencies. These may, themselves, be forensic of an underlying time-related taxonomy. Currently there are only two sets of relevant and necessarily systematic observations in this field: one of these reports the precise dynamical structure of the perceptual systems engaged in dynamical binding across form and time; the second, derived both empirically from perceptual performance data, as well as obtained from theoretical models, demonstrates a timing taxonomy related to a fundamental operator referred to as the time quantum. In this contribution both sets of theory and observations are reviewed and compared for their predictive consistency. Conclusions about direct comparability are discussed for both theories of cognitive dynamics and time quantum models. Finally, a brief review of some experimental data measuring sensitivity to visual information presented to the visual blind field (blindsight), as well as from studies of temporal processing in autism and schizophrenia, indicates that an understanding of a precise and metrical dynamic structure may be very important for an operational understanding of perception as well as more general cognitive function in psychopathology.

Prior studies demonstrate focal, neocortical epilepsy is associated with dysfunction, several hours before seizures. How does the epileptic network perpetuate dysfunction during baseline periods? To address this question, we developed an unsupervised machine learning technique to disentangle patterns of functional interactions between brain regions, or subgraphs, from dynamic functional networks constructed from approximately 100 h of intracranial recordings in each of 22 neocortical epilepsy patients. Using this approach, we found: (1) subgraphs from ictal (seizure) and interictal (baseline) epochs are topologically similar, (2) interictal subgraph topology and dynamics can predict brain regions that generate seizures, and (3) subgraphs undergo slower and more coordinated fluctuations during ictal epochs compared to interictal epochs. Our observations suggest that seizures mark a critical shift away from interictal states that is driven by changes in the dynamical expression of strongly interacting components of the epileptic network.

This study explored the effects of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation on subjective evaluation (semantic differential), in response to some consumer goods. We adopted rTMS (low-frequency 1Hz on left and right DLPFC) to modulate the consumers' (N=thirty-three) response during the vision of five commercials. After three hours from the first evaluation of TV commercials without stimulation, rTMS was delivered in brain frontal areas (F3 and F4 areas) before the vision of each stimulus. Following the stimulation, subjects evaluated advertising a second time by using the same semantic differential. An increase of TV commercials preference occurred in subjects who were inhibited on right DLPFC; while a decrease of advertising preference was shown in subjects who were inhibited on left DLPFC. These results reveal the important role of DLPFC for emotions' elaboration. In particular, the left and right DLPFC seem to be related respectively to positive and negative evaluation of emotional stimuli.

These states, known as fruition, are common within the Mahasi School of Theravada Buddhism, and are considered the culmination of contemplation-induced stages of consciousness. Here, electrophysiological measures of these experiences were measured, with the participant's personal reports used to guide the neural analyzes. The preliminary results demonstrate an increase in global long-range gamma (25-45 Hz) synchronization during the fruition states, compared to the background meditation. The discrepancies and similarities with other neuroscientific studies of meditation-induced altered states are discussed. Albeit preliminary, the results presented here provide support for the possibility -previously raised by various authors -that long-range global gamma synchronization may offer an underlying mechanism for un-learning of habitual conditioning and mental patterns, possibly underpinning the neural correlate of the Buddhist concept of liberation. Finally, this pilot study highlights the utility of employing neuro-phenomenology, namely using first-person reports to guide neural analyzes, in the study of subtle human consciousness states.

Using hyperscanning EEG recordings, we measured brain-to-brain synchrony in 104 adults during a male-female naturalistic social interaction, comparing romantic couples and strangers. Neural synchrony was found for couples, but not for strangers, localized to temporal-parietal structures and expressed in gamma rhythms. Brain coordination was not found during a three-minute rest, pinpointing neural synchrony to social interactions among affiliative partners. Brain-to-brain synchrony was linked with behavioral synchrony. Among couples, neural synchrony was anchored in moments of social gaze and positive affect, whereas among strangers, longer durations of social gaze and positive affect correlated with greater neural synchrony. Brain-to-brain synchrony was unrelated to episodes of speech/no-speech or general content of conversation.

Evidence from mind wandering research suggests that spontaneous shifts from externally directed cognition (EDC) to internally directed cognition (IDC) involves oculomotor changes indicative of visual disengagement. In the present study, we investigated potential differences in eye behavior between goal-directed forms of IDC and EDC. To this end, we manipulated the focus of attention (internal versus external) in two demanding cognitive tasks (anagram and sentence generation). IDC was associated with fewer and longer fixations and higher variability in pupil diameter and eye vergence compared to EDC, suggesting reduced visual scanning and higher spontaneous eye activity. IDC was further related to longer blinks, lower microsaccade frequency, and a lower angle of eye vergence. These latter changes appear conducive to attenuate visual input and thereby shield ongoing internal processes from external distraction. Together, these findings suggest that IDC is accompanied by characteristic eye behavior that reflects a decoupling of attention from external events and serves gating out visual input.

Attenuation of high-frequency (30-200 Hz) thalamocortical EEG rhythms as correlate of anaesthetic action: evidence from dexmedetomidine	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						gamma rhythms; drug effects; dose-response relationship; drug; anaesthetics; intravenous	GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MOLECULAR TARGETS; CONSCIOUSNESS; ISOFLURANE; SLEEP; MECHANISMS; THALAMUS; NEURONS	Background. Gamma (30-80 Hz) and high-gamma (80-200 Hz) thalamocortical EEG rhythms are involved in conscious processes and are attenuated by isoflurane and propofol. To explore the hypothesis that this attenuation is a correlate of anaesthetic action, we characterized the effect dexmedetomidine, a selective adrenergic alpha-2 agonist with lesser hypnotic potency, on these rhythms. Methods. We recorded local field potentials from barrel cortex and ventroposteromedial thalamic nucleus in ten previously instrumented rats to measure spectral power (30-50 Hz, 51-75 Hz, 76-125 Hz, 126-200 Hz bands) during baseline, at four dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations obtained by i.v. target-controlled infusion (1.86, 3.75, 5.63 and 7.50 ng ml(-1)), and during recovery. Thalamocortical coherence over 0.3-200 Hz was also measured. Results. Loss of righting reflex (LORR) occurred with 5.63 ng ml(-1). Dexmedetomidine produced a linear concentration-dependent attenuation of cortical (P < 0.04) and thalamic (P a parts per thousand 0.0051) log power in all bands. Slopes for cortex and thalamus were similar. The slope for dexmedetomidine on thalamic power in the 76-200 Hz range was less than half that of the other agents (P < 0.003). LORR was associated with an increase in delta band (0.3-4.0 Hz) thalamocortical coherence (P < 0.001). Increased low-frequency coherence also occurred with propofol and isoflurane. Conclusions. Dexmedetomidine attenuates high-frequency thalamocortical rhythms, but to a lesser degree than isoflurane and propofol. The main differences between dexmedetomidine and the other anaesthetics involved thalamic rhythms, further substantiating the link between impaired thalamic function and anaesthesia. Increased delta coherence likely reflects cyclic hyperpolarization of thalamocortical networks and may be a marker for loss of consciousness.

The method aims to identify the essential functional connections to ensure optimal information flow via the objective criterion of global efficiency minus the cost of surviving connections. The OMST technique was applied to multichannel, resting-state neuromagnetic recordings from four groups of participants: healthy adults (n=50), adults who have suffered mild traumatic brain injury (n=30), typically developing children (n=27), and reading-disabled children (n=25). Weighted interactions between network nodes (sensors) were computed using an integrated approach of dominant intrinsic coupling modes based on two alternative metrics (symbolic mutual information and phase lag index), resulting in excellent discrimination of individual cases according to their group membership. Classification results using OMST-derived functional networks were clearly superior to results using either relative power spectrum features or functional networks derived through the conventional minimal spanning tree algorithm.

It was predicted that such slow oscillatory stimulation applied during slow wave sleep (SWS) would increase the depth and duration of the SWS and improve the sleep related memory consolidation. The results of our study indicates that the stimulation has no effect on either the duration of the SWS or averaged power of slow wave activity during SWS. Some increase in slow wave activity power was found only directly during the 30-second series of stimulation compared with 30 second pauses in between. However, this stimulation delivered during SWS, facilitate onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phase: in experiments with stimulation REM latency was significantly shorter than in the control experiments. Slow oscillatory stimulation failed to show a beneficial effect on either declarative or procedural memory consolidation.	[Ukraintseva, Yu. V.; Polishchuk, A. A.; Tkachenko, O. N.; Cheremushkin, E.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; LOCAL SLEEP; HOMEOSTASIS; DEPRIVATION; ACTIVATION; VIGILANCE; PATTERNS; REPLAY; SKILLS; FORMS	What is the function of sleep in humans? One claim is that sleep consolidates learning. Slow wave activity (SWA), i.e. slow oscillations of frequency < 4 Hz, has been observed in electroencephalograms (EEG) during sleep; it increases with prior wakefulness and decreases with sleep. Studies have claimed that increase in SWA in specific regions of the sleeping brain is correlated with overnight improved performance, i.e. overnight consolidation, on a demanding motor learning task. We wondered if SWA change during sleep is attributable to overnight consolidation or to metabolic demand. Participants executed out-and-back movements to a target using a pen-like cursor with their dominant hand while the target and cursor position were displayed on a screen. They trained on three different conditions on separate nights, differing in the amount and degree of rotation between the actual hand movement direction and displayed cursor movement direction. In the no-rotation (NR) condition, there was no rotation. In the single rotation (SR) condition, the amount of rotation remained the same throughout, and performance improved both across pre-sleep training and after sleep, i.e. overnight consolidation occurred; in the random rotation (RR) condition, the amount of rotation varied randomly from trial to trial, and no overnight consolidation occurred; SR and RR were cognitively demanding. The average EEG power density of SWA for the first 30 min. of non-rapid eye movement sleep after training was computed. Both SR and RR elicited increase in SWA in the parietal region; furthermore, the topographic distribution of SWA in each was remarkably similar. No correlation was found between the overnight performance improvement on SR and the SWA change in the parietal region on measures of learning. Our results argue that regulation of SWA in early sleep is associated with high levels of cognitive effort during prior wakefulness, and not just overnight consolidation.

Several current theories on the origin of AVH converge, with neuroimaging studies suggesting that the language, auditory and memory/limbic networks are of particular relevance. However, reconciliation of these theories with experimental evidence is missing. We review 50 studies investigating functional (EEG and fMRI) and anatomic (diffusion tensor imaging) connectivity in these networks, and explore the evidence supporting abnormal connectivity in these networks associated with AVH. We distinguish between functional connectivity during an actual hallucination experience (symptom capture) and functional connectivity during either the resting state or a task comparing individuals who hallucinate with those who do not (symptom association studies). Symptom capture studies clearly reveal a pattern of increased coupling among the auditory, language and striatal regions. Anatomical and symptom association functional studies suggest that the interhemispheric connectivity between posterior auditory regions may depend on the phase of illness, with increases in non-psychotic individuals and first episode patients and decreases in chronic patients. Leading hypotheses involving concepts as unstable memories, source monitoring, top-down attention, and hybrid models of hallucinations are supported in part by the published connectivity data, although several caveats and inconsistencies remain. Specifically, possible changes in fronto-temporal connectivity are still under debate. Precise hypotheses concerning the directionality of connections deduced from current theoretical approaches should be tested using experimental approaches that allow for discrimination of competing hypotheses.

Delirium and POCD are each associated with decreased quality of life, early retirement, increased 1-year mortality, and long-term cognitive decline. Multiple investigators have thus suggested that anesthesia and surgery place severe stress on the aging brain, and that patients with less ability to withstand this stress will be at increased risk for developing postoperative delirium and POCD. Delirium and POCD risk are increased in patients with lower preoperative cognitive function, yet preoperative cognitive function is not routinely assessed, and no intraoperative physiological predictors have been found that correlate with lower preoperative cognitive function. Since general anesthesia causes alpha-band (8-12 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) power to decrease occipitally and increase frontally (known as "anteriorization"), and anesthetic-induced frontal alpha power is reduced in older adults, we hypothesized that lower intraoperative frontal alpha power might correlate with lower preoperative cognitive function. Here, we provide evidence that such a correlation exists, suggesting that lower intraoperative frontal alpha power could be used as a physiological marker to identify older adults with lower preoperative cognitive function. Lower intraoperative frontal alpha power could thus be used to target these at-risk patients for possible therapeutic interventions to help prevent postoperative delirium and POCD, or for increased postoperative monitoring and follow-up. More generally, these results suggest that understanding interindividual differences in how the brain responds to anesthetic drugs can be used as a probe of neurocognitive function (and dysfunction), and might be a useful measure of neurocognitive function in older adults.

A Biased Look at Phase Locking: Brief Critical Review and Proposed Remedy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Review						Coherence; phase locking; cross-frequency coupling; spectral analysis	INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; AMPLITUDE; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; SIGNAL; INDEX; MEG	A number of popular measures of dependence between pairs of bandlimited signals rely on analytic phase. A common misconception is that the dependence revealed by these measures must be specific to the spectral range of the filtered input signals. Implicitly or explicitly, obtaining analytic phase involves normalizing the signal by its own envelope, which is a nonlinear operation that introduces broad spectral leakage. We review how this generates bias and complicates the interpretation of commonly used measures of phase locking. A specific example of this effect may create spurious phase locking as a consequence of nonzero circular mean in the phase of input signals, which can be viewed as spectral leakage to 0 Hz. Corrections for this problem which recenter or uniformize the distribution of phase may fail when the amplitudes of the compared signals are correlated. To address the more general problem of spectral bias, a novel measure of phase locking is proposed, the amplitude-weighted phase-locking value. This measure is closely related to coherence, but it removes ambiguities of interpretation that detract from the latter.

To explore how the SCS affects the cerebral cortex and what possible electrophysiological mechanism of SCS effects on the cortex, the present study investigated the functional connectivity and network properties during SCS in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. MCS patients received both SCS and sham sessions. Functional connectivity of the phase lock value (PLV) in the gamma band (30-45 Hz) was investigated at the pre-, on-and post-SCS stages. In addition, to evaluate global network properties, complex network parameters, including average path length, cluster coefficient and small-world, were measured. When SCS was turned on, significantly decreased connectivity was noted in the local scale of the frontal-frontal region and in the large scales of the frontal-parietal and frontal-occipital regions. The global network showed fewer small-world properties, average path lengths increased and cluster coefficients decreased. When SCS was turned off, the large-scale connectivity and global network returned to its pre-SCS level, but the local scale of frontal-frontal connectivity remained significantly lower than its pre-SCS level. Sham sessions produced no significant changes in either functional connectivity or network. The findings directly showed that SCS could effectively intervene cortical gamma activity, and the intervention included immediate global effects (large scale connectivity and network alteration only occurred in stimulation period) and long-lasting local effects (local scale connectivity alteration persist beyond stimulation period). Moreover, considering the mechanism and propagation of gamma activity, it indicates that the frontal cortex plays a crucial role in the SCS effects on the cerebral cortex.

Usually, experimental paradigms designed to study anticipatory activity make use of stimuli. The purpose of the present study is to expand the study of neural anticipatory activity upon the temporal occurrence of dichotomic, statistically unpredictable (random) stimuli within an ecological experimental paradigm. To this purpose, we used a simplified driving simulation including two possible, randomly-presented trial types: a car crash end trial and a no car crash end trial. Event Related Potentials (ERP) were extracted -3,000 ms before stimulus onset. We identified a fronto-central negativity starting around 1,000 ms before car crash presentation. By contrast, a whole-scalp distributed positivity characterized the anticipatory activity observed before the end of the trial in the no car crash end condition. The present data are in line with the hypothesis that the brain may also anticipate dichotomic, statistically unpredictable stimuli, relaying onto different pre-stimulus ERP activity. Possible integration with car-smart-systems is also suggested.

Accelerated Recovery of Consciousness after General Anesthesia Is Associated with Increased Functional Brain Connectivity in the High-Gamma Bandwidth	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; general anesthesia; ketamine; functional connectivity; coherence; transfer entropy; gamma; electroencephalogram	SEVOFLURANE-INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; RAT VISUAL-CORTEX; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION-TRANSFER; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; KETAMINE; STATE; DISRUPTION; COHERENCE; COGNITION	Recent data from our laboratory demonstrate that high-frequency gamma connectivity across the cortex is present during consciousness and depressed during unconsciousness. However, these data were derived from static and well-defined states of arousal rather than during transitions that would suggest functional relevance. We also recently found that subanesthetic ketamine administered during isoflurane anesthesia accelerates recovery upon discontinuation of the primary anesthetic and increases gamma power during emergence. In the current study we re-analyzed electroencephalogram (EEG) data to test the hypothesis that functional cortical connectivity between anterior and posterior cortical regions would be increased during accelerated recovery induced by ketamine when compared to saline-treated controls. Rodents were instrumented with intracranial EEG electrodes and general anesthesia was induced with isoflurane anesthesia. After 37.5 min of continuous isoflurane anesthesia, a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (25 mg/kg intraperitoneal) was administered, with evidence of a 44% reduction in emergence time. In this study, we analyzed gamma and theta coherence (measure of undirected functional connectivity) and normalized symbolic transfer entropy (measure of directed functional connectivity) between frontal and parietal cortices during various levels of consciousness, with a focus on emergence from isoflurane anesthesia. During accelerated emergence in the ketamine-treated group, there was increased frontal-parietal coherence {p = 0.005, 0.05-0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI)]} and normalized symbolic transfer entropy [frontal to parietal: p < 0.001, 0.010-0.026 (95% CI); parietal to frontal: p < 0.001, 0.009-0.025 (95% CI)] in high-frequency gamma bandwidth as compared with the saline-treated group. Surrogates of cortical information exchange in high-frequency gamma are increased in association with accelerated recovery from anesthesia. This finding adds evidence suggesting a functional significance of high-gamma information transfer in consciousness.

A Negative Allosteric Modulator for alpha 5 Subunit-Containing GABA Receptors Exerts a Rapid and Persistent Antidepressant-Like Action without the Side Effects of the NMDA Receptor Antagonist Ketamine in Mice	ENEURO			English	Article						antidepressant; behavior; depression; GABA-NAM; gamma oscillation; ketamine	AMPA RECEPTOR; CHRONIC STRESS; A RECEPTOR; SYNAPSE; DEPRESSION; IMPAIRMENT; EXPRESSION; BLOCKADE; SEEKING; TRIAL	New antidepressant pharmacotherapies that provide rapid relief of depressive symptoms are needed. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant actions in depressed patients but also side effects that complicate its clinical utility. Ketamine promotes excitatory synaptic strength, likely by producing high-frequency correlated activity in mood-relevant regions of the forebrain. Negative allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors containing alpha 5 subunits (alpha 5 GABA-NAMs) should also promote high-frequency correlated electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and should therefore exert rapid antidepressant responses. Because alpha 5 subunits display a restricted expression in the forebrain, we predicted that alpha 5 GABA-NAMs would produce activation of principle neurons but exert fewer side effects than ketamine. We tested this hypothesis in male mice and observed that the alpha 5 GABA-NAM MRK-016 exerted an antidepressant-like response in the forced swim test at 1 and 24 h after administration and an antianhedonic response after chronic stress in the female urine sniffing test (FUST). Like ketamine, MRK-016 produced a transient increase in EEG gamma power, and both the increase in gamma power and its antidepressant effects in the forced swim test were blocked by prior administration of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4tetrahydrobenzo[f] quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX). Unlike ketamine, however, MRK-016 produced no impairment of rota-rod performance, no reduction of prepulse inhibition (PPI), no conditioned-place preference (CPP), and no change in locomotion. alpha 5 GABA-NAMs, thus reproduce the rapid antidepressant-like actions of ketamine, perhaps via an AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-dependent increase in coherent neuronal activity, but display fewer potential negative side effects. These compounds thus demonstrate promise as clinically useful fast-acting antidepressants.

More favorable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the environment, an extrinsic acoustic factor, similarly benefits the parsing of simultaneous speech. Here, we examined the neurobiological substrates of these two cues in the perceptual segregation of concurrent speech mixtures. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while listeners performed a speeded double-vowel identification task. Listeners heard two concurrent vowels whose F0 differed by zero or four semitones presented in either clean (no noise) or noise-degraded (+5 dB SNR) conditions. Behaviorally, listeners were more accurate in correctly identifying both vowels for larger F0 separations but F0-benefit was more pronounced at more favorable SNRs (i.e., pitch x SNR interaction). Analysis of the ERPs revealed that only the P2 wave (similar to 200 ms) showed a similar F0 x SNR interaction as behavior and was correlated with listeners' perceptual F0-benefit. Neural classifiers applied to the ERPs further suggested that speech sounds are segregated neurally within 200 ms based on SNR whereas segregation based on pitch occurs later in time (400-700 ms). The earlier timing of extrinsic SNR compared to intrinsic F0-based segregation implies that the cortical extraction of speech from noise is more efficient than differentiating speech based on pitch cues alone, which may recruit additional cortical processes. Findings indicate that noise and pitch differences interact relatively early in cerebral cortex and that the brain arrives at the identities of concurrent speech mixtures as early as similar to 200 ms.

Consequently, perturbations of network activity play an important role in the pathophysiology of brain disorders. When structural information from non-invasive brain imaging is merged with mathematical modelling, then generative brain network models constitute personalized in silico platforms for the exploration of causal mechanisms of brain function and clinical hypothesis testing. We here demonstrate with the example of drug-resistant epilepsy that patient-specific virtual brain models derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging have sufficient predictive power to improve diagnosis and surgery outcome. In partial epilepsy, seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone, before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We create personalized large-scale brain networks for 15 patients and simulate the individual seizure propagation patterns. Model validation is performed against the presurgical stereotactic electroencephalography data and the standard-of-care clinical evaluation. We demonstrate that the individual brain models account for the patient seizure propagation patterns, explain the variability in postsurgical success, but do not reliably augment with the use of patient-specific connectivity. Our results show that connectome-based brain network models have the capacity to explain changes in the organization of brain activity as observed in some brain disorders, thus opening up avenues towards discovery of novel clinical interventions.

J	D'Hondt, F; Maurage, P				D'Hondt, Fabien; Maurage, Pierre			Electrophysiological studies in Internet addiction: A review within the dual-process framework	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Review						Internet addiction; Problematic Internet use; Electrophysiology; Event-related potentials; Dual-process models	GAMMA ACTIVITY; DISORDER; INDIVIDUALS; DEPRESSION; NEGATIVITY; CHILDREN; MODEL; POWER; P300; TASK	The increase of pathological Internet use recently led to the identification of an "Internet addiction" disorder. While its diagnosis criteria remain unclear, the behavioral consequences of Internet addiction have been widely explored. Its cerebral correlates have also been investigated using electroencephalography, but obtained results have not yet been integrated in a sound theoretical framework. This paper aims at reviewing these studies and at analyzing their results through a dual-process perspective. A systematic literature search was conducted using Pubmed to identify studies in English exploring neural oscillations and/or event-related potentials in individuals displaying problematic Internet use. The 14 articles finally selected show that Internet addiction shares essential features with other addictive states, mainly a joint hypo-activation of the reflective system (decreased executive control abilities) and hyper-activation of the automatic-affective one (excessive affective processing of addiction related cues). Despite the currently limited data, dual-process models thus appear useful to conceptualize the imbalance between cerebral systems in Internet addiction. We finally propose that future electrophysiological studies should better characterize this disequilibrium between controlled-deliberate and automatic-affective networks, notably by using event-related potentials paradigms focusing on each system separately and on their interactions, but also by better specifying the potential differences between sub-categories of Internet addiction.

Inhibition of retrieval in hypnotic amnesia: dissociation by upper-alpha gating	NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS			English	Article						alpha inhibition; functional connectivity; face recognition; hypnosis; amnesia; dissociation	EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; SUGGESTION; ATTENTION; HYPNOSIS; CORTEX; TESTS	Hypnotic amnesia is a functional dissociation from awareness during which information from specific neural processes is unavailable to consciousness. We test the proposal that changes in topographic patterns of cortical oscillations in upper-alpha (10-12 Hz) band selectively inhibit the recall of memories during hypnotic amnesia by blocking availability of locally processed information at specific points in retrieval. Participants were prescreened for high or low hypnotic susceptibility. Following hypnotic induction, participants were presented with a series of 60 face stimuli and were required to identify affective expressions. Participants received a suggestion for amnesia for these faces. They were then presented with a set of 30 old and 30 new faces and identified each as old or new. Amnesia suggestion was lifted and recall tested using the remaining 30 old faces and another 30 new faces. Exact Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography source analyses are reported for 64 channel event-related electroencephalogram recorded from highs showing reversible amnesia to old faces. For high-susceptible participants, the amnesia suggestion significantly increased old faces wrongly identified while for low-susceptible participants amnesia suggestion increased the new faces wrongly identified. There were no differences between high-and low-susceptible participants following reversal of the suggestion. For previously seen faces which were wrongly identified, compared to new faces correctly identified, (late) evoked upper-alpha is significantly higher in right BA7 in a region implicated in top-down executive control to assist recall of visual information. Lagged nonlinear connectivity between cortical sources in upper-alpha in the same condition showed significantly increased connectivity between right BA34 (parahippocampal gyrus) and right BAs 7, 20 and 22. Integration between these regions is essential for recall of recent faces. During amnesia, spatial and temporal coordination of upper-alpha appears to suppress integrated functioning of these regions (hence recall). These patterns were absent after reversal of amnesia suggestion.

Since previous studies were performed cross-sectionally in school-aged children or adults, developmental aspects of neural auditory processing in relation to reading acquisition and dyslexia remain to be investigated. The present longitudinal study followed 68 children during development from pre-reader (5 years old) to beginning reader (7 years old) and more advanced reader (9 years old). Thirty-six children had a family risk for dyslexia and 14 children eventually developed dyslexia. EEG recordings of auditory steady-state responses to 4 and 20 Hz modulations, corresponding to syllable and phoneme rates, were collected at each point in time. Our results demonstrate an increase in neural synchronization to phoneme-rate modulations around the onset of reading acquisition. This effect was negatively correlated with later reading and phonological skills, indicating that children who exhibit the largest increase in neural synchronization to phoneme rates, develop the poorest reading and phonological skills. Accordingly, neural synchronization to phoneme-rate modulations was found to be significantly higher in beginning and more advanced readers with dyslexia. We found no developmental effects regarding neural synchronization to syllable rates, nor any effects of a family risk for dyslexia. Altogether, our findings suggest that the onset of reading instruction coincides with an increase in neural responsiveness to phoneme-rate modulations, and that the extent of this increase is related to (the outcome of) reading development. Hereby, dyslexic children persistently demonstrate atypically high neural synchronization to phoneme rates from the beginning of reading acquisition onwards. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Heinz, AJ; Johnson, JS				Heinz, Andrew J.; Johnson, Jeffrey S.			Load-Dependent Increases in Delay-Period Alpha-Band Power Track the Gating of Task-Irrelevant Inputs to Working Memory	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						working memory; neural oscillations; alpha-band activity; EEG; distractor processing	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; MAINTENANCE; INFORMATION; MODULATION; RETENTION; PARIETAL	Studies exploring the role of neural oscillations in cognition have revealed sustained increases in alpha-band power (ABP) during the delay period of verbal and visual working memory (VWM) tasks. There have been various proposals regarding the functional significance of such increases, including the inhibition of task-irrelevant cortical areas as well as the active retention of information in VWM. The present study examines the role of delay-period ABP in mediating the effects of interference arising from on-going visual processing during a concurrent VWM task. Specifically, we reasoned that, if set-size dependent increases in ABP represent the gating out of on-going task-irrelevant visual inputs, they should be predictive with respect to some modulation in visual evoked potentials resulting from a task-irrelevant delay period probe stimulus. In order to investigate this possibility, we recorded the electroencephalogram while subjects performed a change detection task requiring the retention of two or four novel shapes. On a portion of trials, a novel, task-irrelevant bilateral checkerboard probe was presented mid-way through the delay. Analyses focused on examining correlations between set-size dependent increases in ABP and changes in the magnitude of the P1, N1 and P3a components of the probe-evoked response and how such increases might be related to behavior. Results revealed that increased delay-period ABP was associated with changes in the amplitude of the N1 and P3a event-related potential (ERP) components, and with load-dependent changes in capacity when the probe was presented during the delay. We conclude that load-dependent increases in ABP likely play a role in supporting short-term retention by gating task-irrelevant sensory inputs and suppressing potential sources of disruptive interference.

J	Pratt, M; Goldstein, A; Levy, J; Feldman, R				Pratt, Maayan; Goldstein, Abraham; Levy, Jonathan; Feldman, Ruth			Maternal Depression Across the First Years of Life Impacts the Neural Basis of Empathy in Preadolescence	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						maternal depression; mother-child interaction; empathy; magnetoencephalography; alpha oscillations	PARENT-INFANT SYNCHRONY; POSTNATAL DEPRESSION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT; SENSITIVE PERIODS; MENTAL-HEALTH; EEG ALPHA; CHILD; BRAIN; ADOLESCENCE	Objective: Exposure to maternal depression across the first years of life markedly increases children's susceptibility to psychopathology, yet no study has tested its effects on the maturation of children's social brain. Method: Using a birth cohort of mothers with no contextual risk (N = 1,983), families were followed at 7 time points from birth to 11 years and repeatedly assessed for maternal depression across the first 6 years to form 2 cohorts: mothers continuously depressed from birth to 6 years and controls without depression. At 11 years of age, children's (n = 72; depressed, n = 27; nondepressed, n = 45) brain response to others' pain was measured by magnetoencephalography. Results: Preadolescents displayed a unique oscillatory pattern with higher alpha power to pain versus no pain expressing as alpha rebound, not alpha suppression, at a late time window (1,100-1,300 ms post-stimulus) in the supplementary motor area. This suggests that top-down processing in areas of the pain matrix can underpin the maturation of vicarious empathy. Children of mothers with depression showed enhanced alpha rebound to pain in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus, which was unrelated to emotion detection abilities, pointing to decreased late processing of others' overwhelming experiences in socio-cognitive areas. Alpha power in the posterior superior temporal gyrus was predicted by higher maternal intrusiveness and lower synchrony across early childhood. Conclusion: These findings, from the first study to examine maternal depression and early caregiving as long-term predictors of children's neural empathic response, pinpoint a decrease in top-down socio-cognitive mechanisms as potential pathways for the cross-generational transfer of vulnerability from mothers with depression to their offspring and highlight the need for early interventions focused on enhancing maternal attunement.

We examined the associations between sleep-specific oscillations and the retention of relevant and irrelevant study materials. Methods: We applied a list-method directed forgetting paradigm manipulating the perceived relevance of previously encoded lists of words. Participants were randomly assigned to either a nap or an awake group, and to a remember or a forget subgroup. The remember and the forget subgroups were both instructed to study two consecutive lists of words, although, the forget subgroup was manipulated to forget the first list and memorize only the second one. Participants were 112 healthy individuals (44 men; M-age = 21.4 years, SD = 2.4). Results: A significant directed forgetting effect emerged after a 2-hour delay both in the awake and sleep conditions; however, the effect was more pronounced within the sleep group. The benefit of directed forgetting, that is, relatively enhanced recall of relevant words in the forget group, was evidenced only in those participants that reached rapid eye movement (REM) phase. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sigma power was correlated with memory performance for the relevant (second) list, and sleep spindle amplitude was associated with the retention of both lists. These associations, however, were detected only within the forget subgroup. REM duration correlated with recall performance for the relevant (second) list within the forget subgroup, and with recall performance for the first list within the remember subgroup. Conclusions: A directed forgetting effect persists after a 2-hour delay spent awake or asleep. Spindle-related activity and subsequent REM sleep might selectively facilitate the processing of memories that are considered to be relevant for the future.

The onset patterns of focal seizure activity have been studied intensively, and they have largely been distinguished into two types D low amplitude fast oscillations (LAF), or high amplitude spikes (HAS). Here we explore whether these two patterns arise from fundamentally different mechanisms. Here, we use a previously established computational model of neocortical tissue, and validate it as an adequate model using clinical recordings of focal seizures. We then reproduce the two onset patterns in their most defining properties and investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the different focal seizure onset patterns in the model. We show that the two patterns are associated with different mechanisms at the spatial scale of a single ECoG electrode. The LAF onset is initiated by independent patches of localised activity, which slowly invade the surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, the HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. We find that such a global transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of the "healthy" surrounding tissue, which by itself does not generate seizures, but can support seizure activity when incited. In our simulations, the difference in surrounding tissue excitability also offers a simple explanation of the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate in the model how changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated, in principle, using active stimulation. Taken together, our modelling results suggest that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the seizure core may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern, as well as in the surgical outcome.

J	Northoff, G				Northoff, Georg			"Paradox of slow frequencies" - Are slow frequencies in upper cortical layers a neural predisposition of the level/state of consciousness (NPC)?	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article							RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; RESTING-STATE ACTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; EEG FLUCTUATIONS; DEFAULT MODE; DYNAMICS; PHASE	Consciousness research has much focused on faster frequencies like alpha or gamma while neglecting the slower ones in the infraslow (0.001-0.1 Hz) and slow (0.1-1 Hz) frequency range. These slower frequency ranges have a "bad reputation" though; their increase in power can observed during the loss of consciousness as in sleep, anesthesia, and vegetative state. However, at the same time, slower frequencies have been conceived instrumental for consciousness. The present paper aims to resolve this paradox which I describe as "paradox of slow frequencies". I first show various data that suggest a central role of slower frequencies in integrating faster ones, i.e., "temporo-spatial integration and nestedness". Such "temporo-spatial integration and nestedness" is disrupted during the loss of consciousness as in anesthesia and sleep leading to "temporo-spatial fragmentation and isolation" between slow and fast frequencies. Slow frequencies are supposedly mediated by neural activity in upper cortical layers in higher-order associative regions as distinguished from lower cortical layers that are related to faster frequencies. Taken together, slower and faster frequencies take on different roles for the level/state of consciousness. Faster frequencies by themselves are sufficient and thus a neural correlate of consciousness (NCC) while slower frequencies are a necessary non-sufficient condition of possible consciousness, e.g., a neural predisposition of the level/state of consciousness (NPC). This resolves the "paradox of slow frequencies" in that it assigns different roles to slower and faster frequencies in consciousness, i.e., NCC and NPC. Taken as NCC and NPC, fast and slow frequencies including their relation as in "temporo-spatial integration and nestedness" can be considered a first "building bloc" of a future "temporo-spatial theory of consciousness" (TTC) (Northoff, 2013; Northoff, 2014b; Northoff 82 Huang, 2017).

The hippocampus has been documented to undergo morphological and functional changes depending on these rearing environments. For example, rearing condition during juvenility alters CA1 stratum radiatum gamma oscillation power in rats. In the present study, hippocampal CA1 local field potentials (LFP) were recorded from bilateral CA1 in urethane-anaesthetized mice that were reared in either an ENR or ISO condition. Similar to previous findings in rats, gamma oscillation power during theta states was higher in the ENR group. Ripple events that occur during non-theta periods in the CA1 stratum pyramidale also had longer intervals in ISO mice. Because astrocytic Ca2+ elevations play a key role in synaptic plasticity, we next tested whether these changes in LFP are also expressed in inositol trisphosphate receptor type 2 (IP(3)R2)-knockout (KO) mice, in which astrocytic Ca2+ elevations are largely diminished. We found that the gamma power was also higher in IP(3)R2-KO-ENR mice compared to IP(3)R2-KO-ISO mice, suggesting that the rearing-environment-dependent gamma power alteration does not necessarily require the astrocytic IP3/Ca2+ pathway. By contrast, ripple events showed genotype-dependent changes, as well as rearing condition-dependent changes: ISO housing and IP(3)R2 deficiency both lead to longer inter-ripple intervals. Moreover, we found that ripple magnitude in the right CA1 tended to be smaller in IP(3)R2-KO. Because IP(3)R2-KO mice have been reported to have depression phenotypes, our results suggest that ripple events and the mood of animals may be broadly correlated.

Acoustic Enhancement of Sleep Slow Oscillations and Concomitant Memory Improvement in Older Adults	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						acoustic stimulation; sleep; aging; slow waves; memory	SUBJECTIVE COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS; CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; DATA SET UDS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; DEPENDENT MEMORY; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; WAVE ACTIVITY; CONSOLIDATION; EEG; PHASE	Acoustic stimulation methods applied during sleep in young adults can increase slow wave activity (SWA) and improve sleep-dependent memory retention. It is unknown whether this approach enhances SWA and memory in older adults, who generally have reduced SWA compared to younger adults. Additionally, older adults are at risk for age-related cognitive impairment and therefore may benefit from non-invasive interventions. The aim of this study was to determine if acoustic stimulation can increase SWA and improve declarative memory in healthy older adults. Thirteen participants 60-84 years old completed one night of acoustic stimulation and one night of sham stimulation in random order. During sleep, a real-time algorithm using an adaptive phase-locked loop modeled the phase of endogenous slow waves in midline frontopolar electroencephalographic recordings. Pulses of pink noise were delivered when the upstate of the slow wave was predicted. Each interval of five pulses ("ON interval") was followed by a pause of approximately equal length ("OFF interval"). SWA during the entire sleep period was similar between stimulation and sham conditions, whereas SWA and spindle activity were increased during ON intervals compared to matched periods during the sham night. The increases in SWA and spindle activity were sustained across almost the entire five-pulse ON interval compared to matched sham periods. Verbal paired-associate memory was tested before and after sleep. Overnight improvement in word recall was significantly greater with acoustic stimulation compared to sham and was correlated with changes in SWA between ON and OFF intervals. Using the phase-locked-loop method to precisely target acoustic stimulation to the upstate of sleep slow oscillations, we were able to enhance SWA and improve sleep-dependent memory storage in older adults, which strengthens the theoretical link between sleep and age-related memory integrity.

The effect of mobile phone radiation on patients with seizures is not known. Objective To compare the seizure profile of patients not using mobile phones with that of their peers using mobile phones. Methods In a retrospective cohort study performed at the neurology outpatient department of Guntur Medical College Hospital, Guntur, India from September 2014 to September 2015, we included 178 consecutive epileptic patients aged 16-65 years, who had had seizure disorder for 1 year or more. On the basis of their possession and usage of mobile phones, patients were divided into three groups: no mobile group (NMG), home mobile group (HMG) and personal mobile group (PMG). We obtained data on seizure frequency and recorded details of mobile phone usage and their antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Results 107 NMG, 3 HMG and 68 PMG patients were finalised for the analysis. There was no significant difference in the number of seizures in the past year between the three groups. The PMG (3.7%) contained a clinically significant lower proportion of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy than the NMG (28.2%). Patients with drug-responsive epilepsy were 7.4 (95% CI 1.4 to 39.9) (p=0.01) times more likely to be found in the PMG than in the NMG after adjustment for differences in sex and occupation. Conclusions Although the experimental data remain inconclusive, our clinical study suggests that patients who use mobile phones are less likely to have drug-resistant epilepsy.

Eighteen participants were administered light-to-moderate intensity bouts of cycle ergometer exercise. Each exercise bout was of 12-min duration (warm-up [3 min], exercise [6 min], and warm-down [3 min]). Portable techniques were used to monitor the electrical activity in the brain, heart, and muscle during the administration of three conditions: music, audiobook, and control. Conditions were randomized and counterbalanced to prevent any influence of systematic order on the dependent variables. Oscillatory potentials at the Cz electrode site were used to further understanding of time frequency changes influenced by voluntary control of movements. Spectral coherence analysis between Cz and frontal, frontal-central, central, central-parietal, and parietal electrode sites was also calculated. Perceptual and affective measures were taken at five timepoints during the exercise bout. Results indicated that music reallocated participants' attentional focus toward auditory pathways and reduced perceived exertion. The music also inhibited alpha resynchronization at the Cz electrode site and reduced the spectral coherence values at Cz-C4 and Cz-Fz. The reduced focal awareness induced by music led to a more autonomous control of cycle movements performed at light-to-moderate-intensities. Processing of interoceptive sensory cues appears to upmodulate fatigue-related sensations, increase the connectivity in the frontal and central regions of the brain, and is associated with neural resynchronization to sustain the imposed exercise intensity.

J	Zhao, ZF; Li, XZ; Wan, Y				Zhao, Zi-Fang; Li, Xue-Zhu; Wan, You			Mapping the Information Trace in Local Field Potentials by a Computational Method of Two-Dimensional Time-Shifting Synchronization Likelihood Based on Graphic Processing Unit Acceleration	NEUROSCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						Local field potential; Synchronization; Temporal; Time-shifting; Parallel computing	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; HIGH-FREQUENCY; BRAIN; THETA; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; MEMORY; PAIN	The local field potential (LFP) is a signal reflecting the electrical activity of neurons surrounding the electrode tip. Synchronization between LFP signals provides important details about how neural networks are organized. Synchronization between two distant brain regions is hard to detect using linear synchronization algorithms like correlation and coherence. Synchronization likelihood (SL) is a non-linear synchronization-detecting algorithm widely used in studies of neural signals from two distant brain areas. One drawback of non-linear algorithms is the heavy computational burden. In the present study, we proposed a graphic processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementation of an SL algorithm with optional 2-dimensional time-shifting. We tested the algorithm with both artificial data and raw LFP data. The results showed that this method revealed detailed information from original data with the synchronization values of two temporal axes, delay time and onset time, and thus can be used to reconstruct the temporal structure of a neural network. Our results suggest that this GPU-accelerated method can be extended to other algorithms for processing time-series signals (like EEG and fMRI) using similar recording techniques.

J	Krook-Magnuson, E				Krook-Magnuson, Esther			The Gate and the Source? The Dentate Gyrus Takes Central Stage in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							SPONTANEOUS SEIZURES; ACTIVATION; MODEL	Following prolonged perforant pathway stimulation (PPS) in rats, a seizure-free "latent period" is observed that lasts around 3 weeks. During this time, aberrant neuronal activity occurs, which has been hypothesized to contribute to the generation of an "epileptic" network. This study was designed to 1) examine the pathological network activity that occurs in the dentate gyrus during the latent period, and 2) determine whether suppressing this activity by removing the main input to the dentate gyrus could stop or prolong epileptogenesis. Immediately following PPS, continuous video-EEG monitoring was used to record spontaneous neuronal activity and detect seizures. During the latent period, low frequency oscillations (LFOs), occurring at a rate of approximately 1 Hz, were detected in the dentate gyrus of all rats that developed epilepsy. LFO incidence was apparently random, but often decreased in the hour preceding a spontaneous seizure. Bilateral transection of the perforant pathway did not impact the incidence of hippocampal LFOs, the latency to epilepsy, or hippocampal neuropathology. Our main findings are: 1) LFOs are a reliable biomarker of hippocampal epileptogenesis, and 2) removing entorhinal cortex input to the hippocampus neither reduces the occurrence of LFOs nor has a demonstrable antiepileptogenic effect.											10	2	2	1	2	AMER EPILEPSY SOCIETY	WEST HARTFORD	342 NORTH MAIN STREET, WEST HARTFORD, CT 06117-2507 USA	1535-7597	1535-7511		EPILEPSY CURR	Epilepsy Curr.

Event-related Potentials (ERPs) effects (Feedback Related Negativity (FRN) and P300) were monitored in concomitance with Behavioral Activation System (BAS) modulation. High-IAT young participants showed specific responses to IA-related cues (videos representing online gambling and videogames) in terms of cognitive performance (decreased Response Times, RTs; and Error Rates, ERs) and ERPs modulation (decreased FRN and increased P300). Consistent reward and attentional biases was adduced to explain the cognitive gain effect and the anomalous response in terms of both feedback behavior (FRN) and attentional (P300) mechanisms in high-IAT. In addition, BAS and BAS-Reward subscales measures were correlated with both IAT and ERPs variations. Therefore, high sensitivity to IAT may be considered as a marker of dysfunctional reward processing (reduction of monitoring) and cognitive control (higher attentional values) for specific IA-related cues. More generally, a direct relationship among reward-related behavior, Internet addiction and BAS attitude was suggested.

Real-time EEG-based brain-computer interface to a virtual avatar enhances cortical involvement in human treadmill walking	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; STROKE REHABILITATION; MOTOR; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; BETA; LIMB; SYNCHRONIZATION; ADJUSTMENTS	Recent advances in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies have shown the feasibility of neural decoding for both users' gait intent and continuous kinematics. However, the dynamics of cortical involvement in human upright walking with a closed-loop BCI has not been investigated. This study aims to investigate the changes of cortical involvement in human treadmill walking with and without BCI control of a walking avatar. Source localization revealed significant differences in cortical network activity between walking with and without closed-loop BCI control. Our results showed sustained alpha/mu suppression in the Posterior Parietal Cortex and Inferior Parietal Lobe, indicating increases of cortical involvement during walking with BCI control. We also observed significant increased activity of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) in the low frequency band suggesting the presence of a cortical network involved in error monitoring and motor learning. Additionally, the presence of low. modulations in the ACC and Superior Temporal Gyrus may associate with increases of voluntary control of human gait. This work is a further step toward the development of a novel training paradigm for improving the efficacy of rehabilitation in a top-down approach.

In a medical apparatus, a set of these techniques essentially work in real time. It contains the vital communications hardware and an advanced level software interface which enables the user to work in real time mainly for biomedical applications where processing speed, stability and accuracy is very important. This paper addresses the stability issues of digital filters in the presence of external disturbance to the real time biomedical computing system. Specifically, new output strict and input strict passivity criteria for fixed-point state-space digital filters with saturation arithmetic in the presence of external interference for biomedical applications are established. The proposed linear matrix inequality-based criteria confirm the asymptotic stability of the digital filter in the absence of external interference. The proposed approach may produce larger stability region in the parameter-space which will be useful for the processing of biomedical signals and images. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the usefulness of the presented criteria.	[Arockiaraj, S.

J	Zanin, M; Papo, D				Zanin, Massimiliano; Papo, David			Detecting switching and intermittent causalities in time series	CHAOS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; GRANGER CAUSALITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ALCOHOLISM; GRAY	During the last decade, complex network representations have emerged as a powerful instrument for describing the cross-talk between different brain regions both at rest and as subjects are carrying out cognitive tasks, in healthy brains and neurological pathologies. The transient nature of such cross-talk has nevertheless by and large been neglected, mainly due to the inherent limitations of some metrics,e.g., causality ones, which require a long time series in order to yield statistically significant results. Here, we present a methodology to account for intermittent causal coupling in neural activity, based on the identification of non-overlapping windows within the original time series in which the causality is strongest. The result is a less coarse-grained assessment of the time-varying properties of brain interactions, which can be used to create a high temporal resolution time-varying network. We apply the proposed methodology to the analysis of the brain activity of control subjects and alcoholic patients performing an image recognition task. Our results show that short-lived, intermittent, local-scale causality is better at discriminating both groups than global network metrics. These results highlight the importance of the transient nature of brain activity, at least under some pathological conditions. Published by AIP Publishing.

It is not clear, however, if this coherence reflects the control strategy selected by the nervous system for a given task, or if it instead reflects an intrinsic property of cortico-spinal communication. Here, we measured corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence between muscles of index finger and thumb while a two-finger pinch grip of identical net force was applied to objects which were either stable (allowing synergistic activation of finger muscles) or unstable (requiring individuated finger control). We found that beta-band corticomuscular coherence with the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles, as well as their beta-band coherence with each other, was significantly reduced when individuated control of the thumb and index finger was required. We interpret these findings to show that beta-band coherence is reflective of a synergistic control strategy in which the cortex binds task-related motor neurons into functional units.

But what are the consequences at the behavioural and neural level? While numerous studies have investigated both auditory attention and visual gaze independently, little is known about their interaction during selective listening. In the present EEG study, we manipulated visual gaze independently of auditory attention while participants detected targets presented from one of three loudspeakers. We observed increased response times when gaze was directed away from the locus of auditory attention. Further, we found an increase in occipital alpha-band power contralateral to the direction of gaze, indicative of a suppression of distracting input. Finally, this condition also led to stronger central theta-band power, which correlated with the observed effect in response times, indicative of differences in top-down processing. Our data suggest that a misalignment between gaze and auditory attention both reduce behavioural performance and modulate underlying neural processes. The involvement of central theta-band and occipital alpha-band effects are in line with compensatory neural mechanisms such as increased cognitive control and the suppression of task irrelevant inputs.

For this work, we have selected the Skill, Rule and Knowledge (SRK) model proposed by Rasmussen in 1983. This model is currently broadly used in safety critical domains, such as the aviation. Nowadays, there are no tools able to assess at which level of cognitive control the operator is dealing with the considered task, that is if he/she is performing the task as an automated routine ( skill level), as procedures-based activity ( rule level), or as a problem-solving process ( knowledge level). Several studies tried to model the SRK behaviours from a Human Factor perspective. Despite such studies, there are no evidences in which such behaviours have been evaluated from a neurophysiological point of view, for example, by considering brain activity variations across the different SRK levels. Therefore, the proposed study aimed to investigate the use of neurophysiological signals to assess the cognitive control behaviours accordingly to the SRK taxonomy. The results of the study, performed on 37 professional Air Traffic Controllers, demonstrated that specific brain features could characterize and discriminate the different SRK levels, therefore enabling an objective assessment of the degree of cognitive control behaviours in realistic settings.

J	Stevens, RH; Galloway, TL				Stevens, Ronald H.; Galloway, Trysha L.			Are Neurodynamic Organizations A Fundamental Property of Teamwork?	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						teamwork; EEG; social coordination; team neurodynamics; information theory; entropy; uncertainty	OSCILLATIONS; COMMUNICATION; CONNECTION	When performing a task it is important for teams to optimize their strategies and actions to maximize value and avoid the cost of surprise. The decisions teams make sometimes have unintended consequences and they must then reorganize their thinking, roles and/or configuration into corrective structures more appropriate for the situation. In this study we ask: What are the neurodynamic properties of these reorganizations and how do they relate to the moment-by-moment, and longer, performance-outcomes of teams?. We describe an information-organization approach for detecting and quantitating the fluctuating neurodynamic organizations in teams. Neurodynamic organization is the propensity of team members to enter into prolonged (minutes) metastable neurodynamic relationships as they encounter and resolve disturbances to their normal rhythms. Team neurodynamic organizations were detected and modeled by transforming the physical units of each team member's EEG power levels into Shannon entropy-derived information units about the team's organization and synchronization. Entropy is a measure of the variability or uncertainty of information in a data stream. This physical unit to information unit transformation bridges micro level social coordination events with macro level expert observations of team behavior allowing multimodal comparisons across the neural, cognitive and behavioral time scales of teamwork. The measures included the entropy of each team member's data stream, the overall team entropy and the mutual information between dyad pairs of the team. Mutual information can be thought of as periods related to team member synchrony. Comparisons between individual entropy and mutual information levels for the dyad combinations of three-person teams provided quantitative estimates of the proportion of a person's neurodynamic organizations that represented periods of synchrony with other team members, which in aggregate provided measures of the overall degree of neurodynamic interactions of the team. We propose that increased neurodynamic organization occurs when a team's operating rhythm can no longer support the complexity of the task and the team needs to expend energy to re-organize into structures that better minimize the "surprise" in the environment. Consistent with this hypothesis, the frequency and magnitude of neurodynamic organizations were less in experienced military and healthcare teams than they were in more junior teams. Similar dynamical properties of neurodynamic organization were observed in models of the EEG data streams of military, healthcare and high school science teams suggesting that neurodynamic organization may be a common property of teamwork. The innovation of this study is the potential it raises for developing globally applicable quantitative models of team dynamics that will allow comparisons to be made across teams, tasks and training protocols.

We explored the use of noisy (10-115 Hz) Achilles tendon vibration to examine somatosensory reflexes in the triceps surae muscles in standing healthy young adults (n = 8). We also examined the association between noisy vibration and electrical activity recorded over the sensorimotor cortex using electroencephalography. We applied 2 min of vibration and recorded ongoing muscle activity of the soleus and gastrocnemii using surface electromyography (EMG). Vibration amplitude was varied to characterize reflex scaling and to examine how different stimulus levels affected postural sway. Muscle activity from the soleus and gastrocnemii was significantly correlated with the tendon vibration across a broad frequency range (similar to 10-80 Hz), with a peak located at similar to 40 Hz. Vibration-EMG coherence positively scaled with stimulus amplitude in all three muscles, with soleus displaying the strongest coupling and steepest scaling. EMG responses lagged the vibration by similar to 38 ms, a delay that paralleled observed response latencies to tendon taps. Vibrationevoked cortical oscillations were observed at frequencies similar to 40-70 Hz (peak similar to 54 Hz) in most subjects, a finding in line with previous reports of sensory-evoked gamma-band oscillations. Further examination of the method revealed 1) accurate reflex estimates could be obtained with <60 s of low-level (root mean square = 10 m/s(2)) vibration; 2) responses did not habituate over 2 min of exposure; and importantly, 3) noisy vibration had a minimal influence on standing balance. Our findings suggest noisy tendon vibration is an effective novel approach to characterize somatosensory reflexes during standing. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We applied noisy (10-115 Hz) vibration to the Achilles tendon to examine the frequency characteristics of lower limb somatosensory reflexes during standing. Ongoing muscle activity was coherent with the noisy vibration (peak coherence similar to 40 Hz), and coherence positively scaled with increases in stimulus amplitude. Our findings suggest that noisy tendon vibration, along with linear systems analysis, is an effective novel approach to study somatosensory reflex actions in active muscles.

Seizure-associated central apnea in a rat model: Evidence for resetting the respiratory rhythm and activation of the diving reflex	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Respiration; Hypoxia; larynx; Plethysmography	KOLLIKER-FUSE NUCLEUS; SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; PHRENIC MOTONEURONS; PREBOTZINGER COMPLEX; EPILEPSY ANALYSIS; SHEEP MODEL; NEURONS; MECHANISMS; GENERATION; HYPOVENTILATION	Respiratory derangements, including irregular, tachypnic breathing and central or obstructive apnea can be consequences of seizure activity in epilepsy patients and animal models. Periods of seizure-associated central apnea, defined as periods >1 s with rapid onset and offset of no airflow during plethysmography, suggest that seizures spread to brainstem respiratory regions to disrupt breathing. We sought to characterize seizure-associated central apneic episodes as an indicator of seizure impact on the respiratory rhythm in rats anesthetized with urethane and given parenteral kainic acid to induce recurring seizures. We measured central apneic period onsets and offsets to determine if onset-offset relations were a consequence of 1) a reset of the respiratory rhythm, 2) a transient pausing of the respiratory rhythm, resuming from the pause point at the end of the apneic period, 3) a transient suppression of respiratory behavior with apnea offset predicted by a continuation of the breathing pattern preceding apnea, or 4) a random re-entry into the respiratory cycle. Animals were monitored with continuous ECG, EEG, and plethysmography. One hundred ninety central apnea episodes (1.04 to 36.18 s, mean: 3.2 +/- 3.7 s) were recorded during seizure activity from 7 rats with multiple apneic episodes. The majority of apneic period onsets occurred during expiration (125/161 apneic episodes, 78%). In either expiration or inspiration, apneic onsets tended to occur late in the cycle, i.e. between the time of the peak and end of expiration (82/125, 66%) or inspiration (34/36, 94%). Apneic period offsets were more uniformly distributed between early and late expiration (27%, 34%) and inspiration (16%, 23%). Differences between the respiratory phase at the onset of apnea and the corresponding offset phase varied widely, even within individual animals. Each central apneic episode was associated with a high frequency event in EEG or ECG records at onset. High frequency events that were not associated with flatline plethysmographs revealed a constant plethysmograph pattern within each animal, suggesting a clear reset of the respiratory rhythm. The respiratory rhythm became highly variable after about 1 s, however, accounting for the unpredictability of the offset phase. The dissociation of respiratory rhythm reset from the cessation of airflow also suggested that central apneic periods involved activation of brainstem regions serving the diving reflex to eliminate the expression of respiratory movements. This conclusion was supported by the decreased heart rate as a function of apnea duration. We conclude that seizure-associated central apnea episodes are associated with 1) a reset of the respiratory rhythm, and 2) activation of brainstem regions serving the diving reflex to suppress respiratory behavior. The significance of these conclusions is that these details of seizure impact on brainstem circuitry represent metrics for assessing seizure spread and potentially subclassifying seizure patterns.

N-back Versus Complex Span Working Memory Training	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT			English	Article						Cognitive training; Working memory; Transfer; Alpha power	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; IMPROVING FLUID INTELLIGENCE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG-ALPHA; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; SPATIAL RELATIONS; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; CAPACITY	Working memory (WM) is the ability to maintain and manipulate task-relevant information in the absence of sensory input. While its improvement through training is of great interest, the degree to which WM training transfers to untrained WM tasks (near transfer) and other untrained cognitive skills (far transfer) remains debated and the mechanism(s) underlying transfer are unclear. Here we hypothesized that a critical feature of dual n-back training is its reliance on maintaining relational information in WM. In experiment 1, using an individual differences approach, we found evidence that performance on an n-back task was predicted by performance on a measure of relational WM (i.e., WM for vertical spatial relationships independent of absolute spatial locations), whereas the same was not true for a complex span WM task. In experiment 2, we tested the idea that reliance on relational WM is critical to produce transfer from n-back but not complex span task training. Participants completed adaptive training on either a dual n-back task, a symmetry span task, or on a non-WM active control task. We found evidence of near transfer for the dual n-back group; however, far transfer to a measure of fluid intelligence did not emerge. Recording EEG during a separate WM transfer task, we examined group-specific, training-related changes in alpha power, which are proposed to be sensitive to WM demands and top-down modulation of WM. Results indicated that the dual n-back group showed significantly greater frontal alpha power after training compared to before training, more so than both other groups. However, we found no evidence of improvement on measures of relational WM for the dual n-back group, suggesting that near transfer may not be dependent on relational WM. These results suggest that dual n-back and complex span task training may differ in their effectiveness to elicit near transfer as well as in the underlying neural changes they facilitate.

J	Miran, S; Purdon, PL; Brown, EN; Babadi, B				Miran, Sina; Purdon, Patrick L.; Brown, Emery N.; Babadi, Behtash			Robust Estimation of Sparse Narrowband Spectra from Neuronal Spiking Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Neural signal processing; point process models; power spectral density (PSD); spectral estimation	FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EEG; DYNAMICS; MODEL; ONSET	Objective: Characterizing the spectral properties of neuronal responses is an important problem in computational neuroscience, as it provides insight into the spectral organization of the underlying functional neural processes. Although spectral analysis techniques are widely used in the analysis of noninvasive neural recordings such as EEG, their application to spiking data is limited due to the binary and nonlinear nature of neuronal spiking. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the power spectral density of the neural covariate driving the spiking statistics of a neuronal population from binary observations. Methods: We consider a neuronal ensemble spiking according to Bernoulli statistics, for which the conditional intensity function is given by the logistic map of a harmonic second-order stationary process with sparse narrowband spectra. By employing sparsity-promoting priors, we compute the maximum a posteriori estimate of the power spectral density of the process from the binary spiking observations. Furthermore, we construct confidence intervals for these estimates by an efficient posterior sampling procedure. Results: We provide simulation studies which reveal that our method outperforms the existing methods for extracting the frequency content of spiking data. Application of our method to clinically recorded spiking data from a patient under general anesthesia reveals a striking resemblance between our estimated power spectral density and that of the local field potential signal. This result corroborates existing findings regarding the salient role of the local field potential as a major neural covariate of rhythmic cortical spiking activity under anesthesia. Conclusion: Our technique allows us to analyze the harmonic structure of spiking activity in a robust fashion, independently of the local field potentials, and without any prior assumption of the spectral spread and content of the underlying neural processes. Significance: Other than its usage in the spectral analysis of neuronal spiking data, our technique can be applied to a wide variety of binary data, such as heart beat data, in order to obtain a robust spectral representation.

Neuronal networks in the developing brain are adversely modulated by early psychosocial neglect	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain networks; EEG; early development; psychosocial neglect	MEDIAL PARIETOOCCIPITAL CORTEX; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; EARLY INTERVENTION PROJECT; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; DEFAULT MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EARLY DEPRIVATION; FOSTER-CARE; NEURAL DEVELOPMENT; CHILDREN	The brain's neural circuitry plays a ubiquitous role across domains in cognitive processing and undergoes extensive reorganization during the course of development in part as a result of experience. In this study we investigated the effects of profound early psychosocial neglect associated with institutional rearing on the development of task-independent brain networks, estimated from longitudinally acquired electroencephalographic (EEG) data from <30 to 96 mo, in three cohorts of children from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP), including abandoned children reared in institutions who were randomly assigned either to a foster care intervention or to remain in care as usual and never-institutionalized children. Two aberrantly connected brain networks were identified in children that had been reared in institutions: 1) a hyperconnected parieto-occipital network, which included cortical hubs and connections that may partially overlap with default-mode network, and 2) a hypoconnected network between left temporal and distributed bilateral regions, both of which were aberrantly connected across neural oscillations. This study provides the first evidence of the adverse effects of early psychosocial neglect on the wiring of the developing brain. Given these networks' potentially significant role in various cognitive processes, including memory, learning, social communication, and language, these findings suggest that institutionalization in early life may profoundly impact the neural correlates underlying multiple cognitive domains, in ways that may not be fully reversible in the short term. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This paper provides first evidence that early psychosocial neglect associated with institutional rearing profoundly affects the development of the brain's neural circuitry. Using longitudinally acquired electrophysiological data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP), the paper identifies multiple taskindependent networks that are abnormally connected (hyper- or hypoconnected) in children reared in institutions compared with never-institutionalized children. These networks involve spatially distributed brain areas and their abnormal connections may adversely impact neural information processing across cognitive domains.

Altered modulation of sensorimotor rhythms with chronic paralysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						paralysis; spinal cord injury; sensorimotor rhythms; event-related desynchronization; magnetoencephalography	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BAND ACTIVITY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; IMAGERY; EEG; MOVEMENT; MEG	After paralysis, the disconnection between the cortex and its peripheral targets leads to neuroplasticity throughout the nervous system. However, it is unclear how chronic paralysis specifically impacts cortical oscillations associated with attempted movement of impaired limbs. We hypothesized that mu-(8-13 Hz) and beta-(15-30 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) would be less modulated for individuals with hand paralysis due to cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). To test this, we compared the modulation of ERD from magnetoencephalography (MEG) during attempted and imagined grasping performed by participants with cervical SCI (n = 12) and able-bodied controls (n = 13). Seven participants with tetraplegia were able to generate some electromyography (EMG) activity during attempted grasping, whereas the other five were not. The peak and area of ERD were significantly decreased for individuals without volitional muscle activity when they attempted to grasp compared with able-bodied subjects and participants with SCI, with some residual EMG activity. However, no significant differences were found between subject groups during mentally simulated tasks (i.e., motor imagery) where no muscle activity or somatosensory consequences were expected. These findings suggest that individuals who are unable to produce muscle activity are capable of generating ERD when attempting to move, but the characteristics of this ERD are altered. However, for people who maintain volitional muscle activity after SCI, there are no significant differences in ERD characteristics compared with able-bodied controls. These results provide evidence that ERD is dependent on the level of intact muscle activity after SCI. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Source space MEG was used to investigate sensorimotor cortical oscillations in individuals with SCI. This study provides evidence that individuals with cervical SCI exhibit decreased ERD when they attempt to grasp if they are incapable of generating muscle activity. However, there were no significant differences in ERD between paralyzed and able-bodied participants during motor imagery. These results have important implications for the design and evaluation of new therapies, such as motor imagery and neurofeedback interventions.

This study investigates how these responses change from simple reading of numerals to the active use of numerals in an arithmetic context. We recorded high-frequency broadband (HFB) signals, a reliable measure for local neuronal population activity, while 10 epilepsy patients implanted with subdural electrodes performed separate numeral reading and calculation tasks. We found that calculation increased activity in the posterior inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) with a factor of approximately 1.5 over the first 500 ms of calculation, whereas no such increase was noted for reading numerals without calculation or reading and judging memory statements. In a second experiment conducted in 2 of the same subjects, we show that HFB responses increase in a systematic manner when the single numerals were presented successively in a calculation context: The HFB response in the ITG, to the second and third numerals (i.e., b and c in a + b = c), was approximately 1.5 times larger than the responses to the first numeral (a). These results provide electrophysiological evidence for modulation of local neuronal population responses to visual stimuli based on increasing task demands.

We prepared simulation data and 65 clinical cases of seizure. In addition, various filtering algorithms including bandpass filtering, empirical mode decomposition, multivariate empirical mode decomposition and noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) were used to decompose spectral components from the data. Moreover, in the case of clinical data, the PLVs were used to classify between interictal and preictal stages using a support vector machine. The highest PLV was achieved with NA-MEMD with 0-dB white noise algorithm (0.9988), which exhibited statistically significant differences compared to other filtering algorithms. Moreover, the classification rate was the highest for the NA-MEMD with 0-dB algorithm (83.17%). In terms of frequency components, examining the gamma band resulted in the highest classification rates for all algorithms, compared to other frequency bands such as theta, alpha, and beta bands. We found that PLVs calculated with the NA-MEMD algorithm could be used as a potential biological marker for seizure prediction. Moreover, the gamma frequency band was useful for discriminating between interictal and preictal stages.

The application of graph theory to neuroimaging data has become an effective approach for characterizing topographical patterns of large-scale functional networks. We used a graph approach to investigate alteration of functional networks in childhood ASD. Method: Magnetoencephalographic signals were quantified using graph-theoretic metrics with a phase lag index (PLI) for specific bands in 24 children with autism spectrum disorder and 24 typically developing controls. Results: No significant group difference of PLI was found. Regarding topological organization, enhanced and reduced small-worldness, representing the efficiency of information processing, were observed respectively in ASD children, particularly in the gamma band and delta band. Conclusions: Analyses revealed frequency-dependent atypical neural network topologies in ASD children. Significance: Our findings underscore the recently proposed atypical neural network theory of ASD during childhood. Graph theory with PLI applied to magnetoencephalographic signals might be a useful approach for characterizing the frequency-specific neurophysiological bases of ASD.

These networks are composed of two connection layers: network of chemical synapses and the one formed by gap junctions. This work studies the contribution of each layer on the phase synchronization of non-identical spiking Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. The network of male C. elegans shows higher phase synchronization than its randomized version, while it is not the case for hermaphrodite type. The random networks in each layer are constructed such that the nodes have the same degree as the original network, thus providing an unbiased comparison. In male C elegans, although the gap junction network is sparser than the chemical network, it shows higher contribution in the synchronization phenomenon. This is not the case in hermaphrodite type, which is mainly due to significant less density of gap junction layer (0.013) as compared to chemical layer (0.028). Also, the gap junction network in this type has stronger community structure than the chemical network, and this is another driving factor for its weaker synchronizability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Frontal theta accounts for individual differences in the cost of conflict on decision making	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article							RISK-TASK BART; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CINGULATE CORTEX; EEG; BEHAVIOR; OSCILLATIONS; AVOIDANCE; BRAIN	Cognitive conflict is often experienced as a difficult, frustrating, and aversive state. Recent studies have indicated that conflict acts as an implicit cost during learning, valuation, and the instantiation of cognitive control. Here we investigated if an implicit manipulation of conflict also influences explicit decision making to risk. Participants were required to perform a Balloon Analogue Risk Task wherein the virtual balloon was inflated by performing a flankers task. By varying the percent of incongruent flanker trials between balloons, we hypothesized that participants would pump the balloon fewer times in conditions of higher conflict and that frontal midline theta would account for significant variance in this relationship. Across two studies, we demonstrate that conflict did not elicit reliable behavioral changes in this task across participants. However, individual differences in frontal theta power accounted for significant variance by predicting diminished balloon pumps. Thus, while conflict costs may act as investments to some individuals (invigorating behavior), it is aversive to others (diminishing behavior), and frontal mid line theta power accounts for these varying behavioral tendencies between individuals. These findings demonstrate how frontal midline theta is not only a candidate mechanism for implementing cognitive control, but it is sensitive to the inherent costs therein. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Since movement preparation is dependent upon the synchronous activity of a variety of neurons, BP may develop through the exchange of information among motor-related neurons. However, the relationship between BP and information flow is not yet well-known. In the present study, we aimed to investigate how the connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) changes during the occurrence of BP Electrocorticography (ECoG) was recorded in five patients with epilepsy. The subjects performed self-paced hand grasping. We compared the intraregional connectivity between PFC and non-PFC regions using partial directed coherence. In the PFC, the connectivity of beta and gamma bands in the BP period increased by an average of 24.4% compared with the baseline connectivity. Conversely, gamma connectivity in non-PFC regions decreased by 31.4%. Moreover, the intraregional connectivity in the PFC increased according to the stage of BR The increased gamma band connectivity in the PFC implies that the increased communication among neurons in the PFC is associated with development of BP. Intraregional connectivity as one of the factors involved in voluntary movement may reflect the activation of brain networks related to movement preparation in PFC.

Neural mirroring and social interaction: Motor system involvement during action observation relates to early peer cooperation	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neural mirroring; Interpersonal coordination; Cooperation; Social interaction; Peers; Early childhood	JOINT ACTION; MU SUPPRESSION; RHYTHMS; EMPATHY; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; COMPETENCE; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS	Whether we hand over objects to someone, play a team sport, or make music together, social interaction often involves interpersonal action coordination, both during instances of cooperation and entrainment. Neural mirroring is thought to play a crucial role in processing other's actions and is therefore considered important for social interaction. Still, to date, it is unknown whether interindividual differences in neural mirroring play a role in interpersonal coordination during different instances of social interaction. A relation between neural mirroring and interpersonal coordination has particularly relevant implications for early childhood, since successful early interaction with peers is predictive of a more favorable social development. We examined the relation between neural mirroring and children's interpersonal coordination during peer interaction using EEG and longitudinal behavioral data. Results showed that 4-year-old children with higher levels of motor system involvement during action observation (as indicated by lower beta-power) were more successful in early peer cooperation. This is the first evidence fora relation between motor system involvement during action observation and interpersonal coordination during other instances of social interaction. The findings suggest that interindividual differences in neural mirroring are related to interpersonal coordination and thus successful social interaction. (c) 2017 The Authors.

For saccades, it has recently been suggested that the necessity to choose is, in fact, an important factor mediating reward effects: latencies to single low-reward targets increased with an increasing proportion of interleaved choice-trials, in which participants were free to choose between two targets to obtain either a high or low reward. Here, we replicate this finding for manual responses, demonstrating that this effect of choice is a more general, effector-independent phenomenon. Oscillatory activity in the alpha and beta band in the preparatory period preceding target onset was analysed for a parieto-occipital and a centrolateral region of interest to identify an anticipatory neural biasing mechanism related to visuospatial attention or motor preparation. When the proportion of interleaved choices was high, an increase in lateralized posterior alpha power indicated that the hemifield associated with a low reward was suppressed in preparation for reward-maximizing target selection. The larger the individual increase in lateralized alpha power, the slower the reaction times to low-reward targets. At a broader level, these findings support the notion that reward only affects responses when behaviour can be optimized to maximize positive outcome.

However, its effect on performance monitoring and reward prediction errors remain unclear. To examine this issue, we used a standard mood induction procedure (based on guided imagery) and asked 45 participants to complete a gambling task suited to study reward prediction errors by means of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and mid-frontal theta band power. Results showed a larger FRN for negative feedback as well as a lack of reward expectation modulation for positive feedback at the theta level with positive mood, relative to a neutral mood condition. A control analysis showed that this latter result could not be explained by the mere superposition of the event-related brain potential component on the theta oscillations. Moreover, these neurophysiological effects were evidenced in the absence of impairments at the behavioral level or increase in autonomic arousal with positive mood, suggesting that this mood state reliably altered brain mechanisms of reward prediction errors during performance monitoring. We interpret these new results as reflecting a genuine mood congruency effect, whereby reward is anticipated as the default outcome with positive mood and therefore processed as unsurprising (even when it is unlikely), while negative feedback is perceived as unexpected.

As shown in recent studies, the degree of coordination between brain and autonomic arousal influences attention, which highlights a previously unrecognised point of potential failure in the attention system. To investigate how cortical and autonomic dynamics are linked to the attentive process we analysed electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram and skin conductance data of 39 healthy adults recorded during a 2-h resting-state oddball experiment. We related cross-correlations to fluctuation periods of cortical and autonomic signals and correlated obtained measures to event-related potentials N1 and P2, reflecting excitatory and inhibitory processes. Increasing alignment of cortical and autonomic signals and longer periods of vigilance fluctuations corresponded to a larger and earlier P2; no such relations were found for N1. We compared two groups, with (I) and without measurable (II) delay in cortico-autonomic correlations. Individuals in Group II had more stable vigilance fluctuations, larger and earlier P2 and fell asleep more frequently than individuals in Group I. Our results support the hypothesis of a link between cortico-autonomic coupling and dynamics and central inhibition. Quantifying this link could help refine classification in psychiatric disorders with attention and sleep-related symptoms, particularly in ADHD, depression, and insomnia.

However, no intracranial electrophysiological evidence for replay exists in humans. We identified consistent sequences of population firing peaks across widespread cortical regions during complete waking periods. The occurrence of these "Motifs" were compared between sleeps preceding the waking period ("Sleep-Pre") when the Motifs were identified, and those following ("Sleep-Post"). In all subjects, the majority of waking Motifs (most of which were novel) had more matches in Sleep-Post than in Sleep-Pre. In rodents, hippocampal replay occurs during local sharp-wave ripples, and the associated neocortical replay tends to occur during local sleep spindles and down-to-up transitions. These waves may facilitate consolidation by sequencing cell-firing and encouraging plasticity. Similarly, we found that Motifs were coupled to neocortical spindles, down-to-up transitions, theta bursts, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. While Motifs occurring during cognitive task performance were more likely to have more matches in subsequent sleep, our studies provide no direct demonstration that the replay of Motifs contributes to consolidation. Nonetheless, these results confirm a core prediction of the dominant neurobiological theory of human memory consolidation.

Contemporary knowledge justifies early diagnoses of the alcohol risk degree among adolescents, or even children, including their families, involving an examination of the P300 potential as an endophenotype, prior to achievement of an age of alcohol initiation. The results of such research approaches may be of importance not only cognitively, but also of prophylactically, in the early recognition of increased susceptibility to alcohol. The simplicity and non-invasiveness, and the exceptionally low costs of the methods described, should obtain for the present as well as in the future, a wider examination, one potentially even mass scope of in character and usefulness. The knowledge of such an endophenotype and genetically-related susceptibility, in the individual, family, and social dimension and transmission, and in the rearing of children and adolescents, could protect - not just individuals - but many from entering into the route of addiction, which is most frequently the effect of acting unaware and with negative life consequences, both generational and transgenerational for generations to come.

However, the brains of persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reportedly have what has been termed as "local over-connectivity." The neural activity of the ASD brain is also atypical; resting-state EEG signals in the ASD brain have lower complexity and enhanced power at low and high frequency oscillations. In this study, we used a small-world network model based on the model proposed by Watts and Strogatz to investigate the relationship between the degree of local over-connectivity and neural activity. We controlled the degree of local over-connectivity in the model according to the parameters laid out by Watts and Strogatz. We assessed connectivity using graph-theoretical approaches, and analyzed the complexity and frequency spectrum of the activity. We found that an ASD-like network with local over-connectivity (i.e., a high clustering coefficient and a high degree of centrality) would have excessively high power in the high frequency band, and less complexity than that of a network without local over-connectivity. This result supports the idea that local over-connectivity could underlie the characteristic brain electrical activity in persons with ASD.

Previous neuroimaging studies have reported a variety of neurophysiological correlates of illusory hand ownership, with conflicting results likely originating from differences in experimental parameters and control conditions. Here, we overcome these limitations by using a fully automated and precisely-timed visuo-tactile stimulation setup to record evoked responses and oscillatory responses in participants who felt the RHI. Importantly, we relied on a combination of experimental conditions to rule out confounds of attention, body-stimulus position and stimulus duration and on the combination of two control conditions to identify neurophysiological correlates of illusory hand ownership. In two separate experiments we observed a consistent illusion-related attenuation of ERPs around 330 ms over frontocentral electrodes, as well as decreases of frontal alpha and beta power during the illusion that could not be attributed to changes in attention, body-stimulus position or stimulus duration. Our results reveal neural correlates of illusory hand ownership in late and likely higher-order rather than early sensory processes, and support a role of premotor and possibly intraparietal areas in mediating illusory body ownership.

This study was designed to elicit and visualize event related changes during information encoding, maintenance and retrieval processes of working memory in depression. Electroencephalographic signals recorded during performance of 2 memory tasks were used for analysis. The alpha, beta, theta and gamma powers were computed using Welch power density estimation method. The magnitude of event related changes derived from these band powers were used to visualize the difference in functional connectivity between the groups. The results revealed a complete absence of alpha desynchronization (p<0.01), theta synchronization (p<0.01) and gamma synchronisation (p<0.05) in the depressed group for the difficult task. Since alpha desynchronisation is related to information capacity, theta synchronisation to information encoding and retrieval and gamma synchronisation to information transmission, it was concluded that there was a definite impairment of memory and cognitive processing in depression which was reflected in task performance and as compensatory and weak connectivities between the different lobes. The significance of this result was highlighted by SASI values (p<0.001) which were positive in the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe for the depressed group indicating a negative approach/withdrawal response to the requirements of the difficult task.

Major technological evolutions, such as neuronavigation and robotized systems, have continuously increased the spatial reliability and reproducibility of TMS, by minimizing the influence of human and experimental factors. However, there is still a lack of efficient set-up procedure, which prevents the automation of TMS protocols. For example, the set-up procedure for defining the stimulation intensity specific to each subject is classically done manually by experienced practitioners, by assessing the motor cortical excitability level over the motor hotspot (HS) of a targeted muscle. This is time-consuming and introduces experimental variability. Therefore, we developed a probabilistic Bayesian model (AutoHS) that automatically identifies the HS position. Using virtual and real experiments, we compared the efficacy of the manual and automated procedures. AutoHS appeared to be more reproducible, faster, and at least as reliable as classical manual procedures. By combining AutoHS with robotized TMS and automated motor threshold estimation methods, our approach constitutes the first fully automated set-up procedure for TMS protocols. The use of this procedure decreases inter-experimenter variability while facilitating the handling of TMS protocols used for research and clinical routine.

Consistent with this hypothesis, reaction times (RTs) and latencies of event-related potential have been shown to be moderately associated with intelligence. These associations have been explained either in terms of individual differences in some brain-wide property such as myelination, the speed of neural oscillations, or white-matter tract integrity, or in terms of individual differences in specific processes such as the signal-to-noise ratio in evidence accumulation, executive control, or the cholinergic system. Here we show in a sample of 122 participants, who completed a battery of RT tasks at 2 laboratory sessions while an EEG was recorded, that more intelligent individuals have a higher speed of higher-order information processing that explains about 80% of the variance in general intelligence. Our results do not support the notion that individuals with higher levels of general intelligence show advantages in some brain-wide property. Instead, they suggest that more intelligent individuals benefit from a more efficient transmission of information from frontal attention and working memory processes to temporal-parietal processes of memory storage.

Furthermore, in paradigms using a fixed period between warning and target stimuli, such alpha de-synchronization tends to increase and to peak just before target presentation. Previous studies from our group showed that the anticipatory alpha ERD can be modulated when magnetic stimulation is delivered over specific cortical regions during a variety of cognitive tasks. In this study we investigate the temporal dynamics of the anticipatory alpha ERD and test whether the magnetic stimulation produces either a general attenuation or an interruption of the typical development of alpha ERD. We report that, during a semantic decision task, rTMS over left AG, a region previously associated to semantic memory retrieval, shortened the peak latency and decreased the peak amplitude of the anticipatory alpha de-synchronization as compared to both active (left IPS) and non-active (Sham) TMS conditions. These results, while supporting the causal role of the left AG in the anticipation of a semantic decision task, suggest that magnetic interference not simply reduces the mean amplitude of anticipatory alpha ERD but also interrupts its typical temporal evolution in paradigms employing fixed cue-target intervals.

It has been suggested that these WM maintenance processes are controlled by areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) via frontotemporal phase synchronisation in low frequency bands. Here, we investigated whether enhanced cognitive control during audiovisual WM as compared to visual WM alone is associated with increased low-frequency phase synchronisation between sensory areas maintaining WM content and areas from PFC. Using magnetoencephalography, we recorded neural oscillatory activity from healthy human participants engaged in an audiovisual delayed-match-to-sample task. We observed that regions from MTL, which showed enhanced theta-beta phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) during the WM delay window, exhibited stronger phase synchronisation within the theta-band (4-7 Hz) to areas from lateral PFC during audiovisual WM as compared to visual WM alone. Moreover, MTL areas also showed enhanced phase synchronisation to temporooccipital areas in the beta-band (20-32 Hz). Our results provide further evidence that a combination of long-range phase synchronisation and local PAC might constitute a mechanism for neuronal communication between distant brain regions and across frequencies during WM maintenance.

Absence epilepsy is most often treated with ethosuximide or valproic acid. However, both drugs are not always well tolerated or fail, and seizure freedom for a larger proportion of patients remains to be achieved. The availability of genuine animal models of epilepsy does allow to search for new treatment options not only for absence epilepsy per se but also for other genetic - previously called idiopathic - forms of epilepsy. The recent discovery of a highly excitable cortical zone in these models is considered as a new therapeutic target area. Methods: Here, we provide an overview regarding the search for new therapeutical options as has been investigated in the genetic rodent models (mainly WAG/Rij and GAERS) including drugs and whether anti-epileptogenesis can be achieved, various types of electrical and optogenetical invasive stimulations, different types of non-invasive stimulation and finally whether absence seizures can be predicted and prevented. Results: Many factors determine either the cortical and or thalamic excitability or the interaction between cortex and thalamus and offer new possibilities for new anti-absence drugs, among others metabotropic glutamatergic positive and negative allosteric modulators. The inhibition of epileptogenesis by various drugs with its widespread consequences seems feasible, although its mechanisms remain obscure and seems different from the anti-absence action. Surgical intervention on the cortical zone initiating seizures, either with radiosurgery using synchrotron-generated microbeams, or ablation techniques might reduce spike-and-wave discharges in the rodent models. High frequency electrical subcortical or cortical stimulation might be a good way to abort ongoing spike-and-wave discharges. In addition, possibilities for prevention with real-time EEG analyses in combination with electrical stimulation could also be a way to fully control these seizures. Conclusion: Although it is obvious that some of these treatment possibilities will not be used for absence epilepsy and/or need to be further developed, all can be considered as proof of principle and provide clear directives for further developments.

Sleep has also been proposed to benefit episodic features of memory, i.e., a memory for an event (item) bound into the spatiotemporal context it has been experienced in (source). We aimed to explore if sleep enhances word pair memory in children by strengthening the episodic features of the memory, in particular. Sixty-one children (8-12 years) studied two lists of word pairs with 1 h in between. Retrieval testing comprised cued recall of the target word of each word pair (item memory) and recalling in which list the word pair had appeared in (source memory). Retrieval was tested either after 1 h (short retention interval) or after 11 h, with this long retention interval covering either nocturnal sleep or daytime wakefulness. Compared with the wake interval, sleep enhanced separate recall of both word pairs and the lists per se, while recall of the combination of the word pair and the list it had appeared in remained unaffected by sleep. An additional comparison with adult controls (n = 37) suggested that item-source bound memory (combined recall of word pair and list) is generally diminished in children. Our results argue against the view that the sleep-induced enhancement in paired-associate learning in children is a consequence of sleep specifically enhancing the episodic features of the memory representation. On the contrary, sleep in children might strengthen item and source representations in isolation, while leaving the episodic memory representations (item-source binding) unaffected.

Here, we describe how DC-coupled recordings can be performed using high-density iridium electrode arrays (silicone probes). We found that the DC voltage offset of the silicone probe is large and often exceeds the amplifier input range. Introduction of an offset compensation chain at the signal ground efficiently minimized the DC offsets. Silicone probe DC-coupled recordings across layers of the rat visual and barrel cortices revealed that epipial application of KCl, dura incision or pinprick TBI induced SD which preferentially propagated through the supragranular layers and further spread to the granular and infragranular layers attaining maximal amplitudes of similar to-30 mV in the infragranular layers. SD at the superficial cortical layers was nearly two-fold longer than at the deep cortical layers. Continuous epipial KCl evoked multiple recurrent SDs which always started in the supragranular layers but often failed to propagate through the deeper cortical layers. Intracortical KCl injection into the infragranular layers evoked SD which also started in the supragranular layers and spread to the granular and infragranular layers, further indicating that the supragranular layers are particularly prone to SD. Thus, DC-coupled recordings with silicone probes after offset compensation can be successfully used to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of SD and other slow brain activities.

Previous research indicates that when communication is successful, close temporal dependencies arise between adult speakers' and listeners' neural activity. However, it is not known whether similar neural contingencies exist within adult-infant dyads. Here, we used dual-electroencephalography to assess whether direct gaze increases neural coupling between adults and infants during screen-based and live interactions. In experiment 1 (n = 17), infants viewed videos of an adult who was singing nursery rhymes with (i) direct gaze (looking forward), (ii) indirect gaze (head and eyes averted by 20 degrees), or (iii) direct-oblique gaze (head averted but eyes orientated forward). In experiment 2 (n = 19), infants viewed the same adult in a live context, singing with direct or indirect gaze. Gaze-related changes in adult-infant neural network connectivity were measured using partial directed coherence. Across both experiments, the adult had a significant (Granger) causal influence on infants' neural activity, which was stronger during direct and direct-oblique gaze relative to indirect gaze. During live interactions, infants also influenced the adult more during direct than indirect gaze. Further, infants vocalized more frequently during live direct gaze, and individual infants who vocalized longer also elicited stronger synchronization from the adult. These results demonstrate that direct gaze strengthens bidirectional adult-infant neural connectivity during communication. Thus, ostensive social signals could act to bring brains into mutual temporal alignment, creating a jointnetworked state that is structured to facilitate information transfer during early communication and learning.

However, converging evidence implicates the reciprocal interaction between midline limbic regions (typified by the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, vACC) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), reflecting interactions between emotions and cognition. Furthermore, growing evidence suggests a role for abnormal glutamate metabolism in the vACC, while serotonergic treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI) effective for many patients implicate the serotonin system. Currently, no mechanistic framework describes how network dynamics, glutamate, and serotonin interact to explain MDD symptoms and treatments. Here, we built a biophysical computational model of 2 areas (vACC and dlPFC) that can switch between emotional and cognitive processing. MDD networks were simulated by slowing glutamate decay in vACC and demonstrated sustained vACC activation. This hyperactivity was not suppressed by concurrent dlPFC activation and interfered with expected dlPFC responses to cognitive signals, mimicking cognitive dysfunction seen in MDD. Simulation of clinical treatments (SSRI or deep brain stimulation) counteracted this aberrant vACC activity. Theta and beta/gamma oscillations correlated with network function, representing markers of switch-like operation in the network. The model shows how glutamate dysregulation can cause aberrant brain dynamics, respond to treatments, and be reflected in EEG rhythms as biomarkers of MDD.

Vestibular contributions to high-level sensorimotor functions	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th Anniversary Meeting of Concepts, Action and Objects (CAOs)	MAY 05-08, 2016	Ctr Mind Brain Sci, Rovereto, ITALY		Ctr Mind Brain Sci	Vestibular cognition; Optimal control; Bayesian; Decision making; Visual stability; Motor learning	SIGNAL-DEPENDENT NOISE; INTERNAL-MODELS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; REFERENCE FRAMES; CUE INTEGRATION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CONTROL; VISUAL SPACE; MOTION	The vestibular system, which detects motion and orientation of the head in space, is known to be important in controlling gaze to stabilize vision, to ensure postural stability and to provide our sense of self-motion. While the brain's computations underlying these functions are extensively studied, the role of the vestibular system in higher level sensorimotor functions is less clear. This review covers new research on the vestibular influence on perceptual judgments, motor decisions, and the ability to learn multiple motor actions. Guided by concepts such as optimization, inference, estimation and control, we focus on how the brain determines causal relationships between memorized and visual representations in the updating of visual space, and how vestibular, visual and efferent motor information are integrated in the estimation of body motion. We also discuss evidence that these computations involve multiple coordinate representations, some of which can be probed in parietal cortex using neuronal oscillations derived from EEG. In addition, we describe work on decision making during self-motion, showing a clear modulation of bottom-up acceleration signals on decisions in the saccadic system. Finally, we consider the importance of vestibular signals as contextual cues in motor learning and recall. Taken together, these results emphasize the impact of vestibular information on high-level sensorimotor functions, and identify future directions for theoretical, behavioral, and neurophysiological investigations.

This study examines the value of using non-task stimulation-induced EEG oscillations to predict cognitive status in a birth cohort of healthy Danish males (Metropolit) with varying cognitive ability. In particular, we examine the steady-state VEP power response (SSVEP-PR) in the alpha (8Hz) and gamma (36Hz) bands in 54 males (avg. age: 62.0 years) and compare these with 10 young healthy participants (avg. age 27.6 years). Furthermore, we correlate the individual alpha-to-gamma difference in relative visual-area power (Delta R-V) with cognitive scores for the older adults. We find that Delta R-V decrease with age by just over one standard deviation when comparing young with old participants (p<0.01). Furthermore, intelligence is significantly negatively correlated with Delta R-V in the older adult cohort, even when processing speed, global cognition, executive function, memory, and education (p<0.05). In our preferred specification, an increase in Delta R-V of one standard deviation is associated with a reduction in intelligence of 48% of a standard deviation (p<0.01). Finally, we conclude that the difference in cerebral rhythmic activity between the alpha and gamma bands is associated with age and cognitive status, and that Delta R-V therefore provide a non-subjective clinical tool with which to examine cognitive status in old age.

This study evaluated functional connectivity (FC) in relevant brain regions. Synergistic mechanisms in different brain regions were detected by a novel simulator, which combined semi-immersive virtual reality technology and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Each subject was instructed to complete driving tasks coupled with a mental calculation task. Wavelet coherence (WCO) and wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) were calculated and assessed in frequency intervals (I) 0.6-2 and (II) 0.145-0.6 Hz as global connectivity measures; (III) 0.052-0.145, (IV) 0.021-0.052, (V) 0.0095-0.021 and (VI) 0.005-0.0095 Hz as FC. WCO and WPCO revealed the strength and synchronization of cerebral connectivity, respectively. Significantly low WCO levels were found in intervals I and III in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and IV in motor cortex (MC) at the end of the driving task. Furthermore, significantly low WPCO were found in intervals I, and III in PFC and interval IV in MC. Experimental findings suggested that progressive mental fatigue adversely influences the cognitive function in the PFC and the cooperative mechanism between the PFC and MC. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, clinical results have been variable, in part because of the paucity of functional information that might help guide selection of the optimal surgical target. In this study, we use simultaneous magnetoencephalography and local field recordings from the PPNR in seven PD patients, to characterize functional connectivity with distant brain areas at rest. The PPNR was preferentially coupled to brainstem and cingulate regions in the alpha frequency (8-12 Hz) band and to the medial motor strip and neighboring areas in the beta (18-33 Hz) band. The distribution of coupling also depended on the vertical distance of the electrode from the pontomesencephalic line: most effects being greatest in the middle PPNR, which may correspond to the caudal pars dissipata of the pedunculopontine nucleus. These observations confirm the crucial position of the PPNR as a functional node between cortical areas such as the cingulate/medial motor strip and other brainstem nuclei, particularly in the dorsal pons. In particular they suggest a special role for the middle PPNR as this has the greatest functional connectivity with other brain regions.

Studies of metacognition typically probe post-decision judgments of confidence, showing that we can report on the success of wide range of cognitive processes. Much less is known about our ability to monitor and report on the degree of top-down attention, an ability of paramount importance in tasks requiring sustained attention. However, it has been repeatedly shown that the degree and locus of top-down attention modulates alpha (8-14 Hz) power in sensory cortices. In this study we investigated whether self-reported ratings of attention are reflected by sensory alpha power, independent from confidence and task difficulty. Subjects performed a stair cased tactile discrimination task requiring sustained somatosensory attention. Each discrimination response was followed by a rating of their attention at the moment of stimulation, or their confidence in the discrimination response. MEG was used to estimate trial-by-trial alpha power preceding stimulation. Staircasing of task-difficulty successfully equalized performance between conditions. Both attention and confidence ratings reflected subsequent discrimination performance. Task difficulty specifically influenced confidence ratings. As expected, specifically attention ratings, but not confidence ratings, correlated negatively with contralateral somatosensory alpha power preceding tactile stimuli. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the degree of attention can be subjectively experienced and reported accurately, independent from task difficulty and knowledge about task performance.

The purposes of this pilot study were to assess and to compare immediate behavioral auditory working memory and electrophysiologic effects of three different, randomized, conditions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to four neurotypical adults and four adults with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI). Materials/methods: Pre- and post-anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS auditory memory performance, auditory event-related potentials (P300 amplitude and latency) and power of alpha and theta EEG bands were measured across individuals in each group. Results: Post-anodal tDCS only, the neurotypical and TBI groups both demonstrated significantly improved immediate auditory memory function. Also post-anodal tDCS, the TBI group demonstrated significantly increased P300 amplitude versus post-sham tDCS. The neurotypical group demonstrated no pre- post-tDCS electrophysiologic changes across conditions. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with findings of other studies of immediate tDCS effects on other types of memory in neurotypical individuals and in individuals with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and stroke and suggest that individuals with memory impairments second to chronic TBI may benefit from LDLPFC anodal tDCS. Pairing tDCS with traditional behavioral memory interventions may facilitate TBI rehabilitation outcomes and warrants continued investigation.

Although diverse patterns of frequency in improving memory performance have been studied, beta up-training and low alpha/high alpha ratio suppression have not yet been studied. Objective: The present study aimed at examining the effect of 2 neurofeedback protocols "beta up-training" and "low alpha/high alpha ratio suppression" on memory performance. Methods: Thirty healthy participants, aged 20 to 40 years took part in this double-blind study. Participants performed ten 30-minute sessions of neurofeedback training. They were randomly assigned into 3 groups: (A) beta up-training and theta down-training, (B) low alpha/high alpha ratio suppression training, and (C) sham training. The Wechsler memory scale (WMS-R) was performed before and after the training period to examine memory performance. Data were analyzed using ANCOVA to compare memory performance changes among the 3 study groups. Results: No significant differences were obtained among the participants in age, gender, marital status, and psychological condition. Treatment groups (including beta up-training and theta down-training and low alpha/high alpha ratio suppression training) showed superior improvement in memory performance compared with the sham group. Conclusions: Neurofeedback training can improve memory performance. Future studies should address the specificity of the neurofeedback training effects, taking into account various populations of patients with cognitive impairment.

Disconnection from others in autism is more than just a feeling: whole-brain neural synchrony in adults during implicit processing of emotional faces	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Autism; Functional connectivity; Magnetoencephalography; Social brain; Emotional faces; Young adults	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; AMYGDALA RESPONSES; SOCIAL INFORMATION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; ASYMMETRY	Background: Socio-emotional difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to reflect impaired functional connectivity within the "social brain". Nonetheless, a whole-brain characterization of the fast responses in functional connectivity during implicit processing of emotional faces in adults with ASD is lacking. Methods: The present study used magnetoencephalography to investigate early responses in functional connectivity, as measured by interregional phase synchronization, during implicit processing of angry, neutral and happy faces. The sample (n = 44) consisted of 22 young adults with ASD and 22 age-and sex-matched typically developed (TD) controls. Results: Reduced phase-synchrony in the beta band around 300 ms emerged during processing of angry faces in the ASD compared to TD group, involving key areas of the social brain. In the same time window, de-synchronization in the beta band in the amygdala was reduced in the ASD group across conditions. Conclusions: This is the first demonstration of atypical global and local synchrony patterns in the social brain in adults with ASD during implicit processing of emotional faces. The present results replicate and substantially extend previous findings on adolescents, highlighting that atypical brain synchrony during processing of socio-emotional stimuli is a hallmark of clinical sequelae in autism.

Neurofeedback (NF) is an adjuvant or alternative therapy for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This study intended to compare the efficacy of two different NF protocols on clinical and cognitive symptoms of ADHD. Materials and Methods. In this clinical trial, sixty children with ADHD aged 7 to 10 years old were randomly grouped to receive two different NF treatments (theta suppression/beta enhancement protocol and theta suppression/alpha enhancement protocol). Clinical and cognitive assessments were conducted prior to and following the treatment and also after an eight-week follow-up. Results. Both protocols alleviated the symptoms ofADHDin general (p < 0.001), hyperactivity (p < 0.001), inattention (p < 0.001), and omission errors (p < 0.001); however, they did not affect the oppositional and impulsive scales nor commission errors. These effects were maintained after an eight-week intervention-free period. The only significant difference between the two NF protocols was that high-frequency alpha enhancement protocol performed better in suppressing omission errors (p < 0.001). Conclusion. The two NF protocols with theta suppression/beta enhancement and theta suppression/alpha enhancement have considerable and comparable effect on clinical symptoms of ADHD. Alpha enhancement protocol was more effective in suppressing omission errors.

CS-specific modifications of auditory evoked potentials in the behaviorally conditioned rat	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Associative learning; Heart rate; Evoked potential; Plasticity; Primary auditory cortex; Synchronization	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SPECTRAL INTEGRATION; 3-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY; NUCLEUS BASALIS; SENSORY CORTEX; EEG ACTIVITY; HEART-RATE	The current report provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the first two components of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) that accompany associative learning. AEPs were recorded from the primary auditory cortex before and after training sessions. Experimental subjects underwent one (n = 5) or two (n = 7) days of conditioning in which a tone, serving as a conditioned stimulus (CS), was paired with mild foot shock. Control subjects received one (n = 5) or two (n = 7) days of exposure to the same stimuli delivered randomly. Only animals receiving paired CS-US training developed a conditioned tachycardia response to the tone. Our analyses demonstrated that both early components of the AEP recorded from the granular layer of the cortex undergo CS-specific associative changes: (1) the first, negative component (occurring similar to 21 ms following tone onset) was significantly augmented after one and two days of training while maintaining its latency, and (2) the second, positive component (occurring 50 ms following tone onset) was augmented after two days of training, and showed a significant reduction in latency after one and two days of training. We view these changes as evidence of increased cortical synchronization, thereby lending new insight into the temporal dynamics of neural network activity related to auditory learning.

The study of response inhibition provides insights into reduced action disposition in blood phobia. Twenty individuals with and 20 without blood phobia completed an emotional go/no-go task including phobia-related pictures, as well as phobia-unrelated unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant stimuli. Behavioral results did not indicate a phobia-specific reduced action disposition in the phobic group. Time-frequency decomposition of eventrelated EEG data showed a reduction of right prefrontal activity, as indexed by an increase in alpha power (200 ms), for no-go mutilation trials in the phobic group but not in controls. Moreover, theta power (300 ms) increased specifically for phobiarelated pictures in individuals with, but not without, blood phobia, irrespective of go or no-go trial types. Passive avoidance of phobia-related stimuli subtended by the increased alpha in the right prefrontal cortex, associated with increased emotional salience indexed by theta synchronization, represents a possible neurophysiological correlate of the conflicting motivational response in blood phobia. Through the novel use of time-frequency decomposition in an emotional go/no-go task, the present study contributed to clarifying the neurophysiological correlates of the overlapping motivational tendencies in blood phobia.

Hitherto studies on AD-associated neurovascular injury have used animal models that exhibit only a subset of AD-like pathologies and demonstrated some A beta-dependent vascular dysfunction and destabilization of neuronal network. The present work focuses on the early stage of disease progression and uses TgF344-AD rats that recapitulate a broader repertoire of AD-like pathologies to investigate the cerebrovascular and neuronal network functioning using in situ two-photon fluorescence microscopy and laminar array recordings of local field potentials, followed by pathological analyses of vascular wall morphology, tau hyperphosphorylation, and amyloid plaques. Concomitant to widespread amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, cerebrovascular reactivity was strongly attenuated in cortical penetrating arterioles and venules of TgF344-AD rats in comparison to those in non-transgenic littermates. Blood flow elevation to hypercapnia was abolished in TgF344-AD rats. Concomitantly, the phase-amplitude coupling of the neuronal network was impaired, evidenced by decreased modulation of theta band phase on gamma band amplitude. These results demonstrate significant neurovascular network dysfunction at an early stage of AD-like pathology. Our study identifies early markers of pathology progression and call for development of combinatorial treatment plans.

J	Kranczioch, C				Kranczioch, Cornelia			Individual differences in dual-target RSVP task performance relate to entrainment but not to individual alpha frequency	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SERIAL VISUAL PRESENTATION; ATTENTIONAL BLINK; TEMPORAL ATTENTION; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; DYNAMICS; IDENTIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	The attentional blink (AB) paradigm is widely used to study visual temporal attention. An important feature of the standard AB paradigm is repetitive visual stimulation, more precisely the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of numerous distracters interspersed with two targets. The RSVP stream is likely to result in entrainment of visual cortex, which has been suggested to negatively affect target identification in the AB paradigm. The present EEG study tested this idea with an inter-individual differences approach. AB task performance and measures of entrainment were derived from 51 participants. Other than predicted, moderate positive correlations were observed for inter-trial coherence and performance, but only for targets not immediately preceded by other targets. A positive correlation with power was evident for targets presented in the critical AB time window. In a second step, it was tested whether the distance between individual alpha frequency and RSVP frequency mediated correlations with inter-trial coherence, as entrainment of the visual cortex through repetitive visual stimulation is particularly effective when the frequency of the stimulation matches the individual alpha frequency. However, no evidence was found supporting such link. While compatible with a number of findings related to the AB and to visual entrainment, the findings of the present study do not provide evidence for the notion that entrainment to the RSVP stream creates a neural environment unfavourable for detecting targets an RSVP stream.

Neuromodulation approaches, capable of shaping information processing, may highlight residual network activities supporting awareness, which are not detectable through active paradigms, thus allowing to differentiate chronic disorders of consciousness (DoC). We studied aftereffects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) by applying graph theory within canonical frequency bands to compare the markers of these networks in the electroencephalographic data from 20 patients with DoC. We found that patients' high-frequency networks suffered from a large-scale connectivity breakdown, paralleled by a local hyperconnectivity, whereas low-frequency networks showed a preserved but dysfunctional large-scale connectivity. There was a correlation between metrics and the behavioral awareness. Interestingly, two persons with UWS showed a residual rTMS-induced modulation of the functional correlations between the DMN and the EAN, as observed in patients with MCS. Hence, we may hypothesize that the patients with UWS who demonstrate evidence of residual DMN EAN functional correlation may be misdiagnosed, given that such residual network correlations could support covert consciousness.

Around 20-30% retain the full syndrome as young adults, and about 50% show partial, rather than complete, remission. Here, to delineate the neurobiology of this variable outcome, we ask if the persistence of childhood symptoms into adulthood impacts on the brain's functional connectivity. We studied 205 participants followed clinically since childhood. In early adulthood, participants underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure neuronal activity directly and functional MRI (fMRI) to measure hemodynamic activity during a task-free period (the "resting state"). We found that symptoms of inattention persisting into adulthood were associated with disrupted patterns of typical functional connectivity in both MEG and fMRI. Specifically, those with persistent inattention lost the typical balance of connections within the default mode network (DMN; prominent during introspective thought) and connections between this network and those supporting attention and cognitive control. By contrast, adults whose childhood inattentive symptoms had resolved did not differ significantly from their never-affected peers, both hemodynamically and electrophysiologically. The anomalies in functional connectivity tied to clinically significant inattention centered on midline regions of the DMN in both MEG and fMRI, boosting confidence in a possible pathophysiological role. The findings suggest that the clinical course of this common childhood onset disorder impacts the functional connectivity of the adult brain.

Disturbance of oscillatory brain rhythms and decreased synchronization have been associated with different disorders including schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether synchronization (in relaxed conditions with no stimuli) between different brain areas within the delta, theta, alpha (alphal, alpha2), beta (betal, beta2), and gamma bands is altered in patients with a neurological disorder in order to generate significant cortical enhancements. To achieve this, we investigated schizophrenic patients (SZO; N=17, 37.5 +/- 10.4 years, 15 males) and compared them to healthy subjects (CON; N=21, 36.7 +/- 13.4 years, 15 males) applying the phase locking value (PLV). We found significant differences between SZO and CON in different brain areas of the theta, alphal, beta2 and gamma bands. These areas are related to the central and parietal lobes for the theta band, the parietal lobe for the alphal, the parietal and frontal for the beta2 and the frontal-central for the gamma band. The gamma band revealed the most significant differences between CON and SZO. PLV were 61.7% higher on average in SZO in most of the clusters when compared to CON. The related brain areas are directly related to cognition skills which are proved to be impaired in SZO. The results of this study suggest that synchronization in SZO is also altered when the patients were not asked to perform a task that requires their cognitive skills (i.e., no stimuli are applied - in contrast to other findings).

Seeing in the dark: Phosphene thresholds with eyes open versus closed in the absence of visual inputs	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Phosphene; Threshold; Alpha; Oscillations; Excitability; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERNS; RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA-BAND; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; ENHANCED EXCITABILITY; CORTEX EXCITABILITY; LIGHT DEPRIVATION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX	Background: Voluntarily opening or closing our eyes results in fundamentally different input patterns and expectancies. Yet it remains unclear how our brains and visual systems adapt to these ocular states. Objective/Hypothesis: We here used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the excitability of the human visual system with eyes open or closed, in the complete absence of visual inputs. Methods: Combining Bayesian staircase procedures with computer control of TMS pulse intensity allowed interleaved determination of phosphene thresholds (PT) in both conditions. We measured parieto-occipital EEG baseline activity in several stages to track oscillatory power in the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency-band, which has previously been shown to be inversely related to phosphene perception. Results: Since closing the eyes generally increases alpha power, one might have expected a decrease in excitability (higher PT). While we confirmed a rise in alpha power with eyes closed, visual excitability was actually increased (PT was lower) with eyes closed. Conclusions: This suggests that, aside from oscillatory alpha power, additional neuronal mechanisms influence the excitability of early visual cortex. One of these may involve a more internally oriented mode of brain operation, engaged by closing the eyes. In this state, visual cortex may be more susceptible to top-down inputs, to facilitate for example multisensory integration or imagery/working memory, although alternative explanations remain possible.

Methods: We computed the PLV between the phase of the amplitude of high gamma activity (80-150 Hz) and the phase of lower frequency rhythms (4-30 Hz) from ECoG recordings obtained from 10 patients with epilepsy (21 seizures). We extracted five features from the PLV and used a machine learning approach based on logistic regression to build a model that classifies electrodes as SOZ or non-SOZ. Results: More than 96% of electrodes identified as the SOZ by our algorithm were within the resected area in six seizure-free patients. In four non-seizure-free patients, more than 31% of the identified SOZ electrodes by our algorithm were outside the resected area. In addition, we observed that the seizure outcome in non-seizure-free patients correlated with the number of non-resected SOZ electrodes identified by our algorithm. Conclusion: This machine learning approach, based on features extracted from the PLV, effectively identified electrodes within the SOZ. The approach has the potential to assist clinicians in surgical decision-making when pre-surgical intracranial recordings are utilized. (C) 2017 British Epilepsy Association.

Available evidence suggests that the synchronization of oscillatory activity across brains may provide a mechanism for the temporal alignment of actions between two or more individuals. In an attempt to provide a direct test of this hypothesis, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation simultaneously to two individuals (hyper-tACS) who were asked to drum in synchrony at a set pace. Thirty-eight female-female dyads performed the dyadic drumming in the course of 3 weeks under three different hyper-tACS stimulation conditions: same-phase-samefrequency; different-phase-different-frequency; sham. Based on available evidence and theoretical considerations, stimulation was applied over right frontal and parietal sites in the theta frequency range. We predicted that same-phase-same-frequency stimulation would improve interpersonal action coordination, expressed as the degree of synchrony in dyadic drumming, relative to the other two conditions. Contrary to expectations, both the same-phase-same-frequency and the different-phase-differentfrequency conditions were associated with greater dyadic drumming asynchrony relative to the sham condition. No influence of hyper-tACS on behavioral performance was seen when participants were asked to drum separately in synchrony to a metronome. Individual and dyad preferred drumming tempo was also unaffected by hyper-tACS. We discuss limitations of the present version of the hyper-tACS paradigm, and suggest avenues for future research.

Furthermore, that desynchronization was greater during action execution than during its observation. In the present exploratory study, we reanalyzed those ECoG data to evaluate the proof-of-concept that lagged linear connectivity (LLC) between primary somatosensory-motor, lateral premotor and ventral prefrontal areas would be enhanced during the action execution compared to the mere observation due to a greater flow of visual and somatomotor information. Results showed that the delta-theta (<8 Hz) LLC between lateral premotor and ventral prefrontal areas was higher during action execution than during action observation. Furthermore, the phase of these delta-theta rhythms entrained the local event-related connectivity of alpha and beta rhythms. It was speculated the existence of a multi-oscillatory functional network between high-order frontal motor areas which should be more involved during the actual reaching-grasping of objects compared to its mere observation. Future studies in a larger population should cross-validate these preliminary results.

MEG data from 13 untreated CAE patients and 10 healthy controls were recorded. Correlation analysis and Granger causality analysis were used to construct an EC network at the source level in eight frequency bands. Alterations in the spatial pattern and topology of the network in CAE were investigated by comparing the patients with the controls. The network pattern was altered mainly in 1-4 Hz, showing strong connections within the frontal cortex and weak connections in the anterior-posterior pathways. The EC involving the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PC/PCC) significantly decreased in low-frequency bands. In addition, the parameters of graph theory were significantly altered in several low- and high-frequency bands. CAE patients display frequency-specific abnormalities in the network pattern even during the inter-ictal period, and the frontal cortex and PC/PCC might play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of CAE. The EC network of CAE patients was over-connective and random during the inter-ictal period. This study is the first to reveal the frequency-specific alteration in the EC network during the inter-ictal period in CAE patients. Multiple-frequency MEG data are useful in investigating the pathophysiology of CAE, which can serve as new biomarkers of this disorder.

Biomedical, translational and clinical research on PDT of TMJ"	MECHANISMS OF PHOTOBIOMODULATION THERAPY XII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Mechanisms of Photobiomodulation Therapy XII	JAN 28, 2017	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		Laser acupuncture; laser TMJ treatment; TENS; SDT; PDT TMJ treatment	TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDERS; ACUPUNCTURE; PAIN	Introduction Electromagnetic energy of laser light has some typical properties which are found to be a premise for discussions on laser irradiation abilities to control the severe and chronic disorders in TMJ. In world literature PDT application is recommended when soft tissues in TMJ are damaged, in cases of degenerative diseases of discus articularis, medial and lateral distensions of joint ligaments, chronic inflammatory processes in TMJ, occlusion trauma, etc. The aim of our clinical study was to analyze the theoretical achievements up to now in depth and basing on our clinical observations suggest new methods guaranteeing high therapeutic efficacy of Photodynamic therapy. Material and methods During the last six years we have been completed well controlled clinical trials based on the criteria of the American Academy of orofacial pain. The study over the 600 patients (300 women and 300 men), mean age of 47 years was developed. Patients have been selected on the main clinical sign of TMJ pain and were divided into four main groups according to the type of PDT method. Based on the action spectra, various wavelengths have been used for TMJ Photodynamic Therapy. Constant dose and time of exposition, as well as various range of frequencies have been applied. In this way the Laser biostimulation response has been directly proportional to the total energy dose, depending of light intensity. Physiological and clinical effects of the followed "active regions"- 660 - 680, 760 - 780, 810 - 830 and 904 987 nm have been valued by method of comparative analysis. We applied the method of building models of clinical situations and then classified them into categories. Methods applied: LLLT - TENS - red surface laser acupuncture (LA), PIPBM - LA, Laser bioenergetics approach, Complex therapeutic program (CTP). Results evaluation will be demonstrated by comparative digital ortopantomograph analysis, EEG brain maps, VAS, a metric analysis of the level of the maximum active Mdndible opening and EPST through electrophysiological signal evaluation of the patient's body. Results and conclusion Laser-assisting treatment of TMJ disorders has a high degree of therapeutic efficacy and can be applied widely in daily dental practice. The approbated four methods of LT enable to achieve the following therapeutic effects: rapid affection of pain syndrome (neurogenic pain, fibromyalgia, trigeminal and migraine pain, myofascial pain syndrome, neck and low back pains), provoked by functional TMJ disorders and treatment of degenerative diseases of discus articularis, medial and lateral extensions of joint ligaments, of acute and chronic inflammatory processes in TMJ, occlusion trauma, electrogalvanic phenomenon and psychosomatic disorders, achieving a favourable lymphatic drainage, vasodilatative effect,	[Kamenoff, J.] Med Univ, Fac Med Dent, Dept Prosthodont, Sofia, Bulgaria		Kamenoff, J (corresponding author), Fac Dent Med, 1-3 Georgi Sofiiski Blv,Pr Off 810,Fl 8, Sofia 1440, Bulgaria.								27	0	0	0	6	SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING	BELLINGHAM	1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0537-4; 978-1-5106-0538-1	PROC SPIE			2017	10048								1004809	10.1117/12.2256070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2256070			12	Biophysics; Optics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Biophysics; Optics	BI1WW					2022-08-02	WOS:000407023900004

Endophenotype research is being oversold for its potential to help discover psychopathology relevant genes using the types of small samples feasible for electrophysiological research. This is largely because the genetic architecture of endophenotypes appears to be very much like that of behavioral traits and disorders: they are complex, influenced by many variants (e.g., tens of thousands) within many genes, each contributing a very small effect. Out of over 40 electrophysiological endophenotypes covered by our review, only resting heart, a measure that has received scant advocacy as an endophenotype, emerges as an electrophysiological variable with verified associations with molecular genetic variants. To move the field forward, investigations designed to discover novel variants associated with endophenotypes will need extremely large samples best obtained by forming consortia and sharing data obtained from genome wide arrays. In addition, endophenotype research can benefit from successful molecular genetic studies of psychopathology by examining the degree to which these verified psychopathology-relevant variants are also associated with an endophenotype, and by using knowledge about the functional significance of these variants to generate new endophenotypes. Even without molecular genetic associations, endophenotypes still have value in studying the development of disorders in unaffected individuals at high genetic risk, constructing animal models, and gaining insight into neural mechanisms that are relevant to clinical disorder.

Continued technologic advancements in implantable neurostimulators have spurred considerable research efforts directed towards the development of novel antiepileptic stimulation therapies. However, the lack of adequate preclinical experimental platforms has precluded a detailed understanding of the differential effects of stimulation parameters on neuronal activity within seizure networks. In order to chronically monitor seizures and the effects of stimulation in a freely-behaving non-human primate with idiopathic epilepsy, we employed a novel simultaneous video-intracranial EEG recording platform using a state-of-the-art sensing-enabled, rechargeable clinical neurostimulator with real-time seizure detection and wireless data streaming capabilities. Using this platform, we were able to characterize the electrographic and semiologic features of the focal-onset, secondarily generalizing tonic-clonic seizures stably expressed in this animal. A series of acute experiments exploring low-frequency (2 Hz) hippocampal stimulation identified a pulse width (150 ps) and current amplitude (4 mA) combination which maximally suppressed local hippocampal activity. These optimized stimulation parameters were then delivered to the seizure onset-side hippocampus in a series of chronic experiments. This long-term testing revealed that the suppressive effects of low-frequency hippocampal stimulation 1) diminish when delivered continuously but are maintained when stimulation is cycled on and off, 2) are dependent on circadian rhythms, and 3) do not necessarily confer seizure protective effects.

However, the principles governing interareal functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) remain elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that human executive functions arise from the dynamic interplay of multiple networks. To do so, we investigated FCD mediating a key executing function, known as arbitrary visuomotor mapping, using brain connectivity analyses of high-gamma activity recorded using MEG and intracranial EEG. Visuomotor mapping was found to arise from the dynamic interplay of three partly overlapping cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical functional connectivity (FC) networks. First, visual and parietal regions coordinated with sensorimotor and premotor areas. Second, the dorsal frontoparietal circuit together with the sensorimotor and associative frontostriatal networks took the lead. Finally, cortico-cortical interhemispheric coordination among bilateral sensorimotor regions coupled with the left frontoparietal network and visual areas. We suggest that these networks reflect the processing of visual information, the emergence of visuomotor plans, and the processing of somatosensory reafference or action's outcomes, respectively. We thus demonstrated that visuomotor integration resides in the dynamic reconfiguration of multiple cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical FC networks. More generally, we showed that visuomotor-related FC is nonstationary and displays switching dynamics and areal flexibility over timescales relevant for task performance. In addition, visuomotor-related FC is characterized by sparse connectivity with density <10%. To conclude, our results elucidate the relation between dynamic network reconfiguration and executive functions over short timescales and provide a candidate entry point toward a better understanding of cognitive architectures.

Recently, memory consolidation has been causally facilitated in human participants via auditory stimuli phase-locked to SWS slow waves. Aims: Here, we aimed to develop a new acoustic stimulus protocol to facilitate learning and to validate it using different memory tasks. Most importantly, the stimulation setup was automated to be applicable for ambulatory home use. Methods: Fifteen healthy participants slept 3 nights in the laboratory. Learning was tested with 4 memory tasks (word pairs, serial finger tapping, picture recognition, and face-name association). Additional questionnaires addressed subjective sleep quality and overnight changes in mood. During the stimulus night, auditory stimuli were adjusted and targeted by an unsupervised algorithm to be phase-locked to the negative peak of slow waves in SWS. During the control night no sounds were presented. Results: Results showed that the sound stimulation increased both slow wave (p =.002) and sleep spindle activity (p <.001). When overnight improvement of memory performance was compared between stimulus and control nights, we found a significant effect in word pair task but not in other memory tasks. The stimulation did not affect sleep structure or subjective sleep quality. Conclusions: We showed that the memory effect of the SWS-targeted individually triggered single-sound stimulation is specific to verbal associative memory. Moreover, the ambulatory and automated sound stimulus setup was promising and allows for a broad range of potential follow-up studies in the future.

J	Janjarasjitt, S				Janjarasjitt, Suparerk			Epileptic seizure classifications of single-channel scalp EEG data using wavelet-based features and SVM	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Seizure; Support vector machine; Classification; Wavelet transform	ONSET; OSCILLATIONS	In this study, wavelet-based features of single-channel scalp EEGs recorded from subjects with intractable seizure are examined for epileptic seizure classification. The wavelet-based features extracted from scalp EEGs are simply based on detail and approximation coefficients obtained from the discrete wavelet transform. Support vector machine (SVM), one of the most commonly used classifiers, is applied to classify vectors of wavelet-based features of scalp EEGs into either seizure or non-seizure class. In patient-based epileptic seizure classification, a training data set used to train SVM classifiers is composed of wavelet-based features of scalp EEGs corresponding to the first epileptic seizure event. Overall, the excellent performance on patient-dependent epileptic seizure classification is obtained with the average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of, respectively, 0.9687, 0.7299, and 0.9813. The vector composed of two wavelet-based features of scalp EEGs provide the best performance on patient-dependent epileptic seizure classification in most cases, i.e., 19 cases out of 24. The wavelet-based features corresponding to the 32-64, 8-16, and 4-8 Hz subbands of scalp EEGs are the mostly used features providing the best performance on patient-dependent classification. Furthermore, the performance on both patient-dependent and patient-independent epileptic seizure classifications are also validated using tenfold cross-validation. From the patient-independent epileptic seizure classification validated using tenfold cross-validation, it is shown that the best classification performance is achieved using the wavelet-based features corresponding to the 64-128 and 4-8 Hz subbands of scalp EEGs.

EEG Analysis for Short Term Memory Modeling in Visually Explored Shape Recognition Tasks	2017 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 27-DEC 01, 2017	Honolulu, HI	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc		short term memory; iconic memory; Hebbian learning; back propagation neural network; shape recognition; average gamma power; memory failure	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; INHIBITION; ANATOMY; NETWORK; CORTEX	The paper introduces a novel approach to short term memory modeling using electroencephalographic signals acquired from occipital, prefrontal and parietal lobes of the subjects during the recognition of asymmetric two-dimensional object shapes. Each subject is presented with a two-dimensional object of irregular geometry and is asked to remember it for a short period until he/she is instructed to draw the two-dimensional shape of the object. After the drawing is complete, the reference two-dimensional shape and the one produced by the subject are compared. The paper attempts to model Short term memory using unsupervised Hebbian Learning, considering functional invariance of the other relevant brain modules lying on the encoding and recall pathways of the memory. An error norm is defined to measure the magnitude of the error between the input and reproduced shape pattern, and thereby is used to adapt the short term memory. A small value in error indicates proper learning of the proposed short term memory model, and thus can be used to discriminate people with memory failure. Experiments undertaken reveal that the error metric could be used successfully to detect memory failures in five patients, two of whom were in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, two of whom suffer from amnesia, and one patient with parietal lobe damage. The proposed short term memory model thus is expected to have applications in detecting memory failures in shape-recognition tasks.

Recently, a preferential loss of parvalbumin (PV) neurons has been observed in the subiculum of TLE patients and in animal models of TLE. To demonstrate a possible causative role of defunct PV neurons in the generation of TLE, we permanently inhibited GABA release selectively from PV neurons of the ventral subiculum by injecting a viral vector expressing tetanus toxin light chain in male mice. Subsequently, mice were subjected to telemetric EEG recording and video monitoring. Eighty-eight percent of the mice presented clusters of spike-wave discharges (C-SWDs; 40.0 +/- 9.07/month), and 64% showed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs; 5.3 +/- 0.83/month). Mice injected with a control vector presented with neitherC-SWDsnor SRSs. Noneurodegeneration was observed due to vector injection or SRS. Interestingly, mice that presented with only C-SWDs but no SRSs, developed SRSs upon injection of a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole after 6 weeks. The initial frequency of SRSs declined by similar to 30% after 5 weeks. In contrast to permanent silencing of PV neurons, transient inhibition of GABA release from PV neurons through the designer receptor hM4Di selectively expressed in PV-containing neurons transiently reduced the seizure threshold of the mice but induced neither acute nor recurrent seizures. Our data demonstrate a critical role for perisomatic inhibition mediated by PV-containing interneurons, suggesting that their sustained silencing could be causally involved in the development of TLE.

In this review we describe the historical, methodologic, and conceptual bases of this model in the analysis of electrophysiologic intracerebral recordings. In the context of epilepsy surgery, the determination of cerebral regions producing seizures (i.e., the "epileptogenic zone") is a crucial objective. In contrast with a traditional focal vision of focal drug-resistant epilepsies, the concept of epileptogenic networks has been progressively introduced as a model better able to describe the complexity of seizure dynamics and realistically describe the distribution of epileptogenic anomalies in the brain. The concept of epileptogenic networks is historically linked to the development of the stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) method and subsequent introduction of means of quantifying the recorded signals. Seizures, and preictal and interictal discharges produce clear patterns on SEEG. These patterns can be analyzed utilizing signal analysis methods that quantify high-frequency oscillations or changes in functional connectivity. Dramatic changes in SEEG brain connectivity can be described during seizure genesis and propagation within cortical and subcortical regions, associated with the production of different patterns of seizure semiology. The interictal state is characterized by networks generating abnormal activities (interictal spikes) and also by modified functional properties. The introduction of novel approaches to large-scale modeling of these networks offers new methods in the goal of better predicting the effects of epilepsy surgery. The epileptogenic network concept is a key factor in identifying the anatomic distribution of the epileptogenic process, which is particularly important in the context of epilepsy surgery.

Altered sensorimotor cortical oscillations in individuals with multiple sclerosis suggests a faulty internal model	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; lower extremity; beta frequency; PMBR	HUMAN MOTOR CIRCUIT; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN BRAIN; MOVEMENT; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTEX; FORCE; MODULATION; ACTIVATION	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease that results in a broad array of symptoms, including impaired motor performance. How such demyelination of fibers affects the inherent neurophysiological activity in motor circuits, however, remains largely unknown. Potentially, the movement errors associated with MS may be due to imperfections in the internal model used to make predictions of the motor output that will meet the task demands. Prior magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic brain imaging experiments have established that the beta (15-30 Hz) oscillatory activity in the sensorimotor cortices is related to the control of movement. Specifically, it has been suggested that the strength of the post-movement beta rebound may indicate the certainty of the internal model. In this study, we used MEG to evaluate the neural oscillatory activity in the sensorimotor cortices of individuals with MS and healthy individuals during a goal-directed isometric knee force task. Our results showed no difference between the individuals with MS and healthy individuals in the beta activity during the planning and execution stages of movement. However, we did find that individuals with MS exhibited a weaker post-movement beta rebound in the pre/postcentral gyri relative to healthy controls. Additionally, we found that the behavioral performance of individuals with MS was aberrant, and related to the strength of the post-movement beta rebound. These results suggest that the internal model may be faulty in individuals with MS. Hum Brain Mapp 38:4009-4018, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This is particularly true for continuous and complex stimuli such as speech, in which information is organized into hierarchically embedded structures. Recently, novel metrics for assessing the neural representation of continuous speech have been developed using noninvasive brain recordings that have thus far only been tested during wakefulness. Here we investigated, for the first time, the sleeping brain's capacity to process continuous speech at different hierarchical levels using a newly developed Concurrent Hierarchical Tracking (CHT) approach that allows monitoring the neural representation and processing-depth of continuous speech online. Speech sequences were compiled with syllables, words, phrases, and sentences occurring at fixed time intervals such that different linguistic levels correspond to distinct frequencies. This enabled us to distinguish their neural signatures in brain activity. We compared the neural tracking of intelligible versus unintelligible (scrambled and foreign) speech across states of wakefulness and sleep using high-density EEG in humans. Wefound that neural tracking of stimulus acoustics was comparable across wakefulness and sleep and similar across all conditions regardless of speech intelligibility. In contrast, neural tracking of higher-order linguistic constructs (words, phrases, and sentences) was only observed for intelligible speech during wakefulness and could not be detected at all during nonrapid eye movement or rapid eye movement sleep. These results suggest that, whereas low-level auditory processing is relatively preserved during sleep, higher-level hierarchical linguistic parsing is severely disrupted, thereby revealing the capacity and limits of language processing during sleep.

While it is known that effort is related to a complex interplay between bottom-up and top-down processes, the cognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to effortful listening remain unknown. Therefore, a reliable physiological measure to assess effort remains elusive. This study aimed to determine whether pupil dilation and alpha power change, two physiological measures suggested to index listening effort, assess similar processes. Listening effort was manipulated by parametrically varying spectral resolution (16- and 6-channel noise vocoding) and speech reception thresholds (SRT; 50% and 80%) while 19 young, normal-hearing adults performed a speech recognition task in noise. Results of off-line sentence scoring showed discrepancies between the target SRTs and the true performance obtained during the speech recognition task. For example, in the SRT80% condition, participants scored an average of 64.7%. Participants' true performance levels were therefore used for subsequent statistical modelling. Results showed that both measures appeared to be sensitive to changes in spectral resolution (channel vocoding), while pupil dilation only was also significantly related to their true performance levels (%) and task accuracy (i.e., whether the response was correctly or partially recalled). The two measures were not correlated, suggesting they each may reflect different cognitive processes involved in listening effort. This combination of findings contributes to a growing body of research aiming to develop an objective measure of listening effort.

Variability in neural excitability and plasticity induction in the human cortex: A brain stimulation study	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Theta burst stimulation; Motor evoked potential; Variability; Motor cortex	THETA-BURST-STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; SURFACE EMG; EEG; TMS; RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS	Background: The potential of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for both probing human neuroplasticity and the induction of functionally relevant neuroplastic change has received significant interest. However, at present the utility of NIBS is limited due to high response variability. One reason for this response variability is that NIBS targets a diffuse cortical population and the net outcome to stimulation depends on the relative levels of excitability in each population. There is evidence that the relative excitability of complex oligosynaptic circuits (late I-wave circuits) as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is useful in predicting NIBS response. Objective: Here we examined whether an additional marker of cortical excitability, MEP amplitude variability, could provide additional insights into response variability following application of the continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) NIBS protocol. Additionally we investigated whether I-wave recruitment was associated with MEP variability. Methods: Thirty-four healthy subjects (15 male, aged 18-35 years) participated in two experiments. Experiment 1 investigated baseline MEP variability and cTBS response. Experiment 2 determined if I-wave recruitment was associated with MEP variability. Results: Data show that both baseline MEP variability and late I-wave recruitment are associated with cTBS response, but were independent of each other; together, these variables predict 31% of the variability in cTBS response. Conclusions: This study provides insight into the physiological mechanisms underpinning NIBS plasticity responses and may facilitate development of more reliable NIBS protocols.

Methods: We analyzed 115 artifact-and spike-free 2-second epochs extracted from resting state EEG recordings before and after 5 weeks of physical exercise in eight patients with BECTS. The exact Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA) was used for source reconstruction. Weevaluated the cortical current source density (CSD) power across five different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Altered FC between 34 regions of interests (ROIs) was then examined using lagged phase synchronization (LPS) method. We further investigated the correlation between the altered FC measures and the changes in NP test scores. Results: We observed changes in CSD power following the exercise for all frequency bands and statistically significant increases in the right temporal region for the alpha band. There were a number of altered FC between the cortical ROIs in all frequency bands of interest. Furthermore, significant correlationswere observed between FC measures and NP test scores at theta and alpha bands. Conclusion: The increased localization power at alpha band may be an indication of the positive impact of exercise in patients with BECTS. Frequency band-specific alterations in FC among cortical regions were associated with themodulation of cognitive and NP functions. The significant correlation between FC and NP tests suggests that physical exercise may mitigate the severity of BECTS, thereby enhancing NP function. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the sleep microstructure has not yet been evaluated in these patients. We aimed to evaluate whether the sleep spindle (SS) density is altered in patients with NT1 compared to controls and patients with narcolepsy type 2 (NT2). Methods: All-night polysomnographic recordings from 28 NT1 patients, 19 NT2 patients, 20 controls (C) with narcolepsy-like symptoms, but with normal cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin levels and multiple sleep latency tests, and 18 healthy controls (HC) were included. Unspecified, slow, and fast SS were automatically detected, and SS densities were defined as number per minute and were computed across sleep stages and sleep cycles. The between-cycle trends of SS densities in N2 and NREM sleep were evaluated within and between groups. Results: Between-group comparisons in sleep stages revealed no significant differences in any type of SS. Within-group analyses of the SS trends revealed significant decreasing trends for NT1, HC, and C between first and last sleep cycle. Between-group analyses of SS trends between first and last sleep cycle revealed that NT2 differ from NT1 patients in the unspecified SS density in NREM sleep, and from HC in the slow SS density in N2 sleep. Conclusions: SS activity is preserved in NT1, suggesting that the ascending neurons to thalamic activation of SS are not significantly affected by the hypocretinergic system. NT2 patients show an abnormal pattern of SS distribution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Alpha-range visual and auditory stimulation reduces the perception of pain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; A-DELTA-FIBER; EEG-ALPHA; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; BINAURAL BEAT; MOTOR-CORTEX; C-FIBER; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; RESPONSES	Background: Alpha power is believed to have an inverse relationship with the perception of pain. Increasing alpha power through an external stimulus may, therefore, induce an analgesic effect. Here, we attempt to modulate the perception of a moderately painful acute laser stimulus by separately entraining three frequencies across the alpha band: 8, 10 and 12 Hz. Methods: Participants were exposed to either visual or auditory stimulation at three frequencies in the alpha-band range and a control frequency. We collected verbal pain ratings of laser stimuli from participants following 10 minutes of flashing LED goggle stimulation and 10 minutes of binaural beat stimulation across the alpha range. Alterations in sleepiness, anxiety and negative mood were recorded following each auditory or visual alpha-rhythm stimulation session. Results: A significant reduction in pain ratings was found after both the visual and the auditory stimulation across all three frequencies compared with the control condition. In the visual group, a significantly larger reduction was recorded following the 10-Hz stimulation than succeeding the 8-and 12-Hz conditions. Conclusions: This study suggests that a short presentation of auditory and visual stimuli, oscillating in the alpha range, have an analgesic effect on acute laser pain, with the largest effect following the 10-Hz visual stimulation. Pain reductions following stimulation in the alpha range are independent of sleepiness, anxiety, and negative moods. Significance: This study provides new behavioural evidence showing that visual and auditory entrainment of frequencies in the alpha-wave range can influence the perception of acute pain in humans.

To investigate whether the reduction may be linked to genetic risk of the illness, we analysed sleep spindle activity in healthy volunteers, patients with schizophrenia and first-degree relatives, who share an enriched set of schizophrenia susceptibility genes. We further investigated the correlation of spindle activity with cognitive function in first-degree relatives and whether spindle abnormalities affect both fast (12-15 Hz) and slow (9-12 Hz) sleep spindles. We investigated fast and slow sleep spindle activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep in a total of 47 subjects comprising 17 patients with schizophrenia, 13 healthy first-degree relatives and 17 healthy volunteers. Groups were balanced for age, gender, years of education and estimated verbal IQ. A subsample of relatives received additional testing for memory performance. Compared to healthy volunteers, fast spindle density was reduced in patients with schizophrenia and healthy first-degree relatives following a pattern consistent with an assumed genetic load for schizophrenia. The deficit in spindle density was specific to fast spindles and was associated with decreased memory performance. Our findings indicate familial occurrence of this phenotype and thus support the hypothesis that deficient spindle activity relates to genetic liability for schizophrenia. Furthermore, spindle reductions predict impaired cognitive function and are specific to fast spindles. This physiological marker should be further investigated as an intermediate phenotype of schizophrenia. It could also constitute a target for drug development, especially with regard to cognitive dysfunction.

Here, we investigated whether beat perception might have its roots in the earliest stages of auditory cortical processing. Local field potentials were recorded from 8 patients implanted with depth-electrodes in Heschl's gyrus and the planum temporale (55 recording sites in total), usually considered as human primary and secondary auditory cortices. Using a frequency-tagging approach, we show that both low-frequency (<30 Hz) and high-frequency (>30 Hz) neural activities in these structures faithfully track auditory rhythms through frequency-locking to the rhythm envelope. A selective gain in amplitude of the response frequency-locked to the beat frequency was observed for the low-frequency activities but not for the high-frequency activities, and was sharper in the planum temporale, especially for the more challenging syncopated rhythm. Hence, this gain process is not systematic in all activities produced in these areas and depends on the complexity of the rhythmic input. Moreover, this gain was disrupted when the rhythm was presented at fast speed, revealing low-pass response properties which could account for the propensity to perceive a beat only within the musical tempo range. Together, these observations show that, even though part of these neural transforms of rhythms could already take place in subcortical auditory processes, the earliest auditory cortical processes shape the neural representation of rhythmic inputs in favor of the emergence of a periodic beat.

Recent studies suggest that gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) levels are correlated with functional connectivity. To understand whether changes in GABA transmission alter functional connectivity, we modulated the GABAergic activity by a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline. Resting and evoked electrophysiology and BOLD signals were measured in isoflurane-anesthetized rats under infusion of low-dose bicuculline or vehicle individually. Both somatosensory BOLD activations and evoked potentials induced by forepaw stimulation were increased significantly under bicuculline compared to vehicle, indicating increased excitability. Gradually elevated resting BOLD correlation within and between the somatosensory and visual cortices, as well as between somatosensory and caudate putamen but not within subcortical areas were found with the infusion of bicuculline. Increased cerebral blood flow was observed throughout the cortical and subcortical areas where the receptor density is high, but it didn't correlate with BOLD connectivity except in the primary somatosensory cortex. Furthermore, resting EEG coherence in the alpha and beta bands exhibited consistent change with the BOLD correlation. The increased cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal connectivity without dependence on the receptor distribution indicate that the functional connectivity may be mediated by long-range projection via the cortical and striatal GABAergic inter-neurons. Our results indicate an important role of the GABAergic system on neural and hemodynamic oscillations, which further supports the neuronal basis of functional connectivity MRI and its correlation with neurotransmission.

J	Wisniewski, MG; Thompson, ER; Iyer, N				Wisniewski, Matthew G.; Thompson, Eric R.; Iyer, Nandini			Theta- and alpha-power enhancements in the electroencephalogram as an auditory delayed match-to-sample task becomes impossibly difficult	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory processes; event-related synchronization; hearing; independent component analysis; working memory	WORKING-MEMORY TASK; LISTENING EFFORT; HEARING IMPAIRMENT; OLDER LISTENERS; BRAIN DYNAMICS; PUPIL-DILATION; EEG DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; LOAD; PERFORMANCE	Recent studies have related enhancements of theta- (approximate to 4-8 Hz) and alpha-power (approximate to 8-13 Hz) to listening effort based on parallels between enhancement and task difficulty. In contrast, nonauditory works demonstrate that, although increases in difficulty are initially accompanied by increases in effort, effort decreases when a task becomes so difficult as to exceed one's ability. Given the latter, we examined whether theta- and alpha-power enhancements thought to reflect effortful listening show a quadratic trend across levels of listening difficulty from impossible to easy. Listeners (n=14) performed an auditory delayed match-to-sample task with frequency-modulated tonal sweeps under impossible, difficult (at approximate to 70.7% correct threshold), and easy (well above threshold) conditions. Frontal midline theta-power and posterior alpha-power enhancements were observed during the retention interval, with greatest enhancement in the difficult condition. Independent component-based analyses of data suggest that theta-power enhancements stemmed from medial frontal sources at or near the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas alpha-power effects stemmed from occipital cortices. Results support the notion that theta- and alpha-power enhancements reflect effortful cognitive processes during listening, related to auditory working memory and the inhibition of task-irrelevant cortical processing regions, respectively. Theta- and alpha-power dynamics can be used to characterize the cognitive processes that make up effortful listening, including qualitatively different types of listening effort.

Increased Force Variability Is Associated with Altered Modulation of the Motorneuron Pool Activity in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder (ASD); index finger abduction; force variability; motorneuron pool; first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle; decomposition-based electromyography (dEMG)	SLOW FINGER MOVEMENTS; SURFACE EMG SIGNALS; UNIT DISCHARGE; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION; DIFFERENT MUSCLES; COMMON DRIVE; OLDER-ADULTS; EEG-EMG; FLUCTUATIONS; RANGE	Force control deficits have been repeatedly documented in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). They are associated with worse social and daily living skill impairments in patients suggesting that developing a more mechanistic understanding of the central and peripheral processes that cause them may help guide the development of treatments that improve multiple outcomes in ASD. The neuromuscular mechanisms underlying force control deficits are not yet understood. Seventeen individuals with ASD and 14 matched healthy controls completed an isometric index finger abduction test at 60% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) during recording of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle to determine the neuromuscular processes associated with sustained force variability. Central modulation of the motorneuron pool activation of the FDI muscle was evaluated at delta (0-4 Hz), alpha (4-10 Hz), beta (10-35 Hz) and gamma (35-60 Hz) frequency bands. ASD patients showed greater force variability than controls when attempting to maintain a constant force. Relative to controls, patients also showed increased central modulation of the motorneuron pool at beta and gamma bands. For controls, reduced force variability was associated with reduced delta frequency modulation of the motorneuron pool activity of the FDI muscle and increased modulation at beta and gamma bands. In contrast, delta, beta, and gamma frequency oscillations were not associated with force variability in ASD. These findings suggest that alterations of central mechanisms that control motorneuron pool firing may underlie the common and often impairing symptoms of ASD.

Increased long distance event-related gamma band connectivity in Alzheimer's disease	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Event-related; Sensory-evoked; Coherence; Gamma; Alzheimer's disease; EEG; Connectivity	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DELTA OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEMORY TASK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RETICULAR-FORMATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY PATHWAY; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; BRAIN	Background: Brain oscillatory responses can be used for non-invasive analyses of cortico-cortical connectivity, local neuronal synchronization, and coherence of oscillations in many neuropsychiatric conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present paper, we examine sensory-evoked and event-related gamma coherences elicited by visual stimuli in three sub-gamma bands in two sub-groups of patients with AD (i.e., acetylcholinesterase-inhibitor treated and untreated) and healthy controls. Methods: We studied a total of 39 patients with probable mild AD (according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) who had been sub-divided into untreated (n = 21) and treated (n = 18) (patients either on cholinergic monotherapy or combined therapy with memantine) AD groups, and 21 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy elderly controls. A simple flash visual paradigm was applied for the acquisition of sensory-evoked coherences. Event-related coherences were elicited using a classical visual oddball paradigm. Both sensory-evoked and event-related gamma coherences were calculated for long-distance intrahemispheric pairs for three frequency ranges: 2530 Hz, 30-35 Hz, and 40-48 Hz in post-stimulus 0-800 ms duration. The long-distance intrahemispheric pairs from both sides were fronto-parietal, fronto-temporal, fronto-temporoparietal, fronto-occipital, centro-occipital and parieto-occipital. Results: The sensory-evoked or event-related gamma coherences revealed that both treated and untreated AD patients had significantly increased values compared to healthy controls in all three sub-gamma bands. Moreover, the treated AD patients demonstrated significantly higher fronto-parietal gamma coherences during both sensory stimulation and oddball paradigm and lower occipito-parietal coherences during oddball paradigm in comparison to untreated AD patients. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that an increase of gamma coherences was present in response to both visual sensory and cognitive stimulation in AD patients in all gamma sub-bands. Therefore, gamma oscillatory activity seems to be fundamental in brain functions at both the sensory and cognitive levels. The increase of gamma coherence values was not due to cholinergic treatment to any significant extent, as both treated and untreated AD patients had increased gamma coherence values compared to healthy controls. The use of coherence values reflecting brain connectivity holds potential for neuroimaging of AD and understanding brain dynamics related to the effects of medication. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Intersensory timing is crucial in this process because only inputs reaching the brain within a restricted temporal window are perceptually bound. Previous research in the audiovisual field has investigated various features of the temporal binding window, revealing asymmetries in its size and plasticity depending on the leading input: auditory-visual (AV) or visual-auditory (VA). Here, we tested whether separate neuronal mechanisms underlie this AV-VA dichotomy in humans. We recorded high-density EEG while participants performed an audiovisual simultaneity judgment task including various AV-VA asynchronies and unisensory control conditions (visual-only, auditory-only) and tested whether AV and VA processing generate different patterns of brain activity. After isolating the multisensory components of AV-VA event-related potentials (ERPs) from the sum of their unisensory constituents, we ran a time-resolved topographical representational similarity analysis (tRSA) comparing the AV and VA ERP maps. Spatial cross-correlation matrices were built from real data to index the similarity between the AV and VA maps at each time point (500 ms window after stimulus) and then correlated with two alternative similarity model matrices: AV(maps) = VA(maps) versus AV(maps) not equal VA(maps). The tRSA results favored the AV(maps) not equal VA(maps) model across all time points, suggesting that audiovisual temporal binding (indexed by synchrony perception) engages different neural pathways depending on the leading sense. The existence of such dual route supports recent theoretical accounts proposing that multiple binding mechanisms are implemented in the brain to accommodate different information parsing strategies in auditory and visual sensory systems.

Assessing the Effectiveness of Neurofeedback Training in the Context of Clinical and Social Neuroscience	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Review						neurotherapies; perturbative physiological plasticity; self-directed plasticity; biomarkers; functional connectivity	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; TIME FMRI NEUROFEEDBACK; AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDER; SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; FRONTAL-MIDLINE-THETA; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA/THETA NEUROFEEDBACK; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS	Social neuroscience benefits from the experimental manipulation of neuronal activity. One possible manipulation, neurofeedback, is an operant conditioning-based technique in which individuals sense, interact with, and manage their own physiological and mental states. Neurofeedback has been applied to a wide variety of psychiatric illnesses, as well as to treat sub-clinical symptoms, and even to enhance performance in healthy populations. Despite growing interest, there persists a level of distrust and/or bias in the medical and research communities in the USA toward neurofeedback and other functional interventions. As a result, neurofeedback has been largely ignored, or disregarded within social neuroscience. We propose a systematic, empirically-based approach for assessing the effectiveness, and utility of neurofeedback. To that end, we use the term perturbative physiologic plasticity to suggest that biological systems function as an integrated whole that can be perturbed and guided, either directly or indirectly, into different physiological states. When the intention is to normalize the system, e.g., via neurofeedback, we describe it as self-directed neuroplasticity, whose outcome is persistent functional, structural, and behavioral changes. We argue that changes in physiological, neuropsychological, behavioral, interpersonal, and societal functioning following neurofeedback can serve as objective indices and as the metrics necessary for assessing levels of efficacy. In this chapter, we examine the effects of neurofeedback on functional connectivity in a few clinical disorders as case studies for this approach. We believe this broader perspective will open new avenues of investigation, especially within social neuroscience, to further elucidate the mechanisms and effectiveness of these types of interventions, and their relevance to basic research.

J	Vassalli, A; Franken, P				Vassalli, Anne; Franken, Paul			Hypocretin (orexin) is critical in sustaining theta/gamma-rich waking behaviors that drive sleep need	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						hypocretin/orexin; narcolepsy; sleep homeostasis; brain theta oscillations; waking substate	HIPPOCAMPAL THETA ACTIVITY; REM-SLEEP; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OREXIN/HYPOCRETIN NEURONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; KNOCKOUT MICE; MEDIAL SEPTUM; INBRED MICE; IN-VIVO	Hcrt gene inactivation in mice leads to behavioral state instability, abnormal transitions to paradoxical sleep, and cataplexy, hallmarks of narcolepsy. Sleep homeostasis is, however, considered unimpaired in patients and narcoleptic mice. We find that whereas Hcrt(ko/ko) mice respond to 6-h sleep deprivation (SD) with a slow-wave sleep (SWS) EEG delta (1.0 to 4.0 Hz) power rebound like WT littermates, spontaneous waking fails to induce a delta power reflecting prior waking duration. This correlates with impaired theta (6.0 to 9.5 Hz) and fast-gamma (55 to 80 Hz) activity in prior waking. We algorithmically identify a theta-dominated wakefulness (TDW) sub-state underlying motivated behaviors and typically preceding cataplexy in Hcrt(ko/ko) mice. Hcrt(ko/ko) mice fully implement TDW when waking is enforced, but spontaneous TDW episode duration is greatly reduced. A reformulation of the classic sleep homeostasis model, where homeostatic pressure rises exclusively in TDW rather than all waking, predicts delta power dynamics both in Hcrt(ko/ko) and WT mouse baseline and recovery SWS. The low homeostatic impact of Hcrt(ko/ko) mouse spontaneous waking correlates with decreased cortical expression of neuronal activity-related genes (notably Bdnf, Egr1/Zif268, and Per2). Thus, spontaneous TDW stability relies on Hcrt to sustain./fast-gamma network activity and associated plasticity, whereas other arousal circuits sustain TDW during SD. We propose that TDW identifies a discrete global brain activity mode that is regulated by context-dependent neuromodulators and acts as a major driver of sleep homeostasis. Hcrt loss in Hcrt(ko/ko) mice causes impaired TDW maintenance in baseline wake and blunted d power in SWS, reproducing, respectively, narcolepsy excessive daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality.

Relationship of P3b single-trial latencies and response times in one, two, and three-stimulus oddball tasks	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						P300; EEG; Hidden semi-Markov models; Multi-voxel pattern analysis; N1	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TO-TARGET INTERVAL; P300 LATENCY; STIMULUS; ERP; COMPONENT; VARIABILITY; INDEX; OSCILLATIONS; ASSOCIATION	The P300 is one of the most widely studied components of the human event-related potential. According to a longstanding view, the P300, and particularly its posterior subcomponent (i.e., the P3b), is driven by stimulus categorization. Whether the P3b relates to tactical processes involved in immediate responding or strategic processes that affect future behavior remains controversial, however. It is difficult to determine whether variability in P3b latencies relates to variability in response times because of limitations in the methods currently available to quantify the latency of the P3b during single trials. In this paper, we report results from the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), the Hitchcock Radar Task, and a 3-Stimulus Oddball Task. These represent variants of the one-, two-, and three-stimulus oddball paradigms commonly used to study the P3b. The PVT requires simple detection, whereas the Hitchcock Radar Task and the 3-Stimulus Task require detection and categorization. We apply a novel technique that combines hidden semi-Markov models and multi-voxel pattern analysis (HSMM-MVPA) to data from the three experiments. HSMM-MVPA revealed a processing stage in each task corresponding to the P3b. Trial-by trial variability in the latency of the processing stage correlated with response times in the Hitchcock Radar Task and the 3-Stimulus Task, but not the PVT. These results indicate that the P3b reflects a stimulus categorization process, and that its latency is strongly associated with response times when the stimulus must be categorized before responding. In addition to those theoretical insights, the ability to detect the onset of the P3b and other components on a single-trial basis using HSMM-MVPA opens the door for new uses of mental chronometry in cognitive neuroscience.

We quantified IMCC in nine patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (i) within brain networks in 'healthy' non-involved cortical zones (NIZ) and (ii) within brain networks involved in generating seizures and interictal spikes (IZ1) or solely spikes (IZ2). Functional connectivity (h (2) ) estimates for 10 min of resting-state data were obtained between each pair of electrodes within each clinical zone for both icEEG and fMRI. A sliding window approach allowed us to quantify the variability over time of h (2) (vh (2)) as an indicator of connectivity dynamics. We observe significant positive IMCC for h (2) and vh (2), for multiple bands in the NIZ only, with the strongest effect in the lower icEEG frequencies. Similarly, intra-modal h (2) and vh (2) were found to be differently modified as a function of different epileptic processes: compared to NIZ, was higher in IZ1, but lower in IZ2, while showed the inverse pattern. This corroborates previous observations of inter-modal connectivity discrepancies in pathological cortices, while providing the first direct invasive and simultaneous comparison in humans. We also studied time-resolved FC variability multimodally for the first time, finding that IZ1 shows both elevated internal and less rich dynamical variability, suggesting that its chronic role in epileptogenesis may be linked to greater homogeneity in self-sustaining pathological oscillatory states.

However, due to event-related (de) synchronization(ERD/ERS) during motor imagery are not stable enough, the performance of classification of MI-BCI is relatively poor. It has become a focus of study that how to achieve the feature enhancement of motor imagery. Since motor imagery is a cognitive processing that engages parts of the motor resources, we try to improve suppression and enhancement of amplitude (ERD/ERS) in a novel way by changing cognitive state. In this study, we designed a cognitive parallel n-back task with varying memory load to carry out with motor imagery task synchronously. The result of 13 subjects who volunteered in this experiment was shown that increased memory load could activate much stronger power decrease of ERD pattern at alpha rhythms in both sides of sensorimotor cortex, especially in contralateral area. Furthermore, we calculated the accuracy of classification between motor imaginary and motor idle status in different conditions by two classifiers, respectively. Through the paired t-test, we obtained that the accuracy of high memory load condition was significantly higher than the low load condition(SVM: (76.3 +/- 13.3)% and (83.4 +/- 10.5)%, p<0.01; LDA: (78.0 +/- 13.5)% and (84.6 +/- 12.4)%, p<0.05). A conclusion can be drawn that memory load have a positive impact on ERD pattern, even it is not caused by motor imagery itself. Besides, it may imply a new approach to modulate brain oscillations related to motor imagery by changing cognitive state.

To address this question, we used magnetoencephalography to compare the cortical responses between ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals to a passive mismatch paradigm. We repeated the paradigm twice, once in a quiet background, and once in the presence of background noise. We focused on both the evoked mismatch field (MMF) response in temporal and frontal cortical locations, and functional connectivity with spectral specificity between those locations. In the quiet condition, we found common neural sources of the MMF response in both groups, in the right temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In the noise condition, the MMF response in the right IFG was preserved in the TD group, but reduced relative to the quiet condition in ASD group. The MMF response in the right IFG also correlated with severity of ASD. Moreover, in noise, we found significantly reduced normalized coherence (deviant normalized by standard) in ASD relative to TD, in the beta band (14-25 Hz), between left temporal and left inferior frontal sub-regions. However, unnormalized coherence (coherence during deviant or standard) was significantly increased in ASD relative to TD, in multiple frequency bands. Our findings suggest increased recruitment of neural resources in ASD irrespective of the task difficulty, alongside a reduction in top-down modulations, usually mediated by the beta band, needed to mitigate the impact of noise on auditory processing.

Magnetoencephalographic and functional MRI connectomics in schizophrenia via intra- and inter-network connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Imaging; MEG; Functional connectivity; Resting state connectivity	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; HEART-RATE; MEG; EEG; LOCALIZATION; SYNCHRONY; DYSCONNECTION; OSCILLATIONS; DYSFUNCTION	Examination of intrinsic functional connectivity using functional MRI (fMRI) has provided important findings regarding dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. Extending these results using a complementary neuroimaging modality, magnetoencephalography (MEG), we present the first direct comparison of functional connectivity between schizophrenia patients and controls, using these two modalities combined. We developed a novel MEG approach for estimation of networks using MEG that incorporates spatial independent component analysis (ICA) and pairwise correlations between independent component timecourses, to estimate intra- and intern network connectivity. This analysis enables group-level inference and testing of between-group differences. Resting state MEG and fMRI data were acquired from a large sample of healthy controls (n=45) and schizophrenia patients (n=46). Group spatial ICA was performed on fMRI and MEG data to extract intrinsic fMRI and MEG networks and to compensate for signal leakage in MEG. Similar, but not identical spatial independent components were detected for MEG and fMRI. Analysis of functional network connectivity (FNC; i.e., pairwise correlations in network (ICA component) timecourses) revealed a differential between-modalities pattern, with greater connectivity among occipital networks in fMRI and among frontal networks in MEG. Most importantly, significant differences between controls and patients were observed in both modalities. MEG FNC results in particular indicated dysfunctional hyperconnectivity within frontal and temporal networks in patients, while in fMRI FNC was always greater for controls than for patients. This is the first study to apply group spatial ICA as an approach to leakage correction, and as such our results may be biased by spatial leakage effects. Results suggest that combining these two neuroimaging modalities reveals additional disease-relevant patterns of connectivity that were not detectable with fMRI or MEG alone.

Preoperative FDG-PET scans of 37 children with intractable epilepsy (31 with non-localizing MRI) were compared with age-matched pseudo-normal pediatric control PET data. Hypo-/hypermetabolic maps were transformed to 3D-MRI brain surface to compare the locations of metabolic changes with electrode coordinates of the ECoG-defined seizure onset zone (SOZ) and interictal spiking. While hypometabolic clusters showed a good agreement with the SOZ on the lobar level (sensitivity/specificity50.74/ 0.64), detailed surface-distance analysis demonstrated that large portions of ECoG-defined SOZ and interictal spiking area were located at least 3 cm beyond hypometabolic regions with the same statistical threshold (sensitivity/specificity50.18-0.25/0.94-0.90 for overlap 3-cm distance); for a lower threshold, sensitivity for SOZ at 3 cm increased to 0.39 with a modest compromise of specificity. Performance of FDG-PET SPM was slightly better in children with smaller as compared with widespread SOZ. The results demonstrate that SPM utilizing age-matched pseudocontrols can reliably detect the lobe of seizure onset. However, the spatial mismatch between metabolic and EEG epileptiform abnormalities indicates that a more complete SOZ detection could be achieved by extending intracranial electrode coverage at least 3 cm beyond the metabolic abnormality. Considering that the extent of feasible electrode coverage is limited, localization information from other modalities is particularly important to optimize grid coverage in cases of large hypometabolic cortex.

J	Ieong, HFH; Yuan, Z				Ieong, Hada Fong-ha; Yuan, Zhen			Resting-State Neuroimaging and Neuropsychological Findings in Opioid Use Disorder during Abstinence: A Review	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						heroin; opioid; electroencephalography; functional magnetic resonance imaging; neuropsychological tests; resting-state functional connectivity; cognition; addiction	REMOTE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; METHADONE-MAINTENANCE PATIENTS; HEROIN-DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS; BETA FREQUENCY BANDS; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OPIATE ADDICTION; DECISION-MAKING; DRUG-ADDICTION	Dependence to opiates, including illicit heroin and prescription pain killers, and treatment of the opioid use disorder (OUD) have been longstanding problems over the world. Despite intense efforts to scientific investigation and public health care, treatment outcomes have not significantly improved for the past 50 years. One reason behind the continuing use of heroin worldwide despite such efforts is its highly addictive nature. Brain imaging studies over the past two decades have made significant contribution to the understanding of the addictive properties as to be due in part to biological processes, specifically those in the brain structure and function. Moreover, traditional clinical neuropsychology studies also contribute to the account in part for the treatment refractory nature of the drug abuse. However, there is a gap between those studies, and the rates of relapse are still high. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to understand the fundamental neural mechanism of CUD. How does the brain of an OUD patient functionally and cognitively differ from others? This brief review is to compare and contrast the current literature on non-invasive resting state neuroimaging and clinical neuropsychological studies with the focus on the abstinence stage in OUD. The results show as follow: 1. Brain connectivity strength in the reward system, dysregulation of circuits associated with emotion and stress, enhanced beta and alpha power activity, and high impulsivity are induced by CUD. 2. Some recovery signs in cognition are demonstrated in OUD subjects after prolonged abstinence, but not in the subjects undergoing methadone treatment. 3. Normalization in the composition of brain oscillations especially in the temporal region is induced and restored by methadone treatment in roughly 6 months in mean duration for OUDs having a mean opioid-use history of 10 years. We hope that the review provides valuable implications for clinical research and practice and paves anew insight into the future path to the identification of potential biomarkers and clinical outcome predictors in CUD in the domains of brain regions, functions, and behaviors.

Sferics consist of partially polarized electromagnetic pulses with an oscillating carrier signal in the very low frequency (VLF) band and a pulse repetition frequency in the extremely low frequency (ELF) band. Their ELF intensity may reach similar to 5 mV/m at global ranges, and similar to 0.5 V/m at similar to 1000 km from the lightning. The health symptoms associated with sferics are also associated with antennas of mobile telephony base stations and handsets, which emit radio frequency (RF) radiation pulsed on ELF, and expose humans at similar or stronger electric field intensities with sferics. According to the Ion Forced-Oscillation mechanism, polarized ELF EMFs of intensities down to 0.1-1 mV/m are able to disrupt any living cell's electrochemical balance and function by irregular gating of electro-sensitive ion channels on the cell membranes, and thus initiate a variety of health symptoms, while VLF EMFs need to be thousands of times stronger in order to be able to initiate health effects. We examine EMFs from sferics in terms of their bioactivity on the basis of this mechanism. We introduce the hypothesis that stronger atmospheric discharges may reasonably be considered to be similar to 70% along a straight line, and thus the associated EMFs (sferics) similar to 70% polarized. We find that sferics mainly in the ELF band have adequate intensity and polarization to cause biological/health effects. We provide explanation for the effects of sferics on human/animal health on the basis of this mechanism. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hudson, AE				Hudson, Andrew E.			Metastability of Neuronal Dynamics during General Anesthesia: Time for a Change in Our Assumptions?	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						metastability; isoflurane; rats; Sprague-Dawley; attractor networks; attractor dynamics	DELTA OSCILLATIONS; BISPECTRAL INDEX; PHASE-TRANSITION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; CORTEX; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CONSCIOUSNESS; SIGNATURES; AWARENESS; NETWORK	There is strong evidence that anesthetics have stereotypical effects on brain state, so that a given anesthetic appears to have a signature in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which may vary with dose. This can be usefully interpreted as the anesthetic determining an attractor in the phase space of the brain. How brain activity shifts between these attractors in time remains understudied, as most studies implicitly assume a one-to-one relationship between drug dose and attractor features by assuming stationarity over the analysis interval and analyzing data segments of several minutes in length. Yet data in rats anesthetized with isoflurane suggests that, at anesthetic levels consistent with surgical anesthesia, brain activity alternates between multiple attractors, often spending on the order of 10 min in one activity pattern before shifting to another. Moreover, the probability of these jumps between attractors changes with anesthetic concentration. This suggests the hypothesis that brain state is metastable during anesthesia: though it appears at equilibrium on short timescales (on the order of seconds to a few minutes), longer intervals show shifting behavior. Compelling evidence for metastability in rats anesthetized with isoflurane is reviewed, but so far only suggestive hints of metastability in brain states exist with other anesthetics or in other species. Explicit testing of metastability during anesthesia will require experiments with longer acquisition intervals and carefully designed analytic approaches; some of the implications of these constraints are reviewed for typical spectral analysis approaches. If metastability exists during anesthesia, it implies degeneracy in the relationship between brain state and effect site concentration, as there is not a one-to-one mapping between the two. This degeneracy could explain some of the reported difficulty in using brain activity monitors to titrate drug dose to prevent awareness during anesthesia and should force a rethinking of the notion of depth of anesthesia as a single dimension. Finally, explicit incorporation of knowledge of the dynamics of the brain during anesthesia could offer better depth of anesthesia monitoring.

Differential Modulation of Rhythmic Brain Activity in Healthy Adults by a T-Type Calcium Channel Blocker: An MEG Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						octanol; magnetoence phalography; alcohol; thalamocortical dysrhythmia; brain rhythmic activity; power spectrum	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; TEMPORAL SLOW WAVES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; OSCILLATORY PROPERTIES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DRUG-DELIVERY; ALPHA-RHYTHM; OPEN-LABEL; EEG ALPHA; NEURONS	1-octanol is a therapeutic candidate for disorders involving the abnormal activation of the T-type calcium current since it blocks this current specifically. Such disorders include essential tremor and a group of neurological and psychiatric disorders resulting from thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD). For example, clinically, the observable phenotype in essential tremor is the tremor itself. The differential diagnostic of TCD is not based only on clinical signs and symptoms. Rather, TCD incorporates an electromagnetic biomarker, the presence of abnormal thalamocortical low frequency brain oscillations. The effect of 1-octanol on brain activity has not been tested. As a preliminary step to such a TCD study, we examined the short-term effects of a single dose of 1-octanol on resting brain activity in 32 healthy adults using magnetoencephalograpy. Visual inspection of baseline power spectra revealed that the subjects fell into those with strong low frequency activity (set 2, n = 11) and those without such activity, but dominated by an alpha peak (set 1, n = 22). Cross-validated linear discriminant analysis, using mean spectral density (MSD) in nine frequency bands as predictors, found overall that 82.5% of the subjects were classified as determined by visual inspection. The effect of 1-octanol on the MSD in narrow frequency bands differed between the two subject groups. In set 1 subjects the MSD increased in the 4.5-6.5Hz and 6.58.5 Hz bands. This was consistent with a widening of the alpha peak toward lower frequencies. In the set two subjects the MSD decrease in the 2.54.5 Hz and 4.56.5 Hz bands. This decreased power is consistent with the blocking effect of 1-octanol on T-type calcium channels. The subjects reported no adverse effects of the 1-octanol. Since stronger low frequency activity is characteristic of patients with TCD, 1-octanol and other T-type calcium channel blockers are good candidates for treatment of this group of disorders following a placebo-controlled study.

Nat Neurosci 17: 1661-1663, 2014). It has not yet been fully explored if a similar timescale hierarchy is present in humans. Additionally, these measures in the monkey studies have not addressed findings that rhythmic activity within a brain area can occur at multiple frequencies. In this study we investigate in humans if regions may be biased toward particular frequencies of intrinsic activity and if a full cortical mapping still reveals an organization that follows this hierarchy. We examined the spectral power in multiple frequency bands (0.5-150 Hz) from task-independent data using magnetoen-cephalography (MEG). We compared standardized power across bands to find regional frequency biases. Our results demonstrate a mix of lower and higher frequency biases across sensory and higher order regions. Thus they suggest a more complex cortical organization that does not simply follow this hierarchy. Additionally, some regions do not display a bias for a single band, and a data-driven clustering analysis reveals a regional organization with high standardized power in multiple bands. Specifically, theta and beta are both high in dorsal frontal cortex, whereas delta and gamma are high in ventral frontal cortex and temporal cortex. Occipital and parietal regions are biased more narrowly toward alpha power, and ventral temporal lobe displays specific biases toward gamma. Thus intrinsic rhythmic neural activity displays a regional organization but one that is not necessarily hierarchical. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The organization of rhythmic neural activity is not well understood. Whereas it has been postulated that rhythms are organized in a hierarchical manner across brain regions, our novel analysis allows comparison of full cortical maps across different frequency bands, which demonstrate that the rhythmic organization is more complex. Additionally, data-driven methods show that rhythms of multiple frequencies or timescales occur within a particular region and that this nonhierarchical organization is wide-spread.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on FM have suggested altered brain connectivity between the insula and the default mode network (DMN). However, this connectivity change has not been characterized through direct neural signals for exploring the embedded spectrotemporal features and the pertinent clinical relevance. Methods: We recorded the resting-state magnetoencephalographic activities of 28 patients with FM and 28 age-and sex-matched controls, and analyzed the source-based functional connectivity between the insula and the DMN at 1-40 Hz by using the minimum norm estimates and imaginary coherence methods. We also measured the connectivity between the DMN and the primary visual (V1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices as intrapatient negative controls. Connectivity measurement was further correlated with the clinical parameters of FM. Results: Compared with the controls, patients with FM reported more tender points (15.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 5.9 +/- 3.7) and higher total tenderness score (TTS; 29.1 +/- 7.0 vs. 7.7 +/- 5.5; both p < 0.001); they also had decreased insula-DMN connectivity at the theta band (4-8 Hz; left, p = 0.007; right, p = 0.035), but displayed unchanged V1-DMN and S1-DMN connectivity (p > 0.05). When patients with FM and the controls were combined together, the insula-DMN theta connectivity was negatively correlated with the number of tender points (left insula, r = -0.428, p = 0.001; right insula, r = -0.4, p = 0.002) and TTS score (left insula, r = -0.429, p = 0.001; right insula, r = -0.389, p = 0.003). Furthermore, in patients with FM, the right insula-DMN connectivity at the beta band (13-25 Hz) was negatively correlated with the number of tender points (r = -0.532, p = 0.004) and TTS (r = -0.428, p = 0.023), and the bilateral insula-DMN connectivity at the delta band (1-4 Hz) was negatively correlated with FM Symptom Severity (left: r = -0.423, p = 0.025; right: r = -0.437, p = 0.020) and functional disability (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; left: r = -0.415, p = 0.028; right: r = -0.374, p = 0.050). Conclusions: We confirmed the frequency-specific reorganization of the insula-DMN connectivity in FM. The clinical relevance of this connectivity change may warrant future studies to elucidate its causal relationship and potential as a neurological signature for FM.
