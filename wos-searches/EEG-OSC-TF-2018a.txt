Intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) can directly record electrical neural activity and has the unique potential to accomplish this goal. Traditionally, averaging analysis has been applied to analyze intracranial EEG data; however, several new techniques are available for depicting neural activity and intra- and inter-regional connectivity. Here, we introduce two analytical protocols we recently applied to analyze intracranial EEG data using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software: time-frequency SPM analysis for neural activity and dynamic causal modeling of induced responses for intra- and inter-regional connectivity. We report our analysis of intracranial EEG data during the observation of faces as representative results. The results revealed that the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) showed gamma-band activity at very early stages (110 ms) in response to faces, and both the IOG and amygdala showed rapid intra- and inter-regional connectivity using various types of oscillations. These analytical protocols have the potential to identify the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive functions with high spatial and temporal profiles.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the ripple (80-200/250 Hz) and fast ripple (200/250-500/600 Hz) bands have recently been attracting attention, and their recording has been enabled by advancements in digital EEG techniques. The detection of HFOs was previously limited to intracranial EEG, but fast oscillations (FOs) in the gamma (40-80 Hz) and ripple bands can now be detected over the scalp. HFOs and FOs have been shown to be related to epileptogenicity in intracranial EEG and scalp EEG, respectively. A large number of FOs are found in the scalp EEGs of pediatric patients with various epileptic encephalopathies, particularly West syndrome. FOs are suggested to be a biomarker of the epileptogenic cortical region in epilepsy surgery. FOs are detectable even in patients with idiopathic focal epilepsies, including benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and Panayiotopoulos syndrome, who are not generally candidates for operation. The detection of HFOs and FOs may provide clues to the pathophysiology of epilepsy and the relationship between HFOs and cognitive dysfunction.

We use a database of EEG signals containing SSVEP and demonstrate the desirability of the use of selected methods, showing their benefits. Methods such as independent components analysis (ICA), frequency analysis (DFT), and time-frequency analysis (STFT) are presented. For SSVEP, the features of EEG signal should be stable with time. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) allows to confirm this stability. Independent Component Analysis is used to extract pure SSVEP components. The advantages of each method are described and the obtained results are discussed. Further, source location by the use of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography algorithm is demonstrated.

However, traditional data analyses which employ the Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) have been of limited use as they do not allow time-and frequency-resolved tracking of brain activity and detection of directional connectivity. Here, we applied advanced qEEG tools using autoregressive (AR) modelling, alongside traditional approaches, to murine data sets from common research scenarios: (a) the effect of age on resting EEG; (b) drug actions on nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep EEG (pharmaco-EEG); and (c) dynamic EEG profiles during correct vs incorrect spontaneous alternation responses in the Y-maze. AR analyses of short data strips reliably detected age-and drug-induced spectral EEG changes, while renormalized partial directed coherence (rPDC) reported direction-and time-resolved connectivity dynamics in mice. Our approach allows for the first time inference of behaviour-and stage-dependent data in a time-and frequency-resolved manner, and offers insights into brain networks that underlie working memory processing beyond what can be achieved with traditional methods.

For elucidating brain functions in healthy subjects and motor dysfunctions patients, a motor-related squeeze task, a simple daily task was employed in this study. Using low-cost electroencephalography devices in mapping human brain for understanding neural microcircuitry roles during a squeeze task as a biomarker for brain function was the objective. EEG data was recorded from eight healthy righthanded volunteers (4 female and 4 male) of different age group, performing squeeze task on a rubber ball applying graded forces. Using time and frequency domain analysis, we show frontal asymmetry attributed to activity from electrodes in AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7 and F8 role-specific regions for identifying motor planning and motor execution characterized by predominant mu and beta oscillations.

EEG source imaging of epileptic activity at seizure onset	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Seizure; HD-EEG; Oscillation; Source localization; Time-frequency; Epilepsy	DENSE-ARRAY EEG; FRONTAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SCALP EEG; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ZONE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LATERALIZATION	Surgical resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) requires that this region of the cortex is accurately localized. The onset of a seizure may be marked by transient discharges, but it also may be accompanied by oscillatory, sinusoidal electrographic activity, such as the EEG theta rhythm. However, because of the superposition of the seizure signal with other electrical signals, including noise artifacts and non-seizure brain activity, noninvasive Electrical Source Imaging (ESI) of the ictal EEG activity at seizure onset remains a challenging task for surgical planning. In the present study, we localize the SOZ from oscillatory features of the EEG at the ictal onset using 256-channel high density electroencephalography (HD-EEG), exact sensor positions, and individual electrical head models constructed from the patient's T1 magnetic resonance image (MRI). Epileptic activities at the seizure onset were characterized with joint time-frequency analysis and source estimated by standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) inverse method. The consistency of this localization was examined across multiple seizures for individual patients. For validation, results were compared to three clinical criteria: (1) epileptogenic lesions, (2) seizure onset observed in intracranial EEG, and (3) successful surgical outcomes. In this set of 84 seizures, the onsets of 56 seizures could be localized. For the lateralization measure, the results from HD-EEG with interictal spikes (8/10) and with ictal onset (10/10) were more accurate than international 10-20 EEG for interictal spikes (5/10) and ictal onset (5/10). ESI from HD-EEG with ictal onset (9/ 10) had greater concordance to the clinical criteria than HD-EEG with interictal spikes (6/10). Noninvasive ESI of oscillatory features at ictal onset using 256-channel HD-EEG and high-resolution individual head models can make a useful contribution to the clinical localization of the SOZ in presurgical planning.

Since its initial introduction to electroencephalographic (EEG) data analysis, EMD has been extended to enable phase synchrony analysis and multivariate data processing. EMD has been integrated into a wide range of applications, with emphasis on denoising and classification.

Methods: Twenty-one CSWS patients treated with methylprednisolone were divided into structural group and genetic/unknown group. Comparisons were made between the two etiological groups: selected clinical variables including gender, age parameters, seizure frequencies and antiepileptic drugs; distribution of HFOs in pre-methylprednisolone electroencephalography (EEG) and percentage changes of HFOs and spikes after methylprednisolone treatment. Results: There were 7 patients (33%) in structural group and 14 patients (68%) in genetic/unknown group. No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding selected clinical variables. HFOs were found in 12 patients in premethylprednisolone EEG. The distribution of HFOs was focal and accordant with lesions in 5 of structural group, and it was also focal but in different brain regions in 7 of genetic/unknown group. The percentage reduction of total HFOs and spikes was 81% (158/195) and 19% (1956/10,037) in structural group, while 98% (315/323) and 55% (6658/12,258) in genetic/unknown group after methylprednisolone treatment. Conclusion: The etiologies had no distinct correlation with some clinical characteristics in CSWS. HFOs recorded on scalp EEG might not only be used as makers of seizure-onset zone (SOZ), but also have association with functional disruption of brain networks. Both HFOs and spikes reduced more in genetic/unknown patients than that in structural patients after methylprednisolone treatment and HFOs were more sensitive to treatment than spikes.

In the clinical setting, EEG recording is followed by visual readings by clinicians for qualification. Visual analysis in conscious EEG records include the assessment of background rhythms and graphoelement. This visual reading is good to recognize artifacts. Unfortunately, it has several drawbacks, including its reliability among the assessors is quite low because it depends on the capabilities and experience of the interpreter. Also, if the EEG spatial resolution increases, it takes quite a long time to read. In this study, we developed an algorithm to calculate EEG signal parameters based on visual readings performed by clinicians. Quantitative parameters were calculated in the form of porterior dominant rhythm (PDR) existence, PDR frequency, PDR frequency asymmetry, PDR amplitude, PDR amplitude asymmetry, anterior-posterior gradient, beta amplitude, beta amplitude asymmetry, theta existence, and delta existence. The computation time needed to analyze all 16 channel EEG signals were about 115 seconds. To reduce the computation time, 5 minutes EEG records were manually selected from a complete records. The computation time reduced to 27 seconds without significant different on the quantitative parameters.

However, seizure processes are typically dynamic and nonstationary, and thus, distinguishing rhythmic discharges from nonstationary processes is one of the challenging problems. In this paper, an adaptive and localized time-frequency representation in EEG signals is proposed by means of multiscale radial basis functions (MRBF) and a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) to improve both time and frequency resolution simultaneously, which is a novel MRBF-MPSO framework of the time-frequency feature extraction for epileptic EEG signals. The dimensionality of extracted features can be greatly reduced by the principle component analysis algorithm before the most discriminative features selected are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the radial basis function (RBF) in order to separate epileptic seizure from seizure-free EEG signals. The classification performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by using several state-of-art feature extraction algorithms and other five different classifiers like linear discriminant analysis, and logistic regression. The experimental results indicate that the proposed MRBF-MPSO- SVM classification method outperforms competing techniques in terms of classification accuracy, and shows the effectiveness of the proposed method for classification of seizure epochs and seizure-free epochs.

Here, we investigate whether and how the letters of the alphabet can be directly decoded from EEG phase and power data. In addition, we investigate how different band oscillations contribute to the classification and determine the critical time periods. An English letter recognition task was assigned, and statistical analyses were conducted to decode the EEG signal corresponding to each letter visualized on a computer screen. We applied support vector machine (SVM) with gradient descent method to learn the potential features for classification. It was observed that the EEG phase signals have a higher decoding accuracy than the oscillation power information. Low-frequency theta and alpha oscillations have phase information with higher accuracy than do other bands. The decoding performance was best when the analysis period began from 180 to 380 ms after stimulus presentation, especially in the lateral occipital and posterior temporal scalp regions (PO7 and PO8). These results may provide a new approach for brain-computer interface techniques (BCI) and may deepen our understanding of EEG oscillations in cognition.

A method for the topographical identification and quantification of high frequency oscillations in intracranial electroencephalography recordings	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High-frequency oscillation; Ripple; Filter ringing; Wavelet; Topography	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; 80-500 HZ; SPIKES; PATTERNS; SURGERY; RIPPLES; BRAIN; HFOS	Objective: To develop a reliable software method using a topographic analysis of time-frequency plots to distinguish ripple (80-200 Hz) oscillations that are often associated with EEG sharp waves or spikes (RonS) from sinusoid-like waveforms that appear as ripples but correspond with digital filtering of sharp transients contained in the wide bandwidth EEG. Methods: A custom algorithm distinguished true from false ripples in one second intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings using wavelet convolution, identifying contours of isopower, and categorizing these contours into sets of open or closed loop groups. The spectral and temporal features of candidate groups were used to classify the ripple, and determine its duration, frequency, and power. Verification of detector accuracy was performed on the basis of simulations, and visual inspection of the original and band-pass filtered signals. Results: The detector could distinguish simulated true from false ripple on spikes (RonS). Among 2934 visually verified trials of iEEG recordings and spectrograms exhibiting RonS the accuracy of the detector was 88.5% with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 95.2%. The precision was 94.5% and the negative predictive value was 84.0% (N = 12). Among, 1,370 trials of iEEG recording exhibiting RonS that were reviewed blindly without spectrograms the accuracy of the detector was 68.0%, with kappa equal to 0.01 +/- 0.03. The detector successfully distinguished ripple from high spectral frequency 'fast ripple' oscillations (200-600 Hz), and characterize ripple duration and spectral frequency and power. The detector was confounded by brief bursts of gamma (30-80 Hz) activity in 7.31 +/- 6.09% of trials, and in 30.2 +/- 14.4% of the true RonS detections ripple duration was underestimated. Conclusions: Characterizing the topographic features of a time-frequency plot generated by wavelet convolution is useful for distinguishing true oscillations from false oscillations generated by filter ringing.

Methods: Seven patients with ABECTS and eighteen patients with BECTS underwent electroencephalography (EEG) in the secondary bilateral synchrony (SBS) and non-SBS periods for ABECTS patients. SBS period is that when more than 50% of the interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are bilaterally synchronized. We determined the IED-ripple co-occurrence rate, performed time frequency analysis, and calculated the asymmetry index (AI). Results: The IEDs-ripple co-occurrence rate increased in the SBS compared to the non-SBS period. Time frequency analysis showed higher high-frequency activity rate and peak power in the SBS than in the non-SBS period. The AI was lower in ABECTS than BECTS, both in the non-SBS and SBS periods. Conclusions: Ripples were enhanced in the SBS period of ABECTS, and bilaterally synchronized both in the non-SBS and SBS periods, whereas ripples in BECTS were localized unilaterally. Significance: Bilaterally synchronized ripples in the non-SBS period of ABECTS may distinguish ABECTS from BECTS in the non-SBS period of IEDs, and may be helpful for early detection of progressive neurophysiological regression leading to early intervention.

We conducted a spectral analysis of 4 frequency bands, including theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands, of frontal brain oscillations known to be involved in emotion recognition. Furthermore, we calculated frontal asymmetry and beta/alpha ratio with respect to the valence-arousal domain. We confirmed that driver's perspective video could induce anxiety in the viewers and found three frontal EEG features pronounced in anxious situations: 1) smaller alpha power reflecting more cognitive control; 2) right dominance of theta and beta oscillations; and 3) greater difference between beta and alpha.

The advantages of ECoG-based language mapping over the gold-standard stimulation include: (i) lack of stimulation-induced seizures, (ii) better sensitivity of localization of language areas in young children, and (iii) shorter patient participant time. Despite its potential utility, ECoG-based language mapping is far less commonly practiced than stimulation mapping. Here, we have provided video presentations to explain, point-by-point, our own hardware setting and time-frequency analysis procedures. We also have provided standardized auditory stimuli, in multiple languages, ready to be used for ECoG-based language mapping. Finally, we discussed the technical aspects of ECoG-based mapping, including its pitfalls, to facilitate appropriate interpretation of the data.

While previous studies have mainly focused on elucidating the fundamental concept of neural entrainment, less is known about the time course of entrainment. In this human electroencephalography (EEG) study, we unravel the temporal evolution of neural entrainment by contrasting short and long periods of rhythmic stimulation. Listeners had to detect short silent gaps that were systematically distributed with respect to the phase of a 3 Hz frequency-modulated tone. We found that gap detection performance was modulated by the stimulus stream with a consistent stimulus phase across participants for short and long stimulation. Electrophysiological analysis confirmed neural entrainment effects at 3 Hz and the 6 Hz harmonic for both short and long stimulation lengths. 3 Hz source level analysis revealed that longer stimulation resulted in a phase shift of a participant's neural phase relative to the stimulus phase. Phase coupling increased over the first second of stimulation, but no effects for phase coupling strength were observed over time. The dynamic evolution of phase alignment suggests that the brain attunes to external rhythmic stimulation by adapting the brain's internal representation of incoming environmental stimuli.

We aim to resolve these activation changes using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. Methods: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from 9 patients with epilepsy were used in the analysis. Our method employed the whole scalp EEG data to generate regressors for the analysis of fMRI data using the general linear model. Results: We were able to resolve, with milliseconds temporal resolution, changes in activation patterns involving suspected epileptic foci and other brain regions in the epileptic network during spike and slow wave. Using summary maps (called SSWAS maps) which show the activation frequency of voxels, we found that suspected epileptic foci tend to be significantly active during this interval. SSWAS maps also enabled the detection of the epileptic foci in 4 of 5 patients where the conventional event-timing-based analysis failed to identify. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated the efficacy of the method and the potential application of SSWAS maps to identify epileptic foci.

Characterization of HFOs is still in its infancy and this is reflected in the heterogeneity of analysis and reporting methods across studies and in clinical practice. The clinical approach to HFOs identification and quantification usually still relies on visual inspection of EEG data. In this study, we developed a pipeline for the detection and analysis of HFOs. This includes preliminary selection of the most informative channels exploiting statistical properties of the pre-ictal and ictal intracranial EEG (iEEG) time series based on spectral kurtosis, followed by wavelet-based characterization of the time-frequency properties of the signal. We performed a preliminary validation analyzing EEG data in the ripple frequency band (80-250 Hz) from six patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent pre-surgical evaluation with stereo-EEG (SEEG) followed by surgical resection of pathologic brain areas, who had at least two-year positive post-surgical outcome. In this series, kurtosisdriven selection and wavelet-based detection of HFOs had average sensitivity of 81.94% and average specificity of 96.03% in identifying the HFO area which overlapped with the SOZ as defined by clinical presurgical workup. Furthermore, the kurtosis-based channel selection resulted in an average reduction in computational time of 66.60%.

EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Using Quadratic Time-Frequency Distribution	SENSORS			English	Article						emotion recognition; quadratic time-frequency distributions; electroencephalography; time-frequency features; support vector machines; 2D arousal-valence plane	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FACIAL EXPRESSION; FEATURE-SELECTION; SIGNALS; REPRESENTATION; FEATURES	Accurate recognition and understating of human emotions is an essential skill that can improve the collaboration between humans and machines. In this vein, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition is considered an active research field with challenging issues regarding the analyses of the nonstationary EEG signals and the extraction of salient features that can be used to achieve accurate emotion recognition. In this paper, an EEG-based emotion recognition approach with a novel time-frequency feature extraction technique is presented. In particular, a quadratic time-frequency distribution (QTFD) is employed to construct a high resolution time-frequency representation of the EEG signals and capture the spectral variations of the EEG signals over time. To reduce the dimensionality of the constructed QTFD-based representation, a set of 13 time- and frequency-domain features is extended to the joint time-frequency-domain and employed to quantify the QTFD-based time-frequency representation of the EEG signals. Moreover, to describe different emotion classes, we have utilized the 2D arousal-valence plane to develop four emotion labeling schemes of the EEG signals, such that each emotion labeling scheme defines a set of emotion classes. The extracted time-frequency features are used to construct a set of subject-specific support vector machine classifiers to classify the EEG signals of each subject into the different emotion classes that are defined using each of the four emotion labeling schemes. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using a publicly available EEG dataset, namely the DEAPdataset. Moreover, we design three performance evaluation analyses, namely the channel-based analysis, feature-based analysis and neutral class exclusion analysis, to quantify the effects of utilizing different groups of EEG channels that cover various regions in the brain, reducing the dimensionality of the extracted time-frequency features and excluding the EEG signals that correspond to the neutral class, on the capability of the proposed approach to discriminate between different emotion classes. The results reported in the current study demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed QTFD-based approach in recognizing different emotion classes. In particular, the average classification accuracies obtained in differentiating between the various emotion classes defined using each of the four emotion labeling schemes are within the range of 73.8%-86.2%. Moreover, the emotion classification accuracies achieved by our proposed approach are higher than the results reported in several existing state-of-the-art EEG-based emotion recognition studies.

We sought to address this by systematically reviewing the relevant literature. We searched for EEG studies of gamma band oscillations in subjects at high risk for psychosis and in patients with first episode psychosis. The following measures of gamma oscillations were extracted: resting power, evoked power, induced power, connectivity and peak frequency. Forty-five studies with a total of 3099 participants were included. There were potential sources of bias in the study designs and potential artefacts. Although there were few consistent findings, several studies reported decreased evoked or induced power in both high risk subjects and first episode patients. Studies using larger samples with serial EEG measurements, and designs that minimise artefacts that occur at the gamma frequency may advance work in this area.

J	Samuel, IBH; Wang, C; Hu, ZH; Ding, MZ				Samuel, Immanuel Babu Henry; Wang, Chao; Hu, Zhenhong; Ding, Mingzhou			The frequency of alpha oscillations: Task-dependent modulation and its functional significance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha oscillation; Alpha frequency; Alpha power; Working memory; Alpha modulation; Alpha source; Simultaneous EEG-fMRI	WORKING-MEMORY TASK; PEAK FREQUENCY; BOLD SIGNAL; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; CORTICAL AREAS; REACTION-TIME; HEAD TRAUMA	Power (amplitude) and frequency are two important characteristics of EEG alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz). There is an extensive literature showing that alpha power can be modulated in a goal-oriented manner to either enhance or suppress sensory information processing. Only a few studies to date have examined the task-dependent modulation of alpha frequency. Instead, alpha frequency is often viewed as a trait variable, and used to characterize individual differences in cognitive functioning. We performed two experiments to examine the task-dependent modulation of alpha frequency and its functional significance. In the first experiment, high-density EEG was recorded from 21 participants performing a Sternberg working memory task. The results showed that: (1) during memory encoding, alpha frequency decreased with increasing memory load, whereas during memory retention and retrieval, alpha frequency increased with increasing memory load, (2) higher alpha frequency prior to the onset of probe was associated with longer reaction time, and (3) higher alpha frequency prior to the onset of cue or probe was associated with weaker early cue-evoked or probe-evoked neural responses. In the second experiment, simultaneous EEG-fMRI was recorded from 59 participants during resting state. An EEG-informed fMRI analysis revealed that the spontaneous fluctuations of alpha frequency, but not alpha power, were inversely associated with BOLD activity in the visual cortex. Taken together, these findings suggest that alpha frequency is task-dependent, may serve as an indicator of cortical excitability, and along with alpha power, provides more comprehensive indexing of sensory gating.

The proposed system is based on the hypothesis that a noticeable change occurs in mental conditions while experiencing pain. When the human body is injured, sensory receptors in the brain enter a stimulated state. The injury may be the result of attention or an accident. Pain warnings are natural in humans and protect the body from further negative effects. In this article, an innovative and robust system based on prominent features extracted from the brain activity recorded using EEG, is proposed to predict the state of pain perception. The brain signals of subjects are observed using two low-cost EEG headsets including neurosky mindwave mobile and emotiv insight. Time and frequency domain features are selected to represent the observed signals. The results show that a combination of time and frequency domain features is the most informative approach for pain prediction using the observed brain activity.

Sleep and wakefulness causes some different kind of potential changes in brain. Transient waveforms observed in sleep electroencephalography are structures with specific amplitude and frequency characteristics that can occur in some stages of sleep. The main objective of this study is to develop a method to detect sleep spindle, which is one of these structures, with high-accuracy. Sleep spindles that require the expertise to determine visually, is a process that can be time-consuming and subjective results. In this study, electroencephalography records, scored by expert sleep physicians, were analyzed by different methods. Two features have been determined that express the presence of sleep spindle. Sleep spindles were detected by these features and quadratic discriminant analysis. As a result, the performance of the algorithm was evaluated and sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were determined as 95.74%, 98.08% and 97.76%, respectively.

Used as interfaces and clinical tools, electroencephalography (EEG) techniques measure voltage fluctuations resulting from neurons and electrical activity in the brain and associated circuits. To allow, web-based and easy to use EEG analysis software, we have developed an online platform to perform EEG data analysis and to verify recorded data. The data analysis platform was implemented with Jinja and MNE-Python tools allowing scalable and reasonably fast browser-based access to processing EEG datasets. With exporting datasets, setting markers to time and frequency domain analysis, the web-based platform allows users to perform rhythmic classification and topographical visualization of EEG spectrum in numerical and graphical formats for easy exploration by clinicians and data scientists.

Surrogate-Based Artifact Removal From Single-Channel EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artifact removal; electroencephalography (EEG); single-channel EEG; surrogate data; wavelet decomposition	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; TIME-SERIES; PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS; MUSCLE ARTIFACTS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; TOOL	Objective: the recent emergence and success of electroencephalography (EEG) in low-cost portable devices, has opened the door to a new generation of applications processing a small number of EEG channels for health monitoring and brain-computer interfacing. These recordings are, however, contaminated by many sources of noise degrading the signals of interest, thus compromising the interpretation of the underlying brain state. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven algorithm to effectively remove ocular and muscular artifacts from single-channel EEG: the surrogate-based artifact removal (SuBAR). Methods: by means of the time-frequency analysis of surrogate data, our approach is able to identify and filter automatically ocular and muscular artifacts embedded in single-channel EEG. Results: in a comparative study using artificially contaminated EEG signals, the efficacy of the algorithm in terms of noise removal and signal distortion was superior to other traditionally-employed single-channel EEG denoizing techniques: wavelet thresholding and the canonical correlation analysis combined with an advanced version of the empirical mode decomposition. Even in the presence of mild and severe artifacts, our artifact removal method provides a relative error 4 to 5 times lower than traditional techniques. Significance: in view of these results, the SuBAR method is a promising solution for mobile environments, such as ambulatory healthcare systems, sleep stage scoring, or anesthesia monitoring, where very few EEG channels or even a single channel is available.

In this report, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals evoked by acupuncture at ST36 acupoint with three stimulus frequencies of 50, 100 and 200 times per minutes, and selected non-acupuncture EEGs as the control group. Multiscale analyses were introduced to investigate the possible acupuncture effects on complexity and power in multiscale level. Using multiscale weighted-permutation entropy, we found the significant effects on increased complexity degree in EEG signals induced by acupuncture. The comparison of three stimulation manipulations showed that 100 times/min generated most obvious effects, and affected most cortical regions. By estimating average power spectral density, we found decreased power induced by acupuncture. The joint distribution of entropy and power indicated an inverse correlation, and this relationship was weakened by acupuncture effects, especially under the manipulation of 100 times/min frequency. Above findings are more evident and stable in large scales than small scales, which suggests that multiscale analysis allows evaluating significant effects in specific scale and enables to probe the inherent characteristics underlying physiological signals.

Extreme events in epileptic EEG of rodents after ischemic stroke	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS			English	Article							SLEEP SPINDLES; DYNAMICS; SEIZURE; TIME; FREQUENCY; RATS	Extreme events are observed on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of rodents with induced ischemic stroke. These events represent themselves as post-stroke epileptic seizures in the form of spontaneous high-amplitude oscillations, which appear during the first 2-3 h after induced focal cerebral ischemia. The analysis of the EEG time-frequency structure reveals these extreme events as a sharp sudden growth of the wavelet energy in a particular frequency band, while the energy in the resting part of the power spectrum remains normal. The distinguished features of the extreme events are used for detection and quantification of the pathological brain activity.	[Pisarchik, A. N.; Grubov, V. V.; Maksimenko, V. A.; Frolov, N.

Moving Beyond ERP Components: A Selective Review of Approaches to Integrate EEG and Behavior	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						EEG; ERP; blind source separation; partial least squares; canonical correlations analysis; representational similarity analysis; deep learning; hierarchical Bayesian model	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN NETWORKS; ALPHA RHYTHMS; FMRI; FUSION; ATTENTION	Relationships between neuroimaging measures and behavior provide important clues about brain function and cognition in healthy and clinical populations. While electroencephalography (EEG) provides a portable, low cost measure of brain dynamics, it has been somewhat underrepresented in the emerging field of model-based inference. We seek to address this gap in this article by highlighting the utility of linking EEG and behavior, with an emphasis on approaches for EEG analysis that move beyond focusing on peaks or "components" derived from averaging EEG responses across trials and subjects (generating the event-related potential, ERP). First, we review methods for deriving features from EEG in order to enhance the signal within single-trials. These methods include filtering based on user-defined features (i.e., frequency decomposition, time-frequency decomposition), filtering based on data-driven properties (i.e., blind source separation, BSS), and generating more abstract representations of data (e.g., using deep learning). We then review cognitive models which extract latent variables from experimental tasks, including the drift diffusion model (DDM) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Next, we discuss ways to access associations among these measures, including statistical models, data-driven joint models and cognitive joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). We think that these methodological tools are likely to contribute to theoretical advancements, and will help inform our understandings of brain dynamics that contribute to moment-to-moment cognitive function.

The first objective is to discover how post-cue frequency band oscillations of EEG, as neural index of attention, are correlated with elderly response time (RT), as behavioral index of attention. Furthermore, we aim to detect the most informative period of brain activity (EEG) in which the strongest correlations with reaction time exist. Our results show that 1) there is significant negative correlation between alpha gamma ratio (AGR) and response time (p<0.0001), 2) theta beta ratio (TBR) is positively correlated with subjects' response time (p<0.0001) and 3) these correlations are stronger in a 500ms period right after triggering the cue (question onset in Stroop test). Our study provides an insight into the research on analysis and prediction of subject behavior from EEG. Moreover, it has potential to be used in implementation of feasible and efficient single channel EEG-based brain computer interface (BCI) training systems for elderly.

According to the theoretical bases for how humans can predict the preference of others, one tends to estimate the other's preference using a perceived difference between the other and self. Previous neuroimaging studies have revealed that the network of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is related to the ability of predicting others' preference. However, it still remains unknown about the temporal patterns of neural activities for others' preference prediction through thin-slicing. To investigate such temporal aspects of neural activities, we investigated human electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during the task of predicting the preference of others while only a facial picture of others was provided. Twenty participants (all female, average age: 21.86) participated in the study. In each trial of the task, participants were shown a picture of either a target person or self for 3 s, followed by the presentation of a movie poster over which participants predicted the target person's preference as liking or disliking. The time-frequency EEG analysis was employed to analyze temporal changes in the amplitudes of brain oscillations. Participants could predict others' preference for movies with accuracy of 56.89 +/- 3.16% and 10 out of 20 participants exhibited prediction accuracy higher than a chance level (95% interval). There was a significant difference in the power of the parietal alpha(10 similar to 13 Hz) oscillation 0.6 similar to 0.8 s after the onset of poster presentation between the cases when participants predicted others' preference and when they reported self preference (p < 0.05). The power of brain oscillations at any frequency band and time period during the trial did not show a significant correlation with individual prediction accuracy. However, when we measured differences of the power between the trials of predicting other's preference and reporting self-preference, the right temporal beta oscillations 1.6 similar to 1.8 s after the onset of facial picture presentation exhibited a significant correlation with individual accuracy. Our results suggest that right temporoparietal beta oscillations may be correlated with one's ability to predict what others prefer with minimal information.

They communicate about abstract information by referring to gestures that are clearly concrete (e.g., raising a hand for "the level of the football game is high"). To understand MP co-speech gestures, a multisensory integration at semantic level is necessary between abstract speech and concrete gestures. While semantic gesture-speech integration has been extensively investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging, evidence from electroencephalography (EEG) is rare. In the current study, we set out an EEG experiment, investigating the processing of MP vs. iconic (IC) co-speech gestures in different contexts, to reveal the oscillatory signature of MP gesture integration. German participants (n = 20) viewed video clips with an actor performing both types of gestures, accompanied by either comprehensible German or incomprehensible Russian (R) speech, or speaking German sentences without any gestures. Time-frequency analysis of the EEG data showed that, when gestures were accompanied by comprehensible German speech, MP gestures elicited decreased gamma band power (50-70 Hz) between 500 and 700 ms in the parietal electrodes when compared to IC gestures, and the source of this effect was localized to the right middle temporal gyrus. This difference is likely to reflect integration processes, as it was reduced in the R language and no-gesture conditions. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence suggesting the functional relationship between gamma band oscillations and higher-level semantic processes in a multisensory setting.

Identifying the relationship between oscillatory dynamics and event-related responses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Semantics; Syntax; EEG; Oscillatory dynamics; Event related potentials	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; LEVEL LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; THETA-POWER INCREASES; SYNTACTIC ANOMALIES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; EEG-DATA; POTENTIALS; VIOLATIONS; BETA	Event related potentials (ERPs) and time frequency analysis of the EEG can identify the temporally distinct coordination of groups of neurons across brain regions during sentence processing. Although there are strong arguments that ERP components and neural oscillations are driven by the same changes in the neural signal, others argue that the lack of clear associations between the two suggests oscillatory dynamics are more than just time frequency representations of ERP components, making it unclear how the two are related. The current study seeks to examine the neural activity underlying auditory sentence processing of both semantic and syntactic errors to clarify if ERP and time frequency analyses identify the same or unique neural responses. Thirty-nine adults completed an auditory semantic judgment task and a grammaticality judgment task. As expected, the semantic judgment task elicited a larger N400 and greater increase in theta power for semantic errors compared to correct sentences and the syntactic judgment task elicited a greater P600 and beta power decrease for both grammatical error types compared to syntactically correct sentences. Importantly, we identified a significant relationship between the N400 and P600 ERPs and theta and beta oscillatory dynamics during semantic and syntactic processing. These findings suggest that ERPs and neural oscillations measure similar neural processes; however, unaccounted for variance may indicate that neural oscillations provide additional information regarding fluctuations in power within a given frequency band. Future studies that vary semantic and syntactic complexity are necessary to understand the cognitive processes that are indexed by these oscillations.

We describe the application of a novel method for measuring musicians' interbrain synchrony: amplitude envelope correlations (AECs). Amplitude envelopes (AEs) reflect energy fluctuations in cortical oscillations over time; AE correlations measure the degree to which two envelope fluctuations are temporally correlated, such as cortical oscillations arising from two individuals performing a joint action. Wireless electroencephalography was recorded from two pianists performing a musical duet; an analysis pipeline is described for computing AEs of cortical oscillations at the duet performance frequency (number of tones produced per second) to test whether these oscillations reflect the temporal dynamics of partners' performances. The pianists' AE correlations were compared with correlations based on a distribution of AEs simulated from white noise signals using the same methods. The AE method was also applied to the temporal characteristics of the pianists' performances, to show that the observed pair's AEs reflect the temporal dynamics of their performance. AE correlations offer a promising approach for assessing interbrain correspondences in cortical activity associated with performing joint tasks.

For this purpose, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) was adopted to carry out a 13-week 26-session NFB training of 49 volunteers in the upper-alpha (UA) band (8 similar to 13Hz). To assess the electroencephalography (EEG) changes, each session was designed with five training trials (4min/trail), a pre-EEG screening and a post-EEG screening. The experimental results show that all participants significantly enhanced the UA band in task-related EEG within the training sessions. This proves that the NFB training intervention is effective in improving such functions as work ethic, attention, memory, efficiency, and work execution. Suffice it to say this research provides new insights into job stress relief of financial employees.

Alignment of alpha-band desynchronization with syntactic structure predicts successful sentence comprehension	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Language; Neural oscillations; Subsequent memory paradigm; Computational modeling	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; LINGUISTIC COMPLEXITY; WAVELET ANALYSIS	Sentence comprehension requires the encoding of phrases and their relationships into working memory. To date, despite the importance of neural oscillations in language comprehension, the neural-oscillatory dynamics of sentence encoding are only sparsely understood. Although oscillations in a wide range of frequency bands have been reported both for the encoding of unstructured word lists and for working-memory intensive sentences, it is unclear to what extent these frequency bands subserve processes specific to the working-memory component of sentence comprehension or to general verbal working memory. In our auditory electroencephalography study, we isolated the working-memory component of sentence comprehension by adapting a subsequent memory paradigm to sentence comprehension and assessing oscillatory power changes during successful sentence encoding. Time-frequency analyses and source reconstruction revealed alpha-power desynchronization in left-hemispheric language-relevant regions during successful sentence encoding. We further showed that sentence encoding was more successful when source-level alpha-band desynchronization aligned with computational measures of syntactic-compared to lexical-semantic-difficulty. Our results are a preliminary indication of a domain-general mechanism of cortical disinhibition via alpha-band desynchronization superimposed onto the language-relevant cortex, which is beneficial for encoding sentences into working memory.

Bruce			Remifentanil and Nitrous Oxide Anesthesia Produces a Unique Pattern of EEG Activity During Loss and Recovery of Response	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						remifentanil; nitrous oxide; anesthesia; electroencephalography (EEG); consciousness	BISPECTRAL INDEX; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; END-POINTS; SOLE AGENT; FREQUENCY; SEDATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INDUCTION; INFUSIONS; PHARMACOKINETICS	Nitrous oxide (N2O) and remifentanil (remi) are used along with other anesthetic and adjuvant agents for routine surgical anesthesia, yet the electroencephalogram (EEG) changes produced by this combination are poorly described. N2O administered alone produces EEG spectral characteristics that are distinct from most hypnotics. Furthermore, EEG frequency-derived trends before and after clinically relevant time points vary depending on N2O concentration. Remifentanil typically increases low frequency and decreases high frequency activity in the EEG, but how it influences N2O's EEG effect is not known. Previous attempts to characterize EEG signals of patients anesthetized with N2O using frequency-derived measures have shown conflicts and inconsistencies. Thus, in addition to determining the spectral characteristics of this unique combination, we also test whether a newly proposed characterization of time-delayed embeddings of the EEG signal tracks loss and recovery of consciousness significantly at clinically relevant time points. We retrospectively investigated the effects of remi and N2O on EEG signals recorded from 32 surgical patients receiving anesthesia for elective abdominal surgeries. Remifentanil and N2O (66%) were co-administered during the procedures. Patients were tested for loss and recovery of response (ROR) to verbal stimuli after induction and upon cessation of anesthesia, respectively. We found that the addition of remifentanil to N2O anesthesia improves the ability of traditional frequency-derived measures, including the Bispectral Index (BIS), to discriminate between loss and ROR.

Multi-band component analysis for EEG artifact removal and source reconstruction with application to gamma-band activity	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						artifacts; EEG; filtering; ICA; MEG; PCA; time-course	EYE-MOVEMENT ARTIFACT; SOURCE SEPARATION; ICA; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; MEG; EMG	Independent component analysis (ICA) has been used extensively for artifact removal and reconstruction of neuronal time-courses in electroencephalography (EEG). Typically, ICA is applied on wide-band EEG (for example 1 to 100 Hz or similar ranges). EEG captures the activities of a large number of sources and the as the number of the components separated by the ICA is limited by the number of the sensors, only the stronger sources (in terms of magnitude and duration) will be detected by the ICA, and the activity of weaker sources will be lost or scattered amongst the stronger components. Because of the 1/f nature of the EEG spectra this biases components to the lower frequency ranges. Here we used multi-band ICA; a versatile combination of a filter bank, PCA, and ICA, to increase the number of the ICA components substantially and improve the SNR of the separated components. Using band-pass filtering we break the original signal mixture into several subbands, then using PCA we reduce the dimensionality of each subband, before applying ICA to a matrix containing all the principal components from each band. Using simulated sources and real EEG from participants, we demonstrate that multi-band ICA is able to outperform the traditional wide-band ICA in terms of both signal-to-noise ratio of the separated sources and the number of the identified independent components. We successfully separated the gamma-band neuronal components that were time-locked to a visual stimulus, as well as weak sources which are not detectable by wide-band ICA.

Subjects and methods: The participants were 21 children (11 boys, 10 girls; age ranging from 5 months to 17 years 2 months) with myoclonic seizures associated with generalized (poly)spike-wave bursts in the ictal EEG data. The patients had heterogeneous etiologies and epilepsy diagnoses. In the ictal data, we detected FOs that clearly showed oscillatory morphology in filtered EEG traces and an outstanding spectral blob in time-frequency analysis. Results: We identified FOs in 61 (88.4%) of all 69 myoclonic seizures. Every patient had at least one myoclonic seizure-associated FO. The observed FOs were embedded in the spike component of (poly)spike-wave discharges, and they had a focal distribution with frontal predominance. They ranged in frequency from 41.0 to 123.0 Hz and involved both the gamma and ripple bands, and their spectral peak frequencies were higher in the group of patients with a genetic background free of apparent fundamental brain pathology than in the group of other patients (p = 0.019). Conclusion: FOs were found to represent at least part of the cortical pathophysiological process in the generation of myoclonic seizures that should involve the thalamocortical network system.

The proposed system is able to provide stable performances regardless their intrinsic features of drivers and is suitable for embedded implementation. This approach is based on spectral analysis where a new set of features is extracted from an electroencephalography (EEG) recording based on the analysis of sub-bands of 1 Hz. In this work, the alpha sub-band is represented by only one frequency, i.e., the individual alpha frequency, instead of using the entire sub-band from 8 to 12 Hz. The use of this frequency as a representative feature helps to overcome the problem of interpersonal variability between different persons. Furthermore, we have reduced the EEG feature size while maintaining the accuracy at its highest level. By combining the reduction in the number of features with the use of only one differential EEG channel, we have succeeded in developing a more suitable system with good accuracy. In order to verify the performance of our approach, the proposed EEG-based signal processing technique was simulated and tested under Matlab using an existing offline database (MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database Physiobank); consequently, it provides better drowsiness detection performance than similar published works with an average accuracy of approximately 88.80%. Furthermore, we have implemented our proposed architecture in an ARM based processor platform to complete our virtual prototyping and to get a real evaluation of our drowsiness system architecture. Such system is able to process an epoch of 30 s within 0.2 s. The proposed approach should be easily and efficiently handled by a driver to be warned against any risk from potential drowsiness in real-time. Obtained results show that the proposed system provides a short processing time while maintaining a high performance in term of classification accuracy.

Nevertheless, several studies have characterized cognitive functions as synchronized brain networks depending on the underlying neural interactions. As a result, connectivity analysis provides essential information for improving both the interpretation and interpretability of brain functionality under specific tasks. In this research, we perform functional connectivity analysis by measuring the stability of the phase difference between EEG channels, aiming to include synchronization patterns for studying the brain reaction to cognitive stimulus. Experiments are carried out in subjects responding to an oddball paradigm. Results show statistical differences between target and non-target labels, making the proposed methodology a suitable alternative to support cognitive neuro-physiologic al applications.

Functional brain connectivity analysis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: an EEG source-space study	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						source EEG; connectivity; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	CORTEX; SYSTEM; SCALE	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease, which affects domains outside of the motor system. Recent findings have suggested that scalp electroencephalography (EEG) analysis may represent a useful tool for the monitoring of the disease. Here, we investigated functional connectivity in a set of ALS patients using source-reconstructed EEG time series comparing the results to age-matched healthy controls. Source based functional connectivity was estimated using a measure of amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) after performing orthogonalisation procedure in the time domain. The results of this study show that alpha band functional connectivity at source level discloses different patterns of inter-regional synchronization in ALS patients compared to healthy subjects. These findings suggest that ALS induces a strong frequency-specific reduction of functional connectivity patterns and that these changes are not limited to motor connections.

Clinically, sleep apnea events can be monitored and manually scored from whole-night polysomnography by specialists. However, this task tends to be time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an automatic sleep apnea detection scheme using single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The segmented EEG signals with a length of 30-second are firstly filtered by a band-pass filter to denoise. A short time Fourier transform is then used to generate the time-frequency images from corresponding EEG signals. A multi-scale parallel convolutional neural network with mixed depth of layers and mixed sizes of convolutional filters is designed to automatically learn the features from time-frequency representations and make the classification between sleep apnea periods and other periods. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art works. This method provides the possibility to record and analyze the sleep apnea automatically in sleep monitoring.

J	Kalfaoglu, C; Stafford, T; Milne, E				Kalfaoglu, Cigir; Stafford, Tom; Milne, Elizabeth			Frontal Theta Band Oscillations Predict Error Correction and Posterror Slowing in Typing	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						theta; ERN; error awareness; hierarchical control; typing	BRAIN POTENTIALS; CINGULATE CORTEX; NEURAL SYSTEM; EEG DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; CONFLICT; MECHANISMS; TIME; AWARENESS; RECOGNITION	Performance errors are associated with robust behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) effects. However, there is a debate about the nature of the relationship between these effects and implicit versus explicit error awareness. Our aim was to study the relationship between error related electrophysiological effects, such as spectral perturbations in fronto-medial theta band oscillations (FMT), and error awareness in typing. Typing has an advantage as an experimental paradigm in that detected errors are quickly and habitually signaled by the participant using backspace, allowing separation of detected from undetected errors without interruption in behavior. Typing is thought to be controlled hierarchically via inner and outer loops, which rely on different sources for error detection. Touch-typist participants were asked to copy-type 100 sentences as EEG was recorded in the absence of visual feedback. Continuous EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA). Time-frequency and ERP analyses were applied to emergent independent components. The results show that single-trial FMT parameters and error related negativity (ERN) amplitude predict overt, adaptive posterror actions such as error correction via backspace; and, posterror slowing, reflecting implicit error awareness. In addition, we found that those uncorrected errors which were slowed down the most were also the ones associated with a high level of FMT activity. Our results as a whole show that FMT are related to neural mechanisms involved in explicit awareness of errors, and input from inner loop is sufficient for error correction in typing. Public Significance Statement We investigated the patterns of brain activity associated with errors and error-correction during skilled typing. This is interesting because it tests how theories of action and error-monitoring apply in a domain where actions are made extremely rapidly (up to 10 keys per second). Electroencephalography (EEG) allows us to identify signature changes which have previously been associated with error-related processes in the brain. We showed that 2 of these signature patterns, the "error related negativity" (ERN) and "fronto-medial theta band oscillations" (FMT), both predict whether a typist is likely to notice and correct an error they make, as well as predicting how much typing slows down after an uncorrected error. The results support the idea-which has been contested-that the ERN reflects our explicit recognition that we have made a mistake.

An increase in the complexity of the signals would confirm an improvement in the general state of the patient. Methods: We review the Renyi entropy based on time-frequency representations, along with its time-varying version. We also discuss the entropy based on singular value decomposition computed from a time-frequency representation, and introduce its corresponding time-dependant version. We test these quantities on synthetic data. Friedman tests are used to confirm the differences between signals (before and after proper medication). Principal component analysis is used for dimensional reduction prior to a simple threshold discrimination. Results: Experimental results show a consistent increase in complexity measures in the different regions of the brain. These findings suggest that extracted features can be used to monitor treatment. When combined, they are useful for classification purposes, with areas under ROC curves higher than 0.93 in some regions. Conclusion: Here we applied time-frequency complexity measures to resting state EEG signals from epileptic patients for the first time. We also introduced a new time-varying complexity measure. We showed that these features are able to evaluate the treatment of the patient, and to perform classification. Significance: The time-frequency complexities, and their time-varying versions, can be used to monitor the treatment of epileptic patients. They could be applied to a wider range of problems.

Electroencephalography (EEG) and analysis of sleep-wake vigilance states provide important insights into the function of the normal and diseased immature brain. While developmental changes in EEG and vigilance states are well-described in people, less is known about the normal maturational properties of rodent EEG, including the emergence and evolution of sleep-awake vigilance states. In particular, a number of developmental EEG studies have been performed in rats, but there is limited comparable research in neonatal mice, especially as it pertains to longitudinal EEG studies performed within the same mouse. In this study, we have attempted to provide a relatively comprehensive assessment of developmental changes in EEG background activity and vigilance states in wild-type mice from postnatal days 9-21. A novel EEG and EMG method allowed serial recording from the same mouse pups. EEG continuity and power and vigilance states were analyzed by quantitative assessment and fast Fourier transforms. During this developmental period, we demonstrate the timing of maturational changes in EEG background continuity, frequencies, and power and the emergence of identifiable wake, NREM, and REM sleep states. These results should serve as important control data for physiological studies of mouse models of normal brain development and neurological disease.

J	Ou, JH; Law, SP				Ou, Jinghua; Law, Sam-Po			Induced gamma oscillations index individual differences in speech sound perception and production	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Neural oscillations; Speech perception; Speech production; Individual differences; Induced gamma oscillations	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; THETA OSCILLATION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; BAND ACTIVITY; RESPONSES; DISCRIMINATION; EEG; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; REFLECTS	Auditory neuroscience has provided strong evidence that neural oscillations synchronize to the rhythm of speech stimuli, and oscillations at different frequencies have been linked to processing of different language structures. The present study aims to examine how these ubiquitous neurophysiological attributes may inform us about the brain processes that underpin individual differences in speech perception and production, which in turn elucidate the specific functions of neural oscillations in the domain of speech processing. To this end, we recorded electrophysiological responses to a lexical tone contrast in a passive auditory oddball paradigm from two groups of healthy tone-language speakers who were equal in perceptual discriminability but differed in response latency and production distinctiveness of the tone contrast. Time-frequency analysis was applied to the EEG data, and decomposed into theta (4-7 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency bands. Results show that listeners with longer discrimination RT and less distinctive production showed significantly higher induced (non-phase-locked) gamma during tone processing. Moreover, among speakers with less distinctive production, individual differences in induced gamma were significantly correlated with discrimination latency and production distinction. Based on the present findings, we propose that differences in gamma oscillations reflect differential sensory/perceptual computations during acoustic encoding, impacting the quality of perceptual representations, which further mediates individual differences in speech perception and production.

This study uses electroencephalographic (EEG) variability and fuzzy theory to develop a lie detection model and rule set, identifying sensitive and useful EEG frequency bands to accurately measure lying states based on spectral analysis. Twenty subjects participated in card tests accompanied by EEG recording to evaluate the performance of the proposed model against other data mining methods. The result shows that our proposed model has a lie detection accuracy rate of 89.5% and compares well with other data mining methods. A mobile prototype for real-time lie detection is developed by integrating commercial brainwave measurement instruments with mobile devices. The proposed device can facilitate real-time and accurate polygraphy, while reducing the disadvantages of conventional lie detection approaches.

If consumers express a strong haptic preference for a consumer electronic product, they are more likely to purchase it. Hence, it is important to understand how consumers' haptic preference for consumer electronics is formed. Conventional paper-based methods may not provide sufficient information for this purpose, because they provide post-event (i.e., after haptic experience) and environment-dependent (i.e., depending on the manner of asking questions, the person asking the questions, and so on.) data. Therefore, the present study investigated haptic preferences for consumer electronics using neural responses during haptic experiences, which provide the advantage of observing changes while the user is manipulating the product and obtaining environment-independent data. We measured neural responses using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). Eighteen volunteers participated in the study and manipulated a haptic dial knob that generates four different haptic profiles; during the manipulation, their EEG signals were recorded. After experiencing different haptic profiles, participants reported their level of preference for each profile. The analysis of EEG revealed that frontal gamma oscillations correlate with the level of haptic preferences, with oscillations becoming stronger with increasing haptic preference. The highest correlation between frontal gamma power and haptic preference was found in the early period of the dial task. Therefore, the frontal gamma oscillation of the EEG may represent a neural correlate of the haptic preference and provides a neural basis for understanding this preference in relation to consumer electronics.

The focus to date has been on durations in the millisecond to seconds range, but here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine brain functional connectivity during much longer durations (i.e., 15 min). For this purpose, we conducted an initial exploratory experiment followed by a confirmatory experiment. Our results showed that those participants who overestimated time exhibited lower activity of beta (1830 Hz) at several electrode sites. Furthermore, graph theoretical analysis indicated significant differences in the beta range (15-30 Hz) between those that overestimated and underestimated time. Participants who underestimated time showed higher clustering coefficient compared to those that overestimated time. We discuss our results in terms of two aspects. FFT results, as a linear approach, are discussed within localized/dedicated models (i.e., scalar timing model). Second, non-localized properties of psychological interval timing (as emphasized by intrinsic models) are addressed and discussed based on results derived from graph theory. Results suggested that although beta amplitude in central regions (related to activity of BG-thalamocortical pathway as a dedicated module) is important in relation to timing mechanisms, the properties of functional activity of brain networks; such as the segregation of beta network, are also crucial for time perception. These results may suggest subjective time may be created by vector units instead of scalar ticks.

J	Huang, YL; Xie, JS; Wang, RM				Huang, Yanli; Xie, Jiushu; Wang, Ruiming			Electroencephalography delta, theta, and alpha oscillations in valence-space metaphorical associations	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						affective words; conceptual metaphor theory; electroencephalography; embodied cognition; event-related desynchronization; event-related synchronization; oscillations; valence-space associations	EEG; ATTENTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; LATERALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS	Conceptual metaphor theory holds that understanding abstract affective words relies on concrete spatial information, known as valence-space metaphorical associations. Previous studies show that these metaphorical associations are related to several event-related potentials. However, we know nothing about the neural oscillations underlying these associations. The present study adopted a priming paradigm and the electroencephalographic time-frequency analysis to reveal the brain oscillatory activities related to the processing of valence-space associations. In the experiment, participants first memorized a positive or a negative word. Then, a dot was presented at the higher or lower position of the screen and was horizontally centered. Participants detected the location of the cue and made behavioral responses while their brain electrical activities were recorded. Results found that (a) when participants memorized a negative word and judged the lower spatial cue, the power of the delta band was suppressed compared with memorizing a positive word; (b) when participants memorized a positive word and judged the higher spatial cue, the power of the theta band was suppressed compared with memorizing a negative word; (c) when participants memorized a negative word and judged the lower spatial cue, the power of the alpha band was suppressed compared with memorizing a positive word. These event-related desynchronization results suggest that the processing of valence-space associations is related to inhibition, attention, working memory, and semantic process. The present study provides the first evidence of cortical oscillations involved in conceptual metaphors.

To address this question, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to examine oscillatory activity over learning of different object sequences. Participants made semantic decisions on each object as they were presented in a continuous stream. For three "Consistent" sequences, the order of the objects was always fixed. Activity during Consistent sequences was compared to "Random" sequences that consisted of the same objects presented in a different order on each repetition. Over the course of learning, participants made faster semantic decisions to objects in Consistent, as compared to objects in Random sequences. Thus, participants were able to use sequence knowledge to predict upcoming items in Consistent sequences. EEG analyses revealed decreased oscillatory power in the theta (4-7 Hz) band at frontal sites following decisions about objects in Consistent sequences, as compared with objects in Random sequences. The theta power difference between Consistent and Random only emerged in the second half of the task, as participants were more effectively able to predict items in Consistent sequences. Moreover, we found increases in parieto-occipital alpha (10-13 Hz) and beta (14-28 Hz) power during the pre-response period for objects in Consistent sequences, relative to objects in Random sequences. Linear mixed effects modeling revealed that single trial theta oscillations were related to reaction time for future objects in a sequence, whereas beta and alpha oscillations were only predictive of reaction time on the current trial. These results indicate that theta and alpha/beta activity preferentially relate to future and current events, respectively. More generally our findings highlight the importance of band-specific neural oscillations in the learning of temporal order information.

Therefore, this research aims to build a sensory profile with the help of EEG biosignal potential to distinguish among different sensory responses. The EEG signals acquired in this research identify different emotional states such as positive-thinking or super-learning and light-relaxation and are within the frequency range of 8 - 12 Hertz. 64 children participated in this research among which 34 were children with ASD and 30 were normal children. The EEG data was recoded while all the children were provided with vestibular, visual, sound, taste and vestibular sensory stimulations. The raw EEG data was filtered with the help of independent component analysis (ICA) using wavelet transform and EEGLAB software. Later, for building the sensory profile, entropy approximation, means and standard deviations were extracted from the filtered EEG signals. Along with that, the filtered EEG data was also fed to a neural networks (NN) algorithm which was implemented in MATLAB. Results from the acquired EEG signals depicted that during the sensory stimulation phase, the responses of all autistic children were in an unstable state. These findings will equip and aid their learning strategy in the future.	[Sudirman, R.; Hussin, S. S.; Airij, Awais Gul; Hai, C.

Cortical Auditory-Evoked Responses in Preterm Neonates: Revisited by Spectral and Temporal Analyses	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						auditory-evoked potentials; Delta-brushes; early gamma oscillations; high-density EEG; preterm	SPONTANEOUS ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; DEVELOPING CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EARLY MOTOR-ACTIVITY; MONTHS POST TERM; SPINDLE BURSTS; TISSUE CONDUCTIVITY; ACTIVITY TRANSIENTS; NETWORK MECHANISMS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Characteristic preterm EEG patterns of "Delta-brushes" (DBs) have been reported in the temporal cortex following auditory stimuli, but their spatio-temporal dynamics remains elusive. Using 32-electrode EEG recordings and co-registration of electrodes' position to 3D-MRI of age-matched neonates, we explored the cortical auditory-evoked responses (AERs) after `click' stimuli in 30 healthy neonates aged 30-38 post-menstrual weeks (PMW). (1) We visually identified auditory-evoked DBs within AERs in all the babies between 30 and 33 PMW and a decreasing response rate afterwards. (2) The AERs showed an increase in EEG power from delta to gamma frequency bands over the middle and posterior temporal regions with higher values in quiet sleep and on the right. (3) Time-frequency and averaging analyses showed that the delta component of DBs, which negatively peaked around 550 and 750 ms over the middle and posterior temporal regions, respectively, was superimposed with fast (alpha-gamma) oscillations and corresponded to the late part of the cortical auditory-evoked potential (CAEP), a feature missed when using classical CAEP processing. As evoked DBs rate and AERs delta to alpha frequency power decreased until full term, auditory-evoked DBs are thus associated with the prenatal development of auditory processing and may suggest an early emerging hemispheric specialization.

Sleep Behavior and EEG Oscillations in Aged Dp(16)1Yey/+ Mice: A Down Syndrome Model	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Down syndrome; EEG; spectral power; Dp16; sleep; beta	OF-THE-LITERATURE; MOUSE MODEL; CHILDREN; DEFECTS; ABNORMALITIES; INDIVIDUALS; APNEA	Down syndrome (DS) results from the triplication of genes located on human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). Though many cognitive and behavioral impairments are associated with DS, sleep disturbances remain poorly understood despite being a reported phenotype in approximately 60% of individuals diagnosed with DS. In this study, sleep and electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations were recorded from aged (12-14mos.) Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice (Dp16), a mouse model of DS. We observed disrupted sleep demonstrated by increased activity during the dark phase and increased time awake at the expense of NREM sleep compared to wild-type mice. In addition, we found that Dp16 mice display significant differences in relative EEG power distribution among oscillation frequencies in both sleep and awake states. These results in Dp16 mice are consistent with sleep disturbances found in individuals with DS, and the abnormal EEG oscillations in aged Dp16 mice suggest a potential role for GABAergic activity in these sleep and EEG abnormalities. These sleep and EEG data reflect underlying differences in neuronal activity at the network level and thus are causative agents rather than merely symptoms of DS. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Low- and high-frequency cortical brain oscillations reflect dissociable mechanisms of concurrent speech segregation in noise	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Time-frequency analysis; Double-vowel segregation; F0-benefit; Speech-in-noise perception	WORKING-MEMORY; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; PERCEPTUAL SEPARATION; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; NORMAL-HEARING; VOWEL SOUNDS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTEX; GAMMA	Parsing simultaneous speech requires listeners use pitch-guided segregation which can be affected by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the auditory scene. The interaction of these two cues may occur at multiple levels within the cortex. The aims of the current study were to assess the correspondence between oscillatory brain rhythms and determine how listeners exploit pitch and SNR cues to successfully segregate concurrent speech. We recorded electrical brain activity while participants heard double-vowel stimuli whose fundamental frequencies (F0s) differed by zero or four semitones (STs) presented in either clean or noise-degraded (+5 dB SNR) conditions. We found that behavioral identification was more accurate for vowel mixtures with larger pitch separations but F0 benefit interacted with noise. Time-frequency analysis decomposed the EEG into different spectrotemporal frequency bands. Low-frequency (theta, beta) responses were elevated when speech did not contain pitch cues (OST > 4ST) or was noisy, suggesting a correlate of increased listening effort and/or memory demands. Contrastively, gamma power increments were observed for changes in both pitch (OST > 4ST) and SNR (clean > noise), suggesting high-frequency bands carry information related to acoustic features and the quality of speech representations. Brain-behavior associations corroborated these effects; modulations in low-frequency rhythms predicted the speed of listeners' perceptual decisions with higher bands predicting identification accuracy. Results are consistent with the notion that neural oscillations reflect both automatic (pre-perceptual) and controlled (post-perceptual) mechanisms of speech processing that are largely divisible into high- and low-frequency bands of human brain rhythms.

A total of 66 undergraduate students' EEG were collected while they participated in a chemistry-related decision-making task in which they had to retrieve the relevant chemistry concepts in order to make correct decisions for each task item. The results showed that it was only in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) cluster that distinct patterns in EEG dynamics were displayed for the correct and incorrect responses. The logistic regression results indicated that ACC theta power from 300 ms to 250 ms before stimulus onset was the most informative factor for estimating the likelihood of making correct decisions in the chemistry-related decision-making task, while it was the ACC low beta power from 150 ms to 250 ms after stimulus onset. The results suggested that the ACC theta augmentation before the stimulus onset serves to actively maintain the relevant information for retrieval from long-term memory, while the ACC low beta augmentation after the stimulus onset may serve the function of mapping the encoded stimulus onto the relevant criteria that the given participant has held within his or her mind to guide the decision-making responses.

A number of automated detection algorithms have been developed for reliable analysis of invasively recorded HFOs. However, invasive recordings are not widely applicable since they bear risks and costs, and the harm of the surgical intervention of implantation needs to be weighted against the informational benefits of the invasive examination. In contrast, scalp EEG is widely available at low costs and does not bear any risks. However, the detection of HFOs on the scalp represents a challenge that was taken on so far mostly via visual detection. Visual detection of HFOs is, in turn, highly time-consuming and subjective. In this review, we discuss that automated detection algorithms for detection of HFOs on the scalp are highly warranted because the available algorithms were all developed for invasively recorded EEG and do not perform satisfactorily in scalp EEG because of the low signal-to-noise ratio and numerous artefacts as well as physiological activity that obscures the tiny phenomena in the high-frequency range.

Furthermore, most of the emotion-based studies have used single stimuli to evoke emotions. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes multi modal emotion elicitation paradigm to investigate if same signatures of emotions exist if induced by using different methods of elicitation. The proposed method attempts to analyse Electroencephalography (EEG) data of healthy human subjects to recognize emotions using three different ways of elicitation. Emotional imagery is one of the proposed methods. Furthermore, audio-video clips and immersive videos on Virtual reality headsets are other two stimuli proposed for evoking emotions. Initially, experiments based on emotional imagery have been conducted with eight participants. The recorded EEG data is time sampled with 1 s time window and bandpass filtered in different frequency bands of Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Low and High Gamma. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classified these features in two different classes of fear vs. neutral. Findings revealed that gamma band has achieved highest classification performance amongst other bands. This is in consistent with other studies related to emotion recognition. Outcome of the proposed work is a prototype of EEG based BCI system for emotion recognition using multi-modal elicitation methods. Initially, as mentioned before EEG data recorded based on emotional imagery was analysed. In the next phase of this study, experiments using audio-video clips and immersive videos will be conducted.

Sleep and EEG Power Spectral Analysis in Three Transgenic Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease: APP/PS1, 3xTgAD, and Tg2576	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; dementia; EEG; sleep; transgenic mice	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; QUANTITATIVE EEG; MIDDLE YEARS; MICE; MEMORY; BETA; DEMENTIA; AGE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PREDICTION	Background: Sleep disturbances have long been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there is a growing interest in how these disturbances might impact AD pathophysiology. Despite this growing interest, surprisingly little is known about how sleep architecture and the broader neuronal network are affected in widely used transgenic mouse models of AD. Objective: We analyzed sleep and electroencephalography (EEG) power in three transgenic mouse models of AD, using identical and commercially available hardware and analytical software. The goal was to assess the suitability of these mouse lines to model sleep and the broader neuronal network dysfunction measured by EEG in AD. Methods: Tg2576, APP/PS1, and 3xTgAD transgenic AD mice were studied using in vivo EEG recordings for sleep/wake time and power spectral analysis. Results: Both the APP/PS1 model at 8-10 months and the Tg2576 model at 12 months of age exhibited stage-dependent decreases in theta and delta power, and shifts in the power spectra toward higher frequencies. Stage-dependent power spectral analyses showed no changes in the 3xTgAD model at 18 months of age. The percentage of time spent awake, in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), or in rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM) was not different between genotypes in any of the transgenic lines. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with data from several other transgenic AD models as well as certain studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Further studies will be needed to better understand the correlation between EEG spectra and AD pathophysiology, both in AD models and the human condition.

The stress is classified using a correlation-based feature subset selection method that efficiently reduces the feature vector length. In this study, twenty-eight participants are involved by filling in the perceived stress scale-10 (PSS-10) questionnaire and their EEG is also recorded in closed eye condition to measure the baseline stress. The recorded data is labelled on the basis of the stress level that is indicated by the participant's PSS score. The feature selection method has shown that, among the EEG oscillations, low beta, high beta, and low gamma are the most significant neural oscillations for classifying human stress. The proposed method not only reduces the time to build a classification model but also improves the classification accuracy up to 78.57% using a single channel wearable EEG device.

IAF has been linked with trait-like differences in information processing and general intelligence, and provides an empirical basis for the definition of individualized frequency bands. Despite its widespread application, however, there is little consensus on the optimal method for estimating IAF, and many common approaches are prone to bias and inconsistency. Here, we describe an automated strategy for deriving two of the most prevalent IAF estimators in the literature: peak alpha frequency (PAF) and center of gravity (CoG). These indices are calculated from resting-state power spectra that have been smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (SGF). We evaluate the performance characteristics of this analysis procedure in both empirical and simulated EEG data sets. Applying the SGF technique to resting-state data from n=63 healthy adults furnished 61 PAF and 62 CoG estimates. The statistical properties of these estimates were consistent with previous reports. Simulation analyses revealed that the SGF routine was able to reliably extract target alpha components, even under relatively noisy spectral conditions. The routine consistently outperformed a simpler method of automated peak detection that did not involve spectral smoothing. The SGF technique is fast, open source, and available in two popular programming languages (MATLAB, Python), and thus can easily be integrated within the most popular M/EEG toolsets (EEGLAB, FieldTrip, MNE-Python). As such, it affords a convenient tool for improving the reliability and replicability of future IAF-related research.

From ERPs to MVPA Using the Amsterdam Decoding and Modeling Toolbox (ADAM)	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MVPA; temporal generalization; decoding; EEG signal processing; time-frequency analysis; ERPs	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; MULTIVARIATE PATTERN-ANALYSIS; ATTENTIONAL SELECTION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; TEMPORAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ROC CURVE; EEG-DATA; BRAIN; REPRESENTATIONS	In recent years, time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has gained much popularity in the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. However, MVPA may appear daunting to those who have been applying traditional analyses using event-related potentials (ERPs) or event-related fields (ERFs). To ease this transition, we recently developed the Amsterdam Decoding and Modeling (ADAM) toolbox in MATLAB. ADAM is an entry-level toolbox that allows a direct comparison of ERP/ERF results to MVPA results using any dataset in standard EEGLAB or Fieldtrip format. The toolbox performs and visualizes multiple-comparison corrected group decoding and forward encoding results in a variety of ways, such as classifier performance across time, temporal generalization (time-by-time) matrices of classifier performance, channel tuning functions (CTFs) and topographical maps of (forward-transformed) classifier weights. All analyses can be performed directly on raw data or can be preceded by a time-frequency decomposition of the data in which case the analyses are performed separately on different frequency bands. The figures ADAM produces are publication-ready. In the current manuscript, we provide a cookbook in which we apply a decoding analysis to a publicly available MEG/EEG dataset involving the perception of famous, non-famous and scrambled faces. The manuscript covers the steps involved in single subject analysis and shows how to perform and visualize a subsequent group-level statistical analysis. The processing pipeline covers computation and visualization of group ERPs, ERP difference waves, as well as MVPA decoding results. It ends with a comparison of the differences and similarities between EEG and MEG decoding results. The manuscript has a level of description that allows application of these analyses to any dataset in EEGLAB or Fieldtrip format.	[Fahrenfort, Johannes J.; van Driel, Joram; Olivers, Christian N.

Evidence from electroencephalography (EEG) suggests that oscillations in the alpha and beta bands may support processes at different stages of GSI. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between electrophysiological oscillations and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity during GSI. In a simultaneous EEG-fMRI study, German participants (n=19) were presented with videos of an actor either performing meaningful gestures in the context of a comprehensible German (GG) or incomprehensible Russian sentence (GR), or just speaking a German sentence (SG). EEG results revealed reduced alpha and beta power for the GG vs. SG conditions, while fMRI analyses showed BOLD increase in the left pSTS/MTG for GG>GRGG>SG. In time-window-based EEG-informed fMRI analyses, we further found a positive correlation between single-trial alpha power and BOLD signal in the left pSTS/MTG, the left IFG, and several sub-cortical regions. Moreover, the alpha-pSTS/MTG correlation was observed in an earlier time window in comparison to the alpha-IFG correlation, thus supporting a two-stage processing model of GSI. Our study shows that EEG-informed fMRI implies multiple roles of alpha oscillations during GSI, and that the method is a best candidate for multidimensional investigations on complex cognitive functions such as GSI.

We improved classification performance by combining electroencephalogram (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals. GSR signals are preprocessed using by the zero-crossing rate. Sufficient EEG feature extraction can be obtained through CNN. Therefore, we propose a suitable CNN model for feature extraction by tuning hyper parameters in convolution filters. The EEG signal is preprocessed prior to convolution by a wavelet transform while considering time and frequency simultaneously. We use a database for emotion analysis using the physiological signals open dataset to verify the proposed process, achieving 73.4% accuracy, showing significant performance improvement over the current best practice models.

Spontaneous and noninvasive, Brain-Computer Interface based on motor imagery EEG signal can be applied more widely. This paper focuses on pattern recognition of EEG signal in Brain-Computer Interface based on the left-right hand motor imagery. Mental task among 5 subjects was processed to acquire motor imagery EEG signal. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, filters in time domain, frequency domain and special domain are applied in signal preprocess. Additionally, power spectral density (PSD) was extracted with sliding windows from processed signal as features for pattern recognition. Then the discriminate labels of motor imagery are trained by linear discriminate analysis (LDA) and random forest algorithm to decode the imagine pattern. The results show an average recognition accuracy of 0.65 +/- 0.07 for LDA and 0.70 +/- 0.05 for random forest can be obtained, which has significant difference with random level. From the results, it can be concluded that pattern of motor imagery can be decoded. In addition, a signal trial online pattern recognition task can be further implement to achieve human-computer interaction based on EEG signals.

Changes in neuronal oscillation amplitude across states of consciousness have been widely reported, but little is known about possible changes in the temporal dynamics of these oscillations. The temporal structure of brain oscillations may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness. To address this question, we examined long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG oscillation amplitudes recorded during both wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Importantly, the time-varying EEG oscillation envelopes were assessed over the course of a sevoflurane sedation protocol during which the participants alternated between states of consciousness and unconsciousness. Both spectral power and LRTC in oscillation amplitude were computed across multiple frequency bands. State-dependent differences in these features were assessed using non-parametric tests and supervised machine learning. We found that periods of unconsciousness were associated with increases in LRTC in beta (15-30Hz) amplitude over frontocentral channels and with a suppression of alpha (8-13Hz) amplitude over occipitoparietal electrodes. Moreover, classifiers trained to predict states of consciousness on single epochs demonstrated that the combination of beta LRTC with alpha amplitude provided the highest classification accuracy (above 80%). These results suggest that loss of consciousness is accompanied by an augmentation of temporal persistence in neuronal oscillation amplitude, which may reflect an increase in regularity and a decrease in network repertoire compared to the brain's activity during resting-state consciousness.

The electroencephalography (EEG) task engagement index (TEI), a ratio of EEG power bands (beta/(alpha + theta)), may be used to track how cognitively engaged a person is in a task. In the present study, we performed statistical tests of significance on task engagement indices computed from EEG recorded from six healthy participants who performed five separate cognitive tasks. For all participants, we found a statistically significant difference in task engagement indices between the five cognitive tasks. Also, we used task engagement indices as inputs to support vector machines (SVMs) to allow identification and offline classification of cognitive engagement. We designed six separate multiclass SVMs to classify five cognitive tasks for the participants. The average classification accuracy across the six participants was 93.33 +/- 8.16%. The results show that differences in cognitive task demand do elicit different degrees of cognitive engagement, which can be measured through the use of the TEI.	[Nuamah, J.

Approach: Sixty-three train drivers participated in the study, where 32-lead monopolar EEG data was recorded during a monotonous driving task. Participant sleepiness was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), the Karolinksa sleepiness scale (KSS) and the checklist of individual strength 20 (CIS20). Main results: Self-reported fatigue/sleepiness scores of the train driver cohort were primarily associated with EEG delta, theta, and alpha variables; however, some beta and gamma associations were also implicated. Furthermore, general linear models informed by these EEG variables were able to predict self-reported scores with varying degrees of success, representing between 48% and 54% of variance in fatigue scores. Significance: Self-reported fatigue/sleepiness scores of train drivers were predicted with varying degrees of success (dependent upon the self-reported fatigue/sleepiness measure) by alterations to monopolar delta, theta, and alpha band activity variables, indicating EEG as a potential indicator for fatigue/sleepiness in train drivers.

In classification paradigms, algorithms are developed that can distinguish between these processes. In this work, we apply tensor factorisation to a set of EEG data from a group of epileptic patients and factorise the data into three modes; space, time, and frequency with each mode containing a number of components or signatures. We train separate classifiers on various feature sets corresponding to complementary combinations of those modes and components and test the classification accuracy for each set. The relative influence on the classification accuracy of the respective spatial, temporal, or frequency signatures can then be analysed and useful interpretations can be made. Additionaly, we show that through tensor factorisation we can perform dimensionality reduction by evaluating the classification performance with regards to the number of components in each mode and also by rejecting components with insignificant contribution to the classification accuracy.

Effects of Cable Sway, Electrode Surface Area, and Electrode Mass on Electroencephalography Signal Quality during Motion	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; motion artifacts; electrode mass; electrode surface area; cable sway; signal to noise ratio; phantom head; locomotion	ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; WIRELESS EEG; WALKING; ARTIFACTS; HEAD; ACCELERATIONS; INTERFERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; ORIGIN; PELVIS	More neuroscience researchers are using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to measure electrocortical dynamics during human locomotion and other types of movement. Motion artifacts corrupt the EEG and mask underlying neural signals of interest. The cause of motion artifacts in EEG is often attributed to electrode motion relative to the skin, but few studies have examined EEG signals under head motion. In the current study, we tested how motion artifacts are affected by the overall mass and surface area of commercially available electrodes, as well as how cable sway contributes to motion artifacts. To provide a ground-truth signal, we used a gelatin head phantom with embedded antennas broadcasting electrical signals, and recorded EEG with a commercially available electrode system. A robotic platform moved the phantom head through sinusoidal displacements at different frequencies (0-2 Hz). Results showed that a larger electrode surface area can have a small but significant effect on improving EEG signal quality during motion and that cable sway is a major contributor to motion artifacts. These results have implications in the development of future hardware for mobile brain imaging with EEG.

The Harvard Automated Processing Pipeline for Electroencephalography (HAPPE): Standardized Processing Software for Developmental and High-Artifact Data	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; electroencephalography; automated; pipeline; artifact removal; data quality; EEG processing; development	EEG; RHYTHM	Electroenchephalography (EEG) recordings collected with developmental populations present particular challenges from a data processing perspective. These EEGs have a high degree of artifact contamination and often short recording lengths. As both sample sizes and EEG channel densities increase, traditional processing approaches like manual data rejection are becoming unsustainable. Moreover, such subjective approaches preclude standardized metrics of data quality, despite the heightened importance of such measures for EEGs with high rates of initial artifact contamination. There is presently a paucity of automated resources for processing these EEG data and no consistent reporting of data quality measures. To address these challenges, we propose the Harvard Automated Processing Pipeline for EEG (HAPPE) as a standardized, automated pipeline compatible with EEG recordings of variable lengths and artifact contamination levels, including high-artifact and short EEG recordings from young children or those with neurodevelopmental disorders. HAPPE processes event-related and resting-state EEG data from raw files through a series of filtering, artifact rejection, and re-referencing steps to processed EEG suitable for time-frequency-domain analyses. HAPPE also includes a post-processing report of data quality metrics to facilitate the evaluation and reporting of data quality in a standardized manner. Here, we describe each processing step in HAPPE, perform an example analysis with EEG files we have made freely available, and show that HAPPE outperforms seven alternative, widely-used processing approaches. HAPPE removes more artifact than all alternative approaches while simultaneously preserving greater or equivalent amounts of EEG signal in almost all instances. We also provide distributions of HAPPE's data quality metrics in an 867 file dataset as a reference distribution and in support of HAPPE's performance across EEG data with variable artifact contamination and recording lengths.

High similarity between EEG from subcutaneous and proximate scalp electrodes in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						long-term monitoring; subcutaneous EEG; temporal lobe epilepsy; ultra-long-term monitoring; wearable EEG	SUBDERMAL WIRE ELECTRODES; AMBULATORY EEG; EAR-EEG; SLEEP DISORDERS; MONITORING UNIT; CARE-UNIT; LONG-TERM; ACTIGRAPHY; SEIZURES; SYSTEM	Subcutaneous recording using electroencephalography (EEG) has the potential to enable ultra-long-term epilepsy monitoring in real-life conditions because it allows the patient increased mobility and discreteness. This study is the first to compare physiological and epileptiform EEG signals from subcutaneous and scalp EEG recordings in epilepsy patients. Four patients with probable or definite temporal lobe epilepsy were monitored with simultaneous scalp and subcutaneous EEG recordings. EEG recordings were compared by correlation and time-frequency analysis across an array of clinically relevant waveforms and patterns. We found high similarity between the subcutaneous EEG channels and nearby temporal scalp channels for most investigated electroencephalographic events. In particular, the temporal dynamics of one typical temporal lobe seizure in one patient were similar in scalp and subcutaneous recordings in regard to frequency distribution and morphology. Signal similarity is strongly related to the distance between the subcutaneous and scalp electrodes. On the basis of these limited data, we conclude that subcutaneous EEG recordings are very similar to scalp recordings in both time and time-frequency domains, if the distance between them is small. As many electroencephalographic events are local/ regional, the positioning of the subcutaneous electrodes should be considered carefully to reflect the relevant clinical question. The impact of implantation depth of the subcutaneous electrode on recording quality should be investigated further. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first publication comparing the detection of clinically relevant, pathological EEG features from a subcutaneous recording system designed for out-patient ultralong-term use to gold standard scalp EEG recordings. Our study shows that subcutaneous channels are very similar to comparable scalp channels, but also point out some issues yet to be resolved.

J	Gurve, D; Krishnan, S				Gurve, Dharmendra; Krishnan, Sridhar			Deep Learning of EEG Time-Frequency Representations for Identifying Eye States	ADVANCES IN DATA SCIENCE AND ADAPTIVE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Convolutional neural network; nonstationary signal; non-negative matrix factorization; time-frequency analysis	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; FEATURES	A new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify nonstationary biomedical signals using their time-frequency representations is proposed. The present method uses the spectrogram of the biomedical signals as an input to CNN, in addition Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) dictionary elements are used as an additional feature to improve the performance of the CNN model. Considering a number of applications involving eye state classification, such as in Parkinson's disease detection, analysis of eye fatigue in 3D TVs, driver's drowsiness detection, infant sleep-waking state identification, and classification of bipolar mood disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity, the proposed method was applied to Electroencephalography (EEG) data for classification of eye state. First, the spectrogram of EEG signal is obtained and used as an image input to CNN, simultaneously, the NMF feature is also fed to CNN. Further, both features are combined in fully connected layer of CNN architecture. The proposed method is compared with other existing methods for eye state detection and shows good classification accuracy with 96.16%. The prediction rate for the proposed method is 134 observations/second, which is suitable for brain-computer interface applications.

The authors explored the brain network revealed by these MI tasks using statistical analysis and the analysis of topologic characteristics, and observed significant differences in the reaction level, reaction time, and activated target during 4-class MI tasks. There was a great difference in the reaction level between the execution and resting states during different tasks: the reaction level of the left-hand MI task was the greatest, followed by that of the right-hand, feet, and tongue MI tasks. The reaction time required to perform the tasks also differed: during the left-hand and right-hand MI tasks, the brain networks of subjects reacted promptly and strongly, but there was a delay during the feet and tongue MI task. Statistical analysis and the analysis of network topology revealed the target regions of the brain network during different MI processes. In conclusion, our findings suggest a new way to explain the neural mechanism behind MI.

However, in addition to the (desired) activation of cortical neurons and fibers, TMS also causes (undesired) indirect brain responses through auditory and somatosensory stimulation, which may contribute significantly to the overall EEG signal and mask the effects of intervention on direct cortical responses. Objectives: To test differences in EEG responses to real TMS at intensities above and below resting motor threshold (RMT) and a realistic sham stimulation. Methods: 12 healthy subjects participated in one session in which single-pulse TMS was applied to the left motor cortex in 3 different blocks, 150 pulses per block: 110%RMT, 90%RMT and realistic sham stimulation. Cortical responses were collected by a 64 electrode EEG system. TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) and TMS induced oscillations were analyzed. Methods: 12 healthy subjects participated in one session in which single-pulse TMS was applied to the left motor cortex in 3 different blocks, 150 pulses per block: 110%RMT, 90%RMT and realistic sham stimulation. Cortical responses were collected by a 64-channel EEG system. TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) and TMS induced oscillations were analyzed. Results: TEPs from all conditions differed significantly, with TEPs from 110%RMT showing overall highest amplitudes and realistic sham lowest amplitudes. Sham stimulation had only minor effects on induced cortical oscillations compared to pre-stimulus baseline, TMS at 90%RMT resulted in a significant increase (50-200 m s) followed by a decrease (200-500 m s) in power of alpha and beta oscillations; TMS at 110% RMT led to an additional increase in beta power at late latencies (650-800 m s). Conclusions: Real TMS of motor cortex results in cortical responses significantly different from realistic sham. These differences very likely reflect to a significant extent direct activation of neurons, rather than sensory evoked activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The proposed preprocessing method considers the time-frequency analysis of EEG signal. The Short Time Fourier Transforms (STFT) based time-frequency analysis is applied to generate the Time-Frequency Series (TFS) of Electrooculogram (EOG) corrected EEG signal. Further, the generated TFS of particular frequency bin is transformed into time domain signal by Inverse Short Time Fourier Transforms (ISTFT). The generated time domain signal of particular frequency bin is passed through feature extraction method. An asymmetry coefficient based on Hjorth parameter as a feature extracted for each frequency bin and further subjected to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for their classification. The proposed method of EEG signal pre-processing and feature extraction outperforms the conventional method of EEG signal pre-processing like Discriminative Frequency Band Common Spatial Pattern (DFBCSP).

Various blind source separation (BSS) approaches have been developed and implemented in order to decompose these oscillations, and a subset of approaches have been developed for decomposition of multi-subject data. Group independent component analysis (Group ICA) is one such approach, revealing spatiospectral maps at the group level with distinct frequency and spatial characteristics. The reproducibility of these distinct maps across subjects and paradigms is relatively unexplored domain, and the topic of the present study. To address this, we conducted separate group ICA decompositions of EEG spatiospectral patterns on data collected during three different paradigms or tasks (resting-state, semantic decision task and visual oddball task). K-means clustering analysis of back-reconstructed individual subject maps demonstrates that fourteen different independent spatiospectral maps are present across the different paradigms/tasks, i.e. they are generally stable.

Cross-frequency interactions between frontal theta and posterior alpha control mechanisms foster working memory	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Working memory; Theta oscillations; Alpha oscillations; EEG; Granger causality; Connectivity	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BETA OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL AREAS; BRAIN NETWORK; GAMMA; TOP; INFORMATION; FEEDFORWARD; MODULATION	Neural oscillatory activity in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) bands has been associated with the implementation of executive function, with theta in midline frontal cortex and alpha in posterior parietal cortex related to working memory (WM) load. To identify how these spatially and spectrally distinct neural phenomena interact within a large-scale fronto-parietal network organized in service of WM, EEG was recorded while subjects performed an N-back WM task. Frontal theta power increase, paralleled by posterior alpha decrease, tracked participants' successful WM performance. These power fluctuations were inversely related both across and within trials and predicted reaction time, suggesting a functionally important communication channel within the fronto-parietal network. Granger causality analysis revealed directed parietal to frontal communication via alpha and frontal to parietal communication via theta. Results encourage consideration of these bidirectional, power-to-power, cross-frequency control mechanisms as an important feature of cerebral network organization supporting executive function.

Thus, investigating factors that can predict performance in changing indoor environments have become a highly important research topic bearing significant impact in our society. While past research studies have attempted to determine predictors for performance, they do not provide satisfactory prediction ability. Therefore, in this preliminary study, we attempt to predict performance during office-work tasks triggered by different indoor room temperatures (22.2 degrees C and 30 degrees C) from human brain signals recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Seven participants were recruited, from whom EEG, skin temperature, heart rate and thermal survey questionnaires were collected. Regression analyses were carried out to investigate the effectiveness of using EEG power spectral densities (PSD) as predictors of performance. Our results indicate EEG PSDs as predictors provide the highest R-2 (> 0.70), that is 17 times higher than using other physiological signals as predictors and is more robust. Finally, the paper provides insight on the selected predictors based on brain activity patterns for low- and high-performance levels under different indoor-temperatures.

It is known that seizures initiate and propagate in different brain regions. Long-term intracranial multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) reflects broadband ictal activity under seizure occurrence. Network-based techniques are efficient in discovering brain dynamics and offering finger-print features for specific individuals. In this study, we adopt link prediction for proposing a novel workflow aiming to quantify seizure dynamics and uncover pathological mechanisms of epilepsy. A dataset of EEG signals was enrolled that recorded from 8 patients with 3 different types of pharmoco-resistant focal epilepsy. Weighted networks are obtained from phase locking value (PIN) in subband EEG oscillations. Common neighbor (CN), resource allocation (RA), Adamic-Adar (AA), and Sorenson algorithms are brought in for link prediction performance comparison. Results demonstrate that RA outperforms its rivals. Similarity, matrix was produced from the RA technique performing on EEG networks later. Nodes are gathered to form sequences by selecting the ones with the highest similarity. It is demonstrated that variations are in accordance with seizure attack in node sequences of gamma band EEG oscillations. What is more, variations in node sequences monitor the total seizure journey including its initiation and termination.

Speech Imagery concept will be useful for patients with neurological disorders for decoding their thoughts and possibly convert their thought to speech through some external medium. In this paper Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were acquired from two healthy subjects while speaking and imagining of speaking five consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words in multiple trials of different time frames. Each trial was carried out for five times during both the tasks. The acquired EEG signals wereanalyzed in frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform and the power spectral densities for each band were derived. Based on the derived absolute power, relative spectral powers were computed for each EEG frequency band during speaking and imagining of speaking. Relative powers for both inter and intra hemispheric frontal and temporal electrodes were analyzed as these electrodes are located near Broca's and Wernicke's area. From theresults it was inferred that relative power of theta band was found to be high while imagining of speaking a CVC word and similarly relative power of alpha band was found to be dominant while speaking a CVC word. It has also been observed that averaged relative power of left hemispheric frontal and temporal electrodes was increasing progressively as the resting time for the task is increased. Comparatively the averaged relative power was found to be higher than the relative power of a single trial. This work will be clinically useful for speech impaired people as it is feasible to recognize the word from these signal processing methods.

Previous studies have also revealed that the interplay between different types of sleep oscillations (e.g. spindles, slow waves, sharp-wave ripples) promotes the consolidation process of declarative memories. Yet the functional contribution of this type of frequency-specific interactions to motor memory consolidation remains unknown. Thus, this study sought to investigate whether spindle oscillations are associated with low-or high-frequency activity at the regional (local) and interregional (connectivity) levels. Using an olfactory-targeted memory reactivation paradigm paired to a motor sequence learning task, we compared the effect of cuing (Cond) to no-cuing (NoCond) on frequency interactions during sleep spindles. Time-frequency decomposition analyses revealed that cuing induced significant differential and localized changes in delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequencies before, during, and after spindles, as well as changes in high-beta (20-30 Hz) during the spindle oscillation. Finally, coherence analyses yielded significant increases in connectivity during sleep spindles in both theta and sigma (11-17 Hz) bands in the cued group only. These results support the notion that the synchrony between spindle and associated low-or high-frequency rhythmic activity is an integral part of the memory reactivation process. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of not only measuring spindles' characteristics, but to investigate such oscillations in both time and frequency domains when assessing memory consolidation-related changes.

These patterns are known as proepileptic because they occur in time period during the development of absence-epilepsy before fully-formed epileptic seizures. In the paper we analyze EEG signals of WAG/Rij rats with continuous wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition in order to find particular features of epileptic spike-wave discharges and non-epileptic sleep spindles. Then we introduce proepileptic activity as patterns that combine features of epileptic and non-epileptic activity. We analyze proepileptic activity in order to specify its features and time-frequency structure.

Twenty-six healthy participants performed three cognitive tasks: 1) n-back (0-, 2-and 3-back), 2) discrimination/selection response task (DSR) and 3) word generation (WG) tasks. The data provided includes: 1) measured data, 2) demographic data, and 3) basic analysis results. For n-back (dataset A) and DSR tasks (dataset B), event-related potential (ERP) analysis was performed, and spatiotemporal characteristics and classification results for 'target' versus 'non-target' (dataset A) and symbol 'O' versus symbol 'X' (dataset B) are provided. Time-frequency analysis was performed to show the EEG spectral power to differentiate the task-relevant activations. Spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic responses are also shown. For the WG task (dataset C), the EEG spectral power and spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic responses are analyzed, and the potential merit of hybrid EEG-NIRS BCIs was validated with respect to classification accuracy. We expect that the dataset provided will facilitate performance evaluation and comparison of many neuroimaging analysis techniques.

When studying epilepsy, the microdialysis technique is often combined with short-term or even long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring to assess spontaneous seizure frequency, severity, progression and clustering. The combined microdialysis-EEG is based on the use of several methods and instruments. Here, we performed in vivo microdialysis and continuous video-EEG recording to monitor glutamate and aspartate outflow over time, in different phases of the natural history of epilepsy in a rat model. This combined approach allows the pairing of changes in the neurotransmitter release with specific stages of the disease development and progression. The amino acid concentration in the dialysate was determined by liquid chromatography. Here, we describe the methods and outline the principal precautionary measures one should take during in vivo microdialysis-EEG, with particular attention to the stereotaxic surgery, basal and high potassium stimulation during microdialysis, depth electrode EEG recording and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of aspartate and glutamate in the dialysate. This approach may be adapted to test a variety of drug or disease induced changes of the physiological concentrations of aspartate and glutamate in the brain. Depending on the availability of an appropriate analytical assay, it may be further used to test different soluble molecules when employing EEG recording at the same time.

In this paper, SSVEP is used to assess the perceived quality of texture images. The EEG-based assessment method is compared with conventional methods, and recorded EEG data are correlated to obtained mean opinion scores (MOSs). A dimensionality reduction technique for EEG data called spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) is adapted for the SSVEP framework and used to extract physiologically meaningful and plausible neural components from the EEG recordings. It is shown that the use of SSD not only increases the correlation between neural features and MOS to r = -0.93, but also solves the problem of channel selection in an EEG-based image-quality assessment.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI is one of the most promising form of this application where a subject learns to control brain waves of type mu-rhythm (8-14 Hz) or beta-rhythm (14-30 Hz) or P300 event related potential or slow cortical potentials (SCPs). Intents of the person is extracted using signal processing techniques. In this study self-regulation of SCPs is studied using wavelet packet analysis (WPA), rather than traditional time or frequency domain methods. WPA, by providing arbitrary time-frequency resolution, enables analyzing signals of stationary and non-stationary nature. It has better time representation than Fourier analysis and better high frequency resolution than Wavelet analysis. WPA subimages are analyzed further by log energy entropy. These feature vectors are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classification. We use the BCI Competition 2003 datasets la and lb to test our approach. Performance of the MLP is compared with that of k-NN and SVM. Our method achieves accuracies of 92.8% and 63.3% on datasets la and lb respectively. This outperforms the other reported results on the same datasets including the winners of the competition. Overall, WPA followed by Log Energy Entropy and MLP provides an efficient tool for the aforementioned kind of BCI oriented EEG analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Time-frequency methods provide another approach that allows the detection of subtle shifts in types and patterns of brain oscillations. We sought to discover whether event-related alpha activity would be significantly affected in asymptomatic multi-concussed athletes. We measured the amplitude of alpha activity (8-12 Hz) from the EEG recorded during a visual-spatial attention task to compare event-related alpha perturbations in 13 multi-concussed athletes and 14 age-equivalent, non-concussed teammates. Relative to non-concussed athletes, multi-concussed athletes showed significantly less event-related perturbations time locked to stimulus presentation. Alpha activity alterations were closely related to the number of concussions sustained. Event-related alpha activity differed in asymptomatic multi-concussed athletes when compared to controls. Our study suggests that low-level neurophysiological underpinnings of the deployment of visual-spatial attention are affected in multi-concussed athletes even though their last concussion occurred on average 30 months prior to testing.

The aim of this study was to optimize the analysis of resting EEG alpha magnitude, focusing on alpha peak frequency and nonlinear transformation of alpha power. A family of nonlinear transforms, Box-Cox transforms, were applied to find the transform that (a) maximized a non-disputed effect: the increase in alpha magnitude when the eyes are closed (Berger effect), and (b) made the distribution of alpha magnitude closest to normal across epochs within each participant, or across participants. The transformations were performed either at the single epoch level or at the epoch-average level. Alpha peak frequency showed large individual differences, yet good correspondence between various ways to estimate it in 2min of eyes-closed and 2min of eyes-open resting EEG data. Both alpha magnitude and the Berger effect were larger for individual alpha than for a generic (8-12Hz) alpha band. The log-transform on single epochs (a) maximized the t-value of the contrast between the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions when tested within each participant, and (b) rendered near-normally distributed alpha power across epochs and participants, thereby making further transformation of epoch averages superfluous. The results suggest that the log-normal distribution is a fundamental property of variations in alpha power across time in the order of seconds. Moreover, effects on alpha power appear to be multiplicative rather than additive. These findings support the use of the log-transform on single epochs to achieve appropriate scaling of alpha magnitude.	[Smulders, Fren T. Y.; ten Oever, Sanne; Donkers, Franc C.

Electroencephalography Amplitude Modulation Analysis for Automated Affective Tagging of Music Video Clips	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotion classification; affective computing; multimedia content; electroencephalography; physiological signals; signal processing; pattern classification	FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; EMOTION RECOGNITION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; STATE; AROUSAL; SELECTION; PHASE; INFORMATION; RELEVANCE	The quantity of music content is rapidly increasing and automated affective tagging of music video clips can enable the development of intelligent retrieval, music recommendation, automatic playlist generators, and music browsing interfaces tuned to the users' current desires, preferences, or affective states. To achieve this goal, the field of affective computing has emerged, in particular the development of so-called affective brain-computer interfaces, which measure the user's affective state directly from measured brain waves using non-invasive tools, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Typically, conventional features extracted from the EEG signal have been used, such as frequency subband powers and/or inter-hemispheric power asymmetry indices. More recently, the coupling between EEG and peripheral physiological signals, such as the galvanic skin response (GSR), have also been proposed. Here, we show the importance of EEG amplitude modulations and propose several new features that measure the amplitude-amplitude cross-frequency coupling per EEG electrode, as well as linear and non-linear connections between multiple electrode pairs. When tested on a publicly available dataset of music video clips tagged with subjective affective ratings, support vector classifiers trained on the proposed features were shown to outperform those trained on conventional benchmark EEG features by as much as 6, 20, 8, and 7% for arousal, valence, dominance and liking, respectively. Moreover, fusion of the proposed features with EEG-GSR coupling features showed to be particularly useful for arousal (feature-level fusion) and liking (decision-level fusion) prediction. Together, these findings show the importance of the proposed features to characterize human affective states during music clip watching.

Although the neuroimaging modality such as electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promising research results in achieving objectivity during the screening and diagnosis of AUD patients. However, the translation of these findings for clinical applications has been largely understudied and hence less clear. This study advocates the use of EEG as a diagnostic and screening tool for AUD patients that may help the clinicians during clinical decision making. In this context, a comprehensive review on EEG-based methods is provided including related electrophysiological techniques reported in the literature. More specifically, the EEG abnormalities associated with the conditions of AUD patients are summarized. The aim is to explore the potentials of objective techniques involving quantities/features derived from resting EEG, event-related potentials or event-related oscillations data.

This paper exploits the identification of cyclic alternating patterns (CAPs), a periodic ubiquitous phenomenon nested in the sleep stages, to analyze the EEG spectral coherence in subjects affected by nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) and healthy controls. Methods: For each EEG recording, we extracted several CAP A1 subtype 4 s time series. We analyze the coherence between each pair of electrodes for each individual to obtain its distribution for each frequency range of interest to investigate differences between cases and controls. In addition, the imaginary and real parts of the spectral coherence were calculated and plotted to assess their likelihood of segregation into different classes and anatomical regions. Results: The results of this study suggest a relevant frontal-temporal neural circuitry difference between individuals affected by epilepsy and controls. Conclusion: This supports the observation that, though highly variable, a broad range of executive, cognitive and attentional deficit observed in subjects affected by NFLE might depend on frontal-temporal altered networking. Significance: The investigation of EEG activity in the domain of the complex sleep architecture represents a challenging topic in neurophysiology and needs new methods to explore the manifold aspects of sleep. This work aims to provide a simple method to distinguish NFLE from healthy subjects from a functional connectivity point of view and to explore the possibility of using a smaller EEG channel set to support diagnosis.

Neural oscillation is a rhythmic neural activity that can be easily observed by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). Neural oscillations show the same frequency and cross-frequency synchronization for various cognitive and perceptual functions. However, it is unclear how this neural synchronization is achieved by a dynamical system. If neural oscillations are weakly coupled oscillators, the dynamics of neural synchronization can be described theoretically using a phase oscillator model. We propose an estimation method to identify the phase oscillator model from real data of cross-frequency synchronized activities. The proposed method can estimate the coupling function governing the properties of synchronization. Furthermore, we examine the reliability of the proposed method using time-series data obtained from numerical simulation and an electronic circuit experiment, and show that our method can estimate the coupling function correctly. Finally, we estimate the coupling function between EEG oscillation and the speech sound envelope, and discuss the validity of these results.

Based on well-established complexity theories, one hypothesis in sleep medicine is that lower complexity of brain waves at pre-sleep state can facilitate sleep initiation and further improve sleep quality. However, this has never been studied with solid data. In this study, EEG collected from healthy subjects was used to investigate the association between pre-sleep EEG complexity and sleep quality. Multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) was applied to pre-sleep EEG signals recorded immediately after light-off (while subjects were awake) for measuring the complexities of brain dynamics by a proposed index, CI1-30. Slow wave activity (SWA) in sleep, which is commonly used as an indicator of sleep depth or sleep intensity, was quantified based on two methods, traditional Fast Fourier transform (FR) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). The associations between wake EEG complexity, sleep latency, and SWA in sleep were evaluated. Our results demonstrated that lower complexity before sleep onset is associated with decreased sleep latency, indicating a potential facilitating role of reduced pre-sleep complexity in the wake-sleep transition. In addition, the proposed EEMD-based method revealed an association between wake complexity and quantified SWA in the beginning of sleep (90 min after sleep onset). Complexity metric could thus be considered as a potential indicator for sleep interventions, and further studies are encouraged to examine the application of EEG complexity before sleep onset in populations with difficulty in sleep initiation. Further studies may also examine the mechanisms of the causal relationships between pre-sleep brain complexity and SWA, or conduct comparisons between normal and pathological conditions.

This information is related to the determination of the type of drug delivery and the therapeutic measures that will be performed for the epilepsy patient. In this research, a system that can visualize the state of the brains of epilepsy patients by performing an analysis of brain wave signals or electroencephalography (EEG) is built. Visualization is performed using topographic mapping techniques on each EEG signal sub-band, namely delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma sub-bands. The feature extraction process is conducted using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to transform signals from time domain into frequency domain. The absolute power and relative power data of EEG signals are used as input values in the visualization process. The results are compared to neurologist analysis and they indicate that this system can visualize the brain condition of epileptic patients to find out where the epileptogenic zone is located by adjusting data cutting process to the duration of the seizure wave that occurs.

Recent developments in the field demonstrated that FC fluctuates even in the resting state, which has not been taken into account by the widely applied static approaches introduced earlier. In a recent study using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) global dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) has also been found to fluctuate according to scale-free i.e., fractal dynamics evidencing the true multifractal (MF) nature of DFC in the human prefrontal cortex. Expanding on these findings, we performed electroencephalography (EEG) measurements in 14 regions over the whole cortex of 24 healthy, young adult subjects in eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) states. We applied dynamic graph theoretical analysis to capture DFC by computing the pairwise time-dependent synchronization between brain regions and subsequently calculating the following dynamic graph topological measures: Density, Clustering Coefficient, and Efficiency. We characterized the dynamic nature of these global network metrics as well as local individual connections in the networks using focus-based multifractal time series analysis in all traditional EEG frequency bands. Global network topological measures were found fluctuating-albeit at different extent-according to true multifractal nature in all frequency bands. Moreover, the monofractal Hurst exponent was found higher during EC than EO in the alpha and beta bands. Individual connections showed a characteristic topology in their fractal properties, with higher autocorrelation owing to short-distance connections-especially those in the frontal and pre-frontal cortex-while long-distance connections linking the occipital to the frontal and pre-frontal areas expressed lower values. The same topology was found with connection-wise multifractality in all but delta band connections, where the very opposite pattern appeared. This resulted in a positive correlation between global autocorrelation and connection-wise multifractality in the higher frequency bands, while a strong anticorrelation in the delta band. The proposed analytical tools allow for capturing the fine details of functional connectivity dynamics that are evidently present in DFC, with the presented results implying that multifractality is indeed an inherent property of both global and local DFC.

Resting State Electroencephalography and Sports-Related Concussion: A Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Review						biomarker; coherence; oscillations; qEEG; return-to-play; sports-related concussion	FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SUICIDAL IDEATION; EEG; ATTENTION; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; DYNAMICS; DEFICITS; GLIOSIS; RETURN	Sports-related concussion is associated with a range of short-term functional deficits that are commonly thought to recover within a two-week post-injury period for most, but certainly not all, persons. Resting state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) may prove to be an affordable, accessible, and sensitive method of assessing severity of brain injury and rate of recovery after a concussion. This article presents a systematic review of rs-EEG in sports-related concussion. A systematic review of articles published in the English language, up to June 2017, was retrieved via PsychINFO, Medline, Medline In Process, Embase, SportDiscus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library, Reviews, and Trials. The following key words were used for database searches: electroencephalography, quantitative electroencephalography, qEEG, cranio-cerebral trauma, mild traumatic brain injury, mTBI, traumatic brain injury, brain concussion, concussion, brain damage, sport, athletic, and athlete. Observational, cohort, correlational, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies were all included in the current review. Sixteen articles met inclusion criteria, which included data on 504 athletes and 367 controls. All 16 articles reported some abnormality in rs-EEG activity after a concussion; however, the cortical rhythms that were affected varied. Despite substantial methodological and analytical differences across the 16 studies, the current review suggests that rs-EEG may provide a reliable technique to identify persistent functional changes in athletes after a concussion. Because of the varied approaches, however, considerable work is needed to establish a systematic methodology to assess its efficacy as a marker of return-to-play.

J	von Wegner, F; Laufs, H				von Wegner, Frederic; Laufs, Helmut			Information-Theoretical Analysis of EEG Microstate Sequences in Python	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG microstates; information theory; entropy; mutual information; Markovianity; open-source	ADAPTIVE SEGMENTATION; MARKOV-CHAINS; MAP SERIES; NREM SLEEP; SCHIZOPHRENIA; NETWORKS; NAIVE; REST	We present an open-source Python package to compute information-theoretical quantities for electroencephalographic data. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical potential generated by the cerebral cortex and the set of spatial patterns projected by the brain's electrical potential on the scalp surface can be clustered into a set of representative maps called EEG microstates. Microstate time series are obtained by competitively fitting the microstate maps back into the EEG data set, i.e., by substituting the EEG data at a given time with the label of the microstate that has the highest similarity with the actual EEG topography. As microstate sequences consist of non-metric random variables, e.g., the letters A-D, we recently introduced information-theoretical measures to quantify these time series. In wakeful resting state EEG recordings, we found new characteristics of microstate sequences such as periodicities related to EEG frequency bands. The algorithms used are here provided as an open-source package and their use is explained in a tutorial style. The package is self-contained and the programming style is procedural, focusing on code intelligibility and easy portability. Using a sample EEG file, we demonstrate how to perform EEG microstate segmentation using the modified K-means approach, and how to compute and visualize the recently introduced information-theoretical tests and quantities. The time-lagged mutual information function is derived as a discrete symbolic alternative to the autocorrelation function for metric time series and confidence intervals are computed from Markov chain surrogate data. The software package provides an open-source extension to the existing implementations of the microstate transform and is specifically designed to analyze resting state EEG recordings.

The dynamic EEG data at static state that is when 1G and under +Gz acceleration is made time frequency analysis by using HHT method, and the analysis result is basically consistent with that of FFT, proving the feasibility of this method on dynamic EEG data analysis. It is found by contrast that, HHT is more appropriate for the analysis and treatment of non-stationary signal, moreover, the whole process is adaptive. HHT can better show the distribution of signal energy in time frequency domain by Hilbert spectrum and more clearly reflect the frequency spectrum change feature of dynamic EEG than FFT.

Using a novel gambling task that separates gains and losses across blocks and directly compares reception of monetary rewards to a 'no-reward/punishment' condition with equal probability we aimed to further investigate the role of beta oscillations. When contrasting different feedback conditions across rewards, we found that a late low beta component (12-20 Hz) had increased in power during the omission of rewards relative to the reception of rewards, while no differences were observed during the loss domain. These findings may indicate that late low beta oscillations in the context of feedback processing may respond to omission of gains relative to other potential outcomes. We speculate that late low beta oscillations may operate as a learning mechanism that signals the brain to make future adequate decisions. Overall, our study provides new insights for the role of late low beta oscillations in reward processing.

A recent and advanced TF analyzing method, multivariate synchrosqueezing transform (MSST) is adopted as a feature extraction method due to multi-channel signal processing and compact component localization capabilities. First, the 32 participants' EEG recordings from DEAP emotional EEG database are analyzed using MSST to reveal oscillations. Second, independent component analysis (ICA), and feature selection are applied to reduce the high dimensional 2D TF distribution without losing distinctive component information in the 2D image. Thus, only one method for feature extraction using MSST is performed to analyze time, and frequency-domain properties of the EEG signals instead of using some signal analyzing combinations (e.g., power spectral density, energy in bands, Hjorth parameters, statistical values, and time differences etc.). As well, the TF-domain reduction performance of ICA is compared to non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to discuss the accuracy levels of high/low arousal, and high/low valence emotional state recognition. The proposed MSST-ICA feature extraction approach yields up to correct rates of 82.11%, and 82.03% for arousal, and valence state recognition using artificial neural network. The performances of the MSST and ICA are compared with Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) and NMF to investigate the effects of TF distributions as feature set with reduction techniques on emotion recognition.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has become an important preclinical and clinical technique to investigate the underlying mechanisms of neurophysiological dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders. Patients with schizophrenia show marked deficits in auditory event-related potentials (ERP), the detection of deviant auditory stimuli (mismatch negativity, MMN), the generation and synchronization of 40 Hz gamma oscillations in response to steady-state auditory stimulation (ASSR) and reduced auditory-evoked oscillation in the gamma range. Due to a novel data-logging technology (Neurologger, TSE Systems), it is now possible to record wireless EEG data in awake, free-moving small rodents without any restrictions due to size of the device or attached cables. Recently, a new version of the Neurologger was released with improved performance to record time-locked event-related EEG signals. In this study, we were able to show in mice that pharmacological intervention with the NMDA receptor antagonists Ketamine and MK-801 can impair a comprehensive selection of EEG/ERP readouts (ERP N1 amplitude, 40 Hz ASSR, basal and evoked gamma oscillation, MMN) and therefore mimic the EEG deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia. Our data support the translational value of NMDA receptor antagonists as a model for preclinical evaluation of sensory processing deficits relevant to schizophrenia. Further, the new Neurologger system is a suitable device for wireless recording of clinically relevant EEG biomarkers in freely moving mice and a robust translational tool to investigate novel therapeutic approaches regarding sensory processing deficits related to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) contained in the iEEG signal have been proposed as biomarker of the SOZ. Their visual identification is a very onerous process and an automated detection tool could be an extremely valuable aid for clinicians, reducing operator-dependent bias, and computational time. In this manuscript, we present the EPINETLAB software, developed as a collection of routines integrated in the EEGLAB framework that aim to provide clinicians with a structured analysis pipeline for HFOs detection and SOZ identification. The tool implements an analysis strategy developed by our group and underwent a preliminary clinical validation that identifies the HFOs area by extracting the statistical properties of HFOs signal and that provides useful information for a topographic characterization of the relationship between clinically defined SOZ and HFO area. Additional functionalities such as inspection of spectral properties of ictal iEEG data and import and analysis of source-space magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were also included. EPINETLAB was developed with user-friendliness in mind to support clinicians in the identification and quantitative assessment of HFOs in iEEG and source space MEG data and aid the evaluation of the SOZ for pre-surgical assessment.

Our objective was to investigate whether LF and delta waves should be considered as separate entities. Methods: The slow-wave electroencephalogram (EEG) activity of 2 sets of 10 young, healthy volunteers was analysed utilising the rarely-used Lomb-Scargle"periodogram. This method has advantages over the more commonly -used Fast Fourier Transform analysis. Results: During the night, the frequencies of the most powerful waves are concentrated in the 0.5-2 Hz range and show a continuous tendency to shift towards slower frequencies during sleep. Comparison with existing methods: When considering the frequency dynamics of slow-wave activity below 3 Hz, the unifying theory of LF and delta waves is more parsimonious than the idea that there is a different origin and regulation for the two sub-bands. Conclusions: The unifying theory of LF and delta waves is the simplest explanation for the slow-wave activity of the EEG below 3 Hz. This finding is important for the clinical use of slow-wave activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Developmental differences in the neural oscillations underlying auditory sentence processing in children and adults	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						EEG; Language; Neural oscillations; Development	WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SPHERICAL SPLINES; DEVELOPING BRAIN; WORLD KNOWLEDGE; EEG; DYNAMICS; AGE; POTENTIALS; OPERATIONS	Although very young children seem to process ongoing language quickly and effortlessly, neuroimaging and behavioral studies reveal that children continue to mature in their language skills through adolescence. During this prolonged development, children likely engage the same basic cognitive processes and neural mechanisms to perform language tasks as adults, but in somewhat different ways. In this study we used time frequency analysis of EEG to identify developmental differences in the engagement of neural oscillations between children (ages 10-12) and adults while listening to naturally-paced sentences. Adults displayed consistent beta changes throughout the sentence compared to children, thought to be related to efficient syntactic integration, and children displayed more broadly distributed theta changes than adults, thought to be related to more effortful semantic integration. Few differences in alpha, related to verbal working memory, existed between. groups. These findings shed new light on developmental changes in the neuronal processes underlying language comprehension.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain subject of research. The combination of TES and electroencephalography (EEG) offers great potential for investigating these mechanisms and brain function in general, especially when performed simultaneously. In conventional applications, the combination of EEG and TES suffers from limitations on the electrode level (gel for electrode-skin interface) and the usability level (preparation time, reproducibility of positioning). To overcome these limitations, we designed a bifunctional cap for simultaneous TES-EEG applications. We used novel electrode materials, namely textile stimulation electrodes and dry EEG electrodes integrated in a flexible textile cap. We verified the functionality of this cap by analysing the effect of TES on visual evoked potentials (VEPs). In accordance with previous reports using standard TES, the amplitude of the N75 component was significantly decreased post-stimulation, indicating the feasibility of using this novel flexible cap for simultaneous TES and EEG. Further, we found a significant reduction of the P100 component only during TES, indicating a different brain modulation effect during and after TES. In conclusion, the novel bifunctional cap offers a novel tool for simultaneous TES-EEG applications in clinical research, therapy monitoring and closed-loop stimulation.

Multiple animal models were created in attempts to recapitulate features of human malformations of cortical development. These manipulations give rise to various focal or diffuse anatomical abnormalities, accompanied by altered susceptibility to epileptic seizures. Both in humans and in models of dysplasia, the question of timing of the initiating insult is important. METHODSHere, we used a rat model of cerebral dysplasia elicited by prenatal irradiation at gestational days (E) 13, 15, 17, or 19. Previous results suggest these animals are characterized by different patterns of dysplasia as well as different reactivity to seizurogenic stimuli in several seizure models. Rats were implanted with telemetric electroencephalography (EEG) transmitters. We compared EEG data from freely moving animals with anatomical observations obtained with MRI, as well as Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTSWe performed spectral analyses of EEG signal, revealing differential regulation of specific bands (including delta, theta, alpha-beta, gamma) in animals with different patterns of dysplasia. Relative contribution of low-frequency activity in delta band is the lowest in E15 and the highest in E19. Conversely, higher frequency bands, corresponding to alpha/beta and gamma components, are reduced in E15 versus E19. This is accompanied by altered expression of glial markers in the E19 group. CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge, this constitutes the first quantitative description of power spectral properties in this experimental model, providing insight into mechanisms underlying the anatomical and electrophysiological abnormalities associated with brain dysplasia of different types.

It has also increased the need for secure access to personal information in the cloud. Biometrics is one approach to person recognition, which can be used in identification as well as authentication. Among the various modalities that have been developed, electroencephalography (EEG)-based biometrics features unparalleled universality, distinctiveness and collectability, while minimizing the risk of circumvention. However, commercializing EEG-based person recognition poses a number of challenges. This article reviews the various systems proposed over the past few years with a focus on the shortcomings that have prevented wide-scale implementation, including issues pertaining to temporal stability, psychological and physiological changes, protocol design, equipment and performance evaluation. We also examine several directions for the further development of usable EEG-based recognition systems as well as the niche markets to which they could be applied. It is expected that rapid advancements in EEG instrumentation, on-device processing and machine learning techniques will lead to the emergence of commercialized person recognition systems in the near future.

The objective of this study was to analyze the dynamic emotional responses of the participants to self-selected music using Electroencephalography (EEG). The frequency localization with respect to time for the given stimulus (liked and disliked music) in various EEG bands was established by implementing a multi-resolution analysis algorithm using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD).Ten healthy adults with an average age of 20 years (without any formal training in music) participated in this study. The perceived emotion of the participants was assessed using Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale and brain activity,while they were listening to music,was recorded using EEG. A high frontal asymmetry index score was noted at mid-frontal (F3 and F4) and lateral frontal (F7 and F8) electrode locations indicating positive emotion. The result suggests that playing the disliked music elicits neither negative emotion nor positive emotion as the changes were noted only at lateral frontal (F4 and F3). Apart from these, there was an increase in the theta band energy of the frontal midline only for liked music and increased beta component energy was observed only at frontal electrode locations while listening to disliked music. The participants' perceived emotion (valence/arousal) matched with induced emotion for liked music whereas for disliked music only the arousal component was similar. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a real-time triggered setup is a novel method for testing hypotheses about the relationship between spontaneous neuronal oscillations, cortical excitability, and synaptic plasticity. For this method, a reliable real-time extraction of the neuronal signal of interest from scalp EEG with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is of crucial importance. Here we compare individually tailored spatial filters as computed by spatial-spectral decomposition (SSD), which maximizes SNR in a frequency band of interest, against established local C3-centered Laplacian filters for the extraction of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm. Single-pulse TMS over the left primary motor cortex was synchronized with the surface positive or negative peak of the respective extracted signal, and motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded with electromyography (EMG) of a contralateral hand muscle. Both extraction methods led to a comparable degree of MEP amplitude modulation by phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm at the time of stimulation. This could be relevant for targeting other brain regions with no working benchmark such as the local C3-centered Laplacian filter, as sufficient SNR is an important prerequisite for reliable real-time single-trial detection of EEG features.

To determine whether and how asymmetry of EEG rhythms during motor preparation might occur following "awake brain surgery" for this type of tumour, we recorded electroencephalograms during a simple visuo-manual reaction time paradigm performed by the patients between 3 and 12 months after surgery and compared them to a control group of 8 healthy subjects. Frequency analyses revealed imbalances between the injured and healthy hemispheres. More particularly, we observed a power increase in the 8 frequency band near the lesion site and a power increase in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Interestingly, these alterations seem to decrease for the two patients whose surgery were anterior to 9 months, independently of the size of the lesion. Reaction times did not reflect this pattern as they were clearly not inversely related to the anteriority of the surgery. Electrophysiology suggests here different processes of recovery compared to behavioral data and brings further insights for the understanding of EEG rhythms that should not be systematically confounded or assimilated with cognitive performances. EEG monitoring is rare for these patients, especially after awake brain surgery, however it is important.

Mechanisms of Neurofeedback: A Computation-theoretic Approach	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurofeedback; electroencephalography; computational neuroscience; computer model	THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; NETWORK REORGANIZATION; APPLIED NEUROSCIENCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; MEMORY; MODEL	Neurofeedback training is a form of brain training in which information about a neural measure is fed back to the trainee who is instructed to increase or decrease the value of that particular measure. This paper focuses on electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in which the neural measures of interest are the brain oscillations. To date, the neural mechanisms that underlie successful neurofeedback training are still unexplained. Such an understanding would benefit researchers, funding agencies, clinicians, regulatory bodies, and insurance firms. Based on recent empirical work, an emerging theory couched firmly within computational neuroscience is proposed that advocates a critical role of the striatum in modulating EEG frequencies. The theory is implemented as a computer simulation of peak alpha upregulation, but in principle any frequency band at one or more electrode sites could be addressed. The simulation successfully learns to increase its peak alpha frequency and demonstrates the influence of threshold setting - the threshold that determines whether positive or negative feedback is provided. Analyses of the model suggest that neurofeedback can be likened to a search process that uses importance sampling to estimate the posterior probability distribution over striatal representational space, with each representation being associated with a distribution of values of the target EEG band. The model provides an important proof of concept to address pertinent methodological questions about how to understand and improve EEG neurofeedback success.

In several experiments we show that language, in the form of verbal labels, both aids recognition of ambiguous "Mooney" images and improves objective visual discrimination performance in a match/non-match task. We then used electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the mechanisms of this effect. The improved discrimination of images previously labeled was accompanied by a larger occipital-parietal P1 evoked response to the meaningful versus meaningless target stimuli. Time-frequency analysis of the interval between the cue and the target stimulus revealed increases in the power of posterior alpha-band (8-14 Hz) oscillations when the meaning of the stimuli to be compared was trained. The magnitude of the pre-target alpha difference and the P1 amplitude difference were positively correlated across individuals. These results suggest that prior knowledge prepares the brain for upcoming perception via the modulation of alpha-band oscillations, and that this preparatory state influences early (similar to 120 ms) stages of visual processing.

The EEG is the product of synchronized activity of the brain, and variations in EEG oscillations patterns reflect the underlying changes in neuronal synchrony. Our aim is to characterize the complexity of the EEG rhythmic oscillations bands when the subjects perform a visuomotor or imagined cognitive tasks (imagined movement), providing a causal mapping of the dynamical rhythmic activities of the brain as a measure of attentional investment. We estimate the intrinsic correlational structure of the signals within the causality entropy-complexity plane H x C, where the enhanced complexity in the gamma 1, gamma 2, and beta 1 bands allows us to distinguish motor-visual memory tasks from control conditions. We identify the dynamics of the gamma 1, gamma 2, and beta 1 rhythmic oscillations within the zone of a chaotic dissipative behavior, whereas in contrast the beta 2 band shows a much higher level of entropy and a significant low level of complexity that correspond to a non-invertible cubic map. Our findings enhance the importance of the gamma band during attention in perceptual feature binding during the visuomotor/imagery tasks. Published by AIP Publishing.

However, since its introduction, the effect of cTBS has shown a remarkable variability in its effects, which are often quantified by measuring the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Part of this inconsistency in experimental results might be due to an intrinsic variability of TMS effects caused by genetic or neurophysiologic factors. However, it is also possible that MEP only reflect the excitability of a sub-population of output neurons; resting EEG power and measures combining TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) might represent a more thorough reflection of cortical excitability. The aim of the present study was to verify the robustness of several predictors of cTBS response, such as I wave recruitment and baseline MEP amplitude, and to test cTBS after-effects on multiple neurophysiologic measurements such as MEP, resting EEG power, local mean field power (LMFP), TMS-related spectral perturbation (TRSP), and inter-trial phase clustering (ITPC). As a result, we were not able to confirm either the expected decrease of MEP amplitude after cTBS or the ability of I wave recruitment and MEP amplitude to predict the response to cTBS. Resting EEG power, LMFP, TRSP, and ITPC showed a more consistent trend toward a decrease after cTBS. Overall, our data suggest that the effect of cTBS on corticospinal excitability is variable and difficult to predict with common electrophysiologic markers, while its effect might be clearer when probed with combined TMS and EEG.

In this context, this paper has two related aims. The first is to show how the nature of the first phoneme influences the alignment of the ERPs. The second is to further characterize the EEG signal around the onset of articulation, both in temporal and frequency domains. Participants were asked to name aloud pictures of common objects. We applied microstate analyses and time-frequency transformations of ERPs locked to vocal onset to compare the EEG signal between voiced and unvoiced labial plosive word onset consonants. We found a delay of about 40 ms in the set of stable topographic patterns for /b/ relative to /p/ onset words. A similar shift was observed in the power increase of gamma oscillations (30-50 Hz), which had an earlier onset for /p/ trials (similar to 150 ms before vocal onset). This 40-ms shift is consistent with the length of the voiced proportion of the acoustic signal prior to the release of the closure in the vocal responses. These results demonstrate that phonetic features are an important parameter affecting response-locked ERPs, and hence that the onset of the acoustic energy may not be an optimal trigger for synchronizing the EEG activity to the response in vocal paradigms. The indexes explored in this study provide a step forward in the characterization of muscle-related artifacts in electrophysiological studies of speech and language production.

Thirty-four healthy subjects completed two event-related potential tests in the same sequence. Unilateral wrist extension was involved in both tests as the movement task. Instruction Response Movement (IRM) was a brisk movement response task with visual "go" signal, while Cued Instruction Response Movement (CIRM) added a visual cue contenting the direction information to create a prolonged motor preparation stage. Recorded EEG data were segmented and averaged to show time domain changes and then transformed into time-frequency mapping to show the time-frequency changes. All components were calculated and compared among C3, Cz, and C4 locations. The motor potential appeared bilaterally in both tests' movement execution stages, and Cz had the largest peak value among the investigated locations (p<0.01). In CIRM, a contingent negative variation (CNV) component presented bilaterally during the movement preparation stage with the largest amplitude at Cz. ERD of the mu rhythm (mu ERD) presented bilateral sensorimotor cortices during movement execution stages in both tests and was the smallest at Cz among the investigated locations. In the movement preparation stage of CIRM, mu ERD presented mainly in the contralateral sensory motor cortex area (C3 and C4 for right and left wrist movements, respectively) and showed significant differences between different locations. EEG changes in the time and time-frequency domains showed different topographical features. Movement execution was controlled bilaterally, while movement preparation was controlled mainly by contralateral sensorimotor cortices. Mu ERD was found to have stronger contra-lateralization features in the movement preparation stage and might be a better indicator for detecting movement intentions. This information could be helpful and might provide comprehensive information for studying movement disorders (such as those in post-stroke hemiplegic patients) or for facilitating the development of neuro-rehabilitation engineering technology such as brain computer interface.

Comparison of local spectral modulation, and temporal correlation, of simultaneously recorded EEG/fMRI signals during ketamine and midazolam sedation	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Simultaneous EEG; fMRI; Ketamine; Midazolam; Frequency analysis	SIMULTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL EEG; LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BLOOD-FLOW; FMRI; AMPLITUDE; POWER	Rationale and objectivesThe identification of biomarkers of drug action can be supported by non-invasive brain imaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with simultaneous collection plausibly overcoming the limitations of either modality alone. Despite this, few studies have assessed the feasibility and utility of recording simultaneous EEG/fMRI in a drug study.MethodsWe used simultaneous EEG/fMRI to assess the modulation of neural activity by ketamine and midazolam, in a placebo-controlled, single-blind, three-way cross-over design. Specifically, we analysed the sensitivity and direction of the spectral effects of each modality and the temporal correlations between the modulations of power of the common EEG bands and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal.Results and conclusionsDemonstrating feasibility, local spectral effects were similar to those found in previous non-simultaneous EEG and fMRI studies. Ketamine administration resulted in a widespread reduction of BOLD fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and a diverse pattern of effects in the different EEG bands. Midazolam increased fALFF in occipital, parietal, and temporal areas, and frontal delta and beta EEG power. While EEG spectra were more sensitive to pharmacological modulations than the fALFF bands, there was no clear spatial relationship between the two modalities. Additionally, ketamine modulated the temporal correlation strengths between the theta EEG band and the BOLD signal, whereas midazolam altered temporal correlations with the alpha and beta bands. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of simultaneous recording: each modality provides unique insights, and combinatorial analyses elicit more information than separate recordings.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of boundary EEG oscillations of theta-alpha bands on cognitive functions in vascular cognitive impairments (VCI) patients. Materials and Methods: We examined 55 patients with VCI in carotid stenosis, and underwent EEG in a resting state with closed eyes for 5 min. The asymmetry index (AI) along homologous channel pairs (e.g., F7-8) was assessed using neuronal activity topography (NAT). AI referring to 10 frequency components ranging from 4 to 20 Hz and neuropsychological assessments including linguistic competence were analyzed. Results: The main findings was that the language score had a positive association with AI in 7.8 Hz at F7-8 and a negative association with AI in 6.3 Hz at C3-4 and 14.1 Hz at F3-4. Conclusion: EEG asymmetry in a boundary range might have a special role in linguistic competence, suggesting the application of neural oscillation on the cognitive function evaluation and neurorehabilition induced by a frequency-specific transcranial alternating current stimulation.

Methods: Spectral EEG analysis was performed in patients with subacute stroke and OSA randomized to usual care or CPAP treatment from a previous study. Results: A total of 23 subjects were included. Compared to CPAP (n = 14), those in the control (n = 9) group demonstrated a significant increase in alpha power (p = 0.042). There was no between group differences for delta, theta or beta power. No significant correlation was demonstrated between the change in alpha power and indices of OSA severity or sleepiness. The increase in alpha power did not correlate with improvements in outcomes. Conclusion: Contrary to expectations CPAP treatment of OSA did not significantly decrease alpha and delta oscillations in stroke subjects.

We used beamformer-based virtual electrodes to improve ripple identification. Methods: We analyzed ten minutes of interictal EEG of nine patients with refractory focal epilepsy. EEGs with more than 60 channels and 20 spikes were included. We computed similar to 79 virtual electrodes using a scalar beamformer and marked ripples (80-250 Hz) co-occurring with spikes in physical and virtual electrodes. Ripple numbers in physical and virtual electrodes were compared, and sensitivity and specificity of ripples for the region of interest (ROI; based on clinical information) were determined. Results: Five patients had ripples in the physical electrodes and eight in the virtual electrodes, with more ripples in virtual than in physical electrodes (101 vs. 57, p = .007). Ripples in virtual electrodes predicted the ROI better than physical electrodes (AUC 0.65 vs. 0.56, p = .03). Conclusions: Beamforming increased ripple visibility in surface EEG. Virtual ripples predicted the ROI better than physical ripples, although sensitivity was still poor. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To develop reliable and valid biomarkers, many aspects in pre- and post-processing of EEG data are important. Artifact detection and segment selection are done by visual inspection or automated routines, both with specific advantages and difficulties. Inverse solution is an elegant way of solving the issue of common source but may be somewhat imprecise in the absence of defined graphoelements such as epileptiform discharges. Connectivity analyses allow a description of interactions between brain regions, which may represent one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline.

Whilst demonstrated in simulation, there are currently no suitable imaging or classification methods which can be successfully applied to human stroke data. Development of these complex methods is hindered by a lack of quality Multi-Frequency EIT (MFEIT) data. To address this, MFEIT data were collected from 23 stroke patients, and 10 healthy volunteers, as part of a clinical trial in collaboration with the Hyper Acute Stroke Unit (HASU) at University College London Hospital (UCLH). Data were collected at 17 frequencies between 5 Hz and 2 kHz, with 31 current injections, yielding 930 measurements at each frequency. This dataset is the most comprehensive of its kind and enables combined analysis of MFEIT, Electroencephalography (EEG) and Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data in stroke patients, which can form the basis of future research into stroke classification.

An early detection of patients affected by AD can be obtained by analyzing their electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which show a reduction of the complexity, a perturbation of the synchrony, and a slowing down of the rhythms. Methods: In this work, we apply a procedure that exploits feature extraction and classification techniques to EEG signals, whose aim is to distinguish patient affected by AD from the ones affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy control (HC) samples. Specifically, we perform a time-frequency analysis by applying both the Fourier and Wavelet Transforms on 109 samples belonging to AD, MCI, and HC classes. The classification procedure is designed with the following steps: (i) preprocessing of EEG signals; (ii) feature extraction by means of the Discrete Fourier and Wavelet Transforms; and (iii) classification with tree-based supervised methods. Results: By applying our procedure, we are able to extract reliable human-interpretable classification models that allow to automatically assign the patients into their belonging class. In particular, by exploiting a Wavelet feature extraction we achieve 83%, 92%, and 79% of accuracy when dealing with HC vs AD, HC vs MCI, and MCI vs AD classification problems, respectively. Conclusions: Finally, by comparing the classification performances with both feature extraction methods, we find out that Wavelets analysis outperforms Fourier. Hence, we suggest it in combination with supervised methods for automatic patients classification based on their EEG signals for aiding the medical diagnosis of dementia.

J	Khan, NA; Ali, S				Khan, Nabeel Ali; Ali, Sadiq			A new feature for the classification of non-stationary signals based on the direction of signal energy in the time frequency domain	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Adaptive time-frequency analysis; Seizure detection; Epilepsy	EPILEPTIC SEIZURE DETECTION; EEG SIGNALS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SEPARATION	The detection of seizure activity in electroencephalogram (EEG) segments is very important for the classification and localization of epileptic seizures. The evolution of a seizure in an EEG usually appears as a train of non uniformly spaced spikes and/or as piecewise linear frequency modulated signals. If a seizure is present, then the energy of the EEG is concentrated along the time axis and the frequency axis in the time frequency plane. However, in the absence of a seizure, the energy of the EEG signal is uniformly distributed along all directions in the time frequency plane. Based on this observation, we propose a new approach for the detection of a seizure. In this paper, we develop a new feature that exploits the direction of the energy of the signal in the time frequency domain to distinguish between seizures and non-seizures in an EEG. Our experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach over other conventional time frequency approaches; for example, the proposed feature set achieves a classification accuracy of 98.25% by only using five features.

Patterns that are observed through EEG related to neural circuit mechanism under different molecular targets dependent anesthetics have recently attracted much attention. Propofol, a Gamma-amino butyric acid, is known with evidently increasing alpha oscillation. Desflurane shares the same receptor action and should be similar to propofol. To explore their dynamics, EEG under routine surgery level anesthetic depth is analyzed using multitaper spectral method from two groups: propofol (n = 28) and desflurane (n = 23). The time-varying spectrum comparison was undertaken to characterize their properties. Results show that both of the agents are dominated by slow and alpha waves. Especially, for increased alpha band feature, propofol unconsciousness shows maximum power at about 10 Hz (mean +/- SD; frequency: 10.2 +/- 1.4 Hz; peak power, -14.0 +/- 1.6 dB), while it is approximate about 8 Hz (mean +/- SD; frequency: 8.3 +/- 1.3 Hz; peak power, -13.8 +/- 1.6 dB) for desflurane with significantly lower frequency-resolved spectra for this band. In addition, the mean power of propofol is much higher from alpha to gamma band, including slow oscillation than that of desflurane. The patterns might give us an EEG biomarker for specific anesthetic. This study suggests that both of the anesthetics exhibit similar spectral dynamics, which could provide insight into some common neural circuit mechanism. However, differences between them also indicate their uniqueness where relevant.

Examination of interhemispheric transfer by means of the CUD is not entirely explained by simple measures of response time. Multiple processes contribute to wide variability observed in CUD reaction times. Prior research has suggested that intra-hemispheric inhibitory processes may be involved in regulation of speed of transfer. Our study examined electroencephalography recordings and time-locked alpha frequency activity while 18 participants responded to lateralized targets during performance of the Poffenberger Paradigm. Our results suggest that there are alpha frequency differences at fronto-central lateral electrodes based on target, hand-of-response, and receiving hemisphere. These findings suggest that early motoric inhibitory mechanisms may help explain the wide range of variability typically seen with the CUD.

Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Methods: In Experiment 1, participants completed a cycling time-trial, 120-min after they ingested either tramadol or placebo. In Experiment 2, participants performed a visual oddball task during the time-trial. Electroencephalography measures (EEG) were recorded throughout the session. Results: In Experiment 1, average time-trial power output was higher in the tramadol vs. placebo condition (tramadol: 220W vs. placebo: 209W; p<0.01). In Experiment 2, no differences between conditions were observed in the average power output (tramadol: 234W vs. placebo: 230W; p>0.05). No behavioural differences were found between conditions in the oddball task. Crucially, the time frequency analysis in Experiment 2 revealed an overall lower target-locked power in the beta-band (p<0.01), and higher alpha suppression (p<0.01) in the tramadol vs. placebo condition. At baseline, EEG power spectrum was higher under tramadol than under placebo in Experiment 1 while the reverse was true for Experiment 2. Conclusions: Tramadol improved cycling power output in Experiment 1, but not in Experiment 2, which may be due to the simultaneous performance of a cognitive task. Interestingly enough, the EEG data in Experiment 2 pointed to an impact of tramadol on stimulus processing related to sustained attention. Trial registration: EudraCT number: 2015-005056-96.

Auditory priming improves neural synchronization in auditory-motor entrainment	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Auditory-motor entrainment; Synchronization; EEG	SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; BETA; MECHANISM; FREQUENCY; RHYTHMS; PHASE; BEAT	Neurophysiological research has shown that auditory and motor systems interact during movement to rhythmic auditory stimuli through a process called entrainment. This study explores the neural oscillations underlying auditory-motor entrainment using electroencephalography. Forty young adults were randomly assigned to one of two control conditions, an auditory-only condition or a motor-only condition, prior to a rhythmic auditory motor synchronization condition (referred to as combined condition). Participants assigned to the auditory-only condition auditory-first group) listened to 400 trials of auditory stimuli presented every 800 ms, while those in the motor-only condition (motor-first group) were asked to tap rhythmically every 800 ms without any external stimuli. Following their control condition, all participants completed an auditory-motor combined condition that required tapping along with auditory stimuli every 800 ms. As expected, the neural processes for the combined condition for each group were different compared to their respective control condition. Time-frequency analysis of total power at an electrode site on the left central scalp (C3) indicated that the neural oscillations elicited by auditory stimuli, especially in the beta and gamma range, drove the auditory-motor entrainment. For the combined condition, the auditory-first group had significantly lower evoked power for a region of interest representing sensorimotor processing (4-20 Hz) and less total power in a region associated with anticipation and predictive timing (13-16 Hz) than the motor-first group. Thus, the auditory-only condition served as a priming facilitator of the neural processes in the combined condition, more so than the motor-only condition. Results suggest that even brief periods of rhythmic training of the auditory system leads to neural efficiency facilitating the motor system during the process of entrainment. These findings have implications for interventions using rhythmic auditory stimulation.

In this paper, we have looked at the behavior of the SSVEP signals over 4 varying stimuli frequencies and 4 varying distances between the subject and the stimulus.

Through oscillating visual stimulus at distinct frequencies, an SSVEP can be detected by EEG at occipital electrodes on the scalp, with distinct visual stimuli representing distinct choices. Rapid, accurate detection and classification of these signals is crucial for real-time analysis in SSVEP-based applications. However, signal analysis and interpretation of SSVEP events may be hindered in children due to the significant variability in electrophysiological signals throughout development. Recently, multi-way tensors have been shown capable of exploiting higher-order interactions present in the naturally multi-dimensional EEG data. Using tensors as tools to identify latent structures between varying maturational signals thus may provide a potential solution for rapid classification of SSVEP signals in children at different developmental stages. The presented methodology builds upon previous tensor-based SSVEP analysis and extends it for the first time to developing paediatric populations. Results from a binary SSVEP classification task of n = 40 children age 811 are reported to be significantly greater than chance, at 67-74% accuracy across multiple training and testing blocks. The findings support that tensor decomposition could provide flexible advantages capable of accommodating developmental differences across children and lay groundwork for future tensor analysis in SSVEP-based applications, like BCIs.

The aim of this study is to explore the brain activity reflected by electroencephalography (EEG) during a confusing state induced by two kinds of information insufficiencies during mathematical problem-solving, namely, an explicit situation that clearly lacked information and an implicit situation in which the missing information was hidden in the problem itself, and whether there is an EEG difference between these two situations. Two experimental tasks and three control tasks were created. Short time Fourier transformation (STFT) was used for time-frequency analysis; then the alpha task-related-power (TRP) changes and distributions, which are closely related to cognitive processing, were calculated, and repeated measures ANOVA were performed to find the significant difference between task conditions. 'the results showed that the alpha power decreased significantly in the regions related to calculation when the participants encountered both explicit and implicit information insufficiency tasks compared to the control tasks, suggesting that confusion can cause more brain activity in the cortical regions related to the tasks that induce confusion. In addition, the implicit information insufficiency task elicited more activity in the parietal and right temporal regions, whereas the explicit information insufficiency task elicited additional activity in the frontal lobe, which revealed that the frontal region is related to the processing of novel or unfamiliar information and the parietal-temporal regions are involved in sustained attention or reorientation during confusing states induced by information insufficiency. In conclusion, this study has preliminarily investigated the EEG characteristics of confusion states, suggests that EEG is a promising methodology to detect confusion, and provides a basis for future studies aiming to achieve automatic recognition of confusing states.

Due to the sudden and unexpected electrical discharges occurring in the brain, epilepsy occurs and is a most commonly occurring neurological disorder next to stroke. For the easy monitoring of the activities of the brain, Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used. For the primary purpose of assessment of brain activities, EEG serves as a valuable treasure and an indispensable tool. The various information related to the physiological state of the brain can be bought out by EEG. For the analysis of the EEG records in a visual manner, expert neurologists consume more time and to detect the epileptic seizures, only EEG signals are used widely as it contains vital information. The EEG recording contains a lot of noise and so it is difficult to isolate the seizures from other artifacts with resembles more or less similar time-frequency patterns. Various automatic detection and machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the risk of epileptic seizures in raw EEG signals. In this study, the dimensions of the EEG signals are reduced initially with the help of two approaches, namely, Expectation Maximization Based Principal Component Analysis (EM-PCA) approach and Hessian Local Linear Embedding (HLLE) approach. The dimensionally reduced values are then classified to predict the risk of epilepsy from EEG signals with the help of two post classifiers namely Weighted K Nearest Neighbour (WKNN) and Linear Support Vector Machine (L-SVM). The performance metrics are analyzed in terms of various measures like Performance Index, Accuracy, Time Delay, Specificity and Sensitivity. The study shows that the best result is obtained when HLLE is used as a dimensionality reduction technique and classified with WKNN as it gives the highest perfect classification rate with an average accuracy of 97.743%.

Power increases in the high-frequency gamma band are typically reported in parallel to decreases in the low-frequency alpha band. However, their functional significance and in particular their interactions are not well understood. The present study shows that, in the context of an N-back working memory task, alpha power decreases in the dorsal visual stream are related to gamma power increases in early visual areas. Granger causality analysis revealed directed interregional interactions from dorsal to ventral stream areas, in accordance with task demands. Present results reveal a robust, behaviorally relevant, and architectonically decisive power-to-power relationship between alpha and gamma activity. This relationship suggests that anatomically distant power fluctuations in oscillatory activity can link cerebral network dynamics on trial-by-trial basis during cognitive operations such as working memory.

Cognitive Behavior Classification From Scalp EEG Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; cognition; synchrony; cognition; muscle artifact	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN; HZ; SYNCHRONY; NETWORKS; SEARCH; POWER; TASK; LOAD	Electroencephalography (EEG) has become increasingly valuable outside of its traditional use in neurology. EEG is now used for neuropsychiatric diagnosis, neurological evaluation of traumatic brain injury, neurotherapy, gaming, neurofeedback, mindfulness, and cognitive enhancement training. The trend to increase the number of EEG electrodes, the development of novel analytical methods, and the availability of large data sets has created a data analysis challenge to find the "signal of interest" that conveys the most information about ongoing cognitive effort. Accordingly, we compare three common types of neural synchronymeasures that are applied to EEG-power analysis, phase locking, and phase-amplitude coupling to assess which analytical measure provides the best separation between EEG signals that were recorded, while healthy subjects performed eight cognitive tasks-Hopkins Verbal Learning Test and its delayed version, Stroop Test, Symbol Digit Modality Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Trail Marking Test, Digit Span Test, and Benton Visual Retention Test. We find that of the three analytical methods, phase-amplitude coupling, specifically theta (4-7 Hz)-high gamma (70-90 Hz) obtained from frontal and parietal EEG electrodes provides both the largest separation between the EEG during cognitive tasks and also the highest classification accuracy between pairs of tasks. We also find that phase-locking analysis provides the most distinct clustering of tasks based on their utilization of long-term memory. Finally, we show that phase-amplitude coupling is the least sensitive to contamination by intense jaw-clenching muscle artifact.

Dynamics of corticospinal motor control during overground and treadmill walking in humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ambulatory EEG; corticomuscular coherence; human gait; neural oscillations; time frequency analysis	CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; LEG MUSCLES; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; SUPRASPINAL CONTROL; GRANGER CAUSALITY; SPINAL NEURONS; CORTEX CONTROL; GAIT; BRAIN; EMG	Increasing evidence suggests cortical involvement in the control of human gait. However, the nature of corticospinal interactions remains poorly understood. We performed time-frequency analysis of electrophysiological activity acquired during treadmill and overground walking in 22 healthy, young adults. Participants walked at their preferred speed (4.2, SD 0.4 km/h), which was matched across both gait conditions. Event-related power, corticomuscular coherence (CMC), and intertrial coherence (ITC) were assessed for EEG from bilateral sensorimotor cortices and EMG from the bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Cortical power, CMC, and ITC at theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies (4-45 Hz) increased during the double support phase of the gait cycle for both overground and treadmill walking. High beta (21-30 Hz) CMC and ITC of EMG was significantly increased during overground compared with treadmill walking, as well as EEG power in theta hand (4-7 Hz). The phase spectra revealed positive time lags at alpha, beta, and gatmna frequencies, indicating that the EEG response preceded the EMG response. The parallel increases in power, CMC, and ITC during double support suggest evoked responses at spinal and cortical populations rather than a modulation of ongoing corticospinal oscillatory interactions. The evoked responses are not consistent with the idea of synchronization of ongoing corticospinal oscillations but instead suggest coordinated cortical and spinal inputs during the double support phase. Frequency-band dependent differences in power, CMC, and ITC between overground and treadmill walking suggest differing neural control for the two gait modalities, emphasizing the task dependent nature of neural processes during human walking. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated cortical and spinal activity during overground and treadmill walking in healthy adults. Parallel increases in power, corticomuscular coherence, and intertrial coherence during double support suggest evoked responses at spinal and cortical populations rather than a modulation of ongoing corticospinal oscillatory interactions. These findings identify neurophysiological mechanisms that are important for understanding cortical control of human gait in health and disease.

Quantitative analysis of the observable outputs to identify the dependencies among components is imperative to increase the understanding of the underlying mechanism of the system. In this work, quantification of nonlinear dependencies in terms of mutual information between time series with respect to frequency characteristics is explored. A new model-free methodology is developed and tested on simulated data from coupled nonlinear systems. The results indicate that the proposed framework performs better than a conventional method for quantifying interactions. Application on real-world electrophysiological data from an emotional state assessment experiment reveals specific brain areas that are associated with levels of emotional responses.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and repeatable technique to diagnose brain abnormalities. However, the analysis of EEG spectra is still carried out manually by experts and effective computer science methods to extract relevant information from these signals become a necessity. Through a data mining approach, which guides the automated knowledge discovery process, we aim to achieve an automatic patients classification from the EEG biomedical signals of AD and MCI, in order to support medical doctors in the diagnosis formulation. Specifically, we design an integrated procedure that encompasses the following steps: (1) data collection; (2) data preprocessing of EEG-signals data; (3) features extraction by applying time-frequency transforms on EEG-signals (Fourier and Wavelet analysis); and (3) a supervised learning approach to classify samples in patients suffering from AD, patients affected by MCI, and healthy control (HC) subjects. By applying our procedure, we are able to extract human-interpretable classification models that allow to automatically assign the patients into their belonging class. In particular, by exploiting a Wavelet feature extraction we achieve 83%, 92%, and 79% of accuracy when dealing with HC vs AD, HC vs MCI, and MCI vs AD classification problems, respectively. By comparing the classification performances with both feature extraction methods, we find out that Wavelets analysis outperforms Fourier. Thus, we suggest it in combination with supervised methods for automatic patients classification based on their EEG signals for aiding the medical diagnosis of dementia.

Brain electrical activity recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) is most commonly used for BCI. Noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) is a data-driven time-frequency analysis method that can be applied to nonlinear and nonstationary EEG signals for BCI data processing. However, because white Gaussian noise occupies a broad range of frequencies, some redundant components are introduced. To solve this leakage problem, in this study, we propose using a sinusoidal assisted signal that occupies the same frequency ranges as the original signals to improve MEMD performance. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed sinusoidal signal assisted MEMD (SA-MEMD) method, we compared the decomposition performances of MEMD, NA-MEMD, and the proposed SA-MEMD using synthetic signals and a real-world BCI dataset. The spectral decomposition results indicate that the proposed SA-MEMD can avoid the generation of redundant components and over decomposition, thus, substantially reduce the mode mixing and misalignment that occurs in MEMD and NA-MEMD. Moreover, using SA-MEMD as a signal preprocessing method instead of MEMD or NA-MEMD can significantly improve BCI classification accuracy and reduce calculation time, which indicates that SA-MEMD is a powerful spectral decomposition method for BCI.

While alpha waves (8-12 Hz) are known to closely resemble short sinusoids, and thus are revealed by Fourier analysis or wavelet transforms, there is an evolving debate that electromagnetic neural signals are composed of more complex waveforms that cannot be analyzed by linear filters and traditional signal representations. In this paper, we propose to learn dedicated representations of such recordings using a multivariate convolutional sparse coding (CSC) algorithm. Applied to electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, this method is able to learn not only prototypical temporal waveforms, but also associated spatial patterns so their origin can be localized in the brain. Our algorithm is based on alternated minimization and a greedy coordinate descent solver that leads to state-of-the-art running time on long time series. To demonstrate the implications of this method, we apply it to MEG data and show that it is able to recover biological artifacts.

J	Shaw, L; Routray, A				Shaw, Laxmi; Routray, Aurobinda			Topographical assessment of neurocortical connectivity by using directed transfer function and partial directed coherence during meditation	COGNITIVE PROCESSING			English	Article						EEG; Partial directed coherence; Multivariate autoregressive model; Volume conduction; Meditation; Brain connectivity	STATE EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; RESOLUTION EEG RECORDINGS; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION; PATTERNS	Due to the presence of nonlinearity and volume conduction in electroencephalography (EEG), sometimes it's challenging to find out the actual brain network from neurodynamical alteration. In this paper, two well-known time-frequency brain connectivity measures, namely partial directed coherence (PDC) and directed transfer function (DTF), have been applied to evaluate the performance analysis of EEG signals obtained during meditation. These measures are implemented to the multichannel meditation EEG data to get the directed neural information flow. Mostly the assessment of PDC and DTF is entirely subjective and there are probabilities to have erroneous connectivity estimation. To avoid the subjective evaluation, the performance results are compared in terms of absolute energy, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and relative SNR (R-SNR) scale. In most of the cases, the PDC result is found to be more efficient than DTF. The limitation of DTF and PDC in terms of the time-varying multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model is highlighted. The time-varying MVAR model can track the neurodynamical changes better than any other method. In the present study, we would like to show that the PDC-based connectivity gives a better understanding of the non-symmetric relation in EEG obtained during Kriya Yoga meditation in comparison to DTF. However, it needs to be investigated further to warrant this claim.

To achieve its detection, various techniques of brain signal processing can be used. One of the most studied evoked potentials is the P300 brain wave, which usually appears between 300 and 500 ms after the stimulus. Currently, the detection of P300 evoked potentials is of great importance due to its unique properties that allow the development of applications such as spellers, lie detectors, and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. The present study was developed to demonstrate the usefulness of the Stockwell transform in the process of identifying P300 evoked potentials using a low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) device with only two brain sensors. The acquisition of signals was carried out using the Emotiv EPOC device a wireless EEG headset. In the feature extraction, the Stockwell transform was used to obtain time-frequency information. The algorithms of linear discriminant analysis and a support vector machine were used in the classification process. The experiments were carried out with 10 participants; men with an average age of 25.3 years in good health. In general, a good performance (75-92%) was obtained in identifying P300 evoked potentials.

The International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology produces new guidelines as an educational service for clinicians to address gaps in knowledge in clinical neurophysiology. The current guideline was prepared in response to gaps present in epilepsy-related neurophysiological assessment and is not intended to replace sound clinical judgement in the care of PWE. Furthermore, addressing specific pathophysiological conditions of the brain that produce epilepsy is of primary importance though is beyond the scope of this guideline. Instead, our goal is to summarize the scientific evidence for the utility of EEG when diagnosing and monitoring PWE. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: We performed a time-frequency analysis using wavelets, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and the Alpha/Theta power ratio of EEG data collected during a visual Go/Nogo task in 7-9 year old CWS and TDC, including also the time window between consecutive tasks. Results: CWS showed significantly reduced occipital alpha power and Alpha/Theta ratio in the "resting" or preparatory period between visual stimuli especially in the Nogo condition. Conclusions: The CWS demonstrate reduced inhibition of the visual cortex and information processing in the absence of visual stimuli, which may be related to problems in attentional gating. Significance: Occipital alpha oscillation is elementary in the control and inhibition of visual attention and the lack of occipital alpha modulation indicate fundamental differences in the regulation of visual information processing in CWS. Our findings support the view of stuttering as part of a wide-ranging brain dysfunction most likely involving also attentional and inhibitory networks.

Electroencephalography, given the high temporal resolution, allows the investigation of brain activity, connectivity, and network organization in time and frequency domains. Here, some of the most common metrics used to estimate the strength of functional interaction between pairs of brain regions are compared using source reconstructed time-series from resting-state high-density electroencephalography. Results show that the investigated metrics, on the basis of their connectivity profiles, may be naturally grouped into two main clusters. In particular, this finding shows that metrics which tend to limit the effects of volume conduction/signal leakage, although based on different properties of the original signals, may be partitioned into a specific homogeneous cluster, whilst the metrics which do not correct for these effects form a separate cluster. Moreover, this effect is even clearer when the analysis is replicated at scalp level. In conclusion, although within each cluster different metrics may still capture specific connectivity profiles, this study provides evidence that the result of an arbitrary choice of metric that either does or does not correct for volume conduction and signal leakage is more relevant.

It has been considered one of the most reliable methods for diagnosing deep coma and brain death patients in clinical practice. Phase synchronization (PS) method can be applied to detect the information flow and information exchange among different brain regions. In this paper, we aim to provide the diagnostic reference of deep coma patients and brain death patients based on EEG data and determine some potential clinical practice standards by using PS method. We first calculate the phase locking value (PLV) between the channel pairs located on the forehead among three types of patients (deep coma patients, brain death patients, and a patient from deep coma to brain death). Then the PLV differences between the two types of patients were analyzed based on different frequency bands, where the significance of the results was verified by the significant test (one-way ANOVA). Finally, the difference coefficient d is used to measure the degree of PS for two types of patients in different frequency bands. The results showed that the degree of PS in deep coma patients was significantly higher than that in brain death patients. This difference was more pronounced in the low frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and low beta), and the difference was most prominent in the alpha frequency band.

However, their association remains incompletely understood. We investigated time-frequency and time-course effects in functional networks underlying the P300 and their involvement in reactive control. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data of three different age groups (30 young: 18-26 years, 30 mid-aged: 49-58 years, 30 elderly: 65-75 years) was measured while they performed a cued colour/thickness switching task. Neural data was analysed concerning the targets. To consider restart, mixing, and switching processes, the targets position after a cue (first or third target) as well as their context in the single-task (distractor cue) or the mixed-task block (switch- or repeat cue) was analysed. P300 EEG data was decomposed by means of group-independent component and time-frequency analyses focusing on theta and beta oscillations. RTs generally slowed down with age (main effect group), and effects were specifically strong in targets after a switching cue (larger Cohens d). Peaking at around 300 ms, we detected five functionally independent networks reflecting the multicomponent process underlying task-switching. These networks differed in terms of their topography (parietal and frontal), their involvement in task processes (switch-specific, mixing-, restart-, and single-task processes) and in terms of frequency effects. All were affected by age, as indicated by amplitude changes of the target-P300 and power reductions most consistently shown in beta oscillations. Most extensive age-related changes were observed in one parietal network sensitive to mixing and restart processes. Changes included a topography shift, P300 and beta amplitudes, and were ongoing in the elderly group.

Understanding the relative contribution of genetic factors to sleep oscillations is important for determining whether they constitute useful endophenotypes that mark vulnerability to psychiatric illness. Using high-density sleep EEG recordings in human adolescent twin pairs (n = 60; 28 females), we find that over posterior regions 80-90% of the variance in slow oscillations, slow wave, and spindle activity is due to genes. Surprisingly, slow (10-12 Hz) and fast (12-16 Hz) anterior spindle amplitude and sigma power are largely driven by environmental factors shared among the twins. To our knowledge this is the first example of a neural phenotype that exhibits a strong influence of nature in one brain region, and nurture in another. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of the sleep EEG as a reliable and easy to measure endophenotype during adolescence. This measure may be used to measure disease risk in development before the onset of a psychiatric disorder; the location within the brain of deficits in sleep neurophysiology may suggest whether the ultimate cause is genetic or environmental.

Accumulating evidence of the predominantly local expression of these individual oscillatory rhythms suggests that their cross-frequency interactions may have a similar local component. However, it is unclear whether locally coordinated sleep oscillations exist across the cortex, and whether and how these dynamics differ between fast and slow spindles, and sleep stages. Moreover, substantial individual variability in the expression of both spindles and slow oscillations raises the possibility that their temporal organization shows similar individual differences. Using two nights of multichannel electroencephalography recordings from 24 healthy individuals, we characterized the topography of slow oscillation-spindle coupling. We found that while slow oscillations are highly restricted in spatial extent, the phase of the local slow oscillation modulates local spindle activity at virtually every cortical site. However, coupling dynamics varied with spindle class, sleep stage, and cortical region. Moreover, the slow oscillation phase at which spindles were maximally expressed differed markedly across individuals while remaining stable across nights. These findings both add an important spatial aspect to our understanding of the temporal coupling of sleep oscillations and demonstrate the heterogeneity of coupling dynamics, which must be taken into account when formulating mechanistic accounts of sleep-related memory processing.

Propofol-induced unresponsiveness is associated with impaired feedforward connectivity in cortical hierarchy	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						general anesthesia; connectivity; consciousness; electroencephalography; transcranial magnetic stimulation	FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; INDUCED RESPONSES; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; ANESTHESIA; CONSCIOUSNESS; EEG; CORTEX; BREAKDOWN; SLEEP	Background: Impaired consciousness has been associated with impaired cortical signal propagation after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We hypothesised that the reduced current propagation under propofol-induced unresponsiveness is associated with changes in both feedforward and feedback connectivity across the cortical hierarchy. Methods: Eight subjects underwent left occipital TMS coupled with high-density EEG recordings during wakefulness and propofol-induced unconsciousness. Spectral analysis was applied to responses recorded from sensors overlying six hierarchical cortical sources involved in visual processing. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of induced time-frequency responses and evoked response potentials were used to investigate propofol's effects on connectivity between regions. Results: Sensor space analysis demonstrated that propofol reduced both induced and evoked power after TMS in occipital, parietal, and frontal electrodes. Bayesian model selection supported a DCM with hierarchical feedforward and feedback connections. DCM of induced EEG responses revealed that the primary effect of propofol was impaired feedforward responses in cross-frequency theta/alphaegamma coupling and within frequency theta coupling (F contrast, family-wise error corrected P< 0.05). An exploratory analysis (thresholded at uncorrected P< 0.001) also suggested that propofol impaired feedforward and feedback beta band coupling. Post hoc analyses showed impairments in all feedforward connections and one feedback connection from parietal to occipital cortex. DCM of the evoked response potential showed impaired feedforward connectivity between left-sided occipital and parietal cortex (T contrast P = 0.004, Bonferroni corrected). Conclusions: Propofol-induced loss of consciousness is associated with impaired hierarchical feedforward connectivity assessed by EEG after occipital TMS.	[Sanders, R.

J	Mert, A; Akan, A				Mert, Ahmet; Akan, Aydin			Emotion recognition from EEG signals by using multivariate empirical mode decomposition	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Empirical mode decomposition; Multivariate empirical mode decomposition; Emotion recognition; Electroencephalogram	CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURE	This paper explores the advanced properties of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its multivariate extension (MEMD) for emotion recognition. Since emotion recognition using EEG is a challenging study due to nonstationary behavior of the signals caused by complicated neuronal activity in the brain, sophisticated signal processing methods are required to extract the hidden patterns in the EEG. In addition, multichannel analysis is another issue to be considered when dealing with EEG signals. EMD is a recently proposed iterative method to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary time series. It decomposes a signal into a set of oscillations called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) without requiring a set of basis functions. In this study, a MEMD-based feature extraction method is proposed to process multichannel EEG signals for emotion recognition. The multichannel IMFs extracted by MEMD are analyzed using various time and frequency domain techniques such as power ratio, power spectral density, entropy, Hjorth parameters and correlation as features of valance and arousal scales of the participants. The proposed method is applied to the DEAP emotional EEG data set, and the results are compared with similar previous studies for benchmarking.

Different techniques like electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have traditionally been used to find biomarkers for autism, but there have been very few attempts for a combined or multimodal approach of EEG, fMRI, and DTI to understand the neurobiological basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we explore how the structural brain network correlate with the functional brain network, such that the information encompassed by these two could be uncovered only by using the latter. In this paper, source localization from EEG using independent component analysis and dipole fitting has been applied first, followed by selecting those dipoles that are closest to the active regions identified with fMRI. This allows translating the high temporal resolution of EEG to estimate time varying connectivity at the spatial source level. Our analysis shows that the estimated functional connectivity between two active regions can be correlated with the physical properties of the structure obtained from DTI analysis. This constitutes a first step toward opening the possibility of using pervasive EEG to monitor the long-term impact of ASD treatment without the need for frequent expensive fMRI or DTI investigations.

Here, we used rhythmic auditory and visual stimulation to entrain neural oscillations to assess whether theta activity contributes to successful memory retrieval. In two separate experiments, human subjects studied words and were subsequently tested on memory for the words ('item recognition') and the context in which each had been previously studied ('source memory'). Between study and test, subjects in the entrainment groups were exposed to audiovisual stimuli designed to enhance activity at 5.5 Hz, whereas subjects in the control groups were exposed to white noise (Expt. 1) or 14 Hz entrainment (Expt. 2). Theta entrainment selectively increased source memory performance in both studies. Electroencephalography (EEG) data in Expt. 2 revealed that theta entrainment resulted in band-specific enhancement of theta power during the entrainment period and during post-entrainment memory retrieval. These results demonstrate a direct link between theta activity and episodic memory retrieval. Targeted manipulation of theta activity could be a promising new approach to enhance theta activity and memory performance in healthy individuals and in patients with memory disorders.

Variability in the location of high frequency oscillations during prolonged intracranial EEG recordings	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; LONG-TERM; FOCAL EPILEPSY; SEIZURE LOCALIZATION; SURGICAL RESECTION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FAST RIPPLES; HIGH-GAMMA	The rate of interictal high frequency oscillations (HFOs) is a promising biomarker of the seizure onset zone, though little is known about its consistency over hours to days. Here we test whether the highest HFO-rate channels are consistent across different 10-min segments of EEG during sleep. An automated HFO detector and blind source separation are applied to nearly 3000 total hours of data from 121 subjects, including 12 control subjects without epilepsy. Although interictal HFOs are significantly correlated with the seizure onset zone, the precise localization is consistent in only 22% of patients. The remaining patients either have one intermittent source (16%), different sources varying over time (45%), or insufficient HFOs (17%). Multiple HFO networks are found in patients with both one and multiple seizure foci. These results indicate that robust HFO interpretation requires prolonged analysis in context with other clinical data, rather than isolated review of short data segments.

Utilization of independent component analysis for accurate pathological ripple detection in intracranial EEG recordings recorded extra- and intra-operatively	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High-frequency oscillation; Ripple; Independent component analysis; Detector	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; 80-500 HZ; EPILEPSY; IDENTIFICATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; SURGERY; INFOMAX; SPIKES	Objective: To develop and validate a detector that identifies ripple (80-200 Hz) events in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in a referential montage and utilizes independent component analysis (ICA) to eliminate or reduce high-frequency artifact contamination. Also, investigate the correspondence of detected ripples and the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Methods: iEEG recordings from 16 patients were first band-pass filtered (80-600 Hz) and Infomax ICA was next applied to derive the first independent component (IC1). IC1 was subsequently pruned, and an artifact index was derived to reduce the identification of high-frequency events introduced by the reference electrode signal. A Hilbert detector identified ripple events in the processed iEEG recordings using amplitude and duration criteria. The identified ripple events were further classified and characterized as true or false ripple on spikes, or ripples on oscillations by utilizing a topographical analysis to their time-frequency plot, and confirmed by visual inspection. Results: The signal to noise ratio was improved by pruning IC1. The precision of the detector for ripple events was 91.27 +/- 4.3%, and the sensitivity of the detector was 79.4 +/- 3.0% (N = 16 patients, 5842 ripple events). The sensitivity and precision of the detector was equivalent in iEEG recordings obtained during sleep or intra-operatively. Across all the patients, true ripple on spike rates and also the rates of false ripple on spikes, that were generated due to filter ringing, classified the seizure onset zone (SOZ) with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of > 76%. The magnitude and spectral content of true ripple on spikes generated in the SOZ was distinct as compared with the ripples generated in the NSOZ (p < .001). Conclusions: Utilizing ICA to analyze iEEG recordings in referential montage provides many benefits to the study of high-frequency oscillations. The ripple rates and properties defined using this approach may accurately delineate the seizure onset zone. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

EEG Resting State Functional Connectivity in Adult Dyslexics Using Phase Lag Index and Graph Analysis	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); functional connectivity; network; graph theory; minimum spanning tree; dyslexia	MINIMUM SPANNING TREE; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; DIRECTED CONNECTIVITY; READING-DISABILITY; NEURAL SYSTEMS; ANGULAR GYRUS; POOR READERS; WHOLE-BRAIN	Developmental dyslexia may involve deficits in functional connectivity across widespread brain networks that enable fluent reading. We investigated the large-scale organization of electroencephalography (EEG) functional networks at rest in 28 dyslexics and 36 typically reading adults. For each frequency band (delta, theta alpha and beta), we assessed functional connectivity strength with the phase lag index (PLI). Network topology was examined using minimum spanning tree (MST) graphs derived from the functional connectivity matrices. We found significant group differences in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). The graph analysis indicated more interconnected nodes, in dyslexics compared to typical readers. The graph metrics were significantly correlated with age in dyslexics but not in typical readers, which may indicate more heterogeneity in maturation of brain networks in dyslexics. The present findings support the involvement of alpha oscillations in higher cognition and the sensitivity of graph metrics to characterize functional networks in adult dyslexia. Finally, the current results extend our previous findings on children.

Intranasal oxytocin decreases cross-frequency coupling of neural oscillations at rest	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Intranasal oxytocin; Neural oscillations; Cross-frequency coupling	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG; SYSTEM; PERSONALITY; INHIBITION; MOTIVATION; ATTENTION; AROUSAL; PLASMA; IMPACT	Recent research has suggested a role for the hormone oxytocin in social cognition and behavior. Administration of intranasal oxytocin modulates multiple brain regions during experimental tasks; however, the neural mechanisms that underscore the changes associated with oxytocin administration are yet to be fully elucidated. In a double-blind placebo controlled design using electroencephalography, the effects of intranasal oxytocin on neural oscillations (delta, theta, alpha, beta) and their coupling during the resting state were examined. Prior work suggested that coupling of slow and fast waves are indicative of the integration of motivational and cognitive processes. While neural oscillations were unaffected by oxytocin relative to placebo administration; oxytocin decreased delta-beta, delta-alpha, theta-alpha, and theta-beta coupling. These findings suggest that one mechanism through which intranasal oxytocin may modulate brain and behavior is through affecting the cross frequency coupling of neural oscillations, a phenomenon that has been associated with specific cognitive and motivational states.

Here, we assessed perceptual, motor, and autonomic responses to brief noxious heat stimuli and recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in humans. Multilevel mediation analysis reveals that each pain dimension is subserved by a distinct pattern of EEG responses and, conversely, that each EEG response differentially contributes to the different dimensions of pain. In particular, the translation of noxious stimuli into autonomic and motor responses involved the earliest N1 wave, whereas pain perception was mediated by later N2 and P2 waves. Gamma oscillations mediated motor responses rather than pain perception. These findings represent progress towards a mechanistic understanding of the brain processes translating noxious stimuli into pain and suggest that perceptual, motor, and autonomic dimensions of pain are partially independent rather than serial processes.

The purpose of this study was to compare mu rhythm oscillatory activity between (PWS) and matched typically fluent speakers (TFS) during spontaneously fluent overt and covert speech production tasks. Independent component analysis identified bilateral mu components from 24/27 PWS and matched TFS that localized over premotor cortex. Time-frequency analysis of the left hemisphere mu clusters demonstrated significantly reduced mu-alpha and mu-beta ERD (p(CLUSTER) < 0.05) in PWS across the time course of overt and covert speech production, while no group differences were found in the right hemisphere in any condition. Results were interpreted through the framework of State Feedback Control. They suggest that weak forward modeling and evaluation of sensory feedback across the time course of speech production characterizes the trait related sensorimotor impairment in PWS. This weakness is proposed to represent an underlying sensorimotor instability that may predispose the speech of PWS to breakdown.

Here, we developed a connectome-based brain network model that integrates individual structural and functional data with neural population dynamics to support multi-scale neurophysiological inference. Simulated populations were linked by structural connectivity and, as a novelty, driven by electroencephalography (EEG) source activity. Simulations not only predicted subjects' individual resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and spatial network topologies over 20 minutes of activity, but more importantly, they also revealed precise neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie and link six empirical observations from different scales and modalities: (1) resting-state fMRI oscillations, (2) functional connectivity networks, (3) excitation-inhibition balance, (4, 5) inverse relationships between alpha-rhythms, spike-firing and fMRI on short and long time scales, and (6) fMRI power-law scaling. These findings underscore the potential of this new modelling framework for general inference and integration of neurophysiological knowledge to complement empirical studies.

In this article, we highlight the potentials of iEEG in exploring functions of the human brain while also considering its limitations. The iEEG signal provides anatomically precise information about the selective engagement of neuronal populations at the millimeter scale and the temporal dynamics of their engagement at the millisecond scale. If several nodes of a given network are monitored simultaneously with implanted electrodes, the iEEG signals can also reveal information about functional interactions within and across networks during different stages of neural computation. As such, human iEEG can complement other methods of neuroscience beyond simply replicating what is already known, or can be known, from noninvasive lines of research in humans or from invasive recordings in nonhuman mammalian brains.

In this context, EEG beta oscillations have been recently associated with attention and working memory processing that underlie math achievement. Due to that EEG coherence represents a useful measure of brain functional connectivity, we aimed to contrast the EEG coherence in forty 8-to-9-year-old children with different math skill levels (High: HA, and Low achievement: LA) according to their arithmetic scores in the Fourth Edition of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT-4) while performing a symbolic magnitude comparison task (i.e. determining which of two numbers is numerically larger). The analysis showed significantly greater coherence over the right hemisphere in the two groups, but with a distinctive connectivity pattern. Whereas functional connectivity in the HA group was predominant in parietal areas, especially involving beta frequencies, the LA group showed more extensive frontoparietal relationships, with higher participation of delta, theta and alpha band frequencies, along with a distinct time-frequency domain expression. The results seem to reflect that lower math achievements in children mainly associate with cognitive processing steps beyond stimulus encoding, along with the need of further attentional resources and cognitive control than their peers, suggesting a lower degree of numerical processing automation.

Effect of sensory attenuation on cortical movement-related oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; event-related desynchronization; event-related synchronization; movement; sensory attenuation	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; PARAPLEGIC PATIENTS; PASSIVE MOVEMENTS; TENDON VIBRATION; FOOT MOVEMENTS; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTOR AREAS; BRAIN	This study examined the impact of induced sensory deficits on cortical, movement-related oscillations measured using electroencephalography (EEG). We hypothesized that EEG patterns in healthy subjects with induced sensory reduction would be comparable to EEG found after chronic loss of sensory feedback. EEG signals from 64 scalp locations were measured from 10 healthy subjects. Participants dorsiflexed their ankle after prolonged vibration of the tibialis anterior (TA). Beta band time frequency decompositions were calculated using wavelets and compared across conditions. Changes in patterns of movement-related brain activity were observed following attenuation of sensory feedback. A significant decrease in beta power of eventrelated synchronization was associated with simple ankle dorsiflexion after prolonged vibration of the TA. Attenuation of sensory feedback in young, healthy subjects led to a corresponding decrease in beta band synchronization. This temporary change in beta oscillations suggests that these modulations are a mechanism for sensorimotor integration. The loss of sensory feedback found in spinal cord injury patients contributes to changes in EEG signals underlying motor commands. Similar alterations in cortical signals in healthy subjects with reduced sensory feedback implies these changes reflect normal sensorimotor integration after reduced sensory input rather than brain plasticity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Transient attenuation of sensory afferents in young, healthy adults led to similar changes in brain activity found previously in volunteers with incomplete spinal cord injury. Beta band power associated with ankle movement in these controls was attenuated after prolonged vibration of the tibialis anterior. Evoked potential measurements suggest that prolonged vibration reduces phasing across trials as the mechanism behind this attenuation of cortical activity.

J	Goksu, H				Goksu, Huseyin			EEG based epileptiform pattern recognition inside and outside the seizure states	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Automatic diagnosis; Epilepsy; EEG; Wavelet packet decomposition; Entropy; MLP	WAVELET PACKET TRANSFORM; LINEAR DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS; PERCEPTRON	Automatic diagnosis of epilepsy by computers based on Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is a beneficial practice which increases recognition rate, speeds up diagnosis and saves physicians from long hours of EEG inspection. Most studies on this subject report results on detecting seizures; but seizures, which appear during the ictal states are very rare to catch. Therefore, an efficient algorithm must be able to detect epilepsy during nonseizure periods, or in other words interictal states as well. We present a novel algorithm to detect epileptiform patterns during both states: ictal and interictal. For this purpose, we use wavelet packet analysis (WPA) rather than traditional time and frequency domain methods. WPA, by providing arbitrary time-frequency resolution, enables analyzing signals of stationary and non-stationary nature. It has better time representation than Fourier analysis and better high frequency resolution than Wavelet analysis. WPA subimages are analyzed further to obtain feature vectors of Log Energy Entropy, Norm Entropy and Energy. These features are fed into a classifier, multilayer perceptron (MLP). We test our method on a well-known and widely studied database which includes healthy, ictal and interictal EEG recordings. Normal vs. Ictal and Interictal vs. Ictal zone classifications are realized at 100% accuracy by using any of the three features. Nonseizure vs. Seizure state classification is realized with 100% accuracy using Norm entropy. Normal vs. Interictal zone classification is achieved with 100% accuracy using Log Energy Entropy. Normal vs. Interictal vs. lctal Zone classifications are considered as two-step binary classifications of Nonseizure vs. Seizure state followed by Normal vs. Interictal zone both of which are realized at 100% accuracy. Therefore, jointly use of Log Energy Entropy and Norm entropy is able to realize all possible classifications with 100% accuracy. We make the most comprehensive comparison of results belonging to all possible classification categories reported on the same datasets. The proposed method outperforms all the other results in all possible classifications by achieving 100% accuracy in all possible classifications. The method presented is the only single method that achieves this. Overall, the method provides us with a promising tool for the detection of epileptiform patterns during and outside the seizure states. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This detector does not presuppose a specific number of clusters and has a good performance. First, the HFO candidates are detected by an initial detection method which distinguishes HFOs from background activities. Then, as significant features, fuzzy entropy, short-time energy, power ratio, and spectral centroid of the HFO candidates are investigated and constructed as a feature vector. Finally, the feature vector is used as the input of the fuzzy-c-means-quantization-error-modeling-based expectation-maximization-Gaussian mixture model clustering algorithm. This algorithm has the advantages of detecting HFOs and avoiding false detection caused by artifacts.

This component is usually measured approximately 200-300 ms post-feedback at a single electrode in the frontal-central area (e.g., Fz or FCz). The present review argues that this singular focus on the FRN fails to leverage EEG's greatest strength, its temporal resolution, by underutilizing the rich variety of event-related potential (ERP) and EEG time-frequency components encompassing the wider temporal heterogeneity of reward processing. The primary objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of often overlooked ERP and EEG correlates beyond the FRN in the context of reward processing with the secondary goal of guiding future research toward multistage experimental designs and multicomponent analyses that leverage the temporal power of EEG. We comprehensively review reward-related ERPs (including the FRN, readiness potential or RP, stimulus-preceding negativity or SPN, contingent-negative variation or CNV, cue-related N2 and P3, Feedback-P3, and late-positive potential or LPP/slow-wave), and reward-related EEG time-frequency components (changes in power at alpha, beta, theta, and delta bands). These electrophysiological signatures display distinct time-courses, scalp topographies, and reflect independent psychological processes during anticipatory and/or outcome stages of reward processing. Special consideration is given to the time-course of each component and factors that significantly contribute to component variation. Concluding remarks identify current limitations along with recommendations for potential important future directions.

J	Liu, P				Liu, Peng			Time-frequency analysis of event-related potentials associated with the origin of the motor interference effect from dangerous objects	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motor interference effect; Dangerous objects; Danger evaluation; Go/NoGo task; Theta ERS; Alpha ERD	GO/NO-GO TASK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; BAND OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; ERP COMPONENT; EEG ALPHA; THETA; DYNAMICS	Previous research has suggested that the motor interference effect of dangerous objects may originate from danger evaluations rather than direct response inhibition, as evidenced by a larger parietal P3 amplitude (which represents danger evaluations) under dangerous conditions than under safe conditions and an insignificant difference between dangerous and safe conditions in the frontal P3 component (which represents response inhibition). However, an alternative explanation exists for the null effect of the frontal P3 component. Specifically, this null effect may be attributed to cancellation between the theta and delta band oscillations, and only theta band oscillations represent response inhibition. To clarify this issue, the current study decomposed event-related potential data into different frequency bands using short-time Fourier transform. The results identified an insignificant difference of theta oscillations between dangerous and safe conditions in the mid-frontal area during a 200-500-ms time window. Instead, decreased alpha oscillations were identified in the dangerous compared with the safe condition in Go trials in the right parietal area during a 100-660-ms time window. Regression analyses further indicated that the alpha oscillations significantly contributed to the parietal P3 amplitude in the right parietal area. In summary, the results indicated that when an emergent dangerous object is encountered during the execution of prepared motor actions, an individual may tend to chiefly evaluate the potential dangerousness rather than directly suppress the prepared motor actions toward the dangerous object.

Detecting Epilepsy in EEG Signals Using Time, Frequency and Time-Frequency Domain Features	COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS	Studies in Systems Decision and Control		English	Article; Book Chapter							MATCHING PURSUIT; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; RHYTHM	Seizures caused by epilepsy are unprovoked, they disrupt the mantel activity of the patient and impair their normal motor and sensorial functions, endangering the patient's well being. Exploiting today's technology it is possible toe create automatic systems to monitor and evaluate patients. An area of special interest is the automatic analysis of EEG signals. This paper presents extensive analysis of feature extraction and classification methods that have reported good results in other EEG based problems. Several methods are detailed to extract 52 features from the time, frequency and time-frequency domains in order to characterize the EEG signals. Additionally, 10 different classification models, together with a feature selection method, are implemented using these features to identify if a signal corresponds to an epileptic state. The experiments were performed using the standard BONN and the proposed method achieve results comparable to those in the state-of-the-art for the three and four classes problems.	[Hernandez, D.

Visual identification of seizure activity from long-term electroencephalography (EEG) is tedious, time-consuming and leads to human error. Therefore, there is a need for an automated classification system. Methods: In this paper, we introduce a tool called CADFES: computerized automated detection of focal epileptic seizures. For the study, total 41.66 hours of EEG data from the Bern-Barcelona database was used. Set of 28 features were extracted from time, frequency, and statistical domain and significant features were selected using neighborhood component analysis (NCA). In NCA, optimization of regularization parameter ensured better classification accuracy (less classification loss) with seven features. The performance of the algorithm was assessed using support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) classifiers. Results: Experimental results revealed sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive rate, negative predictive rate, and area under the curve of 97.6%, 94.4%, 96.1%, 92.9%, 98.8% and 0.96 respectively using the SVM classifier. Finally, MATLAB based software tool referred to as CADFES was introduced for automated classification of focal and non-focal seizures. Comparison results ensure that proposed study is superior to existing methods. Hence, it is expected to perform better at the hospitals for automated classification of focal epileptic seizures in real-time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We aim to evaluate the lateralization value of beamformer analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in TLE. Methods: MEG data from 14 TLE patients were analyzed through beamformer analysis. We measured the hemispherical power distribution of beamformer sources and calculated the lateralization index (LI). We calculated the LI at multiple frequencies to explore the frequency dependency and at the delta frequency to define laterality. LI values ranging from -1 to -0.05 indicated right hemispheric dominance. LI values ranging from 0.05 to 1 indicated left hemispheric dominance. LI values ranging from -0.05 to 0.05 defined bilaterality. We measured the power of beamformer sources with a 9-s duration to explore time dependency. Results: The beamformer analysis showed that 10/14 patients had power dominance ipsilateral to resection. The delta frequency band had a higher lateralization value than other frequency bands. A time-dependent power fluctuation was found in the delta frequency band. Conclusions: MEG beamformer analysis, especially in the delta band, might efficiently provide additional information regarding lateralization in TLE.

EEG-based characterizations of sleep stage progression contribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many pathologies of sleep. Several prior reports explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable discrimination of sleep stages at lower cost in the home. However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes placed on the cranial vertex or occiput, which are both uncomfortable and difficult to position. Previous studies of sleep stage scoring that used only frontal electrodes with a hierarchical decision tree motivated this paper, in which we have taken advantage of rectifier neural network for detecting hierarchical features and long short-term memory network for sequential data learning to optimize classification performance with single-channel recordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous recording of the electro-oculogram. Evaluation of data from 62 people (with 494 hours sleep) demonstrated better performance of our analytical algorithm than is available from existing approaches with vertex or occipital electrode placements. Use of this recording configuration with neural network deconvolution promises to make clinically indicated home sleep studies practical.

This situation usually causes brain ischemia. Due to this or other factors, neurological disorders such as stroke and psychiatric disorders are encountered during the perioperative period. In this study, it was aimed to compare neuroelectrical activity measured during extracorporeal circulation in coronary bypass surgery with preoperative values of the patient. Materials and Methods: Six male patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery in cardiovascular surgery participated in the study. Both the preoperative (Pr0) and during operation (In0) electroencephalography (EEG) data obtained from the frontal region. The data (delta; 0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (theta; 3.5-7 Hz), alpha (alpha; 8-14 Hz), beta (beta;15-30 Hz) ve gamma (gamma; 30-48 Hz) frequency power components were calculated. An equal number of Pr0 and In0 period EEG power values from each participant were taken and used for statistical analysis. Results with a p-value of Less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The main finding of the study is that the frequency power spectrum values show a decrease in the extracorporeal circulation. When the percentage reduction is compared, it is seen that the fast frequencies decrease at a statistically significant with respect to the slow frequencies. Conclusion: Changes in the EEG frequencies of this preliminary study indicate that brain functions are reduced during extracorporeal circulation. Ina broader group of patients, the study included a multi-channel EEG, as well as near-infra-red spectroscopy for cortical blood flow monitoring and the addition of neurocognitive assessment tests, will give us some indicator parameters calculated by meta-analyses from all these data. Early detection of the brain damage and take precaution may be achieved with this indicator data.

The approach combines high-resolution time-frequency analysis and array signal processing methods. The improved performance of MTFDs is demonstrated using several applications including source localization based on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and automated component separation (ACS) of non-stationary sources, with focus on blind source separation. The MTFD approach is further illustrated by two applications to EEG signals. One specifically uses ACS and DOA estimation methods for artifacts removal and source localization. Another uses MTFDs for cross-channel coherence/causality analysis. Data and code are provided to allow readers to reproduce the results presented, and apply these methods to their own data [1].

In this study, we were interested in testing whether specific brain activation-the asymmetry in engagement of the prefrontal cortex-would be related to consumer choice. Subjects saw products and subsequently decided how much they were willing to pay for each product, while undergoing neuroimaging using electroencephalography. Our results demonstrate that prefrontal asymmetry in the gamma frequency band, and a trend in the beta frequency band that was recorded during product viewing was significantly related to subsequent WTP responses. Frontal asymmetry in the alpha band was not related to WTP decisions. Besides suggesting separate neuropsychological mechanisms of consumer choice, we find that one specific measure-the prefrontal gamma asymmetry-was most strongly related to WTP responses, and was most coupled to the actual decision phase. These findings are discussed in light of the psychology of WTP calculations, and in relation to the recent emergence of consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing.

The fluctuations in alertness can be investigated as changes in the brain network connections, reflected in the direction and magnitude of the information transferred. Those changes are induced not only by the time on task but also by the quality of sleep. In an unprecedented 5-month longitudinal study, daily sampling actigraphy and EEG data were collected during a sustained-attention driving task within a near-real-world environment. Using a performance index associated with the subjects' reaction times and a predictive score related to the sleep quality, we identify fatigue levels in drivers and investigate the shifts in their effective connectivity in different frequency bands, through the analysis of the dynamical coupling between brain areas. Study results support the hypothesis that combining EEG, behavioral and actigraphy data can reveal new features of the decline in alertness. In addition, the use of directed measures such as the Convergent Cross Mapping can contribute to the development of fatigue countermeasure devices.

The electroencephalography (EEG) technique combined with different signal analysis approaches has been especially successful in revealing the detailed dynamic properties of the neural response to exogenous stimulation. In this analysis, we evaluated the nonlinear structure of the EEG signal using fractal theory in rest and visual stimulation (checkerboard reversal at 8, 14 and 28 Hz). Our analysis showed a significant influence of stimulation on the fractal structure of EEG signal. On comparison between different conditions, 14-Hz steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), previously shown to trigger an optimal brain response, exhibited the greatest influence on the complexity of the EEG signal. On the other hand, we observed the lowest complexity of EEG signal in the post-stimulation rest period. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in the fractal structure of the EEG signal between rest and different stimulation conditions. These findings demonstrate for the first time a direct relationship between the efficiency of brain processing and the complexity of the measured EEG signal, which could be employed for objective assessment and classification in various experimental paradigms.

The neurophysiology of subjective EA, among other mind-brain-body phenomena, can best be tested when subjects are stimulated in a natural fashion. Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables naturalistic experimental stimulation and thus promises to increase the ecological validity of research findings i.e., how well they generalize to real-life settings. In this study, 45 participants experienced virtual rollercoaster rides while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was then trained on the alpha-frequency (8-12 Hz) component of the EEG signal (input) and the retrospectively acquired continuous reports of subjective EA (target). With the LSTM-based model, subjective EA could be predicted significantly above chance level. This demonstrates a novel EEG-based decoding approach for subjective states of experience in naturalistic research designs using VR.

Behavioral evidence shows that conflict control occurs over successive trials as well as longer time scales of trial blocks, but the relation among time scales as well as their neural mechanisms are unclear. This study used measures of behavior, EEG, and a simple quantitative model to test the hypothesis that conflict control at the block level is not exclusively driven by control adjustments over successive trials. Young adults performed an auditory Simon task, and the base rate of compatible vs. incompatible trials was manipulated in separate blocks (25, 50, 75% compatible). EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) to define cortical mechanisms of any base rate and trial-by-trial sequence effects. Reaction time measures had both sequence and base rate effects. Two fronto-medial ICA components indexed sequence and base rate effects, with specific profiles for evoked potentials and oscillations in the theta and alpha frequency bands. Predictive modeling showed that sequence effects accounted for a minority of the variance on behavioral and ICA measures (all < 36%). The results strongly suggest that the base rate manipulation affected behavior and many neural measures beyond the influence of sequence effects.

However, the underlying mechanisms of SCS remain poorly understood. This study recorded resting-state electroencephalograms (EEG) from 16 patients with minimally conscious state (MCS), before and after SCS, and investigated the mechanisms of SCS on the neuronal dynamics in MCS patients. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), combined with surrogate data method, was employed to measure the long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) of the EEG signals. A surrogate data method was utilized to acquire the genuine DFA exponents (GDFAE) reflecting the genuine LRTCs of brain activity. We analyzed the GDFAE in four brain regions (frontal, central, posterior, and occipital) at five EEG frequency bands [delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz)]. The GDFAE values ranged from 0.5 to 1, and showed temporal and spatial variation between the pre-SCS and the post-SCS states. We found that the channels with GDFAE spread wider after SCS. This phenomenon may indicate that more cortical areas were engaged in the information integration after SCS. In addition, the GDFAE values increased significantly in the frontal area at delta, theta, and alpha bands after SCS. At the theta band, a significant increase in GDFAE was observed in the occipital area. No significant change was found at beta or gamma bands in any brain region. These findings show that the enhanced LRTCs after SCS occurred primarily at low-frequency bands in the frontal and occipital regions. As the LRTCs reflect the long-range temporal integration of EEG signals, our results indicate that information integration became more "complex" after SCS. We concluded that the brain activities at low-frequency oscillations, particularly in the frontal and occipital regions, were improved by SCS.

There is a vast body of research that assesses the usability and interfaces of the existing navigation systems but very few investigations study the impact on the brain activity based on navigation-based driving. In this paper, a real-world experiment is designed to acquire the electroencephalography (EEG) and in-car information to analyze the dynamic brain activity while the driver is performing the lane-changing task based on the auditory instructions from an in-car navigation system. The results show that auditory cues can influence the speed and increase the frontal EEG delta and beta power, which is related to motor preparation and decision making during a lane change. However, there were no significant results on the alpha power.

However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms. EEG-based clinical sedation monitoring should consider the effect of drug types on EEG dynamics.

Several feature extraction methods, such as fast Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and time-frequency distributions, are commonly employed for this purpose. However, when applied to different datasets, the alignment between the method and machine learning algorithms varies significantly. Through an EEG experiment, we test a simultaneous analysis and unsupervised learning application that can effectively determine what feature extraction method will potentially lead to a higher prediction precision when the ground truth is provided by the participants at a later stage.

This can help to understand the limits of the model and how it may be improved, in addition to possibly provide insight about the data itself. Schirrmeister et al. (2017) have recently reported promising results for EEG decoding with deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) trained in an end-to-end manner and, with a causal visualization approach, showed that they learn to use spectral amplitude changes in the input. In this study, we investigate how ConvNets represent spectral features through the sequence of intermediate stages of the network. We show higher sensitivity to EEG phase features at earlier stages and higher sensitivity to EEG amplitude features at later stages. Intriguingly, we observed a specialization of individual stages of the network to the classical EEG frequency bands alpha, beta, and high gamma. Furthermore, we find first evidence that particularly in the last convolutional layer, the network learns to detect more complex oscillatory patterns beyond spectral phase and amplitude, reminiscent of the representation of complex visual features in later layers of ConvNets in computer vision tasks. Our findings thus provide insights into how ConvNets hierarchically represent spectral EEG features in their intermediate layers and suggest that ConvNets can exploit and might help to better understand the compositional structure of EEG time series.

This paper proposes a classification method of two-class motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), in which EEG signals from C3, C4 and Cz electrodes of publicly available BCI competition IV dataset 2b were used to test the performance of CNN. We investigate CNN with a form of input from short time Fourier transform (STFT) combining time, frequency and location information. Fisher discriminant analysis-type F-score based on band pass (BP) feature and power spectra density (PSD) feature are employed respectively to select the subject-optimal frequency bands. In the experiments, typical frequency bands related to motor imagery EEG signals, subject-optimal frequency bands and Extension Frequency Bands are employed respectively as the frequency range of the input image of CNN. The better classification performance of Extension Frequency Bands show that CNN can extract optimal feature from frequency information automatically. The classification result also demonstrates that the proposed approach is more competitive in prediction of left/right hand motor imagery task compared with other state-of-art approaches.

Besides the effects of sleep depth we investigated how sleep-specific EEG patterns (i.e. sleep spindles and slow oscillations [SOs]) relate to stimulus processing. Using 256-channel EEG we studied processing of auditory stimuli by means of event-related oscillatory responses (de-/synchronisation, ERD/ERS) and potentials (ERPs) in N - 17 healthy sleepers. We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (SON vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic emotional relevance (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice, FV/UFV). Results reveal that evaluation of voice familiarity continues during all NREM sleep stages and even REM sleep suggesting a 'sentinel processing mode' of the human brain in the absence of wake-like consciousness. Especially UFV stimuli elicit larger responses in a 1-15 Hz range suggesting they continue being salient. Beyond this, we find that sleep spindles and the negative slope of SOs attenuate information processing. However, unlike previously suggested they do not uniformly inhibit information processing, but inhibition seems to be scaled to stimulus salience.

Our aim was to identify the sources of GS and to analyze the direction of information flow in cerebral networks at the beginning of phasic movements, and during medium-strength isometric contraction of the hand. Methods: We measured 64-channel electroencephalography in 11 healthy volunteers (age: 25 +/- 8 years; four females); surface electromyography detected the movements of the dominant hand. In Task 1, subjects kept a constant medium-strength contraction of the first dorsal interosseus muscle, and performed a superimposed repetitive voluntary self-paced brisk squeeze of an object. In Task 2, brisk, and in Task 3, constant contractions were performed. Time-frequency analysis of the EEG signal was performed with the multitaper method. GS sources were identified in five frequency bands (30-49, 51-75, 76-99, 101-125, and 126-149 Hz) with beamformer inverse solution dynamic imaging of coherent sources. The direction of information flow was estimated by renormalized partial directed coherence for each frequency band. The data-driven surrogate test, and the time reversal technique were performed to identify significant connections. Results: In all tasks, we depicted the first three common sources for the studied frequency bands that were as follows: contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (S1M1), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC) and supplementary motor cortex (SMA). GS was detected in narrower low-(similar to 30-60 Hz) and high-frequency bands (>51-60 Hz) in the contralateral thalamus and ipsilateral cerebellum in all three tasks. The contralateral posterior parietal cortex was activated only in Task 1. In every task, S1M1 had efferent information flow to the SMA and the dPFC while dPFC had no detected afferent connections to the network in the gamma range. Cortical-subcortical information flow captured by the GS was dynamically variable in the narrower frequency bands for the studied movements. Conclusion: A distinct cortical network was identified for GS in voluntary hand movement tasks. Our study revealed that S1M1 modulated the activity of interconnected cortical areas through GS, while subcortical structures modulated the motor network dynamically, and specifically for the studied movement program.

The aim of this work was to identify fluctuations of fractal properties of EEG time series due to circadian rhythms. In twenty-one healthy volunteers (all males, age between 20 and 30 years, chronotype: neutral type) high density EEG recordings at rest in open and closed eyes conditions were acquired in 4 times of the day (8.00 a.m., 11.30 a.m., 2.30 p.m., 7.00 p.m.). A vigilance task (Psychomotor Vigilance Test, PVT) was also performed. Detrended fluctuation Analysis (DFA) of envelope of alpha, beta and theta rhythms was performed, as well as Highuchi fractal dimension (HFD) of the whole band EEG. Our results evidenced circadian fluctuations of fractal features of EEG at rest in both eyes closed and eyes open conditions. Lower values of DFA exponent were found in the time T1 in closed eyes condition, likely effect of the sleep inertia. An alpha DFA exponent reduction was found also in central sensory-motor areas at time T3, the day time in which the sleepiness can be present. In eyes open condition, HFD lowered during the day. In eyes closed condition, an HFD increase was observed in central and frontal regions at time T2, the time in which alertness reaches its maximum and homeostatic sleep pressure is low. Complexity and the persistence of temporal correlations of brain rhythms change during daytime, parallel to changes in alertness and performance.

For that reason, imaging methods need to identify distinct brain regions that concurrently generate oscillatory activity, with adequate separation in space and time. Yet, spatial smearing and inhomogeneous signal-to-noise are challenging factors to source reconstruction from external sensor data. The detection of weak sources in the presence of stronger regional activity nearby is a typical complication of MEG/EEG source imaging. We propose a novel, hypothesis-driven source reconstruction approach to address these methodological challenges. The imaging with embedded statistics (iES) method is a subspace scanning technique that constrains the mapping problem to the actual experimental design. A major benefit is that, regardless of signal strength, the contributions from all oscillatory sources, which activity is consistent with the tested hypothesis, are equalized in the statistical maps produced. We present extensive evaluations of iES on group MEG data, for mapping 1) induced oscillations using experimental contrasts, 2) ongoing narrow-band oscillations in the resting-state, 3) co-modulation of brain-wide oscillatory power with a seed region, and 4) co-modulation of oscillatory power with peripheral signals (pupil dilation). Along the way, we demonstrate several advantages of iES over standard source imaging approaches. These include the detection of oscillatory coupling without rejection of zero-phase coupling, and detection of ongoing oscillations in deeper brain regions, where signal-to-noise conditions are unfavorable. We also show that iES provides a separate evaluation of oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization in experimental contrasts, which has important statistical advantages. The flexibility of iES allows it to be adjusted to many experimental questions in systems neuroscience.

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in Theta and Beta frequency bands and Time-Frequency analysis were conducted by the Brain Electrical Source Analysis (BESA, Germany). The result showed the power in the beta band considerably increased in the electrode column near the left hand area and the higher amplitude was observed in the electrode column in the vicinity of the occipital area during visual stimulation tasks. This primary quantitative analysis of ECoG may provide additional information in the mapping of eloquent areas in the brain.

One measure of feedback processing, the feedback negativity (FN), is an ERP observed following the presentation of feedback. Findings detailing developmental changes in the FN have been mixed, possibly due to limitations in traditional ERP measurement methods. Recent work shows that both theta and delta frequency activity contribute to the FN; utilizing time-frequency methods to measure change in power and phase in these frequency bands may provide more accurate representation of feedback processing development in childhood and adolescence. We employ time-frequency power and intertrial phase synchrony measures, in addition to conventional time-domain ERP methods, to examine the development of feedback processing in the theta (4-7Hz) and delta (.1-3Hz) bands throughout adolescence. A sample of 54 female participants (8-17 years old) completed a gambling task while EEG was recorded. As expected, time-domain ERP amplitudes showed no association with age. In contrast, significant effects were observed for the time-frequency measures, with theta power decreasing with age and delta power increasing with age. For intertrial phase synchrony, delta synchrony increased with age, while age-related changes in theta synchrony differed for gains and losses. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of considering time-frequency dynamics when exploring how the processing of feedback develops through late childhood and adolescence. In particular, the role of delta band activity and theta synchrony appear central to understanding age-related changes in the neural response to feedback.	[Bowers, M. E.; Bernat, E. M.; Fox, N.

This is especially true during early childhood in which neuroimaging data are relatively scarce. We developed a new method for collecting eyes closed and eyes open resting state electroencephalography (EEG) suitable for young children. We report results characterizing age-related change in power in multiple brain rhythms over frontal and posterior regions under eyes closed and open conditions of rest in 3-, 4-, 5- and 9-year-old children (N = 162). We observed two key patterns of results. First, with age theta decreased, alpha increased, and alpha peak frequency increased. Second, power was generally higher when eyes were closed than open for theta and alpha but higher when eyes were open than closed for beta and gamma. We also investigated the relation between resting state EEG activity and executive function (EF) using the Minnesota Executive Function Scale, a standardized behavioral measure of EF for ages 2 and up. Correlational and regression analyses showed that individual differences in the theta/beta ratio is associated with EF even after controlling for children's age and verbal abilities. We situate our results in a theoretical discussion of theta/beta and its role in control processes.

Entrainment of theta, not alpha, oscillations is predictive of the brightness enhancement of a flickering stimulus	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; EEG ALPHA; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; SHAPE PERCEPTION; GENERIC METHOD; PHASE; DISCRIMINATION; PERFORMANCE	Frequency-dependent brightness enhancement, where a flickering light can appear twice as bright as an equiluminant constant light, has been reported to exist within the alpha (8-12 Hz) band. Could oscillatory neural activity be driving this perceptual effect? Here, in two experiments, human subjects reported which of two flickering stimuli were brighter. Strikingly, 4 Hz stimuli were reported as brighter more than 80% of the time when compared to all other tested frequencies, even though all stimuli were equiluminant and of equal temporal length. Electroencephalography recordings showed that inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) of theta (4 Hz) was: (1) Significantly greater than alpha, contralateral to the flickering stimulus; (2) Enhanced by the presence of a second ipsilateral 4 Hz flickering stimulus; and (3) Uniquely lateralized, unlike the alpha band. Importantly, on trials with two identical stimuli (i.e. 4 Hz vs 4 Hz), the brightness discrimination judgment could be predicted by the hemispheric balance in the amount of 4 Hz ITC. We speculate that the theta rhythm plays a distinct information transfer role, where its ability to share information between hemispheres via entrainment promotes a better processing of visual information to inform a discrimination decision.

Establishing a Right Frontal Beta Signature for Stopping Action in Scalp EEG: Implications for Testing Inhibitory Control in Other Task Contexts	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; UNEXPECTED EVENTS; DYNAMICS; NOVELTY; CONNECTIVITY; SUPPRESSION; DISTRACTION; SEPARATION	Many studies have examined the rapid stopping of action as a proxy of human self-control. Several methods have shown that a critical focus for stopping is the right inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, electrocorticography studies have shown beta band power increases in the right inferior frontal cortex and in the BG for successful versus failed stop trials, before the time of stopping elapses, perhaps underpinning a prefrontal-BG network for inhibitory control. Here, we tested whether the same signature might be visible in scalp electroencephalography (EEG)which would open important avenues for using this signature in studies of the recruitment and timing of prefrontal inhibitory control. We used independent component analysis and time-frequency approaches to analyze EEG from three different cohorts of healthy young volunteers (48 participants in total) performing versions of the standard stop signal task. We identified a spectral power increase in the band 13-20 Hz that occurs after the stop signal, but before the time of stopping elapses, with a right frontal topography in the EEG. This right frontal beta band increase was significantly larger for successful compared with failed stops in two of the three studies. We also tested the hypothesis that unexpected events recruit the same frontal system for stopping. Indeed, we show that the stopping-related right-lateralized frontal beta signature was also active after unexpected events (and we accordingly provide data and scripts for the method). These results validate a right frontal beta signature in the EEG as a temporally precise and functionally significant neural marker of the response inhibition process.

This was done by using an advanced analysis workflow to estimate neural signals in the cortex and to assess functional connectivity (FC) between distant cortical regions. FC analyses were conducted either using temporal (tICA) or spatial independent component analysis (sICA). Notably, EEG-RSNs obtained with sICA were very similar to RSNs retrieved with sICA from functional magnetic resonance imaging data. It still remains to be clarified, however, what technological aspects of hdEEG acquisition and analysis primarily influence this correspondence. Here we examined to what extent the detection of EEG-RSN maps by sICA depends on the electrode density, the accuracy of the head model, and the source localization algorithm employed. Our analyses revealed that the collection of EEG data using a high-density montage is crucial for RSN detection by sICA, but also the use of appropriate methods for head modeling and source localization have a substantial effect on RSN reconstruction. Overall, our results confirm the potential of hdEEG for mapping the functional architecture of the human brain, and highlight at the same time the interplay between acquisition technology and innovative solutions in data analysis.

A complex biomedical signal such as EEG is best analysed using a time-frequency algorithm. Wavelet decomposition based analysis is a relatively novel area in EEG analysis and for extracting its subbands. This work aims at exploring the use of discrete wavelet transform for extracting EEG subbands in encephalopathy. The subband energies were then calculated and given as feature sets to SVM classifier for identifying cases of encephalopathy from normal healthy subjects. Out of various combinations of subband energies, energy of delta subband yielded highest performance parameters for SVM classifier with an accuracy of 90.4% in identifying encephalopathy cases.

Methods: Eleven neonates born 2009-2014 diagnosed of ischemic stroke by MRI (three of them with multistroke) underwent continuous video-EEG monitoring. Visual and spectral (power spectrum and coherence) analyses of the background EEG was performed in three moments: 1) Onset of EEG recording (prior to initiate seizure treatment), 2) Post-ictal epoch (1-2 h after the last seizure), and 3) one-two days after seizure control. All children aged 2-6 years underwent neurodevelopmental assessment. Results: Discontinuity, asymmetry, asynchrony, transients, and relative power spectrum in delta and theta frequency bands increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the post-ictal epoch with respect to onset of EEG recording. After seizure control, discontinuity, asynchrony, and theta power spectrum no longer had significant differences with those found at onset of EEG recording. Significant differences between the ischemic and unaffected hemispheres were found in transients and in beta coherence (p = 0.002; p = 0.001, respectively) exclusively in the post-ictal epoch. Seizure burden and time-to-control ranged 5-38 min and 0.5-40 h respectively. Currently, only one child is affected by spastic monoparesis. The intelligence quotients ranged 96-123. Conclusions: The background EEG can undergo significant changes in the post-ictal epoch due to the seizure activity triggered by the perinatal stroke. Most of these EEG changes involve all brain activity and not exclusively the ischemic hemisphere. Many of these modifications in the EEG background reverse following the seizure control. Video-EEG monitoring allows accurate/immediate diagnosis and rapid/intensive treatment of the stroke-associated seizures.

Systematic Review on Resting-State EEG for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Progression Assessment	DISEASE MARKERS			English	Review							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FREQUENCY POWER RATIO; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for nearly 70% of the more than 46 million dementia cases estimated worldwide. Although there is no cure for AD, early diagnosis and an accurate characterization of the disease progression can improve the quality of life of AD patients and their caregivers. Currently, AD diagnosis is carried out using standardized mental status examinations, which are commonly assisted by expensive neuroimaging scans and invasive laboratory tests, thus rendering the diagnosis time consuming and costly. Notwithstanding, over the last decade, electroencephalography ( EEG) has emerged as a noninvasive alternative technique for the study of AD, competing with more expensive neuroimaging tools, such as MRI and PET. This paper reports on the results of a systematic review on the utilization of resting-state EEG signals for AD diagnosis and progression assessment. Recent journal articles obtained from four major bibliographic databases were analyzed. A total of 112 journal articles published from January 2010 to February 2018 were meticulously reviewed, and relevant aspects of these papers were compared across articles to provide a general overview of the research on this noninvasive AD diagnosis technique. Finally, recommendations for future studies with resting-state EEG were presented to improve and facilitate the knowledge transfer among research groups.

J	Lozano-Soldevilla, D				Lozano-Soldevilla, Diego			On the Physiological Modulation and Potential Mechanisms Underlying Parieto-Occipital Alpha Oscillations	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						magnetoencephalography; electroencephalography; brain oscillations; pharmacology; cognitive processes	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; PSYCHOACTIVE BEVERAGE AYAHUASCA; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR-CORTEX; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ENDOGENOUS GABA LEVELS; RAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; RESTING-STATE EEG; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS	The parieto-occipital alpha (8-13Hz) rhythm is by far the strongest spectral fingerprint in the human brain. Almost 90 years later, its physiological origin is still far from clear. In this Research Topic I review human pharmacological studies using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) that investigated the physiological mechanisms behind posterior alpha. Based on results from classical and recent experimental studies, I find a wide spectrum of drugs that modulate parieto-occipital alpha power. Alpha frequency is rarely affected, but this might be due to the range of drug dosages employed. Animal and human pharmacological findings suggest that both GABA enhancers and NMDA blockers systematically decrease posterior alpha power. Surprisingly, most of the theoretical frameworks do not seem to embrace these empirical findings and the debate on the functional role of alpha oscillations has been polarized between the inhibition vs. active poles hypotheses. Here, I speculate that the functional role of alpha might depend on physiological excitation as much as on physiological inhibition. This is supported by animal and human pharmacological work showing that GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic receptors in the thalamus and the cortex play a key role in the regulation of alpha power and frequency. This myriad of physiological modulations fit with the view that the alpha rhythm is a complex rhythm with multiple sources supported by both thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical loops. Finally, I briefly discuss how future research combining experimental measurements derived from theoretical predictions based of biophysically realistic computational models will be crucial to the reconciliation of these disparate findings.

In order to analyze the data, path analysis was applied in AMOS software. The results showed that the predictive model of neuroticism is fit respect to the mediator role of fear and the criterion role of EEG oscillations. The results revealed that EEG is a fit device for predicting fearful and neuroticism and it can be used for further pathologically researches.

FieldTrip Made Easy: An Analysis Protocol for Group Analysis of the Auditory Steady State Brain Response in Time, Frequency, and Space	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ASSR; EEG; FieldTrip; group analysis; ERP; beamforming	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; MEG; TINNITUS; EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; LOCALIZATION; ORGANIZATION; CHILDREN; DEFICITS	The auditory steady state evoked response (ASSR) is a robust and frequently utilized phenomenon in psychophysiological research. It reflects the auditory cortical response to an amplitude-modulated constant carrier frequency signal. The present report provides a concrete example of a group analysis of the EEG data from 29 healthy human participants, recorded during an ASSR paradigm, using the FieldTrip toolbox. First, we demonstrate sensor-level analysis in the time domain, allowing for a description of the event-related potentials (ERPs), as well as their statistical evaluation. Second, frequency analysis is applied to describe the spectral characteristics of the ASSR, followed by group level statistical analysis in the frequency domain. Third, we show how time-and frequency-domain analysis approaches can be combined in order to describe the temporal and spectral development of the ASSR. Finally, we demonstrate source reconstruction techniques to characterize the primary neural generators of the ASSR. Throughout, we pay special attention to explaining the design of the analysis pipeline for single subjects and for the group level analysis. The pipeline presented here can be adjusted to accommodate other experimental paradigms and may serve as a template for similar analyses.

Most MTP studies involve decoding 2D and 3D arm movements i.e., executed arm movements. Decoding of observed or imagined 3D movements has been demonstrated with limited success and only reported in a few studies. MTP studies normally use EEG potentials filtered in the low delta (similar to 1 Hz) band for reconstructing the trajectory of an executed or an imagined/observed movement. In contrast to MTP, multiclass classification based sensorimotor rhythm brain-computer interfaces aim to classify movements using the power spectral density of mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-28 Hz) bands. Approach: We investigated if replacing the standard potentials time-series input with a power spectral density based bandpower time-series improves trajectory decoding accuracy of kinesthetically imagined 3D hand movement tasks (i.e., imagined 3D trajectory of the hand joint) and whether imagined 3D hand movements kinematics are encoded also in mu and beta bands. Twelve naive subjects were asked to generate or imagine generating pointing movements with their right dominant arm to four targets distributed in 3D space in synchrony with an auditory cue (beep). Main results: Using the bandpower time-series based model, the highest decoding accuracy for motor execution was observed in mu and beta bands whilst for imagined movements the low gamma (28-40 Hz) band was also observed to improve decoding accuracy for some subjects. Moreover, for both (executed and imagined) movements, the bandpower time-series model with mu, beta, and low gamma bands produced significantly higher reconstruction accuracy than the commonly used potential time-series model and delta oscillations.

Emerging evidence shows that cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with disruptions in brain functional connectivity. Thus, the identification of alterations in AD functional networks has become a topic of increasing interest. However, to what extent AD induces disruption of the balance of local and global information processing in the human brain remains elusive. The main objective of this study is to explore the dynamic topological changes of AD networks in terms of brain network segregation and integration. Approach. We used electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from 20 participants (10 AD patients and 10 healthy controls) during resting state. Functional brain networks were reconstructed using EEG source connectivity computed in different frequency bands. Graph theoretical analyses were performed assess differences between both groups. Main results. Results revealed that AD networks, compared to networks of age-matched healthy controls, are characterized by lower global information processing (integration) and higher local information processing (segregation). Results showed also significant correlation between the alterations in the AD patients' functional brain networks and their cognitive scores. Significance. These findings may contribute to the development of EEG network-based test that could strengthen results obtained from currently-used neurophysiological tests in neurodegenerative diseases.

Based on the evident advantage of S transform in feature extraction, including more obvious characteristic of time, frequency and phase, it is applied to preprocess the data for a better classification. The experiment result on the motion imagery indicates that the combined algorithm achieve an accuracy of 92.8%, far higher than the accuracy of applying CSP algorithm only. What is more, the time cost could be diminished to 0.85s after sampling, 31% less than the original method, and could still achieve the accuracy of 89.8%. in conclusion, the combination of CSP and S transform algorithm is a feasible and applicable one with data and technical support.

While these findings accord with theoretical models, the precise temporal, oscillatory and network dynamics as well as the interplay between the NAcc and ANT in successfully retrieving information from long-term memory are largely unknown. We addressed this issue by recording intracranial electroencephalography in human epilepsy patients from the NAcc (n = 5) and ANT (n = 4) during an old/new recognition test. Our findings demonstrate that differences in event-related potentials between correctly classified old (i.e., studied) and new (i.e., unstudied) images emerged in the NAcc and ANT already between 200 and 600 ms after stimulus onset. Moreover, time frequency analyses revealed theta (4-8 Hz) power decreases for old compared to new items in the NAcc and the opposite effect in the ANT. Importantly, Granger causality analyses revealed a directional communication from ANT to NAcc suggesting that entrainment from ANT drives successful memory retrieval. Together, our findings show evidence for the notion that the NAcc and ANT receive memory signals, and that theta oscillations may serve as a mechanism to bind these distributed neural assemblies.

This phenomenon is called inattentional deafness and usually occurs under critical high workload conditions. It is difficult to simulate the critical nature of these tasks in the laboratory. In this study, dry electroencephalography is used to investigate inattentional deafness in real flight while piloting an airplane. The pilots participating in the experiment responded to audio alarms while experiencing critical high workload situations. It was found that missed relative to detected alarms were marked by reduced stimulus evoked phase synchrony in theta and alpha frequencies (6-14 Hz) from 120 to 230 ms poststimulus onset. Correlation of alarm detection performance with intertrial coherence measures of neural phase synchrony showed different frequency and time ranges for detected and missed alarms. These results are consistent with selective attentional processes actively disrupting oscillatory coherence in sensory networks not involved with the primary task (piloting in this case) under critical high load conditions. This hypothesis is corroborated by analyses of flight parameters showing greater maneuvering associated with difficult phases of flight occurring during missed alarms. Our results suggest modulation of neural oscillation is a general mechanism of attention utilizing enhancement of phase synchrony to sharpen alarm perception during successful divided attention, and disruption of phase synchrony in brain networks when attentional demands of the primary task are great, such as in the case of inattentional deafness.

However, these mechanisms are still poorly understood and there is urgent need to identify neurophysiological markers of functional recovery after stroke. Here we aimed to track longitudinally the time-course of cortical reorganization by measuring for the first time EEG cortical activity evoked by TMS pulses in patients with subcortical stroke. Thirteen patients in the sub-acute phase of ischemic subcortical stroke with motor symptoms completed the longitudinal study, being evaluated within 20 days and after 40, 60 and 180 days after stroke onset. For each time-point, EEG cortical activity evoked by single TMS pulses was assessed over the motor and parietal cortex of the affected and unaffected hemisphere. We evaluated global TMS-evoked activity and TMS-evoked oscillations in different frequency bands. These measurements were paralleled with clinical and behavioral assessment. We found that motor cortical activity measured by TMS-EEG varied across time in the affected hemisphere. An increase of TMS-evoked activity was evident at 40 days after stroke onset. Moreover, stroke patients showed a significant increase in TMS-evoked alpha oscillations, as highlighted performing analysis in the time-frequency domain. Notably, these changes indicated that crucial mechanisms of cortical reorganization occur in this short-time window. These changes coincided with the clinical improvement. TMS-evoked alpha oscillatory activity recorded at baseline was associated to better functional recovery at 40 and 60 days' follow-up evaluations, suggesting that the power of the alpha rhythm can be considered a good predictor of motor recovery. This study demonstrates that cortical activity increases dynamically in the early phases of recovery after stroke in the affected hemisphere. These findings point to TMS-evoked alpha oscillatory activity as a potential neurophysiological markers of stroke recovery and could be helpful to determine the temporal window in which neuromodulation should be potentially able to drive neuroplasticity in an effective functional direction.

Fast gamma activity has been identified as the most specific marker for seizure onset, but conflicting results have been reported. In this study, we describe an alternative marker, based on an objective description of interictal to ictal transition, with the aim of identifying a time-frequency pattern or 'fingerprint' that can differentiate the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation. Seventeen patients who underwent stereoelectroencephalography were included in the study. Each had seizure onset characterized by sustained gamma activity and were seizure-free after tailored resection or laser ablation. We postulated that the epileptogenic zone was always located inside the resection region based on seizure freedom following surgery. To characterize the ictal frequency pattern, we applied the Morlet wavelet transform to data from each pair of adjacent intracerebral electrode contacts. Based on a visual assessment of the time-frequency plots, we hypothesized that a specific time-frequency pattern in the epileptogenic zone should include a combination of (i) sharp transients or spikes; preceding (ii) multiband fast activity concurrent; with (iii) suppression of lower frequencies. To test this hypothesis, we developed software that automatically extracted each of these features from the time-frequency data. We then used a support vector machine to classify each contact-pair as being within epileptogenic zone or not, based on these features. Our machine learning system identified this pattern in 15 of 17 patients. The total number of identified contacts across all patients was 64, with 58 localized inside the resected area. Subsequent quantitative analysis showed strong correlation between maximum frequency of fast activity and suppression inside the resection but not outside. We did not observe significant discrimination power using only the maximum frequency or the timing of fast activity to differentiate contacts either between resected and non-resected regions or between contacts identified as epileptogenic versus non-epileptogenic. Instead of identifying a single frequency or a single timing trait, we observed the more complex pattern described above that distinguishes the epileptogenic zone. This pattern encompasses interictal to ictal transition and may extend until seizure end. Its time-frequency characteristics can be explained in light of recent models emphasizing the role of fast inhibitory interneurons acting on pyramidal cells as a prominent mechanism in seizure triggering. The pattern clearly differentiates the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation and, as such, represents an epileptogenic zone 'fingerprint'.

The quality of the time-frequency representation is crucial for the extraction of robust and relevant features, thus leading to the demand for highly performing spectral estimators. We consider a stochastic model, known as Locally Stationary Processes, based on the modulation in time of a stationary covariance function. The flexibility of the model makes it suitable for a wide range of time-varying signals, in particular EEG signals. Previous works provided the theoretical expression of the mean-square error optimal kernel for the computation of the Wigner-Ville spectrum. The introduction of a novel inference method for the model parameters permits the computation of the optimal kernel in real-world data cases. The obtained MSE optimal time-frequency estimator is compared with other commonly used methods in a simulation study, confirming the error reduction. Optimal spectral estimates are presented for the case study, consisting of EEG data collected within a research on memory retrieval.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the neural basis of interbrain cooperation and the cognitive performance underlying the execution of joint-actions by using EEG coherence measures. Synchronicity of the cognitive variables (response times, RTs, and error rates, ERs) in response to an attentional task, inter-subjective coherence analysis on EEG frequency bands, and correlational measures between cognitive and brain activity were considered during some steps of progressive reinforcing conditions. Fifteen couples of subjects performed an attentional task in eight temporal steps, stressing their good performance at the end of each step. The induced feedback affected both the cognitive performance and brain-to-brain coupling by increasing behavioral and brain synchronization when a positive feedback was furnished to the participants for their performance. Secondly, about the cortical contribution, high coherence effect was mainly observed when a positive reinforce was produced, but only for some low frequency bands within the prefrontal left area, compared to the right one. Thus, also a left lateralization effect was reportable. Finally, the cognitive and EEG coherence measures were shown to be correlated, with a significant similar trend anchored to the progressive feedback.

Hence, an early detection of the focal epileptic seizures can be carried out using the EEG signals, which act as a helpful tool for early diagnosis of epilepsy. Several EEG-based approaches have been proposed and developed to understand the underlying characteristics of the epileptic seizures. Despite the fact that the early results were positive, the proposed techniques cannot generate reproducible results and lack a statistical validation, which has led to doubts regarding the presence of the pre-ictal state. Various methodical and algorithmic studies have indicated that the transition to an ictal state is not a random process, and the build-up can lead to epileptic seizures. This study reviews many recently-proposed algorithms for detecting the focal epileptic seizures. Generally, the techniques developed for detecting the epileptic seizures were based on tensors, entropy, empirical mode decomposition, wavelet transform and dynamic analysis. The existing algorithms were compared and the need for implementing a practical and reliable new algorithm is highlighted. The research regarding the epileptic seizure detection research is more focused on the development of precise and non-invasive techniques for rapid and reliable diagnosis.

This procedure is based on the spectral theory of time series and identifies series that share similar oscillations or waveforms. The extent of similarity between a pair of time series is measured using the total variation distance between their estimated spectral densities. At each step of the algorithm, every time two clusters merge, a new spectral density is estimated using the whole information present in both clusters, which is representative of all the series in the new cluster. The method is implemented in an R package HSMClust. We present two applications of the HSM method, one to data coming from wave-height measurements in oceanography and the other to electroencefalogram (EEG) data.

It combines the strengths of the multitaper spectral (MT) analysis paradigm with that of state-space (SS) models. In this current work, we explore a variant of the original SSMT framework by imposing a smoothness promoting SS model to generate smoother estimates of power spectral densities for non-stationary data. Specifically, we assume that the continuous processes giving rise to observations in the frequencies of interest follow multiple independent Integrated Wiener Processes (IWP). We use both synthetic data and electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from a human subject under anesthesia to compare the IWP-SSMT with the SSMT method and demonstrate the former's utility in yielding smoother descriptions of underlying processes. The original SSMT and IWP-SSMT can co-exist as a part of a model selection toolkit for nonstationary time series data.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; coherence; monkey; connectivity; local field potential	IMPLANTED SOURCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL CORRELATION; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; VOLUME CONDUCTION; TEMPORAL SCALES; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG; SYNCHRONY	Long-range interactions between cortical areas are undoubtedly a key to the computational power of the brain. For healthy human subjects, the premier method for measuring brain activity on fast timescales is electroencephalography (EEG), and coherence between EEG signals is often used to assay functional connectivity between different brain regions. However, the nature of the underlying brain activity that is reflected in EEG coherence is currently the realm of speculation, because seldom have EEG signals been recorded simultaneously with intracranial recordings near cell bodies in multiple brain areas. Here, we take the early steps towards narrowing this gap in our understanding of EEG coherence by measuring local field potentials with microelectrode arrays in two brain areas (extrastriate visual area V4 and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) simultaneously with EEG at the nearby scalp in rhesus macaque monkeys. Although we found inter-area coherence at both scales of measurement, we did not find that scalp-level coherence was reliably related to coherence between brain areas measured intracranially on a trial-to-trial basis, despite that scalp-level EEG was related to other important features of neural oscillations, such as trial-to-trial variability in overall amplitudes. This suggests that caution must be exercised when interpreting EEG coherence effects, and new theories devised about what aspects of neural activity long-range coherence in the EEG reflects.

J	Ferdowsi, S; Abolghasemi, V				Ferdowsi, Saideh; Abolghasemi, Vahid			Multi layer spectral decomposition technique for ERD estimation in EEG mu rhythms: An EEG-fMRI study	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						EEG-fMRI combination; Event related desynchronization in mu band; Singular spectrum analysis; Spectral factorization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DESYNCHRONIZATION ERD; ARTIFACT; REMOVAL	In this paper, power suppression detection in mu band known as event-related desynchronization during a simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording is addressed. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments provide great opportunities to recognize relation between the active areas in the brain, discovered by fMRI, and EEG events. However, decoding EEG is challenging as a result of artifacts which MRI scanner applies on EEG. Ballistocardiogram (BCG) is one of the main destructive artifacts which deteriorates EEG rhythms specially in mu band. The proposed method, is a supervised time-frequency decomposition algorithm which estimates underlying rhythms of EEG signals recorded in MRI scanner. In the proposed method, a multi layer decomposition approach using three criteria is developed to extract brain oscillations. This goal is achieved by eliminating the artifact related components at each decomposition layer as a result of removing useless extracted components in each layer. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated using synthetic and real EEG. The achieved results from synthetic data confirm the ability of the proposed method to extract mu rhythms when different levels of noise exist. In addition, proposed algorithm is applied on a set of real EEG acquired in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording. Estimated ERD confirms the superiority of the developed algorithm in terms of estimating changes of mu rhythms. Moreover, an EEG-fMRI integration is performed to explore the correlation between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) in fMRI and ERD of mu rhythm in EEG. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Automatic and robust noise suppression in EEG and MEG: The SOUND algorithm	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography; Artifacts; Noise; Wiener estimation; Cross-validation; Minimum-norm estimation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MINIMUM-NORM ESTIMATION; TMS-EVOKED EEG; NEUROMAGNETIC RECORDINGS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; ARTIFACT REJECTION; MUSCLE ARTIFACTS; MODEL SELECTION	Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) often suffer from noise-and artifact-contaminated channels and trials. Conventionally, EEG and MEG data are inspected visually and cleaned accordingly, e.g., by identifying and rejecting the so-called "bad" channels. This approach has several shortcomings: data inspection is laborious, the rejection criteria are subjective, and the process does not fully utilize all the information in the collected data. Here, we present noise-cleaning methods based on modeling the multi-sensor and multi-trial data. These approaches offer objective, automatic, and robust removal of noise and disturbances by taking into account the sensor-or trial-specific signal-to-noise ratios. We introduce a method called the source-estimate-utilizing noise-discarding algorithm (the SOUND algorithm). SOUND employs anatomical information of the head to cross-validate the data between the sensors. As a result, we are able to identify and suppress noise and artifacts in EEG and MEG. Furthermore, we discuss the theoretical background of SOUND and show that it is a special case of the well-known Wiener estimators. We explain how a completely data-driven Wiener estimator (DDWiener) can be used when no anatomical information is available. DDWiener is easily applicable to any linear multivariate problem; as a demonstrative example, we show how DDWiener can be utilized when estimating event-related EEG/MEG responses. We validated the performance of SOUND with simulations and by applying SOUND to multiple EEG and MEG datasets. SOUND considerably improved the data quality, exceeding the performance of the widely used channel-rejection and interpolation scheme. SOUND also helped in localizing the underlying neural activity by preventing noise from contaminating the source estimates. SOUND can be used to detect and reject noise in functional brain data, enabling improved identification of active brain areas.

Peak visual gamma frequency is modified across the healthy menstrual cycle	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						allopregnanolone; electroencephalography; GABA; menstrual cycle; visual gamma oscillations	PREMENSTRUAL-SYNDROME; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ALLOPREGNANOLONE; INHIBITION; MUSCLE; CORTEX; MECHANISMS	Fluctuations in gonadal hormones over the course of the menstrual cycle are known to cause functional brain changes and are thought to modulate changes in the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition. Animal research has shown this occurs primarily via the major metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone, and its action as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) receptor. Our study used EEG to record gamma oscillations induced in the visual cortex using stationary and moving gratings. Recordings took place during twenty females' mid-luteal phase when progesterone and estradiol are highest, and early follicular phase when progesterone and estradiol are lowest. Significantly higher (approximate to 5 Hz) gamma frequency was recorded during the luteal compared to the follicular phase for both stimuli types. Using dynamic causal modeling, these changes were linked to stronger self-inhibition of superficial pyramidal cells in the luteal compared to the follicular phase. In addition, the connection from inhibitory interneurons to deep pyramidal cells was found to be stronger in the follicular compared to the luteal phase. These findings show that complex functional changes in synaptic microcircuitry occur across the menstrual cycle and that menstrual cycle phase should be taken into consideration when including female participants in research into gamma-band oscillations.

The effects of such top-down signals on local processing in primary visual cortex (V1) remain poorly understood. In this work, we characterize the interplay between large-scale interactions and local activity changes in V1 that orchestrates selective attention, using Granger-causality and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis of EEG source signals. The task required participants to either attend to or ignore oriented gratings. Results from time-varying, directed connectivity analysis revealed frequency-specific effects of attentional selection: bottom-up gamma-band influences from visual areas increased rapidly in response to attended stimuli while distributed top-down alpha-band influences originated from parietal cortex in response to ignored stimuli. Importantly, the results revealed a critical interplay between top-down parietal signals and alpha-gamma PAC in visual areas. Parietal alpha-band influences disrupted the alpha-gamma coupling in visual cortex, which in turn reduced the amount of gamma-band outflow from visual areas. Our results are a first demonstration of how directed interactions affect cross-frequency coupling in downstream areas depending on task demands. These findings suggest that parietal cortex realizes selective attention by disrupting cross-frequency coupling at target regions, which prevents them from propagating task-irrelevant information.

However, the emergence of mature cortical activity in wakefulness compared with sleep states in healthy preterm infants is poorly understood. Methods: To investigate whether the cortical activity has a different developmental profile in each sleep-wake state, we recorded 11-channels electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and respiratory movement for 1 hr from 115 infants 34 to 43 weeks-corrected age, with 0.5-17 days of postnatal age. We characterized the trajectory of delta, theta, and alpha-beta oscillations in wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep by calculating the power spectrum of the EEG, averaged across artifact-free epochs. Results: delta-Oscillations in wakefulness and REM sleep decrease with corrected age, particularly in the temporal region, but not in non-REM sleep theta-Oscillations increase with corrected age in sleep, especially non-REM sleep, but not in wakefulness. On the other hand, alpha-beta oscillations decrease predominantly with postnatal age, independently of sleep-wake state, particularly in the occipital region. Conclusions: The developmental trajectory of delta and theta rhythms is state-dependent and results in changed cortical activity patterns between states with corrected age, which suggests that these frequency bands may have particular functional roles in each state. Interestingly, postnatal age is associated with a decrease in alpha-beta oscillations overlying primary visual cortex in every sleep-wake state, suggesting that postnatal experience (including the first visual input through open eyes during periods of wakefulness) is associated with resting-state visual cortical activity changes.

However, there is a lack of data on how changes in the complexity of brain dynamics derived from EEG reflect variations in the BOLD signal. The purpose of our study was to correlate both spectral patterns, as linear features of EEG rhythms, and nonlinear EEG dynamic complexity with neuronal activity obtained by fMRI. We examined the relationships between EEG patterns and brain activation obtained by simultaneous BEG fMRI during the resting state condition in 25 healthy right-handed adult volunteers. Using EEG-derived regressors, we demonstrated a substantial correlation of BOLD signal changes with linear and nonlinear features of EEG. We found the most significant positive correlation of fMRI signal with delta spectral power. Beta and alpha spectral features had no reliable effect on BOLD fluctuation. However, dynamic changes of alpha peak frequency exhibited a significant association with BOLD signal increase in right-hemisphere areas. Additionally, EEG dynamic complexity as measured by the HFD of the 2-20 Hz EEG frequency range significantly correlated with the activation of cortical and subcortical limbic system areas. Our results indicate that both spectral features of EEG frequency bands and nonlinear dynamic properties of spontaneous EEG are strongly associated with fluctuations of the BOLD signal during the resting state condition.

In the present study, inter-brain functional connectivity and cognitive performance were considered during joint which was failing. The cognitive performance and the EEG (brain oscillations from delta to beta) underlying the execution of joint-actions were recorded when dyads of participants executed synchronicity game and received reinforcing negative feedbacks A pre-feedback condition (cooperation) and a control condition (individual task, TO) were provided as well as a check for possible learning effect (time series analysis). Finally, correlation analysis was considered to assess the relation between behavioral and physiological levels. Results showed that the external feedback was able to modulate participants' responses in both behavioral and neural components with increased RTs and ERs after the negative reinforcement. Similarly, a reduced inter-brain connectivity was found, mainly localized within the superior frontal regions, and for low-frequency bands (delta and theta). In contrast pre-feedback condition showed the best performance in terms of both behavioral and brain-to-brain coupling activity. Moreover, the presence of significant correlations between RTs and inter-brain connectivity revealed that the failing cooperation induces significant negative effects on the cognitive and brain strategy in comparison with cooperative (pre-feedback) and individual (control) condition. The present study provides significant contribution to the identification of patterns of cognitive behavior and functional connectivity when social reinforcement is provided within dyads of participants by using a hyperscanning approach.

Despite both being behaviorally relevant, little is known about their potential interactions. In humans, 8-12 Hz alpha oscillations constitute the strongest deviation from 1/f power-law scaling, the signature of LRD. We postulated that alpha oscillations, believed to exert active inhibitory gating, downmodulate the temporal width of LRD in slower ongoing brain activity. In two independent "resting-state" datasets (electroencephalography surface recordings and magnetoencephalography source reconstructions), both across space and dynamically over time, power of alpha activity covaried with the power slope <5 Hz (i.e., greater alpha activity shortened LRD). Causality of alpha activity dynamics was implied by its temporal precedence over changes of slope. A model where power-law fluctuations of the alpha envelope inhibit baseline activity closely replicated our results. Thus, alpha oscillations may provide an active control mechanism to adaptively regulate LRD of brain activity at slow temporal scales, thereby shaping internal states and cognitive processes.

Using behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) time frequency (TF) analysis, the current study examines the oscillatory dynamics of unconsciously triggered conflict in an emotional facial expressions version of the masked affective priming task. The results demonstrate that the power dynamics of conflict are characterized by increased midfrontal theta activity and suppressed parieto-occipital alpha activity. Across-subject and within-trial correlation analyses further confirmed this pattern. Phase synchrony and Granger causality analyses (GCAs) revealed that the fronto-parietal network was involved in unconscious conflict detection and resolution. Our findings support a response conflict account of affective priming, and reveal the role of the fronto-parietal network in unconscious conflict control.

Using a unique large dataset we plan to investigate the causes for performance differences in the SST in healthy and clinically diagnosed children and adolescents. Firstly, we aim to investigate how causes for differences in performance in the SST evolve over age in healthy, typically developing children. With this we plan to dissect aging effects from effects that are specific to developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Secondly, we will include subjects with deficient performance to investigate different causes for bad performance to identify data-driven subgroups of poor performers.

This study focused on the FC of the cortico-striatal network, which is thought to be disrupted in schizophrenia and to contribute to its clinical manifestations. Methods: We used simultaneous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to investigate FC in patients with schizophrenia. The study included 20 patients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Simultaneously recorded rsfMRI and EEG data were collected with an MR-compatible amplifier, and rsfMRI data were analyzed with the CONN toolbox to calculate FC. The study focused on the caudate, which was defined as the seed. We also performed between-group comparisons of standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography intracortical lagged coher-ence for each EEG frequency band. Results: Compared to HCs, patients with schizophrenia showed enhanced FC between the caudate nucleus and the posterior cingulate cortex, temporal, and occipital regions on rsfMRI. It is thus possible that HCs have negative FC between these regions, whereas patients with schizophrenia have non-negative FC. The EEG results showed no significant differences in oscillations or in FC between the groups in any frequency band in any region. Conclusions: Increased FC in the caudate may represent aberrant between-network FC resulting from the disruption of segregation between networks. (C) 2018 S.

Due to rising interest in nicotinic agonists, we aimed to establish a method to monitor neurophysiological effects of modulating the nicotinic cholinergic system. Methods: In a four-way cross-over study, eyes-closed rest EEG was recorded in 28 healthy subjects receiving mecamylamine-a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, which induces temporary cognitive dysfunction in healthy subjects-with co-administration of placebo, nicotine or galantamine. Results: Using machine learning to optimally contrast the effects of 30 mg of mecamylamine and placebo on the brain, we developed a nAChR index that consists of 10 EEG biomarkers and shows high classification accuracy (-95% non-cross-validated, similar to 70% cross-validated). Importantly, using the nAChR index, we demonstrate reversal of mecamylamine-induced neurophysiological effects due to 16 mg of galantamine as well as administering 21 mg of nicotine transdermally. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the mecamylamine challenge model jointly with the nAChR index-a measure of the nicotinic EEG profile-could aid future proof-of-pharmacology studies to demonstrate effects of nicotinic cholinergic compounds. Significance: This novel measure for quantifying nicotinic cholinergic effects on the EEG could serve as a useful tool in drug development of pro-cognitive compounds.

Altered temporal stability in dynamic neural networks underlies connectivity changes in neurodevelopment	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEG; EEG; AGE; CHILDREN; OSCILLATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; AUTISM	Network connectivity is an integral feature of human brain function, and characterising its maturational trajectory is a critical step towards understanding healthy and atypical neurodevelopment. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate both stationary (i.e. time averaged) and rapidly modulating (dynamic) electrophysiological connectivity, in participants aged from mid-childhood to early adulthood (youngest participant 9 years old; oldest participant 25 years old). Stationary functional connectivity (measured via inter-regional coordination of neural oscillations) increased with age in the alpha and beta frequency bands, particularly in bilateral parietal and temporo-parietal connections. Our dynamic analysis (also applied to alpha/beta oscillations) revealed the spatiotemporal signatures of 8 dynamic networks; these modulate on a similar to 100 ms time scale, and temporal stability in attentional networks was found to increase with age. Significant overlap was found between age-modulated dynamic networks and inter-regional oscillatory coordination, implying that altered network dynamics underlie age related changes in functional connectivity. Our results provide novel insights into brain network electrophysiology, and lay a foundation for future work in childhood disorders.

Prior studies focused on the relationship between pre-stimulus neuronal activity and TMS-evoked motor evoked potentials (MEPs) have reported heterogeneous results. We aimed to assess the role of pre-stimulus neural activity on the latency of MEPs, which might enhance our understanding of the variability of MEP signals, and potentially provide information on the role played by cortical activity fluctuations in the excitability of corticospinal pathways. Near-threshold single-pulse TMS (spTMS) was applied at random intervals over the primary motor cortex of 14 healthy participants while they sat passively, to trigger hand muscle contractions. Multichannel EEG was recorded during spTMS blocks. Spearman correlations between both the variation in MEP onset latencies and peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes, and the pre-stimulus power of EEG oscillations were calculated across participants. We found that the variation in MEP latency was positively correlated with pre-stimulus power in the theta range (4-7 Hz) in a broad time window (- 3.1 to - 1.9 s) preceding the spTMS generating the MEP. No correlation between pre-stimulus power in any frequency band and MEP amplitude was found. Our results show that pre-stimulus theta oscillations are correlated with the variation in MEP latency, an outcome measure determined by fiber conduction velocity and synaptic delays along the corticospinal tract. This finding could prove useful for clinicians using MEP latency-based information in pre- or intra-operative diagnostics of corticospinal impairment.

Chasing the zone: Reduced beta power predicts baseball batting performance	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; EEG; Sport; Beta power; Prediction	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ANXIETY; RHYTHMS	Mental state prior to sports skill execution is related to subsequent performance. For example, relationships between pre-performance electroencephalogram (EEG) power and subsequent movement outcomes in golf putting, pistol shooting, and basketball free throw shooting have been previously reported. With that said, the existing body of research examining the pre-performance EEG - performance relationship has been focused on the execution of internally as opposed to externally-paced motor skills. Given that the execution of internally and externally-paced movements are dependent on different neural pathways, in the present study we examined whether or not pre-performance EEG power predicted ensuing performance of an externally-paced motor skill - baseball batting. Sixty-seven baseball players had EEG data recorded for 120s prior to batting practice. Performance was assessed by three expert coaches and the accuracy of coach performance ratings was verified via Generalizability Theory. An analysis of our data revealed an inverse relationship between frontal EEG power in the beta range and subsequent batting performance - reduced beta power was associated with better batting performance whereas increased beta power was associated with worse batting performance. Our results are in line with prior research that has demonstrated a relationship between increased EEG power in the beta range and the subsequent commitment of motor errors in addition to the aforementioned work examining pre-performance EEG and the execution of internally-paced motor skills.

Phase of beta-frequency tACS over primary motor cortex modulates corticospinal excitability	CORTEX			English	Article						Corticospinal excitability; Motor evoked potentials; Neuronal oscillations; Transcranial alternating current stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; OSCILLATIONS; SYSTEM; TMS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; VARIABILITY; INHIBITION	The assessment of corticospinal excitability by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials is an established diagnostic tool in neurophysiology and a widely used procedure in fundamental brain research. However, concern about low reliability of these measures has grown recently. One possible cause of high variability of MEPs under identical acquisition conditions could be the influence of oscillatory neuronal activity on corticospinal excitability. Based on research showing that transcranial alternating current stimulation can entrain neuronal oscillations we here test whether alpha or beta frequency tACS can influence corticospinal excitability in a phase-dependent manner. We applied tACS at individually calibrated alpha- and beta-band oscillation frequencies, or we applied sham tACS. Simultaneous single TMS pulses time locked to eight equidistant phases of the ongoing tACS signal evoked MEPs. To evaluate offline effects of stimulation frequency, MEP amplitudes were measured before and after tACS. To evaluate whether tACS influences MEP amplitude, we fitted one-cycle sinusoids to the average MEPs elicited at the different phase conditions of each tACS frequency. We found no frequency-specific offline effects of tACS. However, beta-frequency tACS modulation of MEPs was phase-dependent. Post hoc analyses suggested that this effect was specific to participants with low (<19 Hz) intrinsic beta frequency. In conclusion, by showing that beta tACS influences MEP amplitude in a phase-dependent manner, our results support a potential role attributed to neuronal oscillations in regulating corticospinal excitability. Moreover, our findings may be useful for the development of TMS protocols that improve the reliability of MEPs as a meaningful tool for research applications or for clinical monitoring and diagnosis.

Previous work suggests this could be mitigated by better intraoperative monitoring using indexes defined by several processed electroencephalogram (EEG) measures. Unfortunately, inconsistencies between patients and anesthetic agents in current analysis techniques have limited the adoption of EEG as standard of care. In attempts to identify new analyses that discriminate clinically-relevant anesthesia timepoints, we tested 1/f frequency scaling as well as measures of complexity from nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, we tested whether analyses that characterize time-delayed embeddings, correlation dimension (CD), phase-space geometric analysis, and multiscale entropy (MSE) capture loss-of-consciousness changes in EEG activity. We performed these analyses on EEG activity collected from a traditionally hard-to-monitor patient population: geriatric patients on beta-adrenergic blockade who were anesthetized using a combination of fentanyl and propofol. We compared these analyses to traditional frequency-derived measures to test how well they discriminated EEG states before and after loss of response to verbal stimuli. We found spectral changes similar to those reported previously during loss of response. We also found significant changes in 1/f frequency scaling. Additionally, we found that our phase-space geometric characterization of time-delayed embeddings showed significant differences before and after loss of response, as did measures of MSE.

Furthermore, high dimensional EEG montages introduce huge computational burden due to excessive number of channels involved. Two experimental, i.e., inter-session and inter-subject, variabilities of EEG dynamics during motor imagery (MI) tasks are investigated in this paper. In particular, the effect on the performance of the BCIs due to day-to-day variability in EEG dynamics during the alterations in cognitive stages is explored. In addition, the inter-subject BCIs feasibility between cortically synchronized and desynchronized subject pairs on pairwise performance associativity is further examined. Moreover, the consequences of integrating spatial brain dynamics of varying the number of channels - from specific regions of the brain - are also discussed in case of both the contexts. The proposed approach is validated on real BCI data set containing EEG data from four classes of MI tasks, i.e., left/right hand, both feet, and tongue, subjected prior to a preprocessing of three different spatial filtering techniques. Experimental results have shown that a maximum classification accuracy a generic and efficient framework for plug and play use.

The visual review of such big data requires a lot of time and is not always unbiased. That is why the search for efficient instruments of long-term EEG records processing is a task of utmost importance for neurologic analysis. To solve this problem we developed a convenient instrument that expands a one-dimensional EEG signal into a two-dimensional representation. In contrast to the well known time-frequency representations we choose for EEG-like signals another representation domain - the time-scale one. This is done because fragments of interest in the EEG signal - seizures, coma signals, alpha-spindles and others often represent a few repeating waveforms, whose spectra are obscure. The most effective here is the correlative-type analysis, a special form of which - the multi-scale correlative analysis is put forward as the basis for a novel representation. The report discusses in detail the multi-scale correlation algorithm of the application developed and shows how the suggested functionality of the instrument is provided by the algorithmic features. The performance of the instrument is illustrated by the results of processing rats long-term EEGs, in particular, before and after traumatic brain injury.

The present study sought to determine whether schizophrenia involves disruption of a frontal-parietal network normally supporting WM and/or involvement of another brain network. Nineteen schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 19 healthy comparison subjects (HC) participated in a cued visual-verbal Sternberg task while dense-array EEG was recorded. A pair of item arrays each consisting of 2-4 consonants was presented bilaterally for 200 ms with a prior cue signaling the hemifield of the task-relevant WM set. A central probe letter 2,000 ms later prompted a choice reaction time decision about match/mismatch with the target WM set. Group and WM load effects on time domain and time-frequency domain 11-15 Hz alpha power were assessed for the cue-to-probe time window, and posterior 11-1.5 Hz alpha power and frontal 4-8 Hz theta power were assessed during the retention period. Directional connectivity was estimated via Granger causality, evaluating group differences in communication. SZ showed slower responding, lower accuracy, smaller overall time-domain alpha power increase, and less load-dependent alpha power increase. Midline frontal theta power increases did not vary by group or load. Network communication in SZ was characterized by temporal-to-posterior information flow, in contrast to bidirectional temporal-posterior communication in HC. Results indicate aberrant WM network activity supporting WM in SZ that might facilitate normal load-dependent and only marginally less accurate task performance, despite generally slower responding.

Identifying the brain activity associated with the early signs of depressive disorders could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. In this study we sought to investigate the EEG characteristics in young adults with newly identified depressive symptoms. Methods: Based on the initial screening, a total of 100 participants (n = 50 euthymic, n = 50 depressive) underwent 32-channel EEG acquisition. Simple logistic regression and C-statistic were used to explore if EEG power could be used to discriminate between the groups. The strongest EEG predictors of mood using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Simple logistic regression analysis with subsequent C-statistics revealed that only high-alpha and beta power originating from the left central cortex (C3) have a reliable discriminative value (ROC curve >0.7 (70%)) for differentiating the depressive group from the euthymic group. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the single most significant predictor of group (depressive vs. euthymic) is the high-alpha power over C3 (p = 0.03). Conclusion: The present findings suggest that EEG is a useful tool in the identification of neurophysiological correlates of depressive symptoms in young adults with no previous psychiatric history.

Behavioral data, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) and induced event-related oscillations (EROs) were analyzed. At the behavioral level, deprived participants showed speeded reaction times to new stimuli. Analyses of ERPs indicated that starting from 1000 ms the recognition of old objects elicited enhanced positive amplitudes only for the visually deprived group. Visual deprivation also influenced EROs. In this sense, we observed reduced power in the lower-1 alpha band for the processing of new compared to old stimuli between 500 and 750 ms. Overall, our data showed improved haptic recognition memory after a short period of visual deprivation. These effects were thought to reflect a compensatory mechanism that might have developed as an adaptive strategy for dealing with the environment when visual information is not available.

Methods: Non-stuttering (NS) adults spoke in one control condition (solo speaking) and four experimental conditions (choral speech, delayed auditory feedback (DAF), prolonged speech and pseudostuttering). Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify sensorimotor mu components from EEG recordings. Time-frequency analyses measured mu-alpha (8-13 Hz) and mu-beta (15-25 Hz) event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) during each speech condition. Results: 19/24 participants contributed mu components. Relative to the control condition, the choral and DAF conditions elicited increases in mu-alpha ERD in the right hemisphere. In the pseudostuttering condition, increases in mu-beta ERD were observed in the left hemisphere. No differences were present between the prolonged speech and control conditions. Conclusions: Differences observed in the experimental conditions are thought to reflect sensorimotor control changes. Increases in right hemisphere mu-alpha ERD likely reflect increased reliance on auditory information, including auditory feedback, during the choral and DAF conditions. In the left hemisphere, increases in mu-beta ERD during pseudostuttering may have resulted from the different movement characteristics of this task compared with the solo speaking task. Relationships to findings in stuttering are discussed. Significance: Changes in sensorimotor control related feedforward and feedback control in fluency-enhancing speech manipulations can be measured using time-frequency decompositions of EEG mu rhythms in neurotypical speakers. This quiet, non-invasive, and temporally sensitive technique may be applied to learn more about normal sensorimotor control and fluency enhancement in PWS.

Dissociable processing of emotional and neutral body movements revealed by mu-alpha and beta rhythms	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						action simulation; emotional body movement; time-frequency EEG; mu suppression; beta enhancement	RAPID FACIAL REACTIONS; POINT-LIGHT; BIOLOGICAL MOTION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG; PERCEPTION; AUTISM; SIMULATION; EXPRESSIONS; SUPPRESSION	Both when actions are executed and observed, electroencephalography (EEG) has shown reduced alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations over sensorimotor cortex. This 'mu-alpha' suppression is thought to reflect mental simulation of action, which has been argued to support internal representation of others' emotional states. Despite the proposed role of simulation in emotion perception, little is known about the effect of emotional content on mu-suppression. We recorded high-density EEG while participants viewed point-light displays of emotional vs neutral body movements in 'coherent' biologically plausible and 'scrambled' configurations. Although coherent relative to scrambled stimuli elicited mu-alpha suppression, the comparison of emotional and neutral movement, controlling for basic visual input, revealed suppression effects in both alpha and beta bands. Whereas alpha-band activity reflected reduced power for emotional stimuli in central and occipital sensors, beta power at frontocentral sites was driven by enhancement for neutral relative to emotional actions. A median-split by autism-spectrum quotient score revealed weaker mu-alpha suppression and beta enhancement in participants with autistic tendencies, suggesting that sensorimotor simulation may be differentially engaged depending on social capabilities. Consistent with theories of embodied emotion, these data support a link between simulation and social perception while more firmly connecting emotional processing to the activity of sensorimotor systems.

Differentiation in Theta and Beta Electrocortical Activity between Visual and Physical Perturbations to Walking and Standing Balance	ENEURO			English	Article						balance control; EEG; independent component analysis; perturbation	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VIRTUAL-REALITY; STANCE PERTURBATION; TREADMILL WALKING	Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely timed coordination among sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain-imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine whether by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10 min trials of beam walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20 degrees field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time-frequency fluctuations in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared with pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time-frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual versus physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.

Methods: Patients with focal epilepsy were implanted with subdural electrodes during presurgical evaluation. Patients without seizures were implanted during treatment with motor cortex stimulation for atypical facial pain. Results: The rate and amplitude of spikes correlate with qualitative seizure probability across patient groups and with proximity to the seizure onset zone in focal epilepsy patients. Spikes occur earlier during the negative oscillation of underlying slow activity (0.5-2 Hz) when seizure probability is increased. Similarly, coupling between slow and fast activity is increased. Conclusions: There is likely a continuum of sharply contoured activity between non-epileptiform and epileptiform. Characteristics of spiking and how spikes relate to slow activity can be combined to predict seizure onset zones. Significance: Intracranial EEG data from patients without seizures represent a unique comparison group and highlight changes seen in spiking and slow wave activity with increased seizure probability. Slow wave activity and related physiology are an important potential biomarker for estimating seizure probability. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Given that higher aggression levels are associated with worse behavioral inhibition and that athletes show better behavioral inhibition than non-athletes, it is unclear why contact athletes would exhibit higher aggression levels. Emotion, especially anger, is an important factor in the generation of aggressive behavior, and anger has been shown to affect behavioral inhibition. Thus, the present study examined the influence of anger on behavioral inhibition in contact athletes. An implicit emotional Go/No-go task was used that contained 50 anger-associated words and 50 neutral words as stimuli. Participants were asked to execute a key press depending on the explicit color of word and to ignore any (implicit) emotional information associated with the word. The results showed a significant interaction in performance accuracy on the No-go task between emotion (i.e., anger-associated words versus neutral words) and group (athlete versus non-athlete). The performance accuracy of the contact athletes on anger-associated stimuli was significantly lower than that for neutral stimuli. Evoked delta and theta oscillations were analyzed at the time windows 200-600 and 200-400 ms respectively in both groups. A time-frequency analysis indicated a significant interaction between group, emotion and task for both evoked delta and theta oscillations. Post hoc analyses showed that stronger evoked delta and theta oscillations were evoked during the presentation of anger-associated stimuli compared with neutral stimuli on the No-go task in athletes. By contrast, no other significant effect was found in the control group or between the control and athlete groups. These results indicate that time-frequency analysis can effectively distinguish conventional ERP components and that implicit anger significantly weakens behavioral inhibition in contact athletes but not in non-athletes.

Neural oscillations patterns are perhaps the best salient feature of EEG as they are rhythmic activities of the brain that can be generated by interactions across neurons. Large-scale oscillations can be measured by EEG as the different oscillation patterns reflected within the different frequency bands, and can provide us with new insights into brain functions. In order to understand how information about the rhythmic activity of the brain during visuomotor/imagined cognitive tasks is encoded in the brain we precisely quantify the different features of the oscillatory patterns considering the Shannon-Fisher plane HxF. This allows us to distinguish the dynamics of rhythmic activities of the brain showing that the Beta band facilitate information transmission during visuomotor/imagined tasks.

EEG Characteristics of Dementia With Lewy Bodies, Alzheimer's Disease and Mixed Pathology	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB); Alzheimer's disease (AD); EEG; spectral analysis; differential diagnosis	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; CONNECTIVITY; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; SURVIVAL; POWER; TIME; MEG	Introduction: Previous studies on electroencephalography (EEG) to discriminate between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been promising. These studies did not consider the pathological overlap of the two diseases. DLB-patients with concomitant AD pathology (DLB/AD+) have a more severe disease manifestation. The EEG may also be influenced by a synergistic effect of the two pathologies. We aimed to compare EEG characteristics between DLB/AD+, "pure" DLB (DLB/AD-) and AD. Methods: We selected probable DLB patients who had an EEG and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) available, from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC). Concomitant AD-pathology was defined as a CSF tau/A beta-42 ratio > 0.52. Forty-one DLB/AD+ cases were matched for age (mean 70 (range 53-85)) and sex (85% male) 1: 1 to DLB/AD and AD-patients. EEGs were assessed visually, with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), network- and connectivity measures. Results: EEG visual severity score (range 1-5) did not differ between DLB/AD and DLB/AD+ (2.7 in both groups) and was higher compared to AD (1.9, p < 0.01). Both DLB groups had a lower peak frequency (7.0 Hz and 6.9 Hz in DLB vs. 8.2 in AD, p < 0.05), more slow-wave activity and more prominent disruptions of connectivity and networks, compared to AD. No significant differences were found between DLB/AD+ and DLB/AD-. Discussion: EEG abnormalities are more pronounced in DLB, regardless of AD co-pathology. This emphasizes the valuable role of EEG in discriminating between DLB and AD. It suggests that EEG slowing in DLB is influenced more by the alpha-synucleinopathy, or the associated cholinergic deficit, than by amyloid and tau pathology.

Old Brains Come Uncoupled in Sleep: Slow Wave-Spindle Synchrony, Brain Atrophy, and Forgetting	NEURON			English	Article							ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; DEPENDENT MEMORY; DYNAMICS; PHASE; HIPPOCAMPUS; ADULTS; NEOCORTEX	The coupled interaction between slow-wave oscillations and sleep spindles during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep has been proposed to support memory consolidation. However, little evidence in humans supports this theory. Moreover, whether such dynamic coupling is impaired as a consequence of brain aging in later life, contributing to cognitive and memory decline, is unknown. Combining electroencephalography (EEG), structural MRI, and sleep-dependent memory assessment, we addressed these questions in cognitively normal young and older adults. Directional cross-frequency coupling analyses demonstrated that the slow wave governs a precise temporal coordination of sleep spindles, the quality of which predicts overnight memory retention. Moreover, selective atrophy within the medial frontal cortex in older adults predicted a temporal dispersion of this slow wave-spindle coupling, impairing overnight memory consolidation and leading to forgetting. Prefrontal-dependent deficits in the spatiotemporal coordination of NREM sleep oscillations therefore represent one pathway explaining age-related memory decline.

Here we took advantage of the information available in temporal oscillatory patterns evoked by simple perceptual decisions to investigate whether stimulus dependent oscillatory signatures can be used as potential biomarkers in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: We studied an extensive set of stimuli (9 categories of faces) and performed data driven classification (Support vector machine, SVM) of ASD vs. Controls with features based on the EEG power responses. We carried out an extensive time-frequency and synchrony analysis of distinct face categories requiring different processing mechanisms in terms of non-holistic vs. holistic processing. Results: We found that the neuronal oscillatory responses of low gamma frequency band, locked to photographic and abstract two-tone (Mooney) face stimulus presentation are decreased in ASD vs. the control group. We also found decreased time-frequency (TF) responses in the beta band in ASD after 350 ms, possibly related to motor preparation. On the other hand, synchrony in the 30-45 Hz band showed a distinct spatial pattern in ASD. These power changes enabled accurate classification of ASD with an SVM approach. SVM accuracy was approximately 85%. ROC curves showed about 94% AUC (area under the curve). Combination of Mooney and Photographic face stimuli evoked features enabled a better separation between groups, reaching an AUC of 98.6%. Conclusion: We identified a relative decrease in EEG responses to face stimuli in ASD in the beta (15-30 Hz; > 350 ms) and gamma (30-45 Hz; 55-80 Hz; 50-350 ms) frequency ranges. These can be used as input of a machine learning approach to separate between groups with high accuracy. Significance: Future studies can use EEG time-frequency patterns evoked by particular types of faces as a diagnostic biomarker and potentially as outcome measures in therapeutic trials.

Alpha Oscillations during Incidental Encoding Predict Subsequent Memory for New "Foil" Information	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN EPISODIC MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; CONSTRAINED RETRIEVAL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG-ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECOLLECTION; DYNAMICS; POWER	People can employ adaptive strategies to increase the likelihood that previously encoded information will be successfully retrieved. One such strategy is to constrain retrieval toward relevant information by reimplementing the neurocognitive processes that were engaged during encoding. Using EEG, we examined the temporal dynamics with which constraining retrieval toward semantic versus nonsemantic information affects the processing of new foil information encountered during a memory test. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data acquired during an initial study phase revealed that semantic compared with nonsemantic processing was associated with alpha decreases in a left frontal electrode cluster from around 600 msec after stimulus onset. Successful encoding of semantic versus nonsemantic foils during a subsequent memory test was related to decreases in alpha oscillatory activity in the same left frontal electrode cluster, which emerged relatively late in the trial at around 1000-1600 msec after stimulus onset. Across participants, left frontal alpha power elicited by semantic processing during the study phase correlated significantly with left frontal alpha power associated with semantic foil encoding during the memory test. Furthermore, larger left frontal alpha power decreases elicited by semantic foil encoding during the memory test predicted better subsequent semantic foil recognition in an additional surprise foil memory test, although this effect did not reach significance. These findings indicate that constraining retrieval toward semantic information involves reimplementing semantic encoding operations that are mediated by alpha oscillations and that such reimplementation occurs at a late stage of memory retrieval, perhaps reflecting additional monitoring processes.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are defined as EEG events in the frequency range between 80 and 500 Hz, consisting of oscillations that stand out from the EEG background activity.(1-3) HFOs are subdivided into ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (FRs) (>250 Hz).(3-5)	[Cendes, Fernando] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Neurol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Meador, Kimford J.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA		Cendes, F (corresponding author), Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Neurol, Sao Paulo, Brazil.	fcendes@unicamp.br	Meador, Kimford/W-6167-2019; Cendes, Fernando/C-1301-2012	Cendes, Fernando/0000-0001-9336-9568; Meador, Kimford/0000-0002-7471-882X					10	1	1	0	1	LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS	PHILADELPHIA	TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA	0028-3878	1526-632X		NEUROLOGY	Neurology	FEB 20	2018	90	8					347	348		10.1212/WNL.0000000000005008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000005008			2	Clinical Neurology	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Neurosciences & Neurology	FZ7WF	29367442				2022-08-02	WOS:000427814700014

What brain areas are bound in the network and how the network activity is modulated by rhythmic complexity have not been completely explored. To contribute to answering these questions, we designed a study in which nine healthy participants performed simple to complex rhythmic finger movement tasks while undergoing simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography (fMRI-EEG) recordings of their brain activity during the tasks and rest. From fMRI blood oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) measurements, we found that the complexity of rhythms was associated with brain activations in the primary motor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor area (SMA), and cerebellum (Cb), and with network interactions from these cortical regions to the cerebellum. The spectral analysis of single-trial EEG source waveforms at the cortical regions further showed that there were bidirectional interactions between PMC and SMA, and the complexity of rhythms was associated with power spectra and Granger causality spectra in the beta (13-30 Hz) frequency band, not in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and gamma (30-58 Hz) bands. These results provide us new insights into the mechanisms for movement rhythm complexity.

Methods: We analyzed simultaneously acquired EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) eyes-closed resting state data in a convenience sample of 30 participants. IC analysis (ICA) was used to decompose the EEG time-series and common ICs were identified using data-driven IC clustering across subjects. The IC time courses were filtered into seven frequency bands, convolved with a hemeodynamic response function (HRF) and used to model spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations across the brain. In parallel, group ICA analysis was used to decompose the fMRI signal into ICs from which the DMN was identified. Frequency and IC cluster associated hemeodynamic correlation maps obtained from the regression analysis were spatially correlated with the DMN. To investigate the reliability of our findings, the analyses were repeated with data collected from the same subjects 1 year later. Results: Our results indicate a relationship between power fluctuations in the delta, theta, beta and gamma frequency range and the DMN in different EEG ICs in our sample as shown by small to moderate spatial correlations at the first measurement (0.234 < | r| < 0.346, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, activity within an EEG component commonly identified as eye movements correlates with BOLD activity within regions of the DMN. In addition, we demonstrate that correlations between EEG ICs and the BOLD signal during rest are in part stable across time. Discussion: We show that ICA source separated EEG signals can be used to investigate electrophysiological correlates of the DMN. The relationship between the eye movement component and the DMN points to a behavioral association between DMN activity and the level of eye movement or the presence of neuronal activity in this component. Previous findings of an association between frontal midline theta activity and the DMN were replicated.

However, no prior study has directly quantified how such neuronal noise relates to the rate of percept reversals. Specifically, it has remained unknown whether individual differences in complexity of resting-state oscillations-as reflected in long-range temporal correlations (LRTC)-are associated with perceptual stability. We hypothesized that participants with stronger resting-state LRTC in the alpha band experience more stable percepts, and thereby fewer perceptual switches. Furthermore, we expected that participants who report less discontinuous thoughts during rest, experience less switches. To test this, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in 65 healthy volunteers during 5 min Eyes-Closed Rest (ECR), after which they filled in the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ). This was followed by three conditions where participants attended an ambiguous structure-from-motion stimulus-Neutral (passively observe the stimulus), Hold (the percept for as long as possible), and Switch (as often as possible). LRTC of resting-state alpha oscillations predicted the number of switches only in the Hold condition, with stronger LRTC associated with less switches. Contrary to our expectations, there was no association between resting-state Discontinuity of Mind and percept stability. Participants were capable of controlling switching according to task goals, and this was accompanied by increased alpha power during Hold and decreased power during Switch. Fewer switches were associated with stronger task-related alpha LRTC in all conditions. Together, our data suggest that bistable visual perception is to some extent under voluntary control and influenced by LRTC of alpha oscillations.

Cerebral peak alpha frequency predicts individual differences in pain sensitivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state; EEG; Hyperalgesia; Biomarker; Neuropathic pain; Ongoing oscillations	TOPICAL CAPSAICIN; BAND OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVITY REFLECTS; EEG; PERCEPTION; HYPERALGESIA; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; PHASE; STATE	The identification of neurobiological markers that predict individual predisposition to pain are not only important for development of effective pain treatments, but would also yield a more complete understanding of how pain is implemented in the brain. In the current study using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the relationship between the peak frequency of alpha activity over sensorimotor cortex and pain intensity during capsaicin-heat pain (C-HP), a prolonged pain model known to induce spinal central sensitization in primates. We found that peak alpha frequency (PAF) recorded during a pain-free period preceding the induction of prolonged pain correlated with subsequent pain intensity reports: slower peak frequency at pain-free state was associated with higher pain during the prolonged pain condition. Moreover, the degree to which PAF decreased between pain-free and prolonged pain states was correlated with pain intensity. These two metrics were statistically uncorrelated and in combination were able to account for 50% of the variability in pain intensity. Altogether, our findings suggest that pain-free state PAF over relevant sensory systems could serve as a marker of individual predisposition to prolonged pain. Moreover, slowing of PAF in response to prolonged pain could represent an objective marker for subjective pain intensity. Our findings potentially lead the way for investigations in clinical populations in which alpha oscillations and the brain areas contributing to their generation are used in identifying and formulating treatment strategies for patients more likely to develop chronic pain.

The ASSR is altered in different diseases of the central nervous system such as schizophrenia. However, in order to use the ASSR as biological markers for disease states, it needs to be understood how different vigilance states and underlying brain activity affect the ASSR. Here, we compared the effects of auditory rhythmic stimuli on EEG brain activity during wake and NREM sleep, investigated the influence of the presence of dominant sleep rhythms on the ASSR, and delineated the topographical distribution of these modulations. Participants (14 healthy males, 20-33 years) completed on the same day a 60 min nap session and two 30 min wakefulness sessions (before and after the nap). During these sessions, amplitude modulated (AM) white noise auditory stimuli at different frequencies were applied. High-density EEG was continuously recorded and time-frequency analyses were performed to assess ASSR during wakefulness and NREM periods. Our analysis revealed that depending on the electrode location, stimulation frequency applied and window/frequencies analysed the ASSR was significantly modulated by sleep pressure (before and after sleep), vigilance state (wake vs. NREM sleep), and the presence of slow wave activity and sleep spindles. Furthermore, AM stimuli increased spindle activity during NREM sleep but not during wakefulness. Thus, (1) electrode location, sleep history, vigilance state and ongoing brain activity needs to be carefully considered when investigating ASSR and (2) auditory rhythmic stimuli during sleep might represent a powerful tool to boost sleep spindles.

Previous studies only found postoperative analgesia dosage significantly reduced in tDCS group while the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was applied. However, there lacks the study about the effect of M1-tDCS on pain intensity and brain activity while the analgesia dosage is the same for both groups. Objective: To investigate whether M1-tDCS can (1) reduce pain intensity and (2) change spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations in prefrontal cortex, in patients with postoperative pain, after taking the constant dosage of analgesics. Methods: A prospective, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study was conducted. 32 patients with postoperative pain after lumbar spine surgery were recruited. All patients received same dosage of dezocine before intervention. In the morning of the first day after surgery and before dezocine injection, a single 20-minute session of anodal M1-tDCS was applied to 'tDCS' group while sham stimulation to 'sham' group. Numeric rating scale (NRS) and resting-state EEG with eyes-closed were measured and analyzed. EEG spectral powers were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Correlation analysis was conducted between the change of NRS and the change of spectral power. Results: The NRS in "tDCS" group significantly decreased (p < 0.01) while not in "sham" group after intervention. Only spectral power within alpha2 band (10-13 Hz) in Fp1 and beta1 band (13-20 Hz) in Fp1 showed significant Time x Intervention interaction effect. These changes of the spectral power also showed significant correlation with the change of NRS. Conclusions: The postoperative pain intensity in patients receiving surgery could reduce after a single session of anodal M1-tDCS compared to sham M1-tDCS. The effect to the top-down dimension of postoperative pain might account for the analgesic effect of M1-tDCS, which reflecting slow oscillations in left prefrontal EEG.

Mirror cortical activity was proposed to underpin the interpersonal sharing of touch, allowing an automatic and unconscious simulation of others' somatic states. However, recent evidence questioned the existence of a tactile shared representation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and the neural correlates of self-other distinction in the somatosensory system remains unknown. We address these issues by exploring S1 reactivity, and the associated neural network oscillations and connectivity, to self and others' touch. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation combined with Electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) recordings were performed during tactile perception and observation, looking for differences in cortical activation and connectivity between felt and seen touch. The sight of a touch directed to a human body part, but not to an object, triggered an early activation of S1 as a felt touch did, which, in both conditions, propagated to fronto-parietal regions. Critically, touch perception and observation shared an effective connectivity network generated in the beta band, which is typically associated to unconscious tactile processing. Conversely, alpha band connectivity, a marker of conscious tactile processing, was detected only for real tactile stimulation. Alpha connectivity within a fronto-parietal pathway seems to underpin the ability to distinguish self and others' somatosensory states, controlling and distinguishing shared tactile representations in S1.

Variant Intestinal-Cell Kinase in Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							SEQUENCE VARIANTS; GENETIC-VARIATION; GUIDELINES; CAUSALITY; EFHC1; PROLIFERATION; ACTIVATION; DISEASE; FAMILY; ICK	BACKGROUND In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, data are limited on the genetic basis of networks promoting convulsions with diffuse polyspikes on electroencephalography (EEG) and the subtle microscopic brain dysplasia called microdysgenesis. METHODS Using Sanger sequencing, we sequenced the exomes of six members of a large family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and confirmed cosegregation in all 37 family members. We screened an additional 310 patients with this disorder for variants on DNA melting-curve analysis and targeted real-time DNA sequencing of the gene encoding intestinal-cell kinase (ICK). We calculated Bayesian logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for cosegregating variants, odds ratios in case-control associations, and allele frequencies in the Genome Aggregation Database. We performed functional tests of the effects of variants on mitosis, apoptosis, and radial neuroblast migration in vitro and conducted video-EEG studies in mice lacking a copy of Ick. RESULTS A variant, K305T (c.914A -> C), cosegregated with epilepsy or polyspikes on EEG in 12 members of the family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. We identified 21 pathogenic ICK variants in 22 of 310 additional patients (7%). Four strongly linked variants (K220E, K305T, A615T, and R632X) impaired mitosis, cell-cycle exit, and radial neuroblast migration while promoting apoptosis. Tonic-clonic convulsions and polyspikes on EEG resembling seizures in human juvenile myoclonic epilepsy occurred more often in knockout heterozygous mice than in wildtype mice (P = 0.02) during light sleep with isoflurane anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Our data provide evidence that heterozygous variants in ICK caused juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in 7% of the patients included in our analysis. Variant ICK affects cell processes that help explain microdysgenesis and polyspike networks observed on EEG in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.	[Bailey, J.

A high-density scalp EEG dataset acquired during brief naps after a visual working memory task	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper							SLEEP SPINDLES	There is growing interest in understanding how specific neural events that occur during sleep, including characteristic spindle oscillations between 10 and 16 Hz (Hz), are related to learning and memory. Neural events can be recorded during sleep using the well-known method of scalp electroencephalography (EEG). While publicly available sleep EEG datasets exist, most consist of only a few channels collected in specific patient groups being evaluated overnight for sleep disorders in clinical settings. The dataset described in this Data in Brief includes 22 participants who each participated in EEG recordings on two separate days. The dataset includes manual annotation of sleep stages and 2528 manually annotated spindles. Signals from 64-channels were continuously recorded at 1 kHz with a high-density active electrode system while participants napped for 30 or 60 min inside a sound-attenuated testing booth after performing a high- or low-load visual working memory task where load was randomized across recording days. The high-density EEG datasets present several advantages over single- or few-channel datasets including most notably the opportunity to explore spatial differences in the distribution of neural events, including whether spindles occur locally on only a few channels or co-occur globally across many channels, whether spindle frequency, duration, and amplitude vary as a function of brain hemisphere and anterior-posterior axis, and whether the probability of spindle occurrence varies as a function of the phase of ongoing slow oscillations. The dataset, along with python source code for file input and signal processing, is made freely available at the Open Science Framework through the link haps://osf.io/chav7/.(C) 2018 The Authors.

EEG-based neurophysiological indicators of hallucinations in Alzheimer's disease: Comparison with dementia with Lewy bodies	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Hallucinations; EEG; Random forest	NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; BAND OSCILLATIONS; NUCLEUS BASALIS; DLB CONSORTIUM; BRAIN NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; ATTENTION	We studied neurophysiological indicators of hallucinations in Alzheimer's disease patients with hallucinations (ADhall+), and compared them with nonhallucinating AD (ADhall-) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBhall+) patients. Thirty-six matched ADhall+and 108 ADhall- and 29 DLBhall+ patients were selected from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Electroencephalography (EEG) spectral and functional connectivity (FC) analyses (phase lag index) were performed. Quantitative and visual EEG measures were combined in a random forest algorithm to determine which EEG-based variable(s) play a role in hallucinations. ADhall+ patients showed lower peak frequency (7.26 vs. 7.94 Hz, p < 0.01), alpha 2-and beta-power, and alpha 2-FC but higher dpowercompared to ADhall-. ADhall+ showed lower delta-power, higher beta-power, and alpha 1-FC than DLBhallthornbut did not differ in peak frequency (7.26 vs. 6.95 Hz), theta -or alpha-power. ADhall+ patients could be differentiated from ADhall- and DLBhall+ with aweighted accuracy of 71% with alpha 1-power and 100% with beta-FC, the 2 most differentiating features. In sum, EEG slowing and decrease in alpha 1-and beta-band activity form potential neurophysiological indicators of underlying cholinergic deficiency in ADhall+ and DLBhall+. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Compressibility of High-Density EEG Signals in Stroke Patients	SENSORS			English	Article						compressive sensing; High-Density Electroencephalography; stroke	MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; MOTOR; OSCILLATIONS; IMPROVEMENT; RECOVERY	Stroke is a critical event that causes the disruption of neural connections. There is increasing evidence that the brain tries to reorganize itself and to replace the damaged circuits, by establishing compensatory pathways. Intra- and extra-cellular currents are involved in the communication between neurons and the macroscopic effects of such currents can be detected at the scalp through electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors. EEG can be used to study the lesions in the brain indirectly, by studying their effects on the brain electrical activity. The primary goal of the present work was to investigate possible asymmetries in the activity of the two hemispheres, in the case one of them is affected by a lesion due to stroke. In particular, the compressibility of High-Density-EEG (HD-EEG) recorded at the two hemispheres was investigated since the presence of the lesion is expected to impact on the regularity of EEG signals. The secondary objective was to evaluate if standard low density EEG is able to provide such information. Eighteen patients with unilateral stroke were recruited and underwent HD-EEG recording. Each EEG signal was compressively sensed, using Block Sparse Bayesian Learning, at increasing compression rate. The two hemispheres showed significant differences in the compressibility of EEG. Signals acquired at the electrode locations of the affected hemisphere showed a better reconstruction quality, quantified by the Structural SIMilarity index (SSIM), than the EEG signals recorded at the healthy hemisphere (p < 0.05), for each compression rate value. The presence of the lesion seems to induce an increased regularity in the electrical activity of the brain, thus an increased compressibility.

J	Huang, N; Slaney, M; Elhilali, M				Huang, Nicholas; Slaney, Malcolm; Elhilali, Mounya			Connecting Deep Neural Networks to Physical, Perceptual, and Electrophysiological Auditory Signals	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						convolutional neural network; auditory salience; natural scenes; audio classification; electroencephalography; deep learning	ATTENTION; GAMMA; EEG; REPRESENTATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; SALIENCE; MODELS	Deep neural networks have been recently shown to capture intricate information transformation of signals from the sensory profiles to semantic representations that facilitate recognition or discrimination of complex stimuli. In this vein, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used very successfully in image and audio classification. Designed to imitate the hierarchical structure of the nervous system, CNNs reflect activation with increasing degrees of complexity that transform the incoming signal onto object-level representations. In this work, we employ a CNN trained for large-scale audio object classification to gain insights about the contribution of various audio representations that guide sound perception. The analysis contrasts activation of different layers of a CNN with acoustic features extracted directly from the scenes, perceptual salience obtained from behavioral responses of human listeners, as well as neural oscillations recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) in response to the same natural scenes. All three measures are tightly linked quantities believed to guide percepts of salience and object formation when listening to complex scenes. The results paint a picture of the intricate interplay between low-level and object-level representations in guiding auditory salience that is very much dependent on context and sound category.

Before classifying sleep stages, representative features are extracted by feature extraction method, such as FFT in the frequency domain of EEG signal and Hilbert transform in time domain, to reduce dimensionality and channel numbers. Other parameters are also used, e.g. Hjorth parameters. Then a Random Forest is trained by classifying the sleep stages. The TFRF is evaluated by means of Dreams database provided by University of MONS - TCTS Laboratory. The new standard of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine about the sleep stage classification is obeyed. 16 objects are considered as the training samples, while the other 4 objects are regarded as the test samples. A best result of 90.4% sensitivity is got with the signals from only one channel. Its application prospect is very extensive.

The purpose of this review is to highlight a number of recent studies that have investigated the alpha band (8-12 Hz) oscillatory activity present in magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography, to provide new insights into the maladaptive network activity underlying attentional impairments in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies reviewed demonstrate that event-related decrease in alpha is attenuated during visual selective attention, primarily in ADHD inattentive type, and is often significantly associated with accuracy and reaction time during task performance. Furthermore, aberrant modulation of alpha activity has been reported across development and may have abnormal or atypical lateralization patterns in ADHD. Modulations in the alpha band thus represent a robust, relatively unexplored putative biomarker of attentional impairment and a strong prospect for future studies aimed at examining underlying neural mechanisms and treatment response among individuals with ADHD. Potential limitations of its use as a diagnostic biomarker and directions for future research are discussed.

Quantitative electroencephalograms (QEEGs) of Thai professional female soccer team players were analyzed in terms of aggression. Material/Method: The QEEGs of 17 soccer players were recorded three times: twice before a competition (once per week) and one week after the competition. Results:There was a significant increase in the beta frequency band associated with the Fp(1), Fp(2), F-7, and F-8 positions as the competition approached. The changes in brain activity were observed in two patterns: the first was an increase in the intensity level of brain processing (presented in terms of brain topographic maps as absolute power), and the second was the magnitude of the amplitude at each of the EEG channels between the hemispheres (presented in terms of brain connectivity as amplitude asymmetry). Conclusions: Consequently, QEEG values were examined as they related to aggression. In the statistical analysis, paired-sample t tests confirmed that an aggressive phenomenon occurred as the competition approached. In addition, the aggressive phenomenon was found in the brain activity of players with defensive soccer positions.

SSVEP response is a near sinusoidal waveform at a visual stimulus frequency and is time-locked to stimulus onset. This paper presents a new single channel SSVEP detection method that takes advantage of the behaviour of SSVEP response. The proposed method defines subject-specific sinusoids at the training stage. Detection of a target stimulus frequency is achieved by a correlation value between the electroencephalography (EEG) signal and subject specific sinusoids at the test stage. The performance of the developed method was compared with the well-known power spectral density analysis (PSDA) on a benchmark dataset. Experimental results show that the developed method significantly improves the SSVEP detection accuracy (by about 23%) as well as the information transfer rate (ITR) compared to PSDA methods.

This study explores alternative sound-based methods for EEG interpretation which are designed to allow for intuitive and quick differentiation between healthy background activity and abnormal activity such as seizures. A novel method based on frequency and amplitude modulation (FM/AM) is presented. The algorithm is tuned to facilitate the audio domain perception of rhythmic activity which is specific to neonatal seizures. The method is compared with the previously developed phase vocoder algorithm for different time compressing factors. A survey is conducted amongst a cohort of non-EEG experts to quantitatively and qualitatively examine the performance of sound-based methods in comparison with the visual interpretation.

Electroencephalographic markers of brain development during sevoflurane anaesthesia in children up to 3 years old	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						anaesthesia; general; child; development	GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; PROPOFOL; INFANTS; EEG; CONSCIOUSNESS; SIGNATURES; EMERGENCE; DYNAMICS; AROUSAL	Background: General anaesthetics generate spatially defined brain oscillations in the EEG that relate fundamentally to neural-circuit architecture. Few studies detailing the neural-circuit activity of general anaesthesia in children have been described. The study aim was to identify age-related changes in EEG characteristics that mirror different stages of early human brain development during sevoflurane anaesthesia. Methods: Multichannel EEG recordings were performed in 91 children aged 0-3 yr undergoing elective surgery. We mapped spatial power and coherence over the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices during maintenance anaesthesia. Results: During sevoflurane exposure: (i) slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations were present in all ages, (ii) theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations emerge by similar to 4 months, (iii) alpha oscillations increased in power from 4 to 10 months, (iv) frontal alpha-oscillation predominance emerged at similar to 6 months, (v) frontal slow oscillations were coherent from birth until 6 months, and (vi) frontal alpha oscillations became coherent similar to 10 months and persisted in older ages. Conclusions: Key developmental milestones in the maturation of the thalamo-cortical circuitry likely generate changes in EEG patterns in infants undergoing sevoflurane general anaesthesia. Characterisation of anaesthesia-induced EEG oscillations in children demonstrates the importance of developing age-dependent strategies to monitor properly the brain states of children receiving general anaesthesia. These data have the potential to guide future studies investigating neurodevelopmental pathologies involving altered excitatory-inhibitory balance, such as epilepsy or Rett syndrome.

Abnormal cortical neural synchrony during working memory in schizophrenia	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Working memory; Neural oscillation; Cortical source analysis; Magnetoencephalography (MEG)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTIONAL APRAXIA; PARIETAL CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POWER CHANGES; MAINTENANCE; EEG; INHIBITION	Objective: To better understand the origins of working memory (WM) impairment in schizophrenia we investigated cortical oscillatory activity in people with schizophrenia (PSZ) while they performed a WM task requiring encoding, maintenance, and retrieval/manipulation processes of spatial information. Methods: We examined time-frequency synchronous energy of cortical source signals that were derived from magnetoencephalography (MEG) localized to cortical regions using WM-related hemodynamic responses and individualized structural head-models. Results: Compared to thirteen healthy controls (HC), twelve PSZ showed performance deficits regardless of WM-load or duration. During encoding, PSZ had early theta and delta event-related synchrony (ERS) deficits in prefrontal and visual cortices which worsened with greater memory load and predicted WM performance. During prolonged maintenance of material, PSZ showed deficient beta event-related desynchrony (ERD) in dorsolateral prefrontal, posterior parietal, and visual cortices. In retrieval, PSZ showed reduced delta/theta ERS in the anterior prefrontal and ventral visual cortices and diminished gamma ERS in the premotor and posterior parietal cortices. Conclusions: Although beta/gamma cortical neural oscillatory deficits for maintenance/retrieval are evident during WM, the abnormal prefrontal theta-frequency ERS for encoding is most predictive of poor WM in schizophrenia. Significance: Time-frequency-spatial analysis identified process-and frequency-specific neural synchrony abnormalities underlying WM deficits in schizophrenia.

J	Senay, S				Senay, Seda			Time-frequency BSS of biosignals	HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article							SPHEROIDAL WAVE-FUNCTIONS; TRANSFORM	Time-frequency (TF) representations are very important tools to understand and explain circumstances, where the frequency content of non-stationary signals varies in time. A variety of biosignals such as speech, electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogram (EMG) show some form of non-stationarity. Considering Priestley's evolutionary (time-dependent) spectral theory for analysis of non-stationary signals, the authors defined a TF representation called evolutionary Slepian transform (EST). The evolutionary spectral theory generalises the definition of spectra while avoiding some of the shortcomings of bilinear TF methods. The performance of the EST in the representation of biosignals for the blind source separation (BSS) problem to extract information from a mixture of sources is studied. For example, in the case of EEG recordings, as electrodes are placed along the scalp, what is actually observed from EEG data at each electrode is a mixture of all the active sources. Separation of these sources from a mixture of observations is crucial for the analysis of recordings. In this study, they show that the EST can be used efficiently in the TF-based BSS problem of biosignals.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is considered to be one of the most effective methods for clinically diagnosing the brain state. In the present study, we investigated if it is possible to find a robust neuro-marker to help doctors diagnose brain death from the perspective of brain information interaction. With 6-channel EEG data collected from prefrontal lobe of 30 patients (deep coma: 13, brain death 17), PLV was used to measure the phase synchronization and quantify the interaction between brain regions. Firstly, we found that there exists significant difference in brain synchronization between brain death patients and deep coma patients. Then, an interesting phenomenon was observed. In all the three low frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha), synchronization between the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere (IHPS) is significantly stronger than that only in left (LHPS) or right hemisphere (RHPS) for deep coma patients. However, this phenomenon has not been found in high frequency bands (beta and gamma) and for brain death patients. More importantly, it was verified for almost every patient (only 1 exception). This phenomenon might provide a robust neuro-marker for brain death diagnosis. Finally, we tried to distinguish between brain death and brain coma by monitoring brain synchronization in real time. The results also show the effectiveness and accuracy of our method. The method proposed in this paper can not only provide doctors with more stable and effective information, but also hope to develop a new visualization tool to assist brain death diagnosis.

SEEG recordings can tap into neural signals across the entire brain and thereby sample both cortical and subcortical sites. However, even though signal referencing is important for proper assessment of SEEG signals, no previous study has comprehensively evaluated the optimal referencing method for SEEG. In our study, we recorded SEEG data from 15 human subjects during a motor task, referencing them against the average of two white matter contacts (monopolar reference). We then subjected these signals to 5 different re-referencing approaches: common average reference (CAR), gray-white matter reference (GWR), electrode shaft reference (ESR), bipolar reference, and Laplacian reference. The results from three different signal quality metrics suggest the use of the Laplacian rereference for study of local population-level activity and low-frequency oscillatory activity.

The objective of this paper is to apply deep learning method to EEG signal analysis in order to confirm clinical brain death diagnosis. A novel approach using spectrogram images produced from EEG signals as the input dataset of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is proposed in this paper. A deep CNN was trained to obtain the similarity degree of the patients' EEG signals with the clinical diagnosed symptoms. This method can evaluate the condition of the brain damage patients and can be a reliable reference of quasi brain death diagnosis.

A robust unsupervised epileptic seizure detection methodology to accelerate large EEG database evaluation	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Epilepsy; Unsupervised seizure detection; Medical knowledge; Time-Frequency analysis	CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; SIGNALS; SYSTEM; ONSET	In this work an unsupervised methodology for the detection of epileptic seizures in long-term EEG recordings is presented. The design of the methodology exploits the available medical knowledge to tackle the lack of training data using a simple rule-based seizure detection logic, avoiding complex decision making systems, training and empirical thresholds. The Short-Time Fourier Transform is initially applied to extract the EEG signal energy distribution over the delta (<4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency bands. A set of four novel seizure detection conditions is proposed to isolate EEG segments with increased potential of containing ictal activity, by identifying segments where the EEG signal energy is intensively accumulated among the three fundamental frequency rhythms. A set of candidate seizure segments is extracted based on the intensity of the accumulated EEG activity per seizure detection condition. The clinician has to visually inspect only the extracted segments instead of the entire duration of the patient's EEG recordings to speed up the annotation process. The results from the evaluation with 24 cases of long-term EEG recordings, suggest that the proposed methodology can reach on average up to 89% of seizure detection sensitivity, by automatically rejecting 95% of the total patient's EEG recordings as non-ictal, without requiring any apriori data knowledge.

However, there are undesirable artifacts that exist among the electrophysiological signals which lead to unreliable results in the extraction and localization of these accurate oscillations. We introduced, three filtering techniques based on Finite Impulse Response filters FIR, Stationary Wavelet transform SWT method and custom FIR filter to extract the non-contaminated (pure) oscillations and localize their responsible sources using the Independent Component Analysis ICA technique. In our obtained results, we compared the effectiveness of these filtering techniques in extracting and localizing of non-contaminated alpha and gamma oscillations. We proposed here the accurate technique for the extraction of pure alpha and oscillations. We also presented the accurate cortical region responsible of the generation of these oscillations.

Improving the quality of combined EEG-TMS neural recordings: Introducing the coil spacer	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Combined; TMS; EEG; Artifact	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CONNECTIVITY; ARTIFACTS; SINGLE	Background: In the last decade, interest in combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) approaches has grown substantially. Aside from the obvious artifacts induced by the magnetic pulses themselves, separate and more sinister signal disturbances arise as a result of contact between the TMS coil and EEG electrodes. New method: Here we profile the characteristics of these artifacts and introduce a simple device-the coil spacer-to provide a platform allowing physical separation between the coil and electrodes during stimulation. Results: EEG data revealed high amplitude signal disturbances when the TMS coil was in direct contact with the EEG electrodes, well within the physiological range of viable EEG signals. The largest artifacts were located in the Delta and Theta frequency range, and standard data cleanup using independent components analysis (ICA) was ineffective due to the artifact's similarity to real brain oscillations. Comparison with existing method: While the current best practice is to use a large coil holding apparatus to fixate the coil 'hovering' over the head with an air gap, the spacer provides a simpler solution that ensures this distance is kept constant throughout testing. Conclusions: The results strongly suggest that data collected from combined TMS-EEG studies with the coil in direct contact with the EEG cap are polluted with low frequency artifacts that are indiscernible from physiological brain signals. The coil spacer provides a cheap and simple solution to this problem and is recommended for use in future simultaneous TMS-EEG recordings. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

We assessed whether genetic variations are associated with gamma-band activity. Methods: We performed a genome-wide association analysis of the early auditory evoked gamma-band response in schizophrenia affected subjects and healthy control individuals (in total N = 315). Results: No marker surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significant association. Several of the markers that were closest to significance mapped to genes involved in neuronal development and the Neuregulin-ErbB signalling network, such as NRG2 and KALRN. Using a gene-set enrichment analysis, we found suggestive evidence for association with genes involved in EEG abnormality (P = .048). Conclusions: We identified no marker genome-wide significantly associating with gamma response; independent replication of the gene-set analysis result and larger sample sizes will be required to provide leads to cellular pathways involved in gamma-band activity.

Despite this hallmark change, studies that investigate modulations of conventional EEG alpha power and connectivity by aging and age-related neuropathology neglect to account for intergroup differences in IAPF. To investigate the relationship of age-related IAPF slowing with EEG power and connectivity, we recorded eyes-closed resting-state EEG in 37 young adults and 32 older adults. We replicated the finding of a slowed IAPF in older adults. IAPF values were significantly correlated with the frequency of maximum global connectivity and the means of their distributions did not differ, suggesting that connectivity was highest at the IAPF. Older adults expressed reduced global EEG power and connectivity at the conventional upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) compared with young adults. By contrast, groups had equivalent power and connectivity at the IAPF. The results suggest that conventional spectral boundaries may be biased against older adults or any group with a slowed IAPF. We conclude that investigations of alpha activity in aging and age-related neuropathology should be adapted to the IAPF of the individual and that previous findings should be interpreted with caution. EEG in the dominant alpha range may be unsuitable for examining cortico-cortical connectivity due to its subcortical origins. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Frontal Alpha Oscillations and Attentional Control: A Virtual Reality Neurofeedback Study	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurofeedback; electroencephalography; virtual reality; cognitive control	EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; BIOFEEDBACK TREATMENT; PERFORMANCE; MEMORY; EFFICACY	Two competing views about alpha oscillations suggest that cortical alpha reflect either cortical inactivity or cortical processing efficiency. We investigated the role of alpha oscillations in attentional control, as measured with a Stroop task. We used neurofeedback to train 22 participants to increase their level of alpha amplitude. Based on the conflict/control loop theory, we selected to train prefrontal alpha and focus on the Gratton effect as an index of deployment of attentional control. We expected an increase or a decrease in the Gratton effect with increase in neural learning depending on whether frontal alpha oscillations reflect cortical idling or enhanced processing efficiency, respectively. In order to induce variability in neural learning beyond natural occurring individual differences, we provided half of the participants with feedback on alpha amplitude in a 3-dimensional (3D) virtual reality environment and the other half received feedback in a 2D environment. Our results showed variable neural learning rates, with larger rates in the 3D compared to the 2D group, corroborating prior evidence of individual differences in EEG-based learning and the influence of a virtual environment. Regression analyses revealed a significant association between the learning rate and changes on deployment of attentional control, with larger learning rates being associated with larger decreases in the Gratton effect. This association was not modulated by feedback medium. The study supports the view of frontal alpha oscillations being associated with efficient neurocognitive processing and demonstrates the utility of neurofeedback training in addressing theoretical questions in the non-neurofeedback literature.

In order to study EEG characteristics induced by sound stimuli with different frequencies, 50 phon and 60 phon intermittent pure tones at the frequency of 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz with a duration of 10 s (a cycle of 1 s, which was divided into four time periods of 0.25 s, the first 0.25 s with sound stimulation, followed by three 0.25 s without sound stimulation) were selected as stimuli. The characteristics of theta, alpha and beta waves in different scalp regions (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital) of left and right hemispheres were examined. Results of the repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) showed there was a significant main effect of time period on mean theta-wave amplitude in all scalp regions except for the occipital region, which meant there were significant differences among the mean theta-wave amplitudes in four time periods. The asymmetry of alpha wave was found between the left and right temporal regions under stimuli of intermittent pure tones, and the mean alpha-wave amplitude in the left temporal region was significant lower than that in the right temporal region. There was a significant interaction effect among hemisphere, frequency and loudness and a significant main effect of frequency on mean beta-wave amplitude in the parietal region, which turned out that beta wave in the left parietal region was significantly related to the frequencies of pure tone stimuli. The mean beta-wave amplitude in the parietal region under stimuli with same loudness at different frequencies was synergistically influenced by two acoustic parameters (i.e., sharpness and fluctuation strength), and a decreasing trend of mean beta-wave amplitude was observed with the increase of sharpness and fluctuation strength. Besides, the parietal mean beta-wave amplitude under stimuli at 60 phon (within the stimulated 0.25 s) was significantly higher than that at 50 phon.

Evaluating the feasibility of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to study temporal attention	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; EEG; methods; SSVEP	ORIENTING ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; CUED SHIFTS; TIME-COURSE; MODULATION; EEG; PERFORMANCE; TASK; SUPPRESSION	Improvements in perceptual performance can be obtained when events in the environment are temporally predictableand temporal predictability improves attention and sensory processing. The amplitude of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has been shown to correlate with attention paid to a flickering stimulus even if the flickering stimulus is irrelevant for the task. However, to our knowledge, the validity of the SSVEP to study temporal attention has not been established. Therefore, we designed an SSVEP temporal attention task to evaluate whether the SSVEP and its temporal dynamics can be used to study temporal attention. We used a forced-choice perceptual detection task while presenting task-irrelevant visual flicker at alpha (10 Hz) and two surrounding frequencies (6 or 15 Hz). Temporal predictability was manipulated by having the interstimulus intervals (ISI) be constant or variable. Behavioral results replicated previous studies confirming the benefits of temporal expectations on performance for trials with constant ISI. EEG analyses revealed robust SSVEP amplitudes for all flicker frequencies, although a main effect of temporal expectations on SSVEP amplitude was not significant. Additional analyses revealed temporal predictability-related modulations of SSVEP amplitude at 10 Hz and its second harmonic (20 Hz). The effect of temporal predictability was also observed for the 6 Hz flicker, but not for 15 Hz for any ISI condition. These results provide some evidence for the feasibility of the SSVEP technique to study temporal attention for stimuli with flicker frequencies around the alpha band.

Using machine learning techniques we explored if abnormalities in microstates can identify patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) in the absence of an interictal discharge (IED). Method: 4 Classes of microstates were computed from 2 min artefact free EEG epochs in 42 subjects (21 TLE and 21 controls). The percentage of time coverage, frequency of occurrence and duration for each of these micro states were computed and redundancy reduced using feature selection methods. Subsequently, Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and logistic regression were used for classification. Result FLDA distinguished TLE with 76.1% accuracy (85.0% sensitivity, 66.6% specificity) considering frequency of occurrence and percentage of time coverage of microstate C as features. Conclusion: Microstate alterations are present in patients with TLE. This feature might be useful in the diagnosis of epilepsy even in the absence of an IED.

Comprehending words or phrases that are related to actions commonly activates motor and premotor areas, and this comprehension process interacts with action preparation and/or execution. However, it remains unclear whether comprehending action-related language interacts with action observation. In the current study, we examined whether the observation of tool-use gesture subjects to interaction with language. In an electroencephalography (EEG) study (n = 20), participants were presented with video clips of an actor performing tool-use (TU, e.g., hammering with a fist) and emblematic (EM, e.g., the thumb up sign for 'good job') gestures accompanied by either comprehensible German (G) or incomprehensible Russian sentences (R). Participants performed a semantic judging task, evaluating whether the co-speech gestures were object- or socially-related. Behavioral results from the semantic task showed faster response for the TU versus EM gestures only in the German condition. For EEG, we found that TU elicited beta power decrease (similar to 20 Hz) when compared to EM gestures, however this effect was reduced when gestures were accompanied by German instead of Russian sentences. We concluded that the processing of action-related sentences might facilitate gesture observation, in the sense that motor simulation required for TU gestures, as indexed by reduced beta power, was modulated when accompanied by comprehensible German speech. Our results corroborate the functional role of the beta oscillations during perception of hand gestures, and provide novel evidence concerning language-motor interaction.

However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying human memory encoding remain poorly understood, and how this molecular framework permits the emergence of specific patterns of brain oscillations observed during mnemonic processing is unknown. Here, we directly compare intracranial electroencephalography recordings from the neocortex in individuals performing an episodic memory task with human gene expression from the same areas. We identify genes correlated with oscillatory memory effects across 6 frequency bands. These genes are enriched for autism-related genes and have preferential expression in neurons, in particular genes encoding synaptic proteins and ion channels, supporting the idea that the genes regulating voltage gradients are involved in the modulation of oscillatory patterns during successful memory encoding across brain areas. Memory-related genes are distinct from those correlated with other forms of cognitive processing and resting state fMRI. These data are the first to identify correlations between gene expression and active human brain states as well as provide a molecular window into memory encoding oscillations in the human brain.

Methods: Nineteen time and frequency domain features were extracted from 39 seizures of 32 patients and were subjected to support vector machine based classification. Three prediction approaches regarding seizure evolution were (1) FTC vs FS vs F, (2) FTC vs FS or F and (3) FTC or FS vs F. Results: We used 21 seizures for training. Most features had significantly different distributions in the three seizure types (p < 0.05). Eighteen seizures were used for testing. We predicted the evolution of 12 seizures in FTC vs FS vs F, 13 seizures in FTC vs FS or F and 14 seizures in FTC or FS vs F. Conclusion: The first five seconds of a focal seizure contains information regarding the eventual evolution of the seizure, which could be predicted in most seizures. Significance: The proposed system could alert the health care team when a patient is hospitalized for intracerebral EEG and improve safety and eventually result in an implantable device.

The task of discriminating four classes (left and right hands and feet) of motor imagery movements of a simple limb-based BCI is still challenging because most imaginary movements in the motor cortex have close spatial representations. We aimed to classify binary limb movements, rather than the direction of movement within one limb. We also investigated joint time-frequency methods to improve classification accuracies. Neither of these, to our knowledge, has been investigated previously in BCI. We recorded EEG data from eleven participants, and demonstrated the classification of four classes of simple-limb motor imagery with an accuracy of 91.46% using intrinsic time-scale decomposition and 88.99% using empirical mode decomposition. In binary classifications, we achieved average accuracies of 89.90% when classifying imaginary movements of left hand versus right hand, 93.1% for left hand versus right foot, 94.00% for left hand versus left foot, 83.82% for left foot versus right foot, 97.62% for right hand versus left foot, and 95.11% for right hand versus right foot. The results show that the binary classification performance is slightly better than that of four-class classification. Our results also show that there is no significant difference in terms of spatial distribution between left and right foot motor imagery movements. There is also no difference in classification performances involving left or right foot movement. This work demonstrates that binary and four-class movements of the left and right feet and hands can be classified using recorded EEG signals of the motor cortex, and an intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) feature extraction method can be used for real time brain computer interface.

Primarily, Hilbert Transform-based empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was found to be suitable for emotional state modeling studies. In more recent studies, models of emotional state recognition were proposed in which the classification was implemented by using the features obtained after applying the time, frequency, and time frequency domain methods to intrinsic mode functions achieved by operating EMD. In this study, an analysis of emotional state recognition is proposed by using the features of the synchrosqueezing coefficients obtained in the classification process after applying the Synchrosqueezing Transform to intrinsic mode functions achieved by using Multivariate EMD. As a result, EEG data available in the DEAP database were categorized as low and high for valence, activation, and dominance dimensions, and 4 different classifiers were utilized in the classification process. The most satisfying ratios of valence, activation and dominance were attained 76%, 68%, and 68% respectively.

Although growing neuroimaging-based evidence suggests atypical functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia, the results are inconsistent and the effects of antipsychotic treatment remain elusive. Methods: We performed resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) in 21 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia (14 patients were re-evaluated after administration of antipsychotic treatment) and 31 age-matched healthy control subjects. We estimated functional connectivity, using the phase lag index (PLI), which captures the true synchronization of EEG signals. Results: The patients had reduced functional connectivity of the beta band across frontal regions and of the gamma band throughout the scalp when compared to the control subjects. In the schizophrenia group, symptom severity did not seem associated with functional connectivity. Antipsychotic treatment led to no alterations in functional connectivity. Conclusions: Synchronous activity within and across brain areas over multiple frequencies reflect the integration of various types of information processing. Our findings of abnormal frequency-and region-specific functional connectivity patterns may provide further insight into the "dysconnection hypothesis" of schizophrenia.

However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoence-phalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz to 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz to 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.

Here, we tested the possible causal links between these oscillatory features and temporal integration/segregation. The individual alpha frequency (IAF) peak as obtained from resting-state electroencephalography was used to set the frequency of sensory (audio-visual) entrainment for the lower (IAF - 2 Hz) and upper (IAF + 2 Hz) alpha. Entrainment at IAF +/- 2 Hz was administered in the prestimulus interval to align oscillations to a faster or slower rhythm. We densely sampled in time the accuracy for integration/segregation by using identical stimuli with different instructions. The spectral peaks of performance fluctuations over time were found in the upper or lower alpha band for the IAF + 2 and IAF -2 Hz entrainment, respectively, implying that faster entrainment resulted in faster behavioral fluctuations. Moreover, the entrainment frequency had opposite effects on temporal resolution: faster entrainment improved segregation while slower entrainment improved integration. Performance fluctuations were almost in anti-phase between the two tasks, such that highest integration performance coincided with lowest segregation performance. These findings provide evidence for a direct link between changes in the alpha band and the temporal resolution of perception.

PACt-MD Study Grp	Theta-Gamma Coupling and Working Memory in Alzheimer's Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mild cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's dementia; electroencephalography; neural oscillations; theta-gamma coupling; working memory	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DISEASE; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; DEPRESSION; ATTENTION; SEVERITY; NETWORKS; TASK	Working memory deficits are common among individuals with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Yet, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these deficits. Theta-gamma coupling-the modulation of high-frequency gamma oscillations by low-frequency theta oscillations-is a neurophysiologic process underlying working memory. We assessed the relationship between theta-gamma coupling and working memory deficits in AD and MCI. We hypothesized that: (1) individuals with AD would display the most significant working memory impairments followed by MCI and finally healthy control (HC) participants; and (2) there would be a significant association between working memory performance and theta-gamma coupling across all participants. Ninety-eight participants completed the N-back working memory task during an electroencephalography (EEG) recording: 33 with AD (mean +/- SD age: 76.5 +/- 6.2), 34 with MCI (mean +/- SD age: 74.8 +/- 5.9) and 31 HCs (mean +/- SD age: 73.5 +/- 5.2). AD participants performed significantly worse than control and MCI participants on the 1- and 2-back conditions. Regarding theta-gamma coupling, AD participants demonstrated the lowest level of coupling followed by the MCI and finally control participants on the 2-back condition. Finally, a linear regression analysis demonstrated that theta-gamma coupling (beta = 0.69, p < 0.001) was the most significant predictor of 2-back performance. Our results provide evidence for a relationship between altered theta-gamma coupling and working memory deficits in individuals with AD and MCI. They also provide insight into a potential mechanism underlying working memory impairments in these individuals.	[Goodman, Michelle S.; Kumar, Sanjeev; Zomorrodi, Reza; Ghazala, Zaid; Cheam, Amay S.

We investigated how brain connectivity changes over time in the resting state in a group of patients with chronic disorders of consciousness (DoC). To this end, we assessed dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in the resting state by analyzing the time-dependent EEG phase synchronization in five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Patients in Minimally Conscious State (MCS) showed changes in DFC matrices and topography over time (mainly in the gamma range), which were significantly different from those observed in patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS). The degree of DFC significantly correlated with the level of behavioral responsiveness measured using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. The analysis of DFC seems promising to differentiate patients with DoC. Moreover, sharpening the current knowledge of DFC by using EEG-based approaches may shed light on the processes of consciousness and their pathophysiology, and may help to design neuromodulation protocols aimed at targeting maladaptive and dysfunctional FC.

This paper presents a novel automatic EEG signal classification method for epileptic seizure detection. The proposed method first employs a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method for obtaining the time-frequency images (TFI) of EEG signals. The processed EEG signals are then decomposed into five sub-band frequency components of clinical interest since these sub-band frequency components indicate much better discriminative characteristics. Both Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) features and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) descriptors are then extracted from these sub-band TFI. Additionally, in order to improve classification accuracy, a compact feature selection method by combining the ReliefF and the support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (RFE-SVM) algorithm is adopted to select the most discriminative feature subset, which is an input to the SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) for classifying epileptic seizure EEG signals. The experimental results from a publicly available benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better classification accuracy than the recently proposed methods in the literature, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method in the detection of epileptic seizures.

Previous studies have described atypical patterns of decreased short range and increased long range connectivity in ASD [1]. However, it remains unclear whether group level features of circuit dysfunction are consistently present across the range of cognitive function seen in the autism spectrum. The dynamics of neural oscillations in the alpha range (6-12 Hz) are exquisitely sensitive to healthy development of functional and structural connectivity. Alpha-band coherence, measured with high temporal precision electroencephalography (EEG) therefore represents an ideal tool for studying neural connectivity in developmental populations. Here we examined spontaneous alpha phase coherence in a heterogeneous sample of 59 children with ASD and 39 age matched typically developing children. Using a data driven approach, we conducted an unbiased examination of all possible atypical connectivity patterns across all cortical regions. Long-range hypoconnectivity was present in children with ASD compared to typically developing children, with temporal interhemispheric connectivity showing the largest difference between the two groups. Decreased long range alpha coherence distinguishes a heterogeneous group of ASD children from typically developing children. Interhemispheric temporal hypoconnectivity represents a fundamental functional difference in children with ASD across a wide cognitive and age range that may reflect white matter disturbances or increased signal variability at temporal sites in ASD.

Dissociation of frontal-midline delta-theta and posterior alpha oscillations: A mobile EEG study	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						BOSC; EEG; spatial navigation; theta; virtual reality	RHYTHMS; MOVEMENT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INTEGRATION; NAVIGATION; DISTANCE; LEVEL; SPACE; BAND	Numerous reports have demonstrated low-frequency oscillations during navigation using invasive recordings in the hippocampus of both rats and human patients. Given evidence, in some cases, of low-frequency synchronization between midline cortex and hippocampus, it is also possible that low-frequency movement-related oscillations manifest in healthy human neocortex. However, this possibility remains largely unexplored, in part due to the difficulties of coupling free ambulation and effective scalp EEG recordings. In the current study, participants freely ambulated on an omnidirectional treadmill and explored an immersive virtual reality city rendered on a head-mounted display while undergoing simultaneous wireless scalp EEG recordings. We found that frontal-midline (FM) delta-theta (2-7.21 Hz) oscillations increased during movement compared to standing still periods, consistent with a role in navigation. In contrast, posterior alpha (8.32-12.76 Hz) oscillations were suppressed in the presence of visual input, independent of movement. Our findings suggest that FM delta-theta and posterior alpha oscillations arise at independent frequencies, under complementary behavioral conditions, and, at least for FM delta-theta oscillations, at independent recordings sites. Together, our findings support a double dissociation between movement-related FM delta-theta and resting-related posterior alpha oscillations. Our study thus provides novel evidence that FM delta-theta oscillations arise, in part, from real-world ambulation, and are functionally independent from posterior alpha oscillations.

The purpose of this study was to systematically quantify the relationship between FOS and ERP responses to a visual oddball task in both time and frequency domains. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroen-cephalography (EEG) sensors were co-located over the prefrontal cortex while participants performed a visual oddball task. Fifteen participants completed 2 data collection sessions each, where they were instructed to keep a mental count of oddball images. The oddball condition produced a positive ERP at 200 ms followed by a negativity 300-500 ms after image onset in the frontal electrodes. In contrast to previous FOS studies, a FOS response was identified only in DC intensity signals and not in phase delay signals. A decrease in DC intensity was found 150-250 ms after oddball image onset with a 400-trial average in 10 of 15 participants. The latency of the positive 200 ms ERP and the FOS DC intensity decrease were significantly correlated for only 6 (out of 15) participants due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the FOS response. Coherence values between the FOS and ERP oddball responses were found to be significant in the 3-5 Hz frequency band for 10 participants. A significant Granger causal influence of the ERP on the FOS oddball response was uncovered in the 2-6 Hz frequency band for 7 participants. Collectively, our findings suggest that, for a majority of participants, the ERP and the DC intensity signal of the FOS are spectrally coherent, specifically in narrow frequency bands previously associated with event-related oscillations in the prefrontal cortex. However, these electro-optical relationships were only found in a subset of participants. Further research on enhancing the quality of the event-related FOS signal is required before it can be practically exploited in applications such as brain-computer interfacing.

Participants had their resting-state brain activity recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) before and after they performed 30 s of bilateral eye movements or a center-control manipulation. We assessed differences in change scores for absolute power and coherence between the eye-movement and center-control conditions. A main effect for handedness was present for EEG power in the theta and beta frequency bands, with inconsistent handed participants displaying a greater increase than consistent-handed participants in both frequency bands. For theta, the increase in power for inconsistent handers was specific to participants in the bilateral eye movement condition, whose increase in theta power exceeded the increase in theta power for consistent-handed participants regardless of condition. In contrast, for coherence, a main effect for condition was present for the delta frequency band, with participants in the control condition exhibiting a significant drop in posterior delta coherence pre to post. We suggest that the maintenance of posterior delta coherence over time may be an important factor in sustaining attention. Further, the malleability of EEG power for inconsistent-handed participants reveals the importance of individual-differences variables in the potential for behavioral manipulations to change brain activity.

In this paper, EEG method is creatively combined with VR technology to assess the severity of fear of heights, which is more safe, fast and convenient in testing a person's fear of heights degree. And this could be used in employee selection, fear of heights therapy, and so on. Time-frequency analysis is utilized with correlation analyze to find out the frequency bands of interest and regions of interest. And with the help of cross mutual information method, the functional brain networks were built up. Graph-theoretic parameters and inter- and intra-connectivity features were extracted after statistical analyses. With the extracted features the severity of fear of heights could successfully be classified. Thus, a combing EEG and VR technology assessment classifier was verified and proposed.

EEG Multiscale Complexity in Schizophrenia During Picture Naming	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; EEG; non-linear analysis; multiscale lempel-ziv complexity; naming task	LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; FORMAL THOUGHT-DISORDER; SYNDROME SCALE PANSS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIMENSIONAL COMPLEXITY; COGNITIVE TASKS; TIME-SERIES; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; DYSFUNCTION	Introduction: Patients with schizophrenia show cognitive deficits that are evident both behaviourally and with EEG recordings. Recent studies have suggested that non-linear analyses of EEG might more adequately reflect the complex, irregular, non-stationary behavior of neural processes than more traditional ERP measures. Non-linear analyses have been mainly applied to EEGs from patients at rest, whereas differences in complexity might be more evident during task performance. Objective: We aimed to investigate changes in non-linear brain dynamics of patients with schizophrenia during cognitive processing. Method: 18 patients and 17 matched healthy controls were asked to name pictures. EEG data were collected at rest and while they were performing a naming task. EEGs were analyzed with the classical Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) and with the Multiscale LZC. Electrodes were grouped in seven regions of interest (ROI). Results: As expected, controls had fewer naming errors than patients. Regarding EEG complexity, the interaction between Group, Task and ROI indicated that patients showed higher complexity values in right frontal regions only at rest, where no differences in complexity between patients and controls were found during the naming task. EEG complexity increased from rest to task in controls in left temporal-parietal regions, while no changes from rest to task were observed in patients. Finally, differences in complexity between patients and controls depended on the frequency bands: higher values of complexity in patients at rest were only observed in fast bands, indicating greater heterogeneity in patients in local dynamics of neuronal assemblies. Conclusion: Consistent with previous studies, schizophrenic patients showed higher complexity than controls in frontal regions at rest. Interestingly, we found different modulations of brain complexity during a simple cognitive task between patients and controls. These data can be interpreted as indicating schizophrenia-related failures to adapt brain functioning to the task, which is reflected in poorer behavioral performance. Highlights: - We measured classical and multiscale Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZCN and MLZC) of the EEG signal of patients with schizophrenia and controls at rest and while performing a cognitive task. - We found that patients and controls showed a different pattern of brain complexity depending on their cognitive state (at rest or under cognitive challenge). - Our results illustrate the value of the MLZC in the characterization of the pattern of brain complexity in schizophrenia on function of frequency bands. - Nonlinear methodologies of EEG analysis can help to characterize brain dysfunction in schizophrenia.

There are many measures of chaotic behaviour: Hurst and Lyapunov exponents, various dimensions of attractor, various entropy measures, etc. We prefer permutation entropy of equidistantly sampled data. The novelty of our approach is in bias reduction of permutation entropy estimates, memory decrease, and time complexities of permutation analysis. Therefore, we are not limited by the EEG signal and permutation sample lengths. This general method was used for channel by channel analysis of Alzheimer's diseased (AD) and healthy (CN) patients to point out the differences between AD and CN groups. Our technique also enables to study the influence of EEG sampling frequency in a wide range. The best results were obtained for sampling frequency 200 Hz, using at most window of length 10. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, we observed a statistically significant decrease in permutation entropy at all channels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We made use of a rare dataset in which the same task was recorded using both scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and Electrocorticography (ECoG), respectively. This allowed us to examine with great spatial and temporal detail how the retrieval process works, and in particular how the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is involved. In each trial, participants judged whether a probe face had been among a set of recently studied faces. With a method that combines hidden semi-Markov models and multivariate pattern analysis, the neural signal was decomposed into a sequence of latent cognitive stages with information about their durations on a trial-by-trial basis. Analyzed separately, EEG and ECoG data yielded converging results on discovered stages and their interpretation, which reflected 1) a brief pre-attention stage, 2) encoding the stimulus, 3) retrieving the studied set, and 4) making a decision. Combining these stages with the high spatial resolution of ECoG suggested that activity in the temporal cortex reflected item familiarity in the retrieval stage; and that once retrieval is complete, there is active maintenance of the studied face set in the decision stage in the MTL. During this same period, the frontal cortex guides the decision by means of theta coupling with the MTL. These observations generalize previous findings on the role of MTL theta from long-term memory tasks to short-term memory tasks.

The field power density was 0.16 mW/cm2. The resting EEG of 14 subjects was recorded and EEG power at fixed frequencies was analyzed. A relative change in the EEG power during 10 cycles with and without radiation was used as a quantitative measure. Microwave radiation caused statistically significant increase in the average EEG power at expected 10, 20 and 30 Hz frequency bands. The results indicate that low-level modulated microwave radiation is able to stimulate brain oscillations at selected frequencies.

Yet recent work using visual-motor dissociation tasks suggests that M1 activity is also correlated with the visual consequences of an action, independent of the actual hand displacement. The goal of the present work was to investigate whether oscillatory activity over sensorimotor regions is modulated by the expectancy of visual reafferent feedback during reach planning. While recording electroencephalography (EEG), participants executed hand-reaching movements in a single direction (i.e., straight-ahead of midline) throughout the entire experiment. Visual feedback of the hand was provided with a cursor and was manipulated. Specifically, before each trial, participants were precued as to the nature of the upcoming visual feedback, which could be spatially congruent with the hand, rotated leftward or rightward by 20 degrees or not provided at all. Results revealed that planning-related EEG activity at contralateral central electrodes was strongly modulated in the theta-band (3-7 Hz) depending on whether visual feedback would be available or not. In contrast, contralateral beta-band (15-30 Hz) activity did not differ across conditions. These results demonstrate that low-frequency oscillatory dynamics during reach planning depend upon the upcoming availability of visual feedback. This may relate to predicting the visual consequences of the movement or to setting different feedback gains necessary for visually guided vs. non-visually guided movements. (C) 2018 IBRO.

Wavelet phase coherence was applied for analyzing brain activity in states with different degrees of mental and sensory attention. In the analysis of electroencephalographic correlates of mental states, as a rule the focus is on the analysis of the spectral power of a quasi-stationary EEG or task-related power of time-frequency EEG spectra. The analysis of the wavelet phase coherence provides additional information on the organization of brain activity, but requires more computing time. Fast implementation can simplify the use of this method in practice. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Delta-gamma coupling as a potential neurophysiological mechanism of fluid intelligence	INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Fluid intelligence; Cross-frequency coupling; Phase-amplitude coupling; EEG	WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; P-FIT; FREQUENCY; THETA; STORAGE; EEG; ACTIVATION; EFFICIENCY	Electrophysiological investigations have pointed out significant yet weak correlations between intelligence and oscillatory brain activity, including the spectral power, frequency, complexity, synchrony, and coherence of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, however neglecting the interplay between fast and slow neuronal oscillations underlying information transfer in the brain. We found that fluid intelligence level depends on the precise synchronization of fast oscillations to a specific time window of slow brain rhythms. Specifically, by examining EEG recordings of 50 people in resting state as well as during performance at two gf tasks we found converging evidence that high-jjf participants display stronger Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) related to an increased concentration of gamma (-36 Hz) spectral power at the descending phase of delta oscillations (similar to 3 Hz). Delta-gamma PAC strength explained 35% variance in scores on multiple gf tests, outperforming six alternative EEG-based predictors including spectral power, complexity and amplitude-amplitude coupling. Present results suggest PAC as a neurophysiological substrate of gf in humans, offering novel insight about the role of slow and fast brain rhytms in high-order cognition, as well as a potential new target for neuromodulatory interventions in the healthy and pathological brain.

High Frequency Oscillations in the Ripple Band (80-250Hz) in Scalp EEG: Higher Density of Electrodes Allows for Better Localization of the Seizure Onset Zone	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Refractory epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; Epilepsy surgery; Spikes; Seizure onset	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; INTRACRANIAL EEG; TEMPORAL-LOBE; 80-500 HZ; EPILEPSY; SPIKES; MACROELECTRODES; GENERATORS; MARKER	High frequency oscillations (HFO) are known as markers of epileptic areas in intracranial EEG and possibly scalp EEG. We compared distributions of HFO in the ripple band (80-250Hz) in intracranial and scalp EEG with either a conventional 10-20-montage (10-20-EEG) or a high density recording using 128 electrodes (HD-EEG). HFO were visually identified, in all intracranial EEG channels (80-500Hz) and all channels of the 10-20-EEG (scalp EEG 80-250Hz). For the HD-EEG, HFO were analyzed in regions of interest using areas with HFO as seen on the 10-20-EEG as well as areas in the clinically-defined seizure onset zone (SOZ). 13 patients were included in the study, of whom 12 showed HFO in the ripple band. In 8 patients HD-EEG revealed additional regions of ripples compared to the 10-20-EEG. With HD-EEG, areas of highest ripple rates were corresponding between scalp and intracranial EEG in 7 patients (58%) and 8 (67%) patients showed highest ripple rates over the SOZ. In contrast, with 10-20-EEG only 2 patients (17%) had corresponding areas of highest ripple rates and only 3 patients (23%) showed highest ripple rates over the SOZ. HD-EEG proved to be better to identify scalp HFO in the ripple band compared to standard 10-20-EEG. Moreover, ripples in 10-20-EEG seem to lead to false localization of epileptic areas. In contrast ripples detected with HD-EEG were located over the seizure onset zone and maybe a promising tool to localize epileptic tissue in the future.

Characterization of network structure in stereoEEG data using consensus-based partial coherence	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Coherence; Partial coherence; Consensus; Connectivity	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY; INFORMATION; EEG; MEG; GENERATORS; MODULATION; FEEDBACK; FLOW	Coherence is a widely used measure to determine the frequency-resolved functional connectivity between pairs of recording sites, but this measure is confounded by shared inputs to the pair. To remove shared inputs, the 'partial coherence' can be computed by conditioning the spectral matrices of the pair on all other recorded channels, which involves the calculation of a matrix (pseudo-) inverse. It has so far remained a challenge to use the time-resolved partial coherence to analyze intracranial recordings with a large number of recording sites. For instance, calculating the partial coherence using a pseudoinverse method produces a high number of false positives when it is applied to a large number of channels. To address this challenge, we developed a new method that randomly aggregated channels into a smaller number of effective channels on which the calculation of partial coherence was based. We obtained a 'consensus' partial coherence (cPCOH) by repeating this approach for several random aggregations of channels (permutations) and only accepting those activations in time and frequency with a high enough consensus. Using model data we show that the cPCOH method effectively filters out the effect of shared inputs and performs substantially better than the pseudo-inverse. We successfully applied the cPCOH procedure to human stereotactic EEG data and demonstrated three key advantages of this method relative to alternative procedures. First, it reduces the number of false positives relative to the pseudo-inverse method. Second, it allows for titration of the amount of false positives relative to the false negatives by adjusting the consensus threshold, thus allowing the data-analyst to prioritize one over the other to meet specific analysis demands. Third, it substantially reduced the number of identified interactions compared to coherence, providing a sparser network of connections from which clear spatial patterns emerged. These patterns can serve as a starting point of further analyses that provide insight into network dynamics during cognitive processes. These advantages likely generalize to other modalities in which shared inputs introduce confounds, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magneto-encephalography (MEG).

Such long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) are thought to reflect neuronal systems poised near a critical state, which would render them capable of quick reorganization and responsive to changing processing demands. When we concentrate, however, the influence of internal and external sources of distraction is better reduced, suggesting that neuronal systems involved with sustained attention could benefit from a shift toward the less volatile sub-critical state. To test these ideas, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from healthy volunteers during eyes-closed rest and during a sustained attention task requiring a speeded response to images deviating in their presentation duration. We show that for oscillations recorded during rest, high levels of alpha-band LRTC in the sensorimotor region predicted good reaction-time performance in the attention task. During task execution, however, fast reaction times were associated with high-amplitude beta and gamma oscillations with low LRTC. Finally, we show that reduced LRTC during the attention task compared to the rest condition correlates with better performance, while increased LRTC of oscillations from rest to attention is associated with reduced performance. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence that 'resting-state criticality' of neuronal networks predicts swift behavioral responses in a sensorimotor task, and that steady attentive processing of visual stimuli requires brain dynamics with suppressed temporal complexity.

Although positive therapeutic effects were found by stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), few studies have investigated physiological effects of DLPFC-tDCS. Objectives: To investigate effects of tDCS with different parameter settings applied to the left DLPFC on cortical responses, measured by resting-state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked/induced EEG responses. Methods: 22 healthy subjects underwent 5 tDCS sessions with different tDCS parameter settings in a double-blinded randomized crossover design (1: 1.5 mA, anode left-DLPFC, cathode right-DLPFC; 2: 1.5 mA, cathode left-DLPFC, anode right-DLPFC; 3: 0.5 mA, anode left-DLPFC, cathode right-DLPFC; 4: 1.5 mA, anode left-DLPFC, cathode left deltoid muscle; 5: sham stimulation). Rs-EEG and TMS-EEG were recorded before and after tDCS. Results: Rs-EEG power spectrum analysis showed no difference comparing baseline with post stimulation in any of the tDCS conditions. TMS-EEG evoked potential amplitude decreased in parietal cortex after 1.5mA left-DLPFC anodal tDCS, and TMS-induced gamma and theta oscillations decreased after all conditions using left-DLPFC anodal tDCS. Left-DLPFC cathodal tDCS did not lead to significant change. None of the post-intervention changes was different when comparing the effects across conditions, including sham. Conclusions: Our study does not provide evidence that a single tDCS session results in significant changes in rs-EEG, using the current stimulation parameters. Significant changes in EEG responses to TMS pulses were observed following the anodal 1.5 mA tDCS interventions, although these changes were not statistically significant in a group comparison.

Some examples are the structure of the first perceptron, inspired in the retina, neuroprosthetics based on ganglion cell recordings or Hopfield networks. In addition, machine learning provides a powerful set of tools to analyze neural data, which has already proved its efficacy in so distant fields of research as speech recognition, behavioral states classification, or LFP recordings. However, despite the huge technological advances in neural data reduction of dimensionality, pattern selection, and clustering during the last years, there has not been a proportional development of the analytical tools used for Time-Frequency (T-F) analysis in neuroscience. Bearing this in mind, we introduce the convenience of using non-linear, non-stationary tools, EMD algorithms in particular, for the transformation of the oscillatory neural data (EEG, EMG, spike oscillations.) into the T-F domain prior to its analysis with machine learning tools. We support that to achieve meaningful conclusions, the transformed data we analyze has to be as faithful as possible to the original recording, so that the transformations forced into the data due to restrictions in the T-F computation are not extended to the results of the machine learning analysis. Moreover, bioinspired computation such as brain-machine interface may be enriched from a more precise definition of neuronal coding where non-linearities of the neuronal dynamics are considered.

Here, we asked whether autistic adults are able to make use of two important spatial cues to auditory object formation - the relative timing and amplitude of sound energy at the left and right ears. Using electroencephalography, we measured the brain responses of 15 autistic adults and 15 age- and verbal-IQ-matched control participants as they listened to dichotic pitch stimuli - white noise stimuli in which interaural timing or amplitude differences applied to a narrow frequency band of noise typically lead to the perception of a pitch sound that is spatially segregated from the noise. Responses were contrasted with those to stimuli in which timing and amplitude cues were removed. Consistent with our previous studies, autistic adults failed to show a significant object-related negativity (ORN) for timing-based pitch, although their ORN was not significantly smaller than that of the control group. Autistic participants did show an ORN to amplitude cues, indicating that they do not experience a general impairment in auditory object formation. However, their P400 response - thought to indicate the later attention-dependent aspects of auditory object formation - was missing. These findings provide further evidence of atypical auditory object processing in autism with potential implications for understanding the perceptual and communication difficulties associated with the condition.

Data Descriptor: Full body mobile brain-body imaging data during unconstrained locomotion on stairs, ramps, and level ground	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; WALKING; EEG; TREADMILL; GAIT; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; PATTERNS; RHYTHMS	Human locomotion is a complex process that requires the integration of central and peripheral nervous signalling. Understanding the brain's involvement in locomotion is challenging and is traditionally investigated during locomotor imagination or observation. However, stationary imaging methods lack the ability to infer information about the peripheral and central signalling during actual task execution. In this report, we present a dataset containing simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG), lower-limb electromyography (EMG), and full body motion capture recorded from ten able-bodied individuals. The subjects completed an average of twenty trials on an experimental gait course containing level-ground, ramps, and stairs. We recorded 60-channel EEG from the scalp and 4-channel EOG from the face and temples. Surface EMG was recorded from six muscle sites bilaterally on the thigh and shank. The motion capture system consisted of seventeen wireless IMUs, allowing for unconstrained ambulation in the experimental space. In this report, we present the rationale for collecting these data, a detailed explanation of the experimental setup, and a brief validation of the data quality.

The utility of such an index extends to any situation where one is interested in the (relative) timing of activation of different sources of information in memory, a paradigm case of which is tracking lexical activation during language processing. Essential for this approach is that memory reinstatement effects are robust, so that their absence (in the average) definitively indicates that no lexical activation is present. We used electroencephalography to test the robustness of a reported subsequent memory finding involving reinstatement of frequency-specific entrained oscillatory brain activity during subsequent recognition. Participants learned lists of words presented on a background flickering at either 6 or 15 Hz to entrain a steady-state brain response. Target words subsequently presented on a non-flickering background that were correctly identified as previously seen exhibited reinstatement effects at both entrainment frequencies. Reliability of these statistical inferences was however critically dependent on the approach used for multiple comparisons correction. We conclude that effects are not robust enough to be used as a reliable index of lexical activation during language processing.

However, recent studies have also associated alpha with processes of attentional control and stability. We addressed this issue in previous experiments by delivering transcranial alternating current stimulation at 10Hz over posterior cortex during visual tasks (alpha tACS). As this stimulation can induce reliable increases in EEG alpha power, and given that performance on each of our visual tasks was negatively associated with alpha power, we assumed that alpha tACS would reliably impair visual performance. However, alpha tACS was instead found to prevent both deteriorations and improvements in visual performance that otherwise occurred during sham & 50Hz tACS. Alpha tACS therefore appeared to exert a stabilizing effect on visual attention. This hypothesis was tested in the current, pre-registered experiment by delivering alpha tACS during a task that required rapid switching of attention between motion, color, and auditory subtasks. We assumed that, if alpha tACS stabilizes visual attention, this stimulation shouldmake it harder for people to switch between visual tasks, but should have little influence on transitions between auditory and visual subtasks. However, in contrast to this prediction, we observed no evidence of impairments in visuovisual vs. audiovisual switching during alpha vs. control tACS. Instead, we observed a trend-level reduction in visuoauditory switching accuracy during alpha tACS. Post-hoc analyses showed no effects of alpha tACS in response time variability, diffusion model parameters, or on performance of repeat trials. EEG analyses also showed no effects of alpha tACS on endogenous or stimulus-evoked alpha power. We discuss possible explanations for these results, as well as their broader implications for current efforts to study the roles of neural oscillations in cognition using tACS.

Twenty-five children between the ages of 2 and 6 with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and a qualified banked autologous umbilical cord blood unit were enrolled. Safety results and clinical outcomes measured at 6 and 12 months post-infusion have been previously published. The purpose of the present analysis was to explore whether measures of electroencephalography (EEG) theta, alpha, and beta power showed evidence of change after treatment and whether baseline EEG characteristics were predictive of clinical improvement. The primary endpoint was the parent-reported Vineland adaptive behavior scales-II socialization subscale score, collected at baseline, 6- and 12-month visits. In addition, the expressive one word picture vocabulary test 4 and the clinical global impression-improvement scale were administered. Electrophysiological recordings were taken during viewing of dynamic social and nonsocial stimuli at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Significant changes in EEG spectral characteristics were found by 12 months post-infusion, which were characterized by increased alpha and beta power and decreased EEG theta power. Furthermore, higher baseline posterior EEG beta power was associated with a greater degree of improvement in social communication symptoms, highlighting the potential for an EEG biomarker to predict variation in outcome. Taken together, the results suggest that EEG measures may be useful endpoints for future ASD clinical trials.

Our results suggest that the communicated content that is mediated through such a device induces a significant effect on electroencephalogram (EEG) time series of human subjects. Precisely, we find a significant reduction of overall power of the EEG signals of the individuals. This observation that is supported by the analysis of the permutation entropy (PE) of the EEG time series of brain activity of the participants suggests the positive effect of such a medium on the stress relief and the induced sense of relaxation. Additionally, multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis of our data implies that such a medium increases the level of complexity that is exhibited by EEG time series of our participants, thereby suggesting their sustained sense of involvement in their course of communication. These findings that are in accord with the results reported by cognitive neuroscience research suggests that the use of such a medium can be beneficial as a complementary step in treatment of developmental disorders, attentiveness of schoolchildren and early child development, as well as scenarios where intimate physical interaction over distance is desirable (e.g., distance-parenting).

In particular, coupled tensor decompositions are regarded as a promising tool for the joint processing of simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG simals. Therefore, we develop a coupled version of the PARAFAC2 decomposition that has been employed for multi-way component analysis of EEC or MEG data separately. Then we discuss the application of this new coupled PARAFAC2 decomposition in the combined analysis of somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) and somatosensory evoked electrical potentials (SEPs) to extract the time, frequency, and spatial features of these simals.

Identifying auditory cortex encoding abnormalities in schizophrenia: The utility of low-frequency versus 40 Hz steady-state measures	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory encoding; electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; schizophrenia; superior temporal gyrus	EVOKED RESPONSE SUPPRESSION; 1ST-DEGREE RELATIVES; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL THICKNESS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; AMPLITUDE; COHERENCE; ENDOPHENOTYPES; 1ST-EPISODE; DYSFUNCTION	Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and EEG have identified poststimulus low frequency and 40 Hz steady-state auditory encoding abnormalities in schizophrenia (SZ). Negative findings have also appeared. To identify factors contributing to these inconsistencies, healthy control (HC) and SZ group differences were examined in MEG and EEG source space and EEG sensor space, with better group differentiation hypothesized for source than sensor measures given greater predictive utility for source measures. Fifty-five HC and 41 chronic SZ were presented 500 Hz sinusoidal stimuli modulated at 40 Hz during simultaneous whole-head MEG and EEG. MEG and EEG source models using left and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) dipoles estimated trial-to-trial phase similarity and percent change from prestimulus baseline. Group differences in poststimulus low-frequency activity and 40 Hz steady-state response were evaluated. Several EEG sensor analysis strategies were also examined. Poststimulus low-frequency group differences were observed across all methods. Given an age-related decrease in left STG 40 Hz steady-state activity in HC (HC>SZ), 40 Hz steady-state group differences were evident only in younger participants' source measures. Findings thus indicated that optimal data collection and analysis methods depend on the auditory encoding measure of interest. In addition, whereas results indicated that HC and SZ auditory encoding low-frequency group differences are generally comparable across modality and analysis strategy (and thus not dependent on obtaining construct-valid measures of left and right auditory cortex activity), 40 Hz steady-state group-difference findings are much more dependent on analysis strategy, with 40 Hz steady-state source-space findings providing the best group differentiation.

The paradigm is popular in EEG-based Brain Computer Interfacing where selectable targets are encoded by different frequency-and/or phase-tagged stimuli. We compare the performance of two state-of-the-art SSVEP decoders on both ECoG-and scalp-recorded EEG signals, and show that ECoG-based decoding is more accurate for very short stimulation lengths (i.e., less than 1 s). Furthermore, whereas the accuracy of scalp-EEG decoding bene fi ts from a multi-electrode approach, to address interfering EEG responses and noise, ECoG decoding enjoys only a marginal improvement as even a single electrode, placed over the posterior part of the primary visual cortex, seems to suf fi ce. This study shows, for the fi rst time, that EEG-based SSVEP decoders can in principle be applied to ECoG, and can be expected to yield faster decoding speeds using less electrodes.

Approach. Twenty subjects participated in EEG collection; the global field power of EEG and its local maximum were calculated and then clustered using cross validation and statistics; the 4 parameters of each microstate (duration, occurrence, time coverage, and amplitude) were calculated from the clustering results and statistically analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA); finally, the relationship between the microstate and frequency band was analyzed. Main Results. The experimental results showed that all microstates related to executed and imagined grip force tasks were clustered into 3 microstate classes (A, B, and C); these microstates generally transitioned from A to B and then from B to C. With the increase of the target value of executed and imagined grip force, the duration and time coverage of microstate B gradually decreased, while these parameters of microstate C gradually increased. The occurrence times of microstate B and C related to executed grip force were significantly more than those related to imagined grip force; furthermore, the amplitudes of these 3 microstates related to executed grip force were significantly greater than those related to imagined grip force. The correlation coefficients between the microstates and the frequency bands indicated that the microstates were correlated to mu rhythm and beta frequency bands, which are consistent with event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) phenomena of sensorimotor rhythm. Significance. It is expected that this microstate analysis may be used as a new method for observing EEG instantaneous activity patterns related to variation in executed and imagined grip force and also for extracting EEG features related to these tasks. This is study may lay a foundation for the application of executed and imagined grip force training for rehabilitation of hand movement disorders in patients with stroke in the future.

Computationally Efficient Algorithms for Sparse, Dynamic Solutions to the EEG Source Localization Problem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; source localization problem; sparse prior models; observation noise	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION; INVERSE PROBLEM; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; BRAIN; EEG/MEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PENALIZATION; SIGNATURES; PRIORS	Objective: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography noninvasively record scalp electromagnetic fields generated by cerebral currents, revealing millisecond-level brain dynamics useful for neuroscience and clinical applications. Estimating the currents that generate these fields, i.e.,source localization, is an ill-conditioned inverse problem. Solutions to this problem have focused on spatial continuity constraints, dynamic modeling, or sparsity constraints. The combination of these key ideas could offer significant performance improvements, but substantial computational costs pose a challenge for practical application of such approaches. Here, we propose a new method for EEG source localization that combines: 1) covariance estimation for both source and measurement noises; 2) linear state-space dynamics; and 3) sparsity constraints, using 4) novel computationally efficient estimation algorithms. Methods: For source covariance estimation, we use a locally smooth basis alongside sparsity enforcing priors. For EEG measurement noise covariance estimation, we use an inverse Wishart prior density. We estimate these model parameters using an expectation-maximization algorithm that employs steady-state filtering and smoothing to expedite computations. Results: We characterized the performance of our method by analyzing simulated data and experimental recordings of eyes-closed alpha oscillations. Our sparsity enforcing priors significantly improved estimation of both the spatial distribution and time course of simulated data, while improving computational time by more than 12-fold over previous dynamic methods. Conclusion: We developed and demonstrated a novel method for improved EEG source localization employing spatial covariance estimation, dynamics, and sparsity. Significance: Our approach provides substantial performance improvements over existing methods using computationally efficient algorithms that will facilitate practical applications in both neuroscience and medicine.

Visual sleep scoring provides an initial and tangible illustration of how the brain wave changes across different sleep stages. The main objective of the present study is to design an accurate and robust computer-assisted sleep stage scoring system using single-channel EEG signal by proposing a novel time domain feature named Statistical Behavior of Local Extrema (SBLE). SBLE provides a profound understanding of hidden dynamics of EEG signals by quantifying and symbolizing its local extrema information, extracting and defining various patterns, and statistical analysis of extracted patterns. First, each EEG segment was decomposed into 6 frequency sub bands (i.e., low-delta, high-delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta). Next, SBLE features were separately computed from each sub-band. Then, an optimal feature set with a high rate of accuracy was selected using a supervised Multi-Cluster/Class Feature Selection (MCFS) algorithm. Finally, the selected features were fed to a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification purposes. The benchmark Sleep-EDF dataset and DREAMS Subject Database were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The average (+/- variance) accuracy rates were 90.6 +/- 4.2%, 91.8 +/- 5.0%, 92.8 +/- 3.3%, 94.5 +/- 3.4%, 97.9 +/- 1.4% for six-stage to two-stage sleep classification on Sleep-EDF dataset, respectively. Besides, its performance on DREAMS Subjects Database was also promising in term of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methodology can precisely solve the multi-class sleep stage classification problem by presenting an innovative symbolic approach similar to physician's point of view.

Therefore, neuromuscular coupling characterization is instructive in assessing motor function. In this study, to overcome the limitation of losing the characteristics of signals in conventional time series symbolization methods, a variable scale symbolic transfer entropy (VS-STE) analysis approach was proposed for corticomuscular coupling evaluation. Post-stroke patients (n = 5) and healthy volunteers (n = 7) were recruited and participated in various tasks (left and right hand gripping, elbow bending). The proposed VS-STE was employed to evaluate the corticomuscular coupling strength between the EEG signal measured from the motor cortex and EMG signal measured from the upper limb in both the time-domain and frequency-domain. Results showed a greater strength of the bi-directional (EEG-to-EMG and EMG-to-EEG) VS-STE in post-stroke patients compared to healthy controls. In addition, the strongest EEG-EMG coupling strength was observed in the beta frequency band (15-35 Hz) during the upper limb movement. The predefined coupling strength of EMG-to-EEG in the affected side of the patient was larger than that of EEG-to-EMG. In conclusion, the results suggested that the corticomuscular coupling is bi-directional, and the proposed VS-STE can be used to quantitatively characterize the non-linear synchronization characteristics and information interaction between the primary motor cortex and muscles.

Among them, brain - computer interface (BCI)-based electrical stimulation (ES) and MI synchronously induced electroencephalo-graph (EEG) analysis is one of the research directions. This paper integrates MI with ES, and introduces the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) on the MI, and then fuses features. The purpose is to achieve better accuracy, reducing training time, and enhancing target body imagine attention. We use ES and MI synchronous-evoked EEG analysis for rehabilitation training strategy in the process of synchronization. Based on the time - frequency diagram and brain topographic map, we make analysis on event-related desynchronization (ERD), time -frequency characteristic of the steady-state evoked potentials (SSEP), energy characteristics, and distribution regularity of brain regions of each task model. We apply the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), common spatial pattern (CSP), and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) to classify task pattern recognition on the basis of support vector machine. The results show that based on the lead less the FBCSP has certain superiority, the classification accuracy of ES versus ES& MI achieved 95% or more.

Nonlinear analysis of brain activity, associated with motor action and motor imaginary in untrained subjects	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Motor action; Motor imaginary; Wavelet analysis; Multifractal analysis; Event-related synchronization; Empirical mode decomposition; EEG; Holder exponent	COMPUTER INTERFACE; MULTIFRACTAL FORMALISM; SIGNALS; IMAGERY; BCI	Identification of brain activity associated with motor execution and, more importantly, with motor imagery is necessary for the development of brain-computer interfaces. Most of recent studies were performed with trained participants which demonstrated that the motor-related brain activity can be detected from the analysis of multichannel electroencephalograms (EEG). For untrained subjects, this task is less studied, but at the same time much more challenging. This task can be solved using the methods of nonlinear dynamics, allowing to extract specific features of the neuronal network of the brain (e.g., the degree of complexity of EEG signals and degree of interaction between different brain areas). In this work, we analyze the spatio-temporal and time-frequency characteristics of the electrical brain activity, associated with both the motor execution and imagery in a group of untrained subjects, by applying different methods of nonlinear dynamics. At the first stage, we apply multifractal formalism to the analysis of EEG signals to reveal the brain areas which demonstrate the most significant distinctions between real motor actions and imaginary movement. Then, using time-frequency wavelet-based analysis of the EEG activity, we analyze in detail the structure of considered brain areas. As a result, we distinguish characteristic oscillatory patterns which occur in different areas of brain and interact with each other when the motor execution (or imagination) takes place. Finally, we create an algorithm allowing online detection of the observed patterns and experimentally verify its efficiency.

Dissociable Decoding of Spatial Attention and Working Memory from EEG Oscillations and Sustained Potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; decoding; EEG; ERP; orientation; working memory	NEURAL MEASURES REVEAL; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; HIDDEN STATES; REPRESENTATIONS; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; MODULATIONS; INFORMATION	In human scalp EEG recordings, both sustained potentials and alpha-band oscillations are present during the delay period of working memory tasks and may therefore reflect the representation of information in working memory. However, these signals may instead reflect support mechanisms rather than the actual contents of memory. In particular, alpha-band oscillations have been tightly tied to spatial attention and may not reflect location-independent memory representations per se. To determine how sustained and oscillating EEG signals are related to attention and working memory, we attempted to decode which of 16 orientations was being held in working memory by human observers (both women and men). We found that sustained EEG activity could be used to decode the remembered orientation of a stimulus, even when the orientation of the stimulus varied independently of its location. Alpha-band oscillations also carried clear information about the location of the stimulus, but they provided little or no information about orientation independently of location. Thus, sustained potentials contain information about the object properties being maintained in working memory, consistent with previous evidence of a tight link between these potentials and working memory capacity. In contrast, alpha-band oscillations primarily carry location information, consistent with their link to spatial attention.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive neurophysiological test that has promise as a biomarker sensitive to treatment effects. The aim of our study was to investigate a novel non-linear index of resting state EEG activity as a predictor of clinical outcome, and compare its predictive capacity to traditional frequency-based indices. Methods: EEG was recorded from 62 patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) and 25 healthy comparison (HC) subjects. TRD patients were treated with excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 4 to 6 weeks. EEG signals were first decomposed using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method into band-limited intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Subsequently, Permutation Entropy (PE) was computed from the obtained second IMF to yield an index named PEIMF2. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and ANOVA test were used to evaluate the efficiency of this index (PEIMF2) and were compared to frequency-band based methods. Results: Responders (RP) to rTMS exhibited an increase in the PEIMF2 index compared to non-responders (NR) at F3, FCz and FC3 sites (p < 0.01). The area under the curve (AUC) for ROC analysis was 0.8 for PEIMF2 index for the FC3 electrode. The PEIMF2 index was superior to ordinary frequency band measures. Conclusion: Our data show that the PEIMF2 index, yields superior outcome prediction performance compared to traditional frequency band indices. Our findings warrant further investigation of EEG-based biomarkers in depression; specifically entropy indices applied in band-limited EEG components.

Quantifying the accuracy of such tools, however, is nontrivial as a ground truth to verify predictions about hypothetical resections is missing. New method: As one possibility to address this, we use customized hypotheses tests to examine the agreement of the methods on a common set of patients. One method uses machine learning techniques to enable the predictive modeling of EEG time series. The other estimates nonlinear interrelation between EEG channels. Both methods were independently shown to distinguish patients with excellent post-surgical outcome (Engel class I) from those without improvement (Engel class IV) when assessing the electrodes associated with the tissue that was actually resected during brain surgery. Using the AND and OR conjunction of both methods we evaluate the performance gain that can be expected when combining them. Results: Both methods' assessments correlate strongly positively with the similarity between a hypothetical resection and the corresponding actual resection in class I patients. Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation between the methods' patient rankings is significantly positive. Comparison with existing method(s): To our best knowledge, this is the first study comparing surgery target assessments from fundamentally differing techniques. Conclusions: Although conceptually completely independent, there is a relation between the predictions obtained from both methods. Their broad consensus supports their application in clinical practice to provide physicians additional information in the process of presurgical evaluation.

A Multitaper Frequency-Domain Bootstrap Method	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Confidence interval; frequency-domain bootstrap (FDB); multitaper methods; spectra resampling		Spectral properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are commonly analyzed to characterize the brain's oscillatory properties in basic science and clinical neuroscience studies. The spectrum is a function that describes power as a function of frequency. To date inference procedures for spectra have focused on constructing confidence intervals at single frequencies using large sample-based analytic procedures or jackknife techniques. These procedures perform well when the frequencies of interest are chosen before the analysis. When these frequencies are chosen after some of the data have been analyzed, the validity of these conditional inferences is not addressed. If power at more than one frequency is investigated, corrections for multiple comparisons must also be incorporated. To develop a statistical inference approach that considers the spectrum as a function defined across frequencies, we combine multitaper spectral methods with a frequency-domain bootstrap (FDB) procedure. The multitaper method is optimal for minimizing the bias-variance tradeoff in spectral estimation. The FDB makes it possible to conduct Monte Carlo based inferences for any part of the spectrum by drawing random samples that respect the dependence structure in the EEG time series. We show that our multitaper FDB procedure performs well in simulation studies and in analyses comparing EEG recordings of children from two different age groups receiving general anesthesia.

Age-Dependent Changes in the Propofol-Induced Electroencephalogram in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder (ASD); electroencephalography (EEG); propofol; gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA); general anesthesia	EEG BURST SUPPRESSION; COTRANSPORTER KCC2; SEVOFLURANE; PREVALENCE; ISOFLURANE; CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATIONS; ANESTHESIA; SYNCHRONY; THICKNESS	Patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often require sedation or general anesthesia. ASD is thought to arise from deficits in GABAergic signaling leading to abnormal neurodevelopment. We sought to investigate differences in how ASD patients respond to the GABAergic drug propofol by comparing the propofol-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) of ASD and neurotypical (NT) patients. This investigation was a prospective observational study. Continuous 4-channel frontal EEG was recorded during routine anesthetic care of patients undergoing endoscopic procedures between July 1, 2014 and May 1, 2016. Study patients were defined as those with previously diagnosed ASD by DSM-V criteria, aged 2-30 years old. NT patients were defined as those lacking neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, aged 2-30 years old. The primary outcome was changes in propofol-induced alpha (8-13 Hz) and slow (0.1-1 Hz) oscillation power by age. A post hoc analysis was performed to characterize incidence of burst suppression during propofol anesthesia. The primary risk factor of interest was a prior diagnosis of ASD. Outcomes were compared between ASD and NT patients using Bayesian methods. Compared to NT patients, slow oscillation power was initially higher in ASD patients (17.05 vs. 14.20 dB at 2.33 years), but progressively declined with age (11.56 vs. 13.95 dB at 22.5 years). Frontal alpha power was initially lower in ASD patients (17.65 vs. 18.86 dB at 5.42 years) and continued to decline with age (6.37 vs. 11.89 dB at 22.5 years). The incidence of burst suppression was significantly higher in ASD vs. NT patients (23.0% vs. 12.2%, p < 0.01) despite reduced total propofol dosing in ASD patients. Ultimately, we found that ASD patients respond differently to propofol compared to NT patients. A similar pattern of decreased alpha power and increased sensitivity to burst suppression develops in older NT adults; one interpretation of our data could be that ASD patients undergo a form of accelerated neuronal aging in adolescence. Our results suggest that investigations of the propofol-induced EEG in ASD patients may enable insights into the underlying differences in neural circuitry of ASD and yield safer practices for managing patients with ASD.

Both changes are associated with a shift from procedural to retrieval strategies for problem-solving. Here we address the critical, open question of whether similar neurocognitive changes are also evident in children. In this study, 20 typically developing children were trained to solve simple and complex multiplication problems. The one-session and two-week training effects were monitored using simultaneous functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). FNIRS measurement after one session of training on complex multiplication problems revealed decreased activation at the left angular gyrus (AG), right superior parietal lobule, and right intraparietal sulcus. Two weeks of training led to decreased activation at the left AG and right middle frontal gyrus. For both simple and complex problems, we observed increased alpha power in EEG measurements as children worked on trained versus untrained problems. In line with previous multiplication training studies in adults, reduced activation within the fronto-parietal network was observed after training. Contrary to adults, we found that strategy shifts via arithmetic learning were not contingent on the activation of the left AG in children.

EMD has shown excellent results in the identification of behaviours from the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In addition, some advances in the computer area have made it possible to improve their performance. In this paper, we presented a method that, using an entropy analysis, can automatically choose the relevant Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) from EEG signals. The idea is to choose the minimum number of IMFs to reconstruct the brain activity. The EEG signals were processed by EMD and the IMFs were ordered according to the entropy cost function. The IMFs with more relevant information are selected for the brain mapping. To validate the results, a relative error measure was used.

J	Sharma, RR; Pachori, RB				Sharma, Rishi Raj; Pachori, Ram Bilas			Time-frequency representation using IEVDHM-HT with application to classification of epileptic EEG signals	IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WIGNER-VILLE DISTRIBUTION; CROSS-TERMS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SEIZURE; DECOMPOSITION; ENHANCEMENT; PATTERN; ROBUST; BANK	Time-frequency representation (TFR) is useful for non-stationary signal analysis as it provides information about the time-varying frequency components. This study proposes a novel TFR based on the improved eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrix and Hilbert transform (IEVDHM-HT). In the proposed method, first the authors decompose non-stationary signals using the IEVDHM with suitably defined criterion for eigenvalue selection, requirement of number of iterations, and new component merging criteria. Furthermore, the HT is applied on extracted components in order to obtain the TFR of non-stationary signals. The performance of proposed TFR has been evaluated on synthetic signals in clean and white noise environment with different signal-to-noise ratios. The proposed method gives good performance in terms of Renyi entropy measure in comparison with other existing methods. Application of the proposed TFR is also shown for the classification of epileptic seizure electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) with radial basis function kernel is used for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals obtained from the publicly available database by the University of Bonn, Germany. The proposed method has achieved classification accuracy 100% for the studied EEG database.

State-space multitaper time-frequency analysis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						nonparametric spectral analysis; spectral representation theorem; complex Kalman filter; statistical inference; big data	NONSTATIONARY; DECOMPOSITION; LIKELIHOOD; ENSEMBLE; SPECTRUM; EEG	Time series are an important data class that includes recordings ranging from radio emissions, seismic activity, global positioning data, and stock prices to EEG measurements, vital signs, and voice recordings. Rapid growth in sensor and recording technologies is increasing the production of time series data and the importance of rapid, accurate analyses. Time series data are commonly analyzed using time-varying spectral methods to characterize their nonstationary and often oscillatory structure. Current methods provide local estimates of data features. However, they do not offer a statistical inference framework that applies to the entire time series. The important advances that we report are state-space multitaper (SS-MT) methods, which provide a statistical inference framework for time-varying spectral analysis of nonstationary time series. We model nonstationary time series as a sequence of second-order stationary Gaussian processes defined on nonoverlapping intervals. We use a frequency-domain random-walk model to relate the spectral representations of the Gaussian processes across intervals. The SS-MT algorithm efficiently computes spectral updates using parallel 1D complex Kalman filters. An expectation-maximization algorithm computes static and dynamic model parameter estimates. We test the framework in time-varying spectral analyses of simulated time series and EEG recordings from patients receiving general anesthesia. Relative to standard multitaper (MT), SS-MT gave enhanced spectral resolution and noise reduction (> 10 dB) and allowed statistical comparisons of spectral properties among arbitrary time series segments. SS-MT also extracts time-domain estimates of signal components. The SS-MT paradigm is a broadly applicable, empirical Bayes' framework for statistical inference that can help ensure accurate, reproducible findings from nonstationary time series analyses.

Even with the use of invasive recordings, the clinical differentiation between the EZ and normal brain areas can be quite challenging, mainly in patients without MRI detectable lesions. Consequently, despite relatively large brain regions being removed, surgical success rates barely reach 60-65%. Such variable and unfavorable outcomes associated with high morbidity rates are often caused by imprecise and/or inaccurate EZ localization. We developed a localization algorithm that uses network-based data analytics to process invasive EEG recordings. This network algorithm analyzes the centrality signatures of every contact electrode within the recording network and characterizes contacts into susceptible EZ based on the centrality trends over time. The algorithm was tested in a retrospective study that included 42 patients from four epilepsy centers. Our algorithm had higher agreement with EZ regions identified by clinicians for patients with successful surgical outcomes and less agreement for patients with failed outcomes. These findings suggest that network analytics and a network systems perspective of epilepsy may be useful in assisting clinicians in more accurately localizing the EZ.

The current study used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine spontaneous neural oscillations in young adults as a function of quantity, frequency, and the pattern of their alcohol consumption. Sixty-one young adults (23.4 +/- 3.4 years of age) were assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups that were equated on gender, race/ethnic identity, age, educational background, and family history of alcoholism. EEG activity was recorded during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting conditions. Each participant's alpha peak frequency (APF) was used to calculate absolute power in individualized theta and alpha frequency bands, with a canonical frequency range used for beta. APF was slower by 0.7 Hz in BD, especially in individuals engaging in high-intensity drinking, but there were no changes in alpha power. BD also exhibited higher frontal theta and beta power than LD. Alpha slowing and increased theta power in BD remained after accounting for depression, anxiety, and personality characteristics, while elevated beta power covaried with sensation seeking. Furthermore, APF slowing and theta power correlated with various measures of alcohol consumption, including binge episodes and blackouts, but not with measures of working and episodic memory, cognitive flexibility, processing speed, or personality variables, suggesting that these physiological changes may be modulated by high-intensity alcohol intake. These results are consistent with studies of alcohol-use disorder (AUD) and support the hypothesis that binge drinking is a transitional stage toward alcohol dependence. The observed thalamocortical dysrhythmia may be indicative of an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in BD and may potentially serve as an index of the progressive development of AUD, with a goal of informing possible interventions to minimize alcohol's deleterious effects on the brain.

Data acquisition in different locations over time is common in sensor networks, for diverse applications ranging from object tracking in wireless networks to medical uses such as electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing. In this paper we leverage novel techniques of GSP to develop a hierarchical feature extraction approach by mapping the data onto a series of spatiotemporal graphs. Such a model maps signals onto vertices of a graph and the time-space dependencies among signals are modeled by the edge weights. Signal components acquired from different locations and time often have complicated functional dependencies. Accordingly, their corresponding graph weights are learned from data and used in two ways. First, they are used as a part of the embedding related to the topology of graph, such as density. Second, they provide the connectivities of the base graph for extracting higher level GSP-based features. The latter include the energies of the signal's graph Fourier transform in different frequency bands. We test our approach on the intracranial EEG (iEEG) data set of the Kaggle epileptic seizure detection contest. In comparison to the winning code, the results show a slight net improvement and up to 6 percent improvement in per subject analysis, while the number of features are decreased by 75 percent on average.

Award-winning advertisements (AAs) were selected on the basis of the professional standards that consider creativity as a prerequisite. However, it is unknown if AA is related to satisfactory advertising performance among customers or only to the experts' viewpoints towards the advertisements. This issue in the field of affective engineering and design merits in-depth evaluation. We recruited 30 subjects and performed an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment while watching AAs and non-AAs (NAAs). The event-related potential (ERP) data showed that AAs evoked larger positive potentials 250-1400 ms after stimulus onset, particularly in the right fronto-temporal regions. The behavioral results were consistent with the professional recognition given to AAs by experts. The perceived levels of creativity and "product-like" quality were higher for the AAs than for the NAAs. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis further revealed statistically significant differences in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma band activity in the right fronto-temporal regions between the AAs and NAAs. Our results confirm that EEG features from the time/frequency domains can differentiate affective responses to AAs at a neural circuit level, and provide scientific evidence to support the identification of AAs.

J	Hashimoto, Y; Yotsumoto, Y				Hashimoto, Yuki; Yotsumoto, Yuko			The Amount of Time Dilation for Visual Flickers Corresponds to the Amount of Neural Entrainments Measured by EEG	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						time perception; duration perception; neural entrainment; time; EEG	INTERNAL CLOCK; OSCILLATORY PROCESSES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS	The neural basis of time perception has long attracted the interests of researchers. Recently, a conceptual model consisting of neural oscillators was proposed and validated by behavioral experiments that measured the dilated duration in perception of a flickering stimulus (Hashimoto and Yotsumoto, 2015). The model proposed that flickering stimuli cause neural entrainment of oscillators, resulting in dilated time perception. In this study, we examined the oscillator-based model of time perception, by collecting electroencephalography (EEG) data during an interval-timing task. Initially, subjects observed a stimulus, either flickering at 10-Hz or constantly illuminated. The subjects then reproduced the duration of the stimulus by pressing a button. As reported in previous studies, the subjects reproduced 1.22 times longer durations for flickering stimuli than for continuously illuminated stimuli. The event-related potential (ERP) during the observation of a flicker oscillated at 10 Hz, reflecting the 10-Hz neural activity phase-locked to the flicker. Importantly, the longer reproduced duration was associated with a larger amplitude of the 10-Hz ERP component during the inter-stimulus interval, as well as during the presentation of the flicker. The correlation between the reproduced duration and the 10-Hz oscillation during the inter-stimulus interval suggested that the flicker-induced neural entrainment affected time dilation. While the 10-Hz flickering stimuli induced phase-locked entrainments at 10 Hz, we also observed event-related desynchronizations of spontaneous neural oscillations in the alpha-frequency range. These could be attributed to the activation of excitatory neurons while observing the flicker stimuli. In addition, neural activity at approximately the alpha frequency increased during the reproduction phase, indicating that flicker-induced neural entrainment persisted even after the offset of the flicker. In summary, our results suggest that the duration perception is mediated by neural oscillations, and that time dilation induced by flickering visual stimuli can be attributed to neural entrainment.

It is used to translate the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into actions or choices. The main challenge in processing the SSVEP signal recognition is finding an appropriate intermediate representation to facilitate the classification task afterwards. In the literature, frequency domain analysis was extensively adopted as an intermediate representation for SSVEP classification. In this presented paper, we propose a deep learning model that uses a hybrid architecture based on Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks to classify SSVEP signals in the time domain directly. We achieved accuracy 93.59% compared to 87.40% for the state-of-the-art method: canonical correlation analysis in the frequency domain. The proposed architecture facilitates the real-time classification of SSVEP signals in the time domain for real-time applications such as robot cars and exoskeletons.

Spectral and temporal electroencephalography measures reveal distinct neural networks for the acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer of motor skills in healthy young adults	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related desynchronization; Motor learning; N30; Phase slope index; Plasticity	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; CROSS-LIMB TRANSFER; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS; CONNECTIVITY; EXCITABILITY; MODULATION	Objective: Plasticity of the central nervous system likely underlies motor learning. It is however unclear, whether plasticity in cortical motor networks is motor learning stage-, activity-, or connectivity-dependent. Methods: From electroencephalography (EEG) data, we quantified effective connectivity by the phase slope index (PSI), neuronal activity by event-related desynchronization, and sensorimotor integration by N30 during the stages of visuomotor skill acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer. Results: Although N30 amplitudes and event-related desynchronization in parietal electrodes increased with skill acquisition, changes in PSI correlated most with motor performance in all stages of motor learning. Specifically, changes in PSI between the premotor, supplementary motor, and primary motor cortex (M1) electrodes correlated with skill acquisition, whereas changes in PSI between electrodes representing M1 and the parietal and primary sensory cortex (S1) correlated with skill consolidation. The magnitude of consolidated interlimb transfer correlated with PSI between bilateral M1s and between S1 and M1 in the non-practiced hemisphere. Conclusions: Spectral and temporal EEG measures but especially PSI correlated with improvements in complex motor behavior and revealed distinct neural networks in the acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer of motor skills.

In this work, publicly available online BCI2003 competition data set was used which contains MI based Electroencephalography (EEG) data of a single subject. The raw MI based EEG signals were extracted from C3 and C4 channels and band pass filtered to mu (8-12 Hz) frequency band. The mean, inter trial variance and ERD/ERS patterns were calculated in both the channels for both MI tasks of the subject. The patterns were used as feature vector and input to the different machine learning classifiers. The logistic regression and Naive Bayesian classifiers were used for the classification of both MI tasks of the subject. For logistic regression classifier, the accuracy, precision and sensitivity were found to be 92.40%, 92.00% and 92.00%, respectively. Meanwhile, 92.19% accuracy, 92.00% precision and 92.00% sensitivity were obtained for the Naive Bayesian classifier. The logistic regression classifier provides maximum classification accuracy (92.40%) in comparison with the existing methods (87.90-90.20%). Result shows that, the proposed method can quantify ERD/ERS patterns effectively in both the channels and also classifies both MI tasks of the subject successfully.	[Shahlaei, Fatemeh; Shaligram, A.

Combining attentional resources from both of those sources exerts qualitatively large effects on manual performance. Here we tested how combined attention was represented in sensory processing, as reflected by the P1 component and associated activity in the alpha band. We measured performance and recorded EEG while participants' attention was engaged in an automated, endogenous, and combined (i.e., automated and endogenous) manner. Behavioral results replicated past reports with reliable effects of isolated automated and endogenous attention, as well as their qualitatively unique combined effect. ERP analyses indicated expected increases in P1 amplitude for validly relative to invalidly cued targets in automated and endogenous conditions. However, in the combined case, the P1 difference between validly relative to invalidly cued targets decreased. Analyses of target-locked alpha-band further revealed that this condition was associated with an increased synchrony in the alpha frequency for invalidly cued targets. This suggests that the large performance benefit observed when attentional systems combine is partly driven by suppressed processing of unexpected targets, dovetailing with the notion that in addition to increasing sensory gain of attended targets, attention may also modulate complex behavior by increasing suppression of unattended ones.

EEG recordings were processed using graph theory analysis. Active and passive coping styles were determined according to the factor structure of the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced questionnaire. A structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the influence of coping strategies on quality of life varies in strength and direction. In particular, active coping strategies were positively correlated with the psychological dimension. Graph measures, at both global and nodal levels, were used to identify the brain network properties in accordance with passive versus active coping styles. Preliminary evidence showed that both the global and nodal graph metrics were affected by the coping strategy in the delta band. During resting state, passive coping strategy participants had network topology characterized by a high global efficiency, indicating an important level of integration between distant brain areas and a high local efficiency and transitivity, suggesting a high local communication between adjacent regions. Various regions, such as the paracentral lobule, posterior cingulate, and other frontal or parietal areas, seemed to play a key role, suggesting that processes such as emotional load are highly solicited in passive coping individuals. In active coping participants, the superior temporal gyrus seemed to be of importance when neurons oscillated in the theta and alpha frequencies.

Twenty adults made same/different discriminations of speech and non-speech stimuli pairs, with and without segmentation demands. Independent component analysis of 64-channel EEG data revealed clear sensorimotor mu components, with characteristic alpha and beta peaks, localized to premotor regions in 70% of participants. Time-frequency analyses of mu components from accurate trials showed that (1) segmentation tasks elicited greater event-related synchronization immediately following offset of the first stimulus, suggestive of inhibitory activity; (2) strong late event-related desynchronization in all conditions, suggesting that working memory/covert replay contributed substantially to sensorimotor activity in all conditions; (3) stronger beta desynchronization in speech versus non-speech stimuli during stimulus presentation, suggesting stronger auditory-motor transforms for speech versus non-speech stimuli. Findings support the continued use of oscillatory approaches for helping understand segmentation and other cognitive tasks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Using spatiotemporal source separation to identify prominent features in multichannel data without sinusoidal filters	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; generalized eigenvalue; oscillations; response conflict; source separation	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DELAY-DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; SCALE NEURAL RECORDINGS; BRAIN DYNAMICS; EEG DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; FREQUENCY; CONFLICT	The number of simultaneously recorded electrodes in neuroscience is steadily increasing, providing new opportunities for understanding brain function, but also new challenges for appropriately dealing with the increase in dimensionality. Multivariate source separation analysis methods have been particularly effective at improving signal-to-noise ratio while reducing the dimensionality of the data and are widely used for cleaning, classifying and source-localizing multichannel neural time series data. Most source separation methods produce a spatial component (that is, a weighted combination of channels to produce one time series); here, this is extended to apply source separation to a time series, with the idea of obtaining a weighted combination of successive time points, such that the weights are optimized to satisfy some criteria. This is achieved via a two-stage source separation procedure, in which an optimal spatial filter is first constructed and then its optimal temporal basis function is computed. This second stage is achieved with a time-delay-embedding matrix, in which additional rows of a matrix are created from time-delayed versions of existing rows. The optimal spatial and temporal weights can be obtained by solving a generalized eigendecomposition of covariance matrices. The method is demonstrated in simulated data and in an empirical electroencephalogram study on theta-band activity during response conflict. Spatiotemporal source separation has several advantages, including defining empirical filters without the need to apply sinusoidal narrowband filters.

Recently, electroencephalograms (EEGs) measured in the resting state have been vastly analyzed as a means for classifying the BD and schizophrenic patients, but EEGs evoked by external audio/visual stimuli have been rarely investigated, despite their high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, in order to investigate whether EEGs evoked by external stimuli can be used for classifying the BD and schizophrenic patients, we used a visual stimulus modulated at a specific frequency to induce steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). In the experiment, a photic stimulation modulated at 16 Hz was presented to two groups of the schizophrenic and BD patients for 95 s, during which the EEG data were recorded. Statistical measures of SSVEPs (mean, skewness, and kurtosis) described in SNR units were extracted as features to characterize and classify the variations of brain activity patterns in the two groups. Two brain areas, O1 and Fz, showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups for SNR mean and kurtosis, respectively. Among five applied classifiers, k-nearest neighbor provided the highest classification accuracy of 91.30% with the best feature set selected by Fisher score. An acceptable accuracy for binary classification (>70%) was retained until analysis time was reduced up to 10 s using a support vector machine classifier, and 20 s for other classifiers. Our results demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed SSVEP-based classification approach with relatively short single-trial EEG signals.

The aim of the present study was to depict the topology of the relevant EEG-derived brain networks associated to distinct operations of WM function elicited by the Sternberg Item Recognition Task (SIRT) such as encoding, storage, and retrieval in healthy, middle age (46 +/- 5 years) adults. High density EEG recordings were performed in 17 participants whilst attending a visual SIRT. Neural correlates of WM were assessed by means of a combination of EEG signal processing methods (i.e., time-varying connectivity estimation and graph theory), in order to extract synthetic descriptors of the complex networks underlying the encoding, storage, and retrieval phases of WM construct. The group analysis revealed that the encoding phase exhibited a significantly higher small-world topology of EEG networks with respect to storage and retrieval in all EEG frequency oscillations, thus indicating that during the encoding of items the global network organization could "optimally" promote the information flow between WM sub-networks. We also found that the magnitude of such configuration could predict subject behavioral performance when memory load increases as indicated by the negative correlation between Reaction Time and the local efficiency values estimated during the encoding in the alpha band in both 4 and 6 digits conditions. At the local scale, the values of the degree index which measures the degree of in- and out-information flow between scalp areas were found to specifically distinguish the hubs within the relevant sub-networks associated to each of the three different WM phases, according to the different role of the sub-network of regions in the different WM phases. Our findings indicate that the use of EEG-derived connectivity measures and their related topological indices might offer a reliable and yet affordable approach to monitor WM components and thus theoretically support the clinical assessment of cognitive functions in presence of WM decline/impairment, as it occurs after stroke.

ON DETECTION OF EPILEPTIC SEIZURE WITH AN APPROACH BASED ON POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY WITH AN AR MODEL	ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS IN STATISTICS			English	Article						spectral analysis; AR model; order determination; EEG	EEG SIGNALS; AUTOREGRESSION	In this manuscript, we considered an autoregressive (AR) model combined with spectral analysis and segmentation criterion in order to analyze electroencephalograph (EEG) recording data collected from normal and epileptic subjects. With the goal to localize epileptic seizures from EEG data, we proposed methods on how to calculate the power spectral density (PSD) for each of the 128 time series generated from EEG via estimating parameters in an AR(p) model, where p is determined by AIC and BIC. Our contribution in this work is the localization of epilepsy seizure with the PSD novel approach by a better resolution in the frequency domain as the examination of EEG signals is often done with visual inspection of the rhythm (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) by neurologist practitioners. The accuracy of the detection is estimated to 70% with the sensitivity of 80.56% according to the interpretation of neurologist.	[Dabye, A. S.; Issaka, M.

Recognition and classification was based on expert markup of EEG signals with epileptiform activity Epileptiform Discharges (ED) and normal sleep activity Sleep Spindles (SS). Proprietary Event Detection Algorithm (EDA) based on time-frequency analysis of wavelet spectrograms was developed in order to extract valuable events from raw EEG records. Epilepsy Prediction Model (EPM) was based on Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and Frequency features of detected events. Resulted predictors were used in logistic regression model, which estimated probabilities of epileptiform activity in particular EEG event. Validation of proposed model was done by multiple train-test division. It was shown that the accuracy of prediction is around 80%. Proposed algorithms were applied for identification of epileptiform activity in long term EEG records of rats. It was proven that algorithms effectively distinguish epilepsy in rats after TBI in comparison with rats after False Surgery. Proposed approaches can be applied used for Post-Traumatic Epilepsy (PTE) diagnostics in the nearest future.

The classification rate achieved 89.7% with singletrial (approximate to 700 ms) when using support vector machine(SVM) with the leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV). And high discriminative regions mainly distributed at the medial frontal cortex (MFC), the left supplementary motor area (lSMA) and the right supplementary motor area (rSMA). The mean entropy value for error trials was significantly lower than that for correct trials in the discriminative cortices. By time-varying network analysis, different information flows changed among these discriminative regions with time, i.e. error processing showed a left-bias information flow, and correct processing presented a right-bias information flow. These findings revealed that the rhythm information based on single cortical signals could be well used to describe characteristics of error-related EEG signals and further provided a novel application about auditory attention for brain computer interfaces (BCIs).

To reveal the electrophysiological difference between children with ES (ES+) and without ES (ES-), we compared the occurrence rate (OR) of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and the modulation index (MI) of coupling between slow and fast oscillations. In ES+, we hypothesized that (1) pathological HFOs are more widely distributed and (2) slow oscillations show stronger coupling with pathological HFOs than in ES-. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 24 children with drug-resistant multilobar onset epilepsy, who underwent intracranial video electroencephalography prior to multilobar resections. We measured the OR of HFOs and determined the electrodes with a high rate of HFOs by cluster analysis. We calculated MI, which reflects the degree of coupling between HFO (ripple/fast ripple [FR]) amplitude and 5 different frequency bands of delta and theta activities (0.5-1 Hz, 1-2 Hz, 2-3 Hz, 3-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz). ResultsIn ES+ (n = 10), the OR(FRs), the number of electrodes with high-rate FRs, and the MI(FRs & 3-4 Hz) in all electrodes were significantly higher than in ES- (n = 14). In both the ES+ and ES- groups, MI(ripples/FRs & 3-4 Hz) was the highest among the 5 frequency bands. Within the good seizure outcome group, the OR(FRs) and the MI(FRs & 3-4 Hz) in the resected area in ES+ were significantly higher than in ES- (OR[FRs], P = .04; MI[FRs & 3-4 Hz], P = .04). SignificanceIn ES+, the larger number of high-rate FR electrodes indicates more widespread epileptogenicity than in ES-. High values of OR(FRs) and MI(FRs & 3-4 Hz) in ES+ compared to ES- are a signature of the severity of epileptogenicity. We proved that ES+ children who achieved seizure freedom following multilobar resections exhibited strong coupling between slow oscillations and FRs.

And most ear-EEG studies have focused on auditory or visual stimuli-based BCI. However, despite advantages of motor imagery (MI), the feasibility of MI-based ear-EEG BCI has not been investigated yet. Hence, in this paper, we examine the usability of MI-based ear-EEG BCI in two folds; 1) observing MI patterns around the ear and 2) classifying MI tasks with satisfactory decoding performance. We propose a sequential backward spatio-spectral filter optimization (SBSSFO) to find a subject-specific optimal frequency band in ear-around EEG signals. And, we evaluate the performance of two datasets including a public dataset (i.e., BCI competition III dataset IVa). In an analysis, event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns in the ear-around EEG signals showed the smaller intensity than motor-area EEG signals. But the similar patterns were inspected in time and frequency domain. As a result, the proposed method showed an average accuracy of 70.54% with approximately 10.5% and 3.6% performance enhancement compared to the standard common spatial pattern (CSP) and common spatio-spectral pattern (CSSP), respectively.

However, because of the weakness and randomness of EEG signal, it is very complicated and difficult to process and identify the EEG signal recorded by the non-invasive BCI, and the decoding error often occurs. In view of the brain electrical signal decoding error, an experimental paradigm for simultaneous acquisition of spontaneous EEG and evoked EEG was designed, where the subjects generated the error-related potentials (ErrP) based on the decoded feedback of motor imagery EEG. We analyzed the EEG signal two times. The motor imagery EEG, which was the component of the EEG signal, was analyzed at the first time analysis. We classified the motor imagery EEG signal of left and right hand, then analyzed the classification method quantitatively using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC). Although the EEG signal were influenced greatly by the individual difference, the AUC values can still reach more than 0.7. Meanwhile, the frequency domain characteristics were analyzed. The activation brain regions of the left-right hand motor imagery are mainly concentrated in the area of the perceptual motor cortex where is responsible for hand motion, but they will also be influenced by the artifacts of the surrounding channels. In the second time analysis, the ErrP was extracted and discussed. Its latency, waveform and amplitude characteristics were studied in the time domain and then a suitable classifier is selected by comparing a variety of classifiers, which classification accuracy is up to 90%. Therefore, the research based on the ErrP signal played a theoretical foundation for applying to the lower limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot in the future, and ensured the feasibility of applying the command confirmation unit based on ErrP signal to the exoskeleton rehabilitation robot.

Based on the development of deep learning, Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is also developing rapidly. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can effectively reduce the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rate of doctors. In this situation, we can analyze, the results for early seizure, detection system based on deep learning algorithm to help doctors to diagnose. In this paper, the problems of seizure preduction based on electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset are studied in depth, especially the probabilistic problem of predicting, pre-seizure fragments. We propose to transform time domain EEG data. into frequency domain information by discrete Fourier transform. We also propose, a method for extracting frequency domain and time series data features based on two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). This method AUC index can reach 0.79. In addition, we also carry out the comparative analysis and systematic analysis of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR) and basic recurrent neural neawork (RNN) methods. The experimental results show that the prediction performance based on the CNN model is better than other models.

Current research states alpha band's relation to creative ideation, as the most consistent finding. However, creative ideation appear at the signal level within multiple frequency bands and cross-frequency coupling phenomenon. To address this issue, we analyzed both within band and cross-frequency functional connectivity in a single framework using multilayer network. To further investigate the time evolution of creative thinking, we performed the analysis for three phases (early, middle and later). The experimental design used in this study consists of divergent thinking as an indicator of creativity where the subjects were instructed to give alternative uses of an object. As a control task, convergent thinking was used where the subjects were asked to list typical characteristics of an object. We evaluated global and nodal metrics (i.e., clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and nodal degree) for the three phases. Each metric was calculated separately for within band (intra layer) and cross-frequency (inter layer) connectivity. Paired t-test results showed significant difference in the later phase for both inter layer clustering coefficient and inter layer local efficiency. In nodal metrics, significant difference was observed in the later phase for intra layer degree and in all the phases for inter layer degree. The results from this study demonstrate that both the cross-frequency coupling and within-band connectivity can reveal more information regarding the neural processes related to creative ideation.

Frontal network dynamics reflect neurocomputational mechanisms for reducing maladaptive biases in motivated action	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; THETA; CONFLICT; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ANTICIPATION; NEGATIVITY; COHERENCE	Motivation exerts control over behavior by eliciting Pavlovian responses, which can either match or conflict with instrumental action. We can overcome maladaptive motivational influences putatively through frontal cognitive control. However, the neurocomputational mechanisms subserving this control are unclear; does control entail up-regulating instrumental systems, down-regulating Pavlovian systems, or both? We combined electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with a motivational Go/NoGo learning task (N = 34), in which multiple Go options enabled us to disentangle selective action learning from nonselective Pavlovian responses. Midfrontal theta-band (4 Hz-8 Hz) activity covaried with the level of Pavlovian conflict and was associated with reduced Pavlovian biases rather than reduced instrumental learning biases. Motor and lateral prefrontal regions synchronized to the midfrontal cortex, and these network dynamics predicted the reduction of Pavlovian biases over and above local, midfrontal theta activity. This work links midfrontal processing to detecting Pavlovian conflict and highlights the importance of network processing in reducing the impact of maladaptive, Pavlovian biases.

Previous studies have shown that this continuity illusion is associated with reduced low-frequency neural oscillations in the auditory cortex. However, the precise contribution of oscillatory amplitude changes and phase alignment to auditory restoration remains unclear. Using electroencephalography, we investigated induced power changes and phase locking in response to 3 Hz amplitude-modulated tones during the interval of an interrupting noise. We experimentally manipulated both the physical continuity of the tone (continuous vs. interrupted) and the masking potential of the noise (notched vs. full). We observed an attenuation of 3 Hz power during continuity illusions in comparison with both continuous tones and veridically perceived interrupted tones. This illusion-related suppression of low-frequency oscillations likely reflects a blurring of auditory object boundaries that supports continuity perception. We further observed increased 3 Hz phase locking during fully masked continuous tones compared with the other conditions. This low-frequency phase alignment may reflect the neural registration of the interrupting noise as a newly appearing object, whereas during continuity illusions, a spectral portion of this noise is delegated to filling the interruption. Taken together, our findings suggest that the suppression of slow cortical oscillations in both the power and phase domains supports perceptual restoration of interruptions in auditory input.

Prestimulus delta and theta contributions to equiprobable Go/NoGo processing in healthy ageing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP dynamics; Delta; Theta; Healthy ageing; Principal components analysis (PCA); Auditory Go/NoGo	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ANTERIOR SHIFT; ERP COMPONENTS; LIFE-SPAN; EEG	Ongoing EEG activity contributes to ERP outcomes of stimulus processing, and each of these measures is known to undergo (sometimes significant) age-related change. Variation in their relationship across the life-span may thus elucidate mechanisms of normal and pathological ageing. This study assessed the relationships between low-frequency EEG prestimulus brain states, the ERP, and behavioural outcomes in a simple equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo paradigm, comparing these for 20 young (M-age = 20.4 years) and 20 healthy older (M-age = 68.2 years) adults. Prestimulus delta and theta amplitudes were separately assessed; these were each dominant across the midline region, and reduced in the older adults. For each band, (within-subjects) trials were sorted into ten increasing prestimulus EEG levels for which separate ERPs were derived. The set of ten ERPs for each band-sort was then quantified by PCA, independently for each group (young, older adults). Four components were primarily assessed (P1, N1-1, P2/N2b complex, and P3), with each showing age-related change. Mean RT was comparable, but intra-individual RT variability increased in older adults. Prestimulus delta and theta each generally modulated component positivity, indicating broad influence on task processing. Prestimulus delta was primarily associated with the early sensory processes, and theta more with the later stimulus-specific processes; prestimulus theta also inversely modulated intra-individual RT variability across the groups. These prestimulus EEG ERP dynamics were consistent between the young and older adults in each band for all components except the P2/N2b, suggesting that across the lifespan, Go/NoGo categorisation is differentially affected by prestimulus delta and theta.

Development of infant sustained attention and its relation to EEG oscillations: an EEG and cortical source analysis study	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION-MEMORY; DEFAULT MODE; MU RHYTHM; BRAIN; STIMULI; INHIBITION; POWER; LOCALIZATION	The current study examined the relation between infant sustained attention and infant EEG oscillations. Fifty-nine infants were tested at 6 (N = 15), 8 (N = 17), 10 (N = 14), and 12 (N = 13) months. Three attention phases, stimulus orienting, sustained attention, and attention termination, were defined based on infants' heart rate changes. Frequency analysis using simultaneously recorded EEG focused on infant theta (2-6 Hz), alpha (6-9 Hz), and beta (9-14 Hz) rhythms. Cortical source analysis of EEG oscillations was conducted with realistic infant MRI models. Theta synchronization was found over fontal pole, temporal, and parietal electrodes during infant sustained attention for 10 and 12 months. Alpha desynchronization was found over frontal, central and parietal electrodes during sustained attention. This alpha effect started to emerge at 10 months and became well established by 12 months. No difference was found for the beta rhythm between different attention phases. The theta synchronization effect was localized to the orbital frontal, temporal pole, and ventral temporal areas. The alpha desynchronization effect was localized to the brain regions composing the default mode network including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal gyrus. The alpha desynchronization effect was also localized to the pre- and post-central gyri. The present study demonstrates a connection between infant sustained attention and EEG oscillatory activities.

Development and Demonstration of an Integrated EEG, Eye-Tracking, and Behavioral Data Acquisition System to Assess Online Learning	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTERS (ICETC 2018)			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Education Technology and Computers (ICETC 2018)	OCT 26-28, 2018	Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, JAPAN	IACSIT	Tokyo Inst Technol	Online learning; EEG; Eye-tracking; Bio-signal and Behavioral Data; Learning Science	OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; PUPIL; GAZE	Over the past several years, there has been a rise in online learning platforms and websites for skill acquisition. However, traditional learning analytics to evaluate the effectiveness of presented material are limited in that they do not acquire information regarding the user's biophysical state during this learning process. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive system for evaluating online learners' engagement and performance via electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, and behavioral data methods. Such information is of interest to (i) neuroscientists and psychologists aiming to quantify computerized learning processes and developing models to represent learning states, as well as to (ii) individuals designing educational content to better understand how information is accessed and utilized by users. We first describe the selection, design, and integration of the bio-signal components. We then demonstrate the combined utility of our system through recording signals while participants (N=22) completed German language lessons on the free web-based platform, Duolingo. As low-cost hardware is utilized in our system, data acquisition can readily be scaled to multiple research sites or remote collection, allowing for access to more naturalistic datasets not typically studied using traditional laboratory research systems.

Relatively little is known regarding the neural generators and temporal dynamics of this arhythmical behaviour compared to rhythmical behaviour. Here we used Irregularly Resampled AutoSpectral Analysis (IRASA) to quantify beta, in both the high (5-100 Hz, beta(hf)) and low frequency bands (0.1-2.5 Hz, beta(lf)) in MEG/EEG/ECoG recordings and to separate arhythmical from rhythmical modes of activity, such as, alpha rhythms. In MEG/EEG/ECoG data, we demonstrate that oscillatory alpha power dynamically correlates over time with beta(hf) and similarly, participants with higher rhythmical alpha power have higher beta(hf). In a series of pharmaco-MEG investigations using the GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine, the glutamatergic AMPA receptor antagonist perampanel, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine and the mixed partial serotonergic agonist LSD, a variety of effects on both beta(hf) and beta(lf) were observed. Additionally, strong modulations of beta(hf) were seen in monkey ECoG data during general anaesthesia using propofol and ketamine. We develop and test a unifying model which can explain, the 1/f nature of electrophysiological spectra, their dynamic interaction with oscillatory rhythms as well as the sensitivity of 1/f activity to drug interventions by considering electrophysiological spectra as being generated by a collection of stochastically perturbed damped oscillators having a distribution of relaxation rates.

J	Ma, Z				Ma, Zhen			Neurophysiological Analysis of the Genesis Mechanism of EEG During the Interictal and Ictal Periods Using a Multiple Neural Masses Model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; multiple neural masses model; sparse representation; orthogonal matching pursuit	NETWORK METHODOLOGY; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; DIAGNOSIS; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; STIMULATION; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION	Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important method to investigate the neurophysiological mechanism underlying epileptogenesis to identify new therapies for the treatment of epilepsy. The neurophysiologically based neural mass model (NMM) can build a bridge between signal processing and neurophysiology, which can be used as a platform to explore the neurophysiological mechanism of epileptogenesis. Most EEG signals cannot be regarded as the outputs of a single NMM with identical model parameters. The outputs of NMM are simple because the diversity of neural signals in the same NMM is ignored. To improve the simulation of EEG signals, a multiple NMM is proposed, the output of which is the linear combination of the outputs of all NMMs. The NMM number is not fixed and is minimized under the premise of guaranteeing the fitting effect. Orthogonal matching pursuit is used to solve a constrained l(0) norm minimization problem for NMM number and the strength of every NMM. The results showed that the NMM number was significantly lower during the ictal period than during the interictal period, and the strength of major NMMs increased. This indicates that neural masses fuse into fewer larger neural masses with greater strength. The distribution of excitatory and inhibitory strength during the ictal and interictal periods was similar, whereas the excitation/inhibition ratio was higher during the ictal period than during the interictal period.

However, psychological and behavioral studies offer inconsistent support for this theory due to personal or social factors, and little is known about the gender-based neurobiological mechanisms of aggression. This study investigates gender differences in aggression through an analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) based neurobiological responses to commonly encountered stimuli, as well as psychological approaches in healthy Korean youth. Our results from self-reports indicate that overall aggression indices, including physical and reactive,/overt aggression, were stronger in men. This agrees with the results of previous studies. Furthermore, our study reveals prominent gender-related patterns in y signals from the right ventrolateral frontal cortex and changes in heart rate through stimulation by aggressive videos. In particular, gender differences in EEG and ECG responses were observed in response to different scenes, as simple aversion and situation-dependent aggression, respectively. In addition, we discovered decisive gender-distinct EEG signals during stimulation of the situation-dependent aggression regions within the right ventromedial prefrontal and ventrolateral frontal regions. Our findings provide evidence of a psychological propensity for aggression and neurobiological mechanisms of oscillation underlying gender differences in aggression. Further studies of oscillatory responses to aggression and provocation will expand the objective understanding of the different emotional worlds between men and women.

Critically, selection via competition requires biasing signals to enable one of these alternatives to be selected. This study tested the hypothesis that selection is related to the prestimulus excitability of neuronal ensembles in which movements are encoded, as assessed through the phase of delta-band oscillations (2-4 Hz). Electroencephalography was recorded while participants performed speeded reaches toward appearing visual targets using the hand of their choice. The target locations were controlled such that only targets for which the left and right hands were selected equally often were used for analysis. Results revealed that hand selection as well as reach reaction times strongly depended upon the instantaneous phase of delta at the moment of target onset. This effect was maximal over contralateral motor regions, and occurred in the absence of prestimulus alpha-(8-12 Hz) and beta-band (1530 Hz) amplitude modulations. These findings demonstrate that the excitability of motor regions acts as a modulatory factor for hand choice during reaching. They extend current models by showing that action selection is related to the underlying brain state independently of previously known decision variables.

Variation in oscillatory activity is highly heritable, but current understanding of specific genetic influences remains limited. We performed the largest genome-wide association study to date of oscillatory power during eyes-closed resting electroencephalogram (EEG) across a range of frequencies (delta 1-3.75 Hz, theta 4-7.75 Hz, alpha 8-12.75 Hz, and beta 13-30 Hz) in 8,425 subjects. Additionally, we performed KGG positional gene-based analysis and brain-expression analyses. GABRA2-a known genetic marker for alcohol use disorder and epilepsysignificantly affected beta power, consistent with the known relation between GABA(A) interneuron activity and beta oscillations. Tissue-specific SNP-based imputation of gene-expression levels based on the GTEx database revealed that hippocampal GABRA2 expression may mediate this effect. Twenty-four genes at 3p21.1 were significant for alpha power (FDR q < .05). SNPs in this region were linked to expression of GLYCTK in hippocampal tissue, and GNL3 and ITIH4 in the frontal cortex-genes that were previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In sum, we identified several novel genetic variants associated with oscillatory brain activity; furthermore, we replicated and advanced understanding of previously known genes associated with psychopathology (i.e., schizophrenia and alcohol use disorders). Importantly, these psychopathological liability genes affect brain functioning, linking the genes' expression to specific cortical/subcortical brain regions.	[Smit, Dirk J.

Symbol phase transfer entropy was a further improvement of transfer entropy. It was applied to the analysis of synchronous EEG and EMG signal to evaluate the performance of cortical muscle coupling. The EEG/EMG signals recorded synchronously at different muscle strength were decomposed into uniform narrow band oscillations using harmonic wavelet transform. The corresponding SPTEs of EEG and EMG narrow band oscillations were calculated and summed, and the significant areas were obtained. By moving the analysis window, time varying significant areas were obtained and significant area curves showed the corresponding strength of cortical muscle coupling.

Impact of different intensities of intermittent theta burst stimulation on the cortical properties during TMS-EEG and working memory performance	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						intensity; prefrontal cortex; theta burst stimulation (TBS); TMS-EEG; working memory	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ALPHA POWER; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; PATTERNED STIMULATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS	Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique capable of increasing cortical excitability beyond the stimulation period. Due to the rapid induction of modulatory effects, prefrontal application of iTBS is gaining popularity as a therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders such as depression. In an attempt to increase efficacy, higher than conventional intensities are currently being applied. The assumption that this increases neuromodulatory may be mechanistically false for iTBS. This study examined the influence of intensity on the neurophysiological and behavioural effects of iTBS in the prefrontal cortex. Sixteen healthy participants received iTBS over prefrontal cortex at either 50, 75 or 100% resting motor threshold in separate sessions. Single-pulse TMS and concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) was used to assess changes in cortical reactivity measured as TMS-evoked potentials and oscillations. The n-back task was used to assess changes in working memory performance. The data can be summarised as an inverse U-shape relationship between intensity and iTBS plastic effects, where 75% iTBS yielded the largest neurophysiological changes. Improvement in reaction time in the 3-back task was supported by the change in alpha power, however, comparison between conditions revealed no significant differences. The assumption that higher intensity results in greater neuromodulatory effects may be false, at least in healthy individuals, and should be carefully considered for clinical populations. Neurophysiological changes associated with working memory following iTBS suggest functional relevance. However, the effects of different intensities on behavioural performance remain elusive in the present healthy sample.	[Chung, Sung Wook; Hoy, Kate E.; Sullivan, Caley M.; Cash, Robin F.

The present study aims to assess whether such modulations occurs also in auditory modality. In order to investigate auditory sensory modulations, we compared a passive listening condition with two conditions in which attention was internally oriented as a part of a task; a visual imagery condition and an inner speech condition. EEG signal was recorded from 20 participants while they were exposed to auditory probes during these three conditions. ERP results showed no differences in N1 auditory response comparing the three conditions reflecting maintenance of evoked electrophysiological reactivity for auditory modality. Nonetheless, time-frequency analyses showed that gamma and theta power in frontal regions was higher for passive listening than for internal attentional conditions. Specifically, the reduced amplitude in early gamma and theta band during both inward attention conditions may reflect reduced conscious attention of the current auditory stimulation. Finally, different pattern of beta band activity was observed only during visual imagery which can reflect cross-modal integration between visual and auditory modalities and it can distinguish this form of mental imagery from the inner speech. Taken together, these results showed that attentional suppression mechanisms in auditory modality are different from visual modality during mental imagery processes. Our results about oscillatory activity also confirm the important role of gamma oscillations in auditory processing and the differential neural dynamics underlying the visual and auditory/verbal imagery.

The relation between Scrabble expertise and brain aging as measured with EEG brain signal variability	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Aging; Electroencephalography; Multiscale entropy; Nonlinear dynamics; Spectral power density; Scrabble expertise	COMPETITIVE SCRABBLE; AGE-DIFFERENCES; PERFORMANCE; SKILL; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCIES; COMPLEXITY; CHESS; TASK	Recent empirical work suggests that the dynamics of brain function, as measured by brain signal variability, differs between younger and older adults. We extended this work by examining how the relationship between brain signal variability and age is altered in the context of expertise. We recorded electroencephalography from Scrabble experts and controls during a visual word recognition task. To measure variability, we used multiscale entropy, which emphasizes the way brain signals behave over a range of timescales and can differentiate the variability of a complex system (the brain) from a purely random system. We replicated previously identified shifts from long-range interactions among neural populations to more local processing in late adulthood. In addition, we demonstrated an age-related increase in midrange neural interactions for experts, suggesting greater maintenance of network integration into late adulthood. Our results indicate that expertise-related differences in the context of age and brain dynamics occur across different timescales and that these differences are linked to task performance.

Expert physicians must monitor long-term EEG signals that is sometimes difficult and time consuming process for epilepsy diagnosis. In this study, classification performances of support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which are widely used in computer supported epilepsy diagnosis, were compared by using wavelet-based features of extracted from EEG signals which were derived in either normal or inter-ictal periods. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to determine the effects of dimension reduction on classification success. Materials and Methods: The EEG data were sampled from the EEG laboratory of the Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology in Adnan Menderes University. Study was approved by Local Ethics Committee with protocol number 2016/873. Ten patients with epilepsy and 10 normal were the study group. EEG signals of patients with epilepsy were contains only seizure free- epochs. EEG signals were first decomposed into frequency sub-bands by using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and then some statistical features were calculated from those to classify it's as normal or epileptic. Results: In classification of the EEG signals, it's as normal or epileptic, we achieved 88.9 0 /o accuracy rate using SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel without dimension reduction. Conclusion: Results showed that SVM was a powerful tool in classifying EEG signals if it's normal or epileptic.

Early studies indicated the thalamo-cortical circuit as the origin of alpha rhythm. Recent works suggest an additional relationship between alpha rhythm and the Default Mode Network (DMN). We simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in 36 young males asked to alternately close and open their eyes in 30-s blocks. Using an EEG source channel montage (the recorded signal was interpolated to designated source positions corresponding to certain brain regions) we found an alpha rhythm sub-activity composed of its intrinsic events, called alpha bursting segments (ABS). More ABS were observed on source channels related to the DMN than those located over the OCC. Similarly, both the beamformer source analysis and fMRI indicated that the specific ABS activity detected on the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC) source channel was less related to the OCC than to the DMN source channels. The fMRI analysis performed using the PCC-ABS as a general linear model regressor indicated an increased blood oxygenation level-dependent signal change in DMN nodes - precuneus and prefrontal cortex.

We investigated neural precursors of conscious vision using EEG recordings and the popular breaking continuous flash suppression (bCFS) paradigm. In this technique, a mask consisting of high-contrast dynamic patterns is presented to one eye, predominating over a target stimulus presented to the other eye. The time needed for the target stimulus to overcome the suppression is thought to reflect the transition from unconscious to conscious perception. In bCFS trials with slow responses, indicative of potent suppression, a time-frequency analysis showed reduced occipital gamma power (33-38 Hz) contralaterally to the visual hemifield where the target was presented 0.27 to 0.21 s prior to the behavioral response. This neural activity was concurrent with a local phase reset and enhanced long-range phase synchronization in the theta band (7 Hz). Such a pattern did not arise in a control condition in which suppression was not induced. Thus, the theta phase reset and synchronization in bCFS trials precede a break from suppression, likely initiating a re-routing of information such that the neural representation of the target is updated more efficiently than that of the competing mask. Overall, these findings mark the emergence of a binocularly integrated percept that can be consciously selected for a behavioral response.

Most of TFR methods are developed for real-valued signals. In several fields of science and technology, the study of unique information presented in the complex form of signals is required. Therefore, an eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrix-based TFR method, which is a data-driven technique, has been extended for the analysis of complex-valued signals. In this method, the positive and negative frequency components of complex signals are separately decomposed using recently developed eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrix-based method. Further, the Hilbert transform is applied on decomposed components to obtain TFR for both positive and negative frequency ranges. The proposed method for obtaining TFR is compared with the existing methods. Results for synthetic and natural complex signals provide support to the proposed method to perform better than compared methods.

Many of these behaviors are known to involve excitatory or inhibitory modulations from the prefrontal cortex. We used cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) to probe cerebellar-evoked electrical activity in prefrontal cortical areas and used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures of prefrontal GABA and glutamate levels to determine if they are correlated with those potentials. Cerebellar-evoked bilateral prefrontal synchrony in the theta to gamma frequency range showed patterns that reflect strong GABAergic inhibitory function (r=-0.66, p=0.002). Stimulation of prefrontal areas evoked bilateral prefrontal synchrony in the theta to low beta frequency range that reflected, conversely, glutamatergic excitatory function (r=0.66, p=0.002) and GABAergic inhibitory function (r=-0.65, p=0.002). Cerebellar-evoked prefrontal synchronization had opposite associations with cognition and motor coordination: it was positively associated with working memory performance (r=0.57, p=0.008) but negatively associated with coordinated motor function as measured by rapid finger tapping (r=-0.59, p=0.006). The results suggest a relationship between regional GABA levels and interregional effects on synchrony. Stronger cerebellar-evoked prefrontal synchrony was associated with better working memory but surprisingly worse motor coordination, which suggests competing effects for motor activity and cognition. The data supports the use of a TMS-EEG-MRS approach to study the neurochemical basis of large-scale oscillations modulated by the cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity.

High frequency oscillations are also an excellent indicator of this zone, but are primarily recorded from intracerebral EEG. We studied the spatial overlap of these two important markers in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy to assess if their combination could help better define the extent of the epileptogenic zone. We included patients who underwent EEG-functional MRI and later intracerebral EEG. Based on intracerebral EEG findings, we separated patients with unifocal seizures from patients with multifocal or unknown onset seizures. Haemodynamic t-maps were coregistered with the intracerebral electrode positions. Each EEG channel was classified as pertaining to one of the following categories: primary haemodynamic cluster (maximum t-value), secondary cluster (t-value490% of the primary cluster) or outside the primary and secondary clusters. We marked high frequency oscillations (ripples: 80-250 Hz; fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) during 1 h of slow wave sleep, and compared their rates in each haemodynamic category. After classifying channels as high-or low-rate, the proportion of high-rate channels within the primary or primary plus secondary clusters was compared to the proportion expected by chance. Twenty-five patients, 11 with unifocal and 14 with multifocal/unknown seizure onsets, were studied. We found a significantly higher median high frequency oscillation rate in the primary cluster compared to secondary cluster and outside these two clusters for the unifocal group (P50.0001), but not for the multifocal/unknown group. For the unifocal group, the number of high-rate channels within the primary or primary plus secondary clusters was significantly higher than expected by chance. This held only for the high-ripple-rate channels in the multifocal/unknown group. At the patient level, most patients (18/25, or 72%) had at least one high-rate channel within a primary cluster. In patients with unifocal epilepsy, the maximum haemodynamic response (primary cluster) related to scalp interictal discharges overlaps with the tissue generating high frequency oscillations at high rates. If intracranial EEG is warranted, this response should be explored. As a tentative clinical use of the combination of these techniques we propose that higher high frequency oscillation rates inside than outside the maximum response indicates that the patient has indeed a focal epileptogenic zone demarcated by this response, whereas similar rates inside and outside may indicate a widespread epileptogenic zone or an epileptogenic zone not covered by the implantation.

Integration and Temporal Processing of Asynchronous Audiovisual Speech	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; VISUAL SPEECH; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; LEADING SENSE; PERCEPTION; EEG; CONFLICT; BINDING	Multisensory integration of visual mouth movements with auditory speech is known to offer substantial perceptual benefits, particularly under challenging (i.e., noisy) acoustic conditions. Previous work characterizing this process has found that ERPs to auditory speech are of shorter latency and smaller magnitude in the presence of visual speech. We sought to determine the dependency of these effects on the temporal relationship between the auditory and visual speech streams using EEG. We found that reductions in ERP latency and suppression of ERP amplitude are maximal when the visual signal precedes the auditory signal by a small interval and that increasing amounts of asynchrony reduce these effects in a continuous manner. Time-frequency analysis revealed that these effects are found primarily in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands, with a central topography consistent with auditory generators. Theta effects also persisted in the lower portion of the band (3.5-5 Hz), and this late activity was more frontally distributed. Importantly, the magnitude of these late theta oscillations not only differed with the temporal characteristics of the stimuli but also served to predict participants' task performance. Our analysis thus reveals that suppression of single-trial brain responses by visual speech depends strongly on the temporal concordance of the auditory and visual inputs. It further illustrates that processes in the lower theta band, which we suggest as an index of incongruity processing, might serve to reflect the neural correlates of individual differences in multisensory temporal perception.

Relevant studies in the field of sports rehabilitation show that motor imagery training can promote the recovery of damaged nerves and the reconstruction of motor nerve pathways. This paper proposes a human-brain cooperative control strategy of a pneumatic muscle-driven ankle rehabilitation robot based on motor imagery EEG. Robots provide assisted rehabilitation training for patients with impaired neural transmission but with movement intentions. The brain network algorithm is used to select the optimal channels for the motor imagery signal, and the common spatial pattern (CSP) method is combined with the time-frequency analysis method local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) to extract the time-frequency information.Finally, the classification is processed by the spectral regression discriminant analysis (SRDA) classifier. In addition, two rehabilitation training modes are designed, namely, synchronous rehabilitation training and asynchronous rehabilitation training. The experimental results prove that a brain intention driven human robot cooperative control method is realized to complete an ankle rehabilitation training task effectively.

Our method requires only that the signals of interest are spatially oversampled, which is a reasonable assumption for many EEG and MEG systems. Methods: Our method is based on a leave-one-out procedure using overlapping temporal windows in a mathematical framework to project spatially uncorrelated noise in the temporal domain. Results: This method, termed "oversampled temporal projection" (OTP), has four advantages over existing methods. First, sparse channel-specific artifacts are suppressed while limiting mixing with other channels, whereas existing linear, time-invariant spatial operators can spread such artifacts to other channels with a spatial distribution which can be mistaken for one produced by an electrophysiological source. Second, OTP minimizes distortion of the spatial configuration of the data. During source localization (e.g., dipole fitting), many spatial methods require corresponding modification of the forward model to avoid bias, while OTP does not. Third, noise suppression factors at the sensor level are maintained during source localization, whereas bias compensation removes the denoising benefit for spatial methods that require such compensation. Fourth, OTP uses a time-window duration parameter to control the tradeoff between noise suppression and adaptation to time-varying sensor characteristics. Conclusion: OTP efficiently optimizes noise suppression performance while controlling for spatial bias of the signal of interest. Significance: This is important in applications where sensor noise significantly limits the signal-to-noise ratio, such as high-frequency brain oscillations.

However, this kind of decision-making has been largely overlooked in the literature. The current study investigated whether behavioral preference would change during sequential decisions, and the neural processes underlying the potential changes. For this purpose, we revised the classic balloon analogue risk task and recorded the electroencephalograph (EEG) signals associated with each step of decision-making. Independent component analysis performed on EEG data revealed that four EEG components elicited by periodic feedback in the current step predicted participants' decisions (gamble vs. no gamble) in the next step. In order of time sequence, these components were: bilateral occipital alpha rhythm, bilateral frontal theta rhythm, middle frontal theta rhythm, and bilateral sensorimotor mu rhythm. According to the information flows between these EEG oscillations, we proposed a brain model that describes the temporal dynamics of sequential decision-making. Finally, we found that the tendency to gamble (as well as the power intensity of bilateral frontal theta rhythms) was sensitive to the individual level of trait anxiety in certain steps, which may help understand the role of emotion in decision-making.

Investigation of Surface EMG and Acceleration Signals of Limbs' Tremor in Parkinson's Disease Patients Using the Method of Electrical Activity Analysis Based on Wave Trains	ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - IBERAMIA 2018	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	16th Ibero-American Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IBERAMIA)	NOV 13-16, 2018	Trujillo, PERU	Univ Nacl Trujillo, Soc Peruana Inteligencia Artificial, Ibero Ame Soc Artificial Intelligence		Exploratory data analysis; Pattern recognition Wavelet spectrogram; ROC analysis; Wave train Muscle electrical activity; Signal processing; Electromyography EMG; Acceleration; Parkinson's disease	SPINDLE DETECTION; POSTURAL TREMOR; MEDICATION; FREQUENCY	In recent years, spindle-shaped electrical activity became interesting for researchers looking for new methods of time-frequency analysis of electromyograms (EMG) and acceleration (ACC) signals. We call signals of this type as wave trains; a wave train (a wave packet) is an electrical signal that is localized in space, frequency, and time. Examples of wave trains in electroencephalograms (EEG) are alpha spindles, beta spindles, and sleep spindles. We analyze all kinds of wave train electrical activity of the muscles in a wide frequency range. We have developed a new method for analyzing wave train electrical activity of muscles based on wavelet analysis and ROC analysis that enables to study the time-frequency features of EMG and ACC in limbs' tremor in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The idea of the method is to find local maxima in the wavelet spectrogram and to calculate various characteristics describing these maxima (called wave trains): the leading frequency, the duration in periods (the full-width on the square root of 1/2 of the peak in the spectrogram), the bandwidth (the full-width on the square root of 1/2 of the peak in the spectrogram), the number of wave trains per second. Then we conduct a statistical analysis of these characteristics. In our previous papers, frequency ranges (based on EEG features) were found where the quantity of wave trains per second differs between a group of patients of the early stage of PD and a group of healthy volunteers. In this paper, we search similar frequency ranges based on time-frequency features of EMG and ACC.

How this can be applied at the patient level remains poorly understood. We investigated how well HFOs and spikes can predict epileptogenic regions with a large spatial sampling at the patient level. Methods: We analyzed non-REM sleep SEEG recordings sampled at 2,048Hz of 30 patients. Ripples (Rs; 80-250Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 250-500Hz), and spikes were automatically detected. Rates of these markers and several combinations-spikes co-occurring with HFOs or FRs and cross-rate (Spk circle times HFO)-were compared to a quantified measure of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) by performing a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each patient individually. We used a Wilcoxon signed-rank test corrected for false-discovery rate to assess whether a marker was better than the others for predicting the SOZ. Results: A total of 2,930 channels was analyzed (median of 100 channels per patient). The HFOs or any of its variants were not statistically better than spikes. Only one feature, the cross-rate, was better than all the other markers. Moreover, fast ripples, even though very specific, were not delineating all epileptogenic tissues. Interpretation: At the patient level, the performance of HFOs is weakened by the presence of strong physiological HFO generators. Fast ripples are not sensitive enough to be the unique biomarker of epileptogenicity. Nevertheless, combining HFOs and spikes using our proposed measure-the cross-rate-is a better strategy than using only one marker.

J	Safi, SMM; Pooyan, M; Nasrabadi, AM				Safi, Seyed Mohammad Mehdi; Pooyan, Mohammad; Nasrabadi, Ali Motie			SSVEP recognition by modeling brain activity using system identification based on Box-Jenkins model	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); Box-jenkins model (BJM); Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); Multivariate linear regression (MLR); Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; COMPUTER INTERFACES; BCI SYSTEM; FREQUENCY COMPONENTS; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; FEATURES; SIGNALS; P300	The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has received increasing attention in recent years. The present study proposes a new method for recognition based on system identification. The method relies on modeling the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using the Box-Jenkins model. In this approach, the recorded EEG signal is considered as a combination of an SSVEP signal evoked by periodic visual stimulation and a background EEG signal whose components are modeled by a moving average (MA) process and an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) process, respectively. Then, the target frequency is determined by comparing the modeled SSVEP signals for all stimulation frequencies. The experimental results of the proposed method for recorded EEG signals from five subjects (each subject with four stimulation frequencies) demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the SSVEP recognition in contrast to canonical correlation analysis,least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and multivariate linear regression methods. The proposed method exhibits enhanced accuracy especially for short data length and a small number of channels. This superiority suggests that the proposed method is an appropriate choice for the implementation of real-time SSVEP based BCI systems.

The widely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), similarly to other antidepressants, are known to produce markedly different effects on sleep and behavioral measures with acute and chronic administration. Although there are studies examining the acute effect of escitalopram on slower (< 30 Hz) oscillations, we hardly could find any data about the effect of the drug on higher-frequency EEG oscillations (> 30 Hz) in different sleep-wake stages, particularly comparing the acute and chronic effects of the drug concerning gamma oscillations. Our aim was to investigate, how escitalopram affects gamma power in different sleep-wake stages, and to discover possible differential effects between acute and chronic treatment. EEG-equipped Wistar rats were treated with escitalopram or vehicle acutely (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or chronically (10 mg/kg/day for 21 days, osmotic minipumps) and frontoparietal EEG, electromyogram and motor activity were recorded during the first 3 h of passive phase. We found that acute and chronic escitalopram treatment affected gamma oscillations differently. While acute escitalopram caused a reduction in gamma power during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and intermediate stage of sleep (IS), chronic treatment caused an elevation in gamma power during non-REMS stages, namely in light and deep slow-wave sleep (SWS-1 and SWS-2, respectively) and in IS. However, gamma activity during active and passive wakefulness (AW and PW, respectively) was not influenced by either acute or chronic dosing of escitalopram. Furthermore, we found that in drug-free (vehicle-treated) rats, a relatively high gamma power was present during wakefulness and REMS, while a much lower power was measured during non-REMS stages. These findings indicate that acute and chronic administration of escitalopram alter gamma activity differently, moreover, in a sleep-wake stage dependent manner that may be related to differential therapeutic and/or side effects.

This paper addresses the application of a tensor decomposition called PARAFAC2 in the analysis of somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) and somatosensory evoked electrical potentials (SEPs). This new perspective of studying such MEG and EEG signals was first motivated by the seemingly good match between the PARAFAC2 model and the nature of these data. Based on this observation, we propose to compute the PARAFAC2 decomposition on three-dimensional tensors constructed from the time-frequency representation of the data. Results show that this PARAFAC2-based component analysis of SEFs and SEPs is able to extract the spectral, temporal and time-varying spatial signatures and to corroborate previous findings concerning the multiplicity in the signals evoked by peripheral nerve stimulations.

Here, we show that in humans, neural signatures of memory reactivation are modulated by the phase of a theta oscillation. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants were cued to recall previously learned word-object associations, and time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect neural reactivation of the target objects. Classifier fidelity rhythmically fluctuated at 7 or 8 Hz and was modulated by theta phase across the entire recall period. The phase of optimal classification was shifted approximately 180 degrees between encoding and retrieval. Inspired by animal work, we then computed "classifier-locked averages" to analyze how ongoing theta oscillations behaved around the time points at which the classifier indicated memory retrieval. We found strong theta (7 or 8 Hz) phase consistency approximately 300 ms before the time points of maximal neural memory reactivation. Our findings provide important evidence that the neural signatures of memory retrieval fluctuate and are time locked to the phase of an ongoing theta oscillation.

With a focus on the neurophysiological underpinnings of such differences, this study evaluated source-localized regional activity and functional connectivity of regions in the top-down and bottom-up streams as well as any discordance between the two streams. Resting state electroencephalography was used for 36 Parkinson's disease patients and 36 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Parkinson's disease patients showed disproportionally higher bilateral gamma activity in the bottom-up stream and higher left alpha2 connectivity in the top-down stream when compared to age-matched controls. An additional cross-frequency coupling analysis showed that Parkinson's patients have higher alpha2-gamma coupling in the right posterior parietal cortex, which is part of the top-down stream. Higher coupling in this region was also associated with lower severity of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. This study provides evidence that in Parkinson's disease, the activity in gamma frequency band and connectivity in alpha2 frequency band is discordant between top-down and bottom-up attention streams.

In addition, the impact of segment length is analyzed. Different nonlinear measures (fractality, complexity, etc.) of neural signals have been demonstrated to be useful to infer the non-linearity of brain functioning from EEG. The surrogate data method is often applied to test whether or not the non-linear structure can be captured from the data. In addition, a growing number of studies are using surrogate data method to determine the statistical threshold of connectivity values in network analysis. Current study focuses on the conventional segmentation of EEG signals, which could lead to false results of surrogate data method. More specifically, the necessity to use end-matched segments that contain an integer number of dominant frequency periods is studied. EEG recordings from 80 healthy volunteers during eyes-closed resting state were analyzed using multivariate surrogate data method. The artificial surrogate data were generated by shuffling the phase spectra of original signals. The null hypothesis that time series were generated by a linear process was rejected by statistically comparing the non-linear statistics calculated for original and surrogate data sets. Five discriminating statistics were used as non-linear estimators: Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), Katz fractal dimension (KFD), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), sample entropy (SampEn) and synchronization likelihood (SL). The results indicate that the number of segments evaluated as non-linear differs in the case of various nonlinear measures and changes with the segment length. The main conclusion is that the dependence on the deviation of the segment length from full periods of dominant EEG frequency has non-monotonic character and causes misleading results in the evaluation of non-linearity. Therefore, in the case of the signals with non-monotonic spectrum and strong dominant frequency, the correct use of surrogate data method requires the signal length comprising of full periods of the spectrum dominant frequency. The study is important to understand the influence of incorrect selection of EEG signal segment length for surrogate data method to estimate non-linearity.

J	Guo, F; Ye, GQ; Duffy, VG; Li, MM; Ding, Y				Guo, Fu; Ye, Guoquan; Duffy, Vincent G.; Li, Mingming; Ding, Yi			Applying eye tracking and electroencephalography to evaluate the effects of placement disclosures on brand responses	JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							PRODUCT PLACEMENT; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; TELEVISION; PERSUASION; IMPACT; OSCILLATIONS; ADVERGAMES; REPETITION; ATTENTION	Product placement is regarded as a covert advertising strategy because viewers are often unaware of the persuasion attempt when they are exposed to product placement due to the high integration of the commercial content into the media content. In order to guarantee fair communication and prevent viewers from being influenced without their awareness, regulations prescribing proper disclosure of product placement have been issued in many countries. However, there are no consistent findings of the effectiveness of disclosures in prior studies. This study first combined eye-tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) technologies with self-reported measures to better understand the effects of disclosures on viewers' brand responses. The results show that (a) disclosure is an effective method to increase viewers' awareness of the embedded persuasive message and brand recognition, while also causing a decrease in brand attitude; (b) viewers exposed to a product placement disclosure tend to show longer fixation time on the placed product and evoke decreased frontal alpha band and increased frontal and right-hemisphere gamma band compared with those who are exposed to non-disclosed product placement; and (c) the positive effects of disclosures on the awareness of the embedded persuasive message and brand recognition are mediated by fixation time, and the negative effect of disclosures on brand attitude is mediated by fixation time and right-hemisphere gamma band. These findings indicate that such eye movement indices and EEG bands can be viewed as reference measures reflecting viewers' cognitive and emotional processing of product placement and disclosures.

The EEG recordings are obtained from an open database which has been widely studied with many different combinations of feature extraction and classification techniques. Cepstral analysis technique is mainly used for speech recognition, seismological problems, mechanical part tests, etc. Utility of cepstral analysis based features in EEG signal classification is explored in the paper. In the proposed study, mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are computed in the feature extraction stage and used in neural network based classification stage. MFCCs are calculated based on a frequency analysis depending on filter bank of approximately critical bandwidths. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method is superior to most of the previous studies using the same dataset in classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This achieved success is the result of applying cepstral analysis technique to extract features. The system is promising to be used in real time seizure detection systems as the neural network adopted in the proposed method is inherently of non-iterative nature.

For this purpose, EEG recordings in conditions of initial rest, clean control, symptom provocation by imaginal exposure, and final rest were used for computing spatiotemporal activity characteristics based on microstate segmentation. Within-group comparisons were significant for the symptom provocation condition: OCD showed high global field power (GFP) and transi-tion rates into a medial frontal microstate, whereas healthy controls showed high frequency of occurrence and high percent of dwelling time for a medial occipitoparietal microstate. Between-group comparisons demonstrated significantly lower GFP and dwelling time for the medial occipitoparietal microstate in OCD in several conditions including initial rest and symptom provocation. In addition, OCD compared to healthy controls showed significant instability of the medial occipitoparietal microstate, with high preference for transitions into the medial frontal microstate. In conclusion, during rest and symptom provocation, OCD patients make preferential use of a medial frontal brain network, with concomitant reduction of use of a medial occipitoparietal network, as shown by dwelling times, explained variance, and dynamic transition rates. These findings support the idea of a possible biological marker for OCD, which might correspond to pathological hyperactivation of the frontal control network. (C) 2018 S.

In this study, Hilbert-Huang coherence(HHC) that can achieve both high frequency resolution and high time resolution was proposed to analyze the synchronization of EEG. Furthermore, we presented three types of visual stimuli (subject's own name, famous name and figure) to three subjects and applied HHC to EEG for each stimulus. In the result of this study, it confirmed that the amplitude of N100 for name stimuli was larger than that of N100 for figure stimuli. the amplitude of P200 for subject's own name was larger than that for famous name. In addition, in the midline electrodes, it confirmed by HHC that the synchronization of EEG around 10 Hz for name stimuli was higher than that for figure stimuli in the range of 0.0 to 0.2 s from stimuli onset.

To this end, we investigated brain oscillatory EEG activity during caresslike, affective haptic elicitation conveyed on the forearm at two force (strength of the caress) and three velocity (velocity of the caress) levels. Thirty-two healthy subjects (16 female) were asked to assess each haptic stimulus in terms of arousal (i.e., intensity of emotional perception) and valence (i.e., pleasantness/unpleasantness of emotional perception) scores, according to the circumplex model of affect. Changes in brain oscillations were quantified through spectral and functional connectivity analyses. EEG power spectra were estimated through the individual alpha frequency peak. Results, expressed in terms of p-value topographic maps, revealed a suppression of alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations over the contralateral somatosensory cortex during unpleasant caresses performed with the lowest force (2 N) and the highest velocity (65 mm/s). Conversely, pleasant caresses at the highest force were associated with a significant decrease of EEG oscillatory activity over the midfrontal region, at frequency bands including alpha, beta, and gamma. A correlation analysis showed that EEG gamma power from the somatosensory area was linked to caressing force. The more unpleasant the affective cutaneous stimuli, the more the brain dynamics decrease in activity all over the scalp, primarily showing a suppression of alpha power over the midfrontal cortex. These results also pave the way for the design of haptic systems eliciting a given emotional state.

Soman-induced status epilepticus, epileptogenesis, and neuropathology in carboxylesterase knockout mice treated with midazolam	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						chemical warfare nerve agents; electroencephalography; ES1-/- mice; organophosphorus; spontaneous recurrent seizures	INDUCED SEIZURES; DELTA ACTIVITY; BRAIN-DAMAGE; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; EPILEPSY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; INDUCTION	Objective Exposure to chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs), such as soman (GD), can induce status epilepticus (SE) that becomes refractory to benzodiazepines when treatment is delayed, leading to increased risk of epileptogenesis, severe neuropathology, and long-term behavioral and cognitive deficits. Rodent models, widely used to evaluate novel medical countermeasures (MCMs) against CWNA exposure, normally express plasma carboxylesterase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of certain organophosphorus compounds. To better predict the efficacy of novel MCMs against CWNA exposure in human casualties, it is crucial to use appropriate animal models that mirror the human condition. We present a comprehensive characterization of the seizurogenic, epileptogenic, and neuropathologic effects of GD exposure with delayed anticonvulsant treatment in the plasma carboxylesterase knockout (ES1-/-) mouse. Methods Results Electroencephalography (EEG) electrode-implanted ES1-/- and wild-type (C57BL/6) mice were exposed to various seizure-inducing doses of GD, treated with atropine sulfate and the oxime HI-6 at 1 minute after exposure, and administered midazolam at 15-30 minutes following the onset of seizure activity. The latency of acute seizure onset and spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) was assessed, as were changes in EEG power spectra. At 2 weeks after GD exposure, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation were assessed. GD-exposed ES1-/- mice displayed a dose-dependent response in seizure severity. Only ES1-/- mice exposed to the highest tested dose of GD developed SE, subchronic alterations in EEG power spectra, and SRS. Degree of neuronal cell loss and neuroinflammation were dose-dependent; no significant neuropathology was observed in C57BL/6 mice or ES1-/- mice exposed to lower GD doses. Significance The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) animal rule requires the use of relevant animal models for the advancement of MCMs against CWNAs. We present evidence that argues for the use of the ES1-/- mouse model to screen anticonvulsant, antiepileptic, and/or neuroprotective drugs against GD-induced toxicity, as well as to identify mechanisms of GD-induced epileptogenesis.

J	Opalka, S; Stasiak, B; Szajerman, D; Wojciechowski, A				Opalka, Slawomir; Stasiak, Bartlomiej; Szajerman, Dominik; Wojciechowski, Adam			Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Networks Architecture Feeding for Effective EEG Mental Tasks Classification	SENSORS			English	Article						mental task classification; EEG; CNN; BCI		Mental tasks classification is increasingly recognized as a major challenge in the field of EEG signal processing and analysis. State-of-the-art approaches face the issue of spatially unstable structure of highly noised EEG signals. To address this problem, this paper presents a multi-channel convolutional neural network architecture with adaptively optimized parameters. Our solution outperforms alternative methods in terms of classification accuracy of mental tasks (imagination of hand movements and speech sounds generation) while providing high generalization capability (approximate to 5%). Classification efficiency was obtained by using a frequency-domain multi-channel neural network feeding scheme by EEG signal frequency sub-bands analysis and architecture supporting feature mapping with two subsequent convolutional layers terminated with a fully connected layer. For dataset V from BCI Competition III, the method achieved an average classification accuracy level of nearly 70%, outperforming alternative methods. The solution presented applies a frequency domain for input data processed by a multi-channel architecture that isolates frequency sub-bands in time windows, which enables multi-class signal classification that is highly generalizable and more accurate (approximate to 1.2%) than the existing solutions. Such an approach, combined with an appropriate learning strategy and parameters optimization, adapted to signal characteristics, outperforms reference single- or multi-channel networks, such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and Cecotti's multi-channel NN. With the classification accuracy improvement of 1.2%, our solution is a clear advance as compared to the top three state-of-the-art methods, which achieved the result of no more than 0.3%.

The emotion recognition from EEG signals is a difficult study by the reason of nonstationary behavior of the signals. These signals are affected from complicated neural activity of brain. To analyze EEG signals, advanced signal processing techniques are required. In our study, data are collected from one channeled BIOPAC lab system. EEG signals were obtained from visual evoked potentials of 13 female and 13 male volunteers for 12 pleasant and 12 unpleasant pictures. To analyze nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics of EEG signals, an EMD-based method is proposed for emotion recognition. Various time and frequency domain techniques such as power spectral density (PSD), and higher order statistics (HOS) are used to analyze the IMFs extracted by EMD. Support vector machine (SVM), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes classifiers are utilized for the classification of features extracted from the IMFs, and their performances are compared.

Methods: EEG data were analyzed from the C3-A2 lead in a sample of polysomnograms from 161 older women participants in a community-based cohort study. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa measures from epoch-by-epoch comparisons of automated to visual-based artifact detection results; then we computed the average EEG spectral power densities in six commonly used EEG frequency bands and compared results from the two methods using correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Results: Assessment of automated artifact detection showed high specificity [96.8%-99.4% in non-rapid eye movement (NREM), 96.9%-99.1% in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep] but low sensitivity (26.7% -38.1% in NREM, 9.1-27.4% in REM sleep). However, large artifacts (total power > 99th percentile) were removed with sensitivity up to 87.7% in NREM and 90.9% in REM, with specificities of 96.9% and 96.6%, respectively. Mean power densities computed with the two approaches for all EEG frequency bands showed very high correlation (>= 0.99). The automated pipeline allowed for a 100-fold reduction in analysis time with regard to the standard approach. Conclusion: Despite low sensitivity for artifact rejection, the automated pipeline generated results comparable to those obtained with a standard method that included manual artifact detection. Automated pipelines can enable practical analyses of recordings from thousands of individuals, allowing for use in genetics and epidemiological research requiring large samples.

Responders to rTMS for depression show increased fronto-midline theta and theta connectivity compared to non-responders	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Treatment resistant depression; Electroencephalography; Response prediction; Theta; Alpha	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE ACTIVITY; CENTRAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ANTIDEPRESSANT RESPONSE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS	Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for depression, but only some individuals respond. Predicting response could reduce patient and clinical burden. Neural activity related to working memory (WM) has been related to mood improvements, so may represent a biomarker for response prediction. Primary hypotheses: We expected higher theta and alpha activity in responders compared to non-responders to rTMS. Methods: Fifty patients with treatment resistant depression and twenty controls performed a WM task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Patients underwent 5-8 weeks of rTMS treatment, repeating the EEG at week 1 (W1). Of the 39 participants with valid WM-related EEG data from baseline and W1, 10 were responders. Comparisons between responders and non-responders were made at baseline and W1 for measures of theta (4-8 Hz), upper alpha (10-12.5 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz) power, connectivity, and theta-gamma coupling. The control group's measures were compared to the depression group's baseline measures separately. Results: Responders showed higher levels of WM-related fronto-midline theta power and theta connectivity compared to non-responders at baseline and W1. Responder's fronto-midline theta power and connectivity was similar to controls. Responders also showed an increase in gamma connectivity from baseline to W1, with a concurrent improvement in mood and WM reaction times. An unbiased combination of all measures provided mean sensitivity of 0.90 at predicting responders and specificity of 0.92 in a predictive machine learning algorithm. Conclusion: Baseline and W1 fronto-midline theta power and theta connectivity show good potential for predicting response to rTMS treatment for depression. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The goal of this study was to examine the degree to which genes contribute to sleep EEG topography during adolescence, a period of brain restructuring and maturation. We recorded high-density sleep EEG in monozygotic (MZ; n = 28) and dizygotic (DZ; n = 22) adolescent twins (mean age = 13.2 +/- 1.1 years) at two time points 6 months apart. The topographic distribution of normalized sleep EEG power was examined for the frequency bands delta (1-4.6 Hz) to gamma 2 (34.2-44 Hz) during NREM and REM sleep. We found highest heritability values in the beta band for NREM and REM sleep (0.44 <= h(2) <= 0.57), while environmental factors shared amongst twin siblings accounted for the variance in the delta to sigma bands (0.59 <= c(2) <= 0.83). Given that both genetic and environmental factors are reflected in sleep EEG topography, our results suggest that topography may provide a rich metric by which to understand brain function. Furthermore, the frequency specific parsing of the influence of genetic from environmental factors on topography suggests functionally distinct networks and reveals the mechanisms that shape these networks.

J	Wang, J; Feng, ZR; Lu, N; Luo, J				Wang, Jie; Feng, Zuren; Lu, Na; Luo, Jing			Toward optimal feature and time segment selection by divergence method for EEG signals classification	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG signals; Kullback-Leibler divergence; Feature selection; Time segment selection; Classification	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; PATTERNS	Feature selection plays an important role in the field of EEG signals based motor imagery pattern classification. It is a process that aims to select an optimal feature subset from the original set. Two significant advantages involved are: lowering the computational burden so as to speed up the learning procedure and removing redundant and irrelevant features so as to improve the classification performance. Therefore, feature selection is widely employed in the classification of EEG signals in practical brain-computer interface systems. In this paper, we present a novel statistical model to select the optimal feature subset based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure, and automatically select the optimal subject-specific time segment. The proposed method comprises four successive stages: a broad frequency band filtering and common spatial pattern enhancement as preprocessing, features extraction by autoregressive model and log-variance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence based optimal feature and time segment selection and linear discriminate analysis classification. More importantly, this paper provides a potential framework for combining other feature extraction models and classification algorithms with the proposed method for EEG signals classification. Experiments on single-trial EEG signals from two public competition datasets not only demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in selecting discriminative features and time segment, but also show that the proposed method yields relatively better classification results in comparison with other competitive methods.

The distributed-source model is a common method to estimate neural activity in the brain. The location and amplitude of each active source are estimated by solving the inverse problem by regularization or using Bayesian methods with spatio-temporal constraints. Frequency and spatio-temporal constraints improve the quality of the reconstructed neural activity. However, separation into frequency bands is beneficial when the relevant information is in specific sub-bands. We improved frequency-band identification and preserved good temporal resolution using EEG pre-processing techniques with good frequency band separation and temporal resolution properties. The identified frequency bands were included as constraints in the solution of the inverse problem by decomposing the EEG signals into frequency bands through various methods that offer good frequency and temporal resolution, such as empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform (WT). We present a comparative analysis of the accuracy of brain-source reconstruction using these techniques. The accuracy of the spatial reconstruction was assessed using the Wasserstein metric for real and simulated signals. We approached the mode-mixing problem, inherent to EMD, by exploring three variants of EMD: masking EMD, Ensemble-EMD (EEMD), and multivariate EMD (MEMD). The results of the spatio-temporal brain source reconstruction using these techniques show that masking EMD and MEMD can largely mitigate the mode-mixing problem and achieve a good spatio-temporal reconstruction of the active sources. Masking EMD and EEMD achieved better reconstruction than standard EMD, Multiple Sparse Priors, or wavelet packet decomposition when EMD was used as a pre-processing tool for the spatial reconstruction (averaged over time) of the brain sources. The spatial resolution obtained using all three EMD variants was substantially better than the use of EMD alone, as the mode-mixing problem was mitigated, particularly with masking EMD and EEMD. These findings encourage further exploration into the use of EMD-based pre-processing, the mode-mixing problem, and its impact on the accuracy of brain source activity reconstruction.

Objective/hypothesis: Different phases of the endogenous sensorimotor m-rhythm represent different states of corticospinal excitability, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of always the same high-vs. low-excitability state results in long-term plasticity of different direction. Methods: State-dependent electroencephalography-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) was applied to target the EEG negative vs. positive peak of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm in healthy subjects using a millisecond resolution real-time digital signal processing system. Corticospinal excitability was indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude in a hand muscle. Results: EEG negative vs. positive peak of the endogenous sensorimotor m-rhythm represent high-vs. low-excitability states of corticospinal neurons. More importantly, otherwise identical rTMS (200 triple-pulses at 100 Hz burst frequency and similar to 1 Hz repetition rate), triggered consistently at this high-excitability vs. low-excitability state, leads to long-term potentiation (LTP)-like vs. no change in corticospinal excitability. Conclusions: Findings raise the intriguing possibility that real-time information of instantaneous brain state can be utilized to control efficacy of plasticity induction in humans.

Investigating the Role of Alpha and Beta Rhythms in Functional Motor Networks	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain waves; electroencephalography; functional connectivity; motor imagery; motor network; sensorimotor cortex	DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MU-RHYTHM; CONNECTIVITY PATTERNS; MENTAL SIMULATION; LOW-FREQUENCY; IMAGERY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTION	It is recognized that lower electroencephalography (EEG) frequencies correspond to distributed brain activity over larger spatial regions than higher frequencies and are associated with coordination. In motor processes it has been suggested that this is not always the case. Our objective was to explore this contradiction. In our study, seven healthy subjects performed four motor tasks (execution and imagery of right hand and foot) under EEG recording. Two cortical source models were defined, model "A" with 16 regions of interest (ROIs) and model "B" with 20 ROIs over the sensorimotor cortex. Functional connectivity was calculated by Directed Transfer Function for alpha and beta rhythm networks. Four graph properties were calculated for each network: characteristic path length (CPL), clustering coefficient (CC), density (D) and small-world-ness (SW). Different network modules and in-degrees of nodes were also calculated and depicted in connectivity maps. Analysis of variance was used to determine statistical significance of observed differences in the network properties between tasks, between rhythms and between ROI models. Consistently on both models, CPL and CC were lower and D was higher in beta rhythm networks. No statistically significant difference was observed for SW between rhythms or for any property between tasks on any model. Comparing the models we observed lower CPL for both rhythms, lower CC in alpha and higher CC in beta when the number of ROIs increased. Also, denser networks with higher SW were correlated with higher number of ROIs. We propose a non-exclusive model where alpha rhythm uses greater wiring costs to engage in local information progression while beta rhythm coordinates the neurophysiological processes in sensorimotor tasks.

So far there is a paucity of data on the neurophysiological effects of ATT. In the present study we tested for specific effects to determine if attention control components of ATT elicit a specific signature that is different from passive listening. Thirty-six healthy volunteers were randomized to an active (follow instructions) or control (ignore instructions) condition. Resting state EEG was recorded for 3 min with eyes open and eyes closed before and after exposure to training, and the power of the theta, alpha, and beta-bands were analyzed in frontal, midline, and posterior electrodes. The active ATT condition enhanced alpha and beta-band activity during eyes-open, and frontal alpha during eyes-closed (p < 0.005). Frontoparietal changes in Alpha were generally accompanied by changes in Beta in the same brain regions of interest. However, these associations were largely significant in the active ATT rather than the control condition. No between-group differences were observed in the Theta-band. These results suggest a single dose of attention training increases alpha and beta-oscillations in frontoparietal networks. These networks are associated with top-down attentional or executive control.

The mismatch between subjective reports and objective measures is often referred to as "sleep state misperception." Previous studies evince that this mismatch is found in both patients with insomnia and in normal sleepers, but the neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study is to explore the neurophysiological basis of this mechanism, from the perspective of both EEG power and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) fluctuations. Thirty-six healthy young adults participated in the study. Simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings were conducted while the participants were trying to fall asleep in an MRI scanner at approximately 9: 00 pm. They were awakened after achieving stable N1 or N2 sleep, or after 90 min without falling into stable sleep. Next they were asked to recall their conscious experiences from the moment immediately prior to awakening. Sixty-one instances of scheduled awakenings were collected: 21 of these after having achieved stable stage N2 sleep; 12, during stage N1 sleep; and, 20 during the waking state. Relative to those awakenings without subjective-objective discrepancy (n = 27), these awakenings with discrepancy (n = 14) were associated with lower. power, as well as higher alpha, beta, and gamma power. Moreover, we found that participants who exhibited the discrepancy, compared with those who did not, evinced a higher amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation levels in the prefrontal cortex. These results lend support to the conjecture that the subjective-objective discrepancy is associated with central nervous system hyperarousal.

However, to date no studies have compared neural oscillatory activity in human REM sleep to resting wakefulness with high spatial sampling. In the current study, we evaluated high-resolution topographical changes in neural oscillatory power between both early and late naturalistic REM sleep and resting wakefulness in adult humans. All-night recordings with 256-channel high-density EEG (hd-EEG) were collected in healthy volunteers (N = 12). Topographic analysis revealed that, compared to wake, both the first and last cycle of REM sleep were associated with increased low-frequency oscillations in local central and occipital regions. In contrast, high-frequency activity in both alpha and beta bands (8-20 Hz) was globally decreased during both early and late REM sleep cycles compared to wakefulness. No significant differences in topographic power in any frequency band were observed between REM sleep cycles occurring early and late in the night. We replicated these findings in an independent dataset (N = 33). Together, our findings show that human REM sleep shows consistent topographical changes in oscillatory power across both early and late sleep cycles compared to resting wakefulness.

Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia may come along with the disease. New indicators are necessary for detecting patients that are likely to develop dementia. Electroencephalogram (EEG) Delta responses are one of the essential electrophysiological indicators that could show the cognitive decline. Many research in literature showed an increase of delta responses with the increased cognitive load. Furthermore, delta responses were decreased in MCI and Alzheimer disease in comparison to healthy controls during cognitive paradigms. There was no previous study that analyzed the delta responses in PD patients with cognitive deficits. The present study aims to fulfill this important gap. 32 patients with Parkinson's disease (12 of them were without any cognitive deficits, 10 of them were PD with MCI, and 10 of them were PD with dementia) and 16 healthy subjects were included in the study. Auditory simple stimuli and Auditory Oddball Paradigms were applied. The maximum amplitudes of each subject's delta response (0.5-3.5 Hz) in 0-600 ms were measured for each electrode and for each stimulation. There was a significant stimulation x group effect [F(df = 6; 88 = 3,21; p < 0.015; eta(2)(p) = 0.180], which showed that the difference between groups was specific to the stimulation. Patients with Parkinson's disease (including PD without cognitive deficit, PD with MCI, and PD with dementia) had reduced delta responses than healthy controls upon presentation of target stimulation (p < 0.05, for all comparisons). On the other hand, this was not the case for non-target and simple auditory stimulation. Furthermore, delta responses gradually decrease according to the cognitive impairment in patients with PD. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that cognitive decline in PD could be represented with decreased event related delta responses during cognitive stimulations. Furthermore, the present study once more strengthens the hypothesis that decrease of delta oscillatory responses could be the candidate of a general electrophysiological indicator for cognitive impairment.

J	Chandran, KS; Perumalsamy, M				Chandran, Kalyana Sundaram; Perumalsamy, Marichamy			EEG Based Strategies for Human Gustation Classification Using Spartan6 FPGA	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Gustatory stimuli; IIR filter; SWT; BCI		Gustation is one of the five sensations and is responsible for the inhibition of electrical stimulation, thus reflecting in the overall cortical activity of the brain due to the electrical stimulation. The information processing of gustation are employed for disorder recognition such as Parkinson's disease, etc. and is a source of reimbursement for better clinical diagnosis. EEG signal of gustatory stimulus is preprocessed using IIR band pass filter to remove the artifacts due to noise. The advantage of using IIR filter is the requirement of lesser memory space and works faster than FIR filter. Extraction of features such as Short Time Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform are frequency-domain analysis in which the signal is assumed to be stationary. An algorithm for feature extraction used in the proposed work is Stationary WaveletTransform (SWT) which provides time frequency representation. In time domain, the statistical features of the detailed coefficients are computed and a filtered EEG signal is decomposed using SWT. The statistical features computed here are the mean which is an average of the absolute value of the EEG signal, variance which uses the power of the EEG signal as a feature of the signal and power spectral density. The different gustatory stimuli of bitter, sour and sweet are classified based on the features extracted. Lastly, the feature extraction and preprocessing algorithms are implemented in Spartan6 FPGA kit. The proposed system possesses an advantage of increased computational speed and reduced area utilization compared to existing method.

Changes in Mental Workload and Motor Performance Throughout Multiple Practice Sessions Under Various Levels of Task Difficulty	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mental workload; motor learning; motor performance; EEG; spectral power	WORKING-MEMORY; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES; ATTENTIONAL RESERVE; COGNITIVE WORKLOAD; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; FRONTAL THETA; SELF-CONTROL; EEG ALPHA; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS	The allocation of mental workload is critical to maintain cognitive-motor performance under various demands. While mental workload has been investigated during performance, limited efforts have examined it during cognitive-motor learning, while none have concurrently manipulated task difficulty. It is reasonable to surmise that the difficulty level at which a skill is practiced would impact the rate of skill acquisition and also the rate at which mental workload is reduced during learning (relatively slowed for challenging compared to easier tasks). This study aimed to monitor mental workload by assessing cortical dynamics during a task practiced under two difficulty levels over four days while perceived task demand, performance, and electroencephalography (EEG) were collected. As expected, self-reported mental workload was reduced, greater working memory engagement via EEG theta synchrony was observed, and reduced cortical activation, as indexed by progressive EEG alpha synchrony was detected during practice. Task difficulty was positively related to the magnitude of alpha desynchrony and accompanied by elevations in the theta-alpha ratio. Counter to expectation, the absence of an interaction between task difficulty and practice days for both theta and alpha power indicates that the refinement of mental processes throughout learning occurred at a comparable rate for both levels of difficulty. Thus, the assessment of brain dynamics was sensitive to the rate of change of cognitive workload with practice, but not to the degree of difficulty. Future work should consider a broader range of task demands and additional measures of brain processes to further assess this phenomenon. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Time Course of Brain Network Reconfiguration Supporting Inhibitory Control	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Granger causality; inhibitory control; machine learning; neuronal oscillations; theta; alpha	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT; NEURAL COMMUNICATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; CONFLICT DETECTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GRANGER CAUSALITY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FRONTAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX	Hemodynamic research has recently clarified key nodes and links in brain networks implementing inhibitory control. Although fMRI methods are optimized for identifying the structure of brain networks, the relatively slow temporal course of fMRI limits the ability to characterize network operation. The latter is crucial for developing a mechanistic understanding of how brain networks shift dynamically to support inhibitory control. To address this critical gap, we applied spectrally resolved Granger causality (GC) and random forest machine learning tools to human EEG data in two large samples of adults (test sample n = 96, replication sample n = 237, total N = 333, both sexes) who performed a color-word Stroop task. Time-frequency analysis confirmed that recruitment of inhibitory control accompanied by slower behavioral responses was related to changes in theta and alpha/beta power. GC analyses revealed directionally asymmetric exchanges within frontal and between frontal and parietal brain areas: top-down influence of superior frontal gyrus (SFG) over both dorsal ACC (dACC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dACC control over middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and frontal-parietal exchanges (IFG, precuneus, MFG). Predictive analytics confirmed a combination of behavioral and brain-derived variables as the best set of predictors of inhibitory control demands, with SFG theta bearing higher classification importance than dACC theta and posterior beta tracking the onset of behavioral response. The present results provide mechanistic insight into the biological implementation of a psychological phenomenon: inhibitory control is implemented by dynamic routing processes during which the target response is upregulated via theta-mediated effective connectivity within key PFC nodes and via beta-mediated motor preparation.

Therefore, for BCI and clinical applications, it is very important to remove/reduce these artifacts before EEG signal analysis. Although, EOG-based methods are simple and fast for removing artifacts but their performance, meanwhile, is highly affected by the bidirectional contamination process. Some studies emphasized that the solution to this problem is low-pass filtering EOG signals before using them in artifact removal algorithm but there is still no evidence on the optimal low-pass frequency limits of EOG signals. In this study, we investigated the optimal EOG signal filtering limits using state-of-the-art artifact removal techniques with fifteen artificially contaminated EEG and EOG datasets. In this comprehensive analysis, unfiltered and twelve different low-pass filtering of EOG signals were used with five different algorithms, namely, simple regression, least mean squares, recursive least squares, REGICA, and AIR Results from statistical testing of time and frequency domain metrics suggested that a low-pass frequency between 6 and 8Hz could be used as the most optimal filtering frequency of EOG signals, both to maximally overcome/minimize the effect of bidirectional contamination and to achieve good results from artifact removal algorithms. Furthermore, we also used BCI competition IV datasets to show the efficacy of the proposed framework on real EEG signals. The motor-imagery-based BCI achieved statistically significant high-classification accuracies when artifacts from EEG were removed by using 7Hz low-pass filtering as compared to all other filterings of EOG signals. These results also validated our hypothesis that low-pass filtering should be applied to EOG signals for enhancing the performance of each algorithm before using them for artifact removal process. Moreover, the comparison results indicated that the hybrid algorithms outperformed the performance of single algorithms for both simulated and experimental EEG datasets.	[Mannan, Malik M.

J	Bruers, S; VanRullen, R				Bruers, Sasskia; VanRullen, Rufin			Alpha Power Modulates Perception Independently of Endogenous Factors	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; power; EEG; visual perception; IRF	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; LOCAL ENTRAINMENT; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; PEAK FREQUENCY; HUMAN BRAIN; PHASE; FLUCTUATIONS; EXCITABILITY	Oscillations are ubiquitous in the brain. Alpha oscillations in particular have been proposed to play an important role in sensory perception. Past studies have shown that the power of ongoing EEG oscillations in the alpha band is negatively correlated with visual outcome. Moreover, it also co-varies with other endogenous factors such as attention, vigilance, or alertness. In turn, these endogenous factors influence visual perception. Therefore, it remains unclear how much of the relation between alpha and perception is indirectly mediated by such endogenous factors, and how much reflects a direct causal influence of alpha rhythms on sensory neural processing. We propose to disentangle the direct from the indirect causal routes by introducing modulations of alpha power, independently of any fluctuations in endogenous factors. To this end, we use white-noise sequences to constrain the brain activity of 20 participants. The cross-correlation between the white-noise sequences and the concurrently recorded EEG reveals the impulse response function (IRF), a model of the systematic relationship between stimulation and brain response. These IRFs are then used to reconstruct rather than record the brain activity linked with new random sequences (by convolution). Interestingly, this reconstructed EEG only contains information about oscillations directly linked to the white-noise stimulation; fluctuations in attention and other endogenous factors may still modulate brain alpha rhythms during the task, but our reconstructed EEG is immune to these factors. We found that the detection of near-perceptual threshold targets embedded within these new white-noise sequences depended on the power of the similar to 10Hz reconstructed EEG over parieto-occipital channels. Around the time of presentation, higher power led to poorer performance. Thus, fluctuations in alpha power, induced here by random luminance sequences, can directly influence perception: the relation between alpha power and perception is not a mere consequence of fluctuations in endogenous factors.

While language has been demonstrated to be a correlate of FBU, there is still controversy about the extent to which a specific aspect of language, complementation syntax, is a necessary condition for FBU. The present study tested an important notion from the debate proposing that complementation syntax task is redundant to FBU measures. Specifically, we examined electrophysiological correlates of false belief, false complementation, and their respective true conditions in adults using electroencephalography (EEG), focusing on indices of oscillatory brain activity and large-scale connectivity. The results showed strong modulation of parieto-occipital alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-20 Hz) power by the experimental manipulations, with heightened sustained alpha power reflective of effortful internal processing observed in the false compared to the true conditions and reliable beta power reductions sensitive to mentalizing and/or syntactic demands in the belief versus the complementation conditions. In addition, higher coupling between parieto-occipital regions and widespread frontal sites in the beta band was found for the false-belief condition selectively. The result of divergence in beta oscillatory activity and in connectivity between false belief and false complementation does not support the redundancy hypothesis.	[Guan, Yao; Farrar, M.

MethodsResting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 16 electrodes in 35 poststroke depressed, 24 poststroke nondepressed, and 35 age-matched healthy control subjects were analyzed by means of spectral power analysis, a quantitative EEG measurement of different frequency bands. The relationship among depressed mood, functional status, lesion side, and poststroke time was assessed by using variance and Spearman correlation analysis. Multiple analysis of variance was used to compare the differences among the 3 groups. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to establish a regression model to predict depressed mood in stroke subjects and to explore the association between depression and EEG band power. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to estimate the ability of spectral power selected by binary logistic regression to indicate depressed mood in stroke subjects. ResultsWe found that the hemisphere in which the lesion was located and the time since stroke onset had no effect on depressed mood. Only the patient's functional status was related to emotional symptoms. Quantitative EEG analysis revealed increased delta, theta, and beta2 power in stroke subjects with depressed mood, particularly in temporal regions. The theta and beta2 power in the right temporal area were shown to be highly sensitive to depressed mood, and these parameters showed good discriminatory ability for depressed subjects following stroke. ConclusionDepressed mood after stroke is associated with functional status. Quantitative EEG parameters may be a useful tool in timely screening for depressed mood after stroke.

Sleep scoring or sleep staging is the process of classifying various sleep stages which helps to detect the quality of sleep. The identification of sleep stages using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an arduous task. Just by looking at an EEG signal, one cannot determine the sleep stages precisely. Sleep specialists may make errors in identifying sleep stages by visual inspection. To mitigate the erroneous identification and to reduce the burden on doctors, a computer-aided EEG based system can be deployed in the hospitals, which can help identify the sleep stages, correctly. Several automated systems based on the analysis of polysomnographic (PSG) signals have been proposed. A few sleep stage scoring systems using EEG signals have also been proposed. But, still there is a need for a robust and accurate portable system developed using huge dataset. In this study, we have developed a new single-channel EEG based sleep-stages identification system using a novel set of wavelet-based features extracted from a large EEG dataset. We employed a novel three-band time-frequency localized (TBTFL) wavelet filter bank (FB). The EEG signals are decomposed using three-level wavelet decomposition, yielding seven sub-bands (SBs). This is followed by the computation of discriminating features namely, log-energy (LE), signal-fractal-dimensions (SFD), and signal-sample-entropy (SSE) from all seven SBs. The extracted features are ranked and fed to the support vector machine (SVM) and other supervised learning classifiers. In this study, we have considered five different classification problems (CPs), (two-class (CP-1), three-class (CP-2), four-class (CP-3), five-class (CP-4) and six-class (CP-5)). The proposed system yielded accuracies of 98.3%, 93.9%, 92.1%, 91.7%, and 91.5% for CP-1 to CP-5, respectively, using 10-fold cross validation (CV) technique.

Animal model that exhibit simplistic representations of such networks open a doorway for such investigations and are gaining rapid popularity. In this study, we investigate and compare resting state network and auditory stimulus related activity with minimal invasive technology along computational spectral analysis on a C57/BL6 based mouse model. Somatosensory, motor and visual cortex are observed to be highly active and significantly correlated (p-value<0.05). Moreover, given the spatial limitation due to small size of the mouse head, we also describe a low-cost and effective fabrication process for the mouse EEG Polyimide Based Microelectrodes (PBM) array. The easy-to-implement fabrication process involves transfer of the pattern on a copper layer of the Kapton film followed by gold electroplating and application of insulation paint. Acoustic stimulation is done by using tube extensions for avoiding electrical coupling to EEG signals. Unlike multi-electrode array type of invasive methods that are local to a cortical region, the methods established in this study can be used for examining functional connectivity analysis, neural dynamics and cortical response at a global level.

J	Nyhus, E				Nyhus, Erika			Brain Networks Related to Beta Oscillatory Activity during Episodic Memory Retrieval	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED FMRI; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; UNWANTED MEMORIES; FUNCTIONAL MRI	Evidence from fMRI has consistently located a widespread network of frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe regions during episodic retrieval. However, the temporal limitations of the fMRI methodology have made it difficult to assess the transient network dynamics by which these distributed regions coordinate activity. Recent evidence suggests that beta oscillations (17-20 Hz) are important for top-down control for memory suppression. However, the spatial limitations of the EEG methodology make it difficult to assess the relationship between these oscillatory signals and the distributed networks identified with fMRI. This study used simultaneous EEG/fMRI to identify networks related to beta oscillations during episodic retrieval. Participants studied adjectives and either imagined a scene (Place Task) or judged its pleasantness (Pleasant Task). During the recognition test, participants decided which task was performed with each word (Old Place Task or Old Pleasant Task) or New. EEG results revealed that posterior beta power was greater for new than old words. fMRI results revealed activity in a frontal, parietal network that was greater for old than new words, consistent with prior studies. Although overall beta power increases correlated with decreased activity within a predominantly parietal network, within the right dorsolateral and ventrolateral pFC, beta power correlated with BOLD activity more under conditions requiring more cognitive control and EEG/fMRI effects in the right frontal cortex correlated with BOLD activity in a frontoparietal network. Therefore, using simultaneous EEG and fMRI, the present results suggest that beta oscillations are related to postretrieval control operations in the right frontal cortex and act within a broader postretrieval control network.

Relationships between alpha oscillations during speech preparation and the listener N400 ERP to the produced speech	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORD; PREDICTION; SENTENCES; COMPONENT; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS	While previous studies separately demonstrate EEG spectral modulations during speech preparation and ERP responses to the listened speech, it is unclear whether these responses are related on a trial-by-trial basis between a speaker and listener. In order to determine whether these responses are related in real-time, Electroencephalography (EEG) responses were measured simultaneously within a speaker and listener using a 24 electrode Mobile EEG system (18 participants; 9 pairs) during a sentence completion task. Each trial consisted of a sentence prompt with an incomplete ending (e.g. "I took my dog for a _"). The speaker was instructed to fill in the ending with something expected (e.g. "walk") (40 trials) or unexpected (e.g. "drink") (40 trials). The other participant listened to the speaker throughout the block. We found that lower alpha band activity was reduced when individuals prepared unexpected sentence endings compared to expected sentence endings. Greater reductions in the speaker's lower alpha activity during response preparation were correlated with a more negative N400 response in the listener to the unexpected word. These findings demonstrate that alpha suppression and the N400 ERP effect are present within a hyperscanning context and they are correlated between the speaker and listener during sentence completion.

Little is known about such cortical variations in semantic priming tasks where target words are matched with preceding sensory object cues. Here, two visually presented target words ("pear" and "lilac") were repeatedly cued by corresponding odors or pictures, and the participants were to indicate matching or nonmatching combinations. Data were split in behaviorally "fast" versus "slow" trials. We hypothesized that slow trials would be associated with higher prestimulus alpha activity and reduced ERP amplitudes, and that response-time differences between odor-cued and picture-cued trials would be especially large in slow behavioral trials. Results confirmed that slow trials showed increased alpha-band activity prior to word target onset, as well as amplitude decreases in the sensory P1 and semantic N400 components. However, no interactions between cue-modality and processing speed were observed. Instead, odor-cue integration responses were uniquely delayed on incongruent trials, a novel behavioral effect that was not observed in EEG measures. The results show that semantic integration speed is reflected in cortical activity before and during stimulus processing. Behavioral interactions with cue modality did not correspond to observed cortical activity changes, perhaps because olfactory circuits are not readily observed in scalp-recorded EEG. We conclude that combining behavioral speed variability and cortical EEG measures is useful in understanding the fluctuating nature of cognitive processing sequences.

In this paper, machine learning methods are used to model a relationship using the publicly available dataset SEED (SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset) which contains EEG signals of 15 participants recorded when excited to video stimuli. The signal processing techniques in time domain and time-frequency domain (Wavelet analysis) are used to extract the desired features. The discrete wavelet transforms are used to extract frequency bands. The features such as Statistical features, Hjorth parameters, differential entropy, and the combination on symmetric electrodes (differential asymmetry DASM and rational asymmetry RASM) are extracted. Artificial neural networks and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are applied on the feature set to develop prediction models to extract the emotion information carried by the participant from emotional characteristics exhibited in different frequency bands. These models are evaluated on the dataset and emotions are classified using ANN into three different states such as positive, negative and neutral states with an accuracy of 91.2%.											11	5	5	0	1	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-530X	2191-5318	978-981-10-6698-6; 978-981-10-6697-9	SPRINGERBR APPL SCI			2018							101	112		10.1007/978-981-10-6698-6_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-6698-6_10	10.1007/978-981-10-6653-5		12	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Multidisciplinary Sciences	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics	BK6NC					2022-08-02	WOS:000440592300010

The GFS method has been introduced to measure functional synchronization of EEG data in the frequency domain. GFS also detects phase interactions between EEG signals acquired from all of the electrodes. If a considerable amount of local brain neurons has the same phase, these neurons appear to interact with each other. EEG data were received from 17 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and 17 healthy controls (HC). OCD effects on local and large-scale brain circuits were studied. Analysis of the GFS results showed significantly decreased values in the delta and full frequency bands. This research suggests that OCD causes synchronization disconnection in both the frontal and large-scale regions. This may be related to motivational, emotional and cognitive dysfunctions.

In this paper, we adopted Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA) to study the amplitude-modulated (AM) and frequency-modulated (FM) components in sensorimotor Mu rhythm induced by slow-and fast-rate repetitive movements. The HHSA-based approach is a two-layer empirical mode decomposition architecture, which firstly decomposes the EEG signal into a series of frequency-modulated intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and then decomposes each frequency-modulated IMF into a set of amplitude-modulated IMFs. With the HHSA, the FM and AM components were incorporated with their instantaneous power to achieve f ull-informational spectral analysis. We observed that the instantaneous power induced by slow-rate movements was significantly higher than that induced by fast-rate movements (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The alpha-band AM frequencies induced by slow-rate movements were higher than those induced by fast-rate movements, while no statistical difference was found in beta-band AM frequencies. In addition, to study the functional coupling between the primary sensorimotor area and other brain regions, spectral coherence was applied and statistical difference was found in frontal area in slow-rate versus fast-rate movements. The discrepancy between slow- and fast-rate movements might be due to the change of motor functional modes from a default mode network to automatic timing with the increase of movement rates. The use of HHSA for oscillatory activity analysis can be an efficient tool to provide informative interaction among different frequency bands.

Due to its role in maintaining mandibular posture, tonic activity of temporalis muscle interferes with the EEG signal particularly at fronto-temporal locations at single motor unit (SMU) level. By obtaining surface representation of a motor unit, we can evaluate its interference in EEG and if we could sum surface representations of several tonically active motor units, we could estimate the overall myogenic contamination in EEG. Therefore, in this study, we followed re-composition (RC) approach and generated EEG-like artefact model using surface representations of single motor units (RC). Furthermore, we compared signal characteristics of RC signals with simultaneously recorded EEG signal at different locations in terms of power spectral density and coherence. First, we found that RC signal represented the power spectral distribution of an EMG signal. Second, RC signal reflected the discharge rate of a SMU giving the greatest surface representation amplitude and strongest interference appeared as distinguishable frequency peak on RC power spectra. Moreover, for strong interferences, RC also contaminated the EEG at F7 and other EEG electrodes. These findings are important to illustrate the susceptibility of EEG signal to myogenic artefacts even at rest and the research using EEG coherence comparisons should consider muscle activity while drawing conclusions about neuronal interactions and oscillations.

These artifacts are usually addressed in a preprocessing phase that attempts to remove them or minimize their impact. This paper offers a set of useful techniques for this purpose: robust detrending, robust rereferencing, outlier detection, data interpolation (inpainting), step removal, and filter ringing artifact removal. These techniques provide a less wasteful alternative to discarding corrupted trials or channels, and they are relatively immune to artifacts that disrupt alternative approaches such as filtering. Robust detrending allows slow drifts and common mode signals to be factored out while avoiding the deleterious effects of glitches. Robust rereferencing reduces the impact of artifacts on the reference. Inpainting allows corrupt data to be interpolated from intact parts based on the correlation structure estimated over the intact parts. Outlier detection allows the corrupt parts to be identified. Step removal fixes the high-amplitude flux jump artifacts that are common with some MEG systems. Ringing removal allows the ringing response of the antialiasing filter to glitches (steps, pulses) to be suppressed. The performance of the methods is illustrated and evaluated using synthetic data and data from real EEG and MEG systems. These methods, which are mainly automatic and require little tuning, can greatly improve the quality of the data.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability with symptoms that include increased anxiety, social and sensory processing deficits. Recent EEG studies in humans with FXS have identified neural oscillation deficits that include enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced inter-trial coherence of sound evoked gamma oscillations. To determine if analogous phenotypes are present in an animal model of FXS, we recorded EEGs in awake, freely moving Fmr1 knock out (KO) mice using similar stimuli as in the human studies. We report remarkably similar neural oscillation phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO mouse including enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced evoked gamma synchronization. The gamma band inter-trial coherence of neural response was reduced in both auditory and frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice stimulated with a sound whose envelope was modulated from 1 to 100 Hz, similar to that seen in humans with FXS. These deficits suggest a form of enhanced 'resting state noise' that interferes with the ability of the circuit to mount a synchronized response to sensory input, predicting specific sensory and cognitive deficits in FXS. The abnormal gamma oscillations are consistent with parvalbumin neuron and perineuronal net deficits seen in the Fmr1 KO mouse auditory cortex indicating that the EEG biomarkers are not only clinically relevant, but could also be used to probe cellular and circuit mechanisms of sensory hypersensitivity in FXS.

J	Wallroth, R; Hochenberger, R; Ohla, K				Wallroth, Raphael; Hoechenberger, Richard; Ohla, Kathrin			Delta activity encodes taste information in the human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Gustation; Taste quality; EEG; MVPA; Delta	GUSTATORY CORTEX; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG-DATA; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONY; PHASE; TIME; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; MECHANISMS	The categorization of food via sensing nutrients or toxins is crucial to the survival of any organism. On ingestion, rapid responses within the gustatory system are required to identify the oral stimulus to guide immediate behavior (swallowing or expulsion). The way in which the human brain accomplishes this task has so far remained unclear. Using multivariate analysis of 64-channel scalp EEG recordings obtained from 16 volunteers during tasting salty, sweet, sour, or bitter solutions, we found that activity in the delta-frequency range (1-4 Hz; delta power and phase) has information about taste identity in the human brain, with discriminable response patterns at the single-trial level within 130 ms of tasting. Importantly, the latencies of these response patterns predicted the point in time at which participants indicated detection of a taste by pressing a button. Furthermore, taste pattern discrimination was independent of motor-related activation and encoded taste identity rather than other taste features such as intensity and valence. On comparison with our previous findings from a delayed taste-discrimination task (Crouzet et al., 2015), taste-specific neural representations emerged earlier during this speeded taste-detection task, suggesting a goal-dependent flexibility in gustatory response coding. Together, these findings provide the first evidence of a role of delta activity in taste-information coding in humans. Crucially, these neuronal response patterns can be linked to the speed of simple gustatory perceptual decisions - a vital performance index of nutrient sensing.

Ictal connectivity in childhood absence epilepsy: Associations with outcome	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						absence epilepsy; fMRI; magnetoencephalography	IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSIES; WAVE DISCHARGES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EEG-FMRI; SEIZURES; ETHOSUXIMIDE; NETWORKS; OSCILLATIONS; VOLUMES; BRAIN	ObjectiveThe understanding of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) has been revolutionized over the past decade, but the biological mechanisms responsible for variable treatment outcomes are unknown. Our purpose in this prospective observational study was to determine how pretreatment ictal network pathways, defined using a combined electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) effective connectivity analysis, were related to treatment response. MethodsSixteen children with newly diagnosed and drug-naive CAE had 31 typical absence seizures during EEG-fMRI and 74 during MEG. The spatial extent of the pretreatment ictal network was defined using fMRI hemodynamic response with an event-related independent component analysis (eICA). This spatially defined pretreatment ictal network supplied prior information for MEG-effective connectivity analysis calculated using phase slope index (PSI). Treatment outcome was assessed 2years following diagnosis and dichotomized to ethosuximide (ETX)-treatment responders (N=11) or nonresponders (N=5). Effective connectivity of the pretreatment ictal network was compared to the treatment response. ResultsPatterns of pretreatment connectivity demonstrated strongest connections in the thalamus and posterior brain regions (parietal, posterior cingulate, angular gyrus, precuneus, and occipital) at delta frequencies and the frontal cortices at gamma frequencies (P<.05). ETX treatment nonresponders had pretreatment connectivity, which was decreased in the precuneus region and increased in the frontal cortex compared to ETX responders (P<.05). SignificancePretreatment ictal connectivity differences in children with CAE were associated with response to antiepileptic treatment. This is a possible mechanism for the variable treatment response seen in patients sharing the same epilepsy syndrome.

Specific oscillations occur between seizures in patients and in animal models of focal epilepsy, and thus, they are termed interictal. According to their shape and intrinsic signal frequency, interictal oscillations are classified as spikes and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). Interictal spikes are recorded in the 'wideband' EEG signal and consist of large-amplitude events that usually last less than 1 s; HFOs, in contrast, are extracted by amplifying the appropriately filtered EEG signal and are usually categorized as ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz). Interictal spikes and HFOs are used in clinical practice to localize the seizure onset zone in focal epileptic disorders, which is fundamental for performing successful surgical interventions in epileptic patients not responding to anti-epileptic drug therapy. Both types of interictal oscillations have been widely studied in animal models of focal epilepsy to identify the mechanisms underlying their generation as well as to establish their role in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. In this review, we will address the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of interictal spikes and HFOs in animal models of epileptiform synchronization and of focal epilepsy. Moreover, we will highlight in vitro and in vivo evidence indicating that these interictal oscillations mirror specific, dynamic changes in neuronal network excitability causing seizure generation (i.e. ictogenesis) and leading to a chronic epileptic condition (i.e. epileptogenesis).

With increased focus on detecting the anesthesia states of patients in the course of surgery, more attention has been paid to analyzing the power spectra and entropy measures of EEG signal during anesthesia. In this paper, by using the relative power of EEG frequency bands and the EEG entropy measures, a new method for detecting the depth of anesthesia states has been presented based on the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. EEG signals were recorded from 20 patients before, during and after general anesthesia in the operating room at a sampling rate of 200Hz. Then, 12 features were extracted from each EEG segment, 10s in length, which are used for anesthesia state monitoring. No significant difference was observed (p>0.05) between these features and the bispectral index (BIS), which is the commonly used measure of anesthetic effect. The used LS-SVM classifier based method is able to identify the anesthesia states with an accuracy of 80% with reference to the BIS index. Since the underlying equation of the utilized LS-SVM is linear, the computational time of the algorithm is not significant and therefore it can be used for online application in operation rooms.

Two-Dimensional Temporal Clustering Analysis for Patients with Epilepsy: Detecting Epilepsy-Related Information in EEG-fMRI Concordant, Discordant and Spike-Less Patients	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Epilepsy; 2dTCA; EEG-fMRI; Interictal epileptiform discharges	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FOCAL EPILEPSY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; LOBE EPILEPSY; ARTIFACT; RESPONSES; SCANNER	EEG acquired simultaneously with fMRI (EEG-fMRI) is a multimodal method that has shown promise in mapping the seizure onset zone in patients with focal epilepsy. However, there are many instances when this method is unsuccessful or not applicable, and other data driven fMRI methods may be utilized. One such method is the two-dimensional temporal clustering analysis (2dTCA). In this study we compared the classic EEG-fMRI and 2dTCA performance in mapping regions related to the seizure onset region in 18 focal epilepsy patients (12 presenting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), during EEG-fMRI acquisition) with Engel I or II surgical outcome. Activation maps of both 2dTCA timing outputs (positive and negative histograms) and EEG detected IEDs were computed and compared to the region of epilepsy surgical resection. Patients were evaluated in three categories based on frequency of EEG detected spiking during the MRI. EEG-fMRI maps were concordant to the epilepsy region in 5/12 subjects, four with frequent IEDs on EEG. The 2dTCA was successful in mapping 13/18 patients including 3/6 with no IEDs detected (10/12 with IEDs detected). The epilepsy-related activities were successfully mapped by both methods in only 4/12 patients. This work suggests that the epilepsy-related information detected by each method may be different: while EEG-fMRI is more accurate in patients with high rather than lower numbers of EEG detected IEDs; 2dTCA can be useful in evaluating patients even when no concurrent EEG spikes are detected or EEG-fMRI is not effective. Therefore, our results support that 2dTCA might be an alternative for mapping epilepsy-related BOLD activity in negative EEG-fMRI (6/7 patients) and spike-less patients.

Doctors perform different experiments to detect the epilepsy and type of' it. Most common and the hest way to epilepsy detection is analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this paper, we present a new method for classifying the brain activities in order to detect epilepsy seizures. The proposed method is based on time-frequency analysis of EEG signals using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). At first, four level SWI' of EEG signal is obtained and then the coefficients are down-sampled with factor 2. After that, the local binary pattern (LBP) of the obtained coefficients are calculated and LBP coefficients are modeled with GARCH model. The parameters of GARCH model construct the feature vector and K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used for classification. Results show that our proposed method has the better classification accuracy than the recently proposed methods.

Excessive cortical synchrony within neural ensembles has been implicated as an important mechanism driving epileptiform activity. The current study measures and compares background electroencephalographic (EEG) phase synchronization in patients having various types of epilepsies and healthy controls during awake and sleep stages. Methods. A total of 120 patients with epilepsy (PWE) subdivided into 3 groups (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy [JME], temporal lobe epilepsy [TLE], and extra-temporal lobe epilepsy [Ex-TLE]; n = 40 in each group) and 40 healthy controls were subjected to overnight polysomnography. EEG phase synchronization (SI) between the 8 EEG channels was assessed for delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and high beta frequency bands using ensemble measure on 10-second representative time windows and compared between patients and controls and also between awake and sleep stages. Mean +/- SD of SI was compared using 2-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise comparison (P .05). Results. In both delta and theta bands, the SI was significantly higher in patients with JME, TLE, and Ex-TLE compared with controls, whereas in alpha, sigma, and high beta bands, SI was comparable between the groups. On comparison of SI between sleep stages, delta band: progressive increase in SI from wake double right arrow N1 double right arrow N2 double right arrow N3, whereas REM (rapid eye movement) was comparable to wake; theta band: decreased SI during N2 and increase during N3; alpha band: SI was highest in wake and lower in N1, N2, N3, and REM; and sigma and high beta bands: progressive increase in SI from wake double right arrow N1 double right arrow N2 double right arrow N3; however, sigma band showed lower SI during REM. Conclusion. This study found an increased background cortical synchronization in PWE compared with healthy controls in delta and theta bands during wake and sleep. This background hypersynchrony may be an important property of epileptogenic brain circuitry in PWE, which enables them to effortlessly generate a paroxysmal EEG depolarization shift.

Electrophysiological approaches in the study of cognitive development outside the lab	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL; EEG; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; ERP	The use of human neuroimaging technology provides knowledge about several emotional and cognitive processes at the neural level of organization. In particular, electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques allow researchers to explore high-temporal resolution of the neural activity that underlie the dynamics of cognitive processes. Although EEG research has been mostly applied in laboratory settings, recently a low-cost, portable EEG apparatus was released, which allows exploration of different emotional and cognitive processes during every-day activities. We compared a wide range of EEG measures using both a low-cost portable and a high-quality laboratory system. EEG recordings were done with both systems while participants performed an active task (Go/NoGo) and during their resting-state. Results showed similar waveforms in terms of morphology and amplitude of the ERPs, and comparable effects between conditions of the applied Go/NoGo paradigm. In addition, the contribution of each frequency to the entire EEG was not significantly different during resting-state, and fluctuations in amplitude of oscillations showed long-range temporal correlations. These results showed that low-cost, portable EEG technology can provide an alternative of enough quality for measuring brain activity outside a laboratory setting, which could contribute to the study of different populations in more ecological contexts.

Nevertheless, an automatic discrimination of transitive (i.e., actions involving an object) and intransitive (i.e., meaningful gestures that do not include the use of objects) imaginary actions using EEG dynamics has not been performed yet. In this study we exploit measures of EEG spectra to automatically discern between imaginary transitive and intransitive movements of the upper limb. To this end, nonlinear support vector machine algorithms are used to properly combine EEG-derived features, while a recursive feature elimination procedure highlights the most discriminant cortical regions and associated EEG frequency oscillations. Results show the significance of gamma (30-45Hz) oscillations over the fronto-occipital and ipsilateral-parietal areas for the automatic classification of transitive-intransitive imaginary upper limb movements with a satisfactory accuracy of 70.97%.

However, the beta band is very broad and smaller frequency bands may improve accuracy. Objective: In the present study, we wanted to investigate whether it was possible to find any differences between pMCI and sMCI using relative power and whether these differences were correlated to cognitive function or neuropathology markers. Methods: 17 patients with AD, 27 patients with MCI, and 38 older healthy controls were recruited from two memory clinics and followed for three years. EEGs were recorded at baseline for all participants and relative power was calculated. All participants underwent adjusted batteries of standardized cognitive tests and lumbar puncture. Results: We found that pMCI showed decreased baseline relative power in the parietal electrodes in the beta1 band (13-17.99 Hz). At 2-year follow-up, we found changes in all baseline beta bands but most pronounced in the beta1 band. In addition, we found that qEEG parietal power was correlated with amyloid-beta(42) and anterograde memory. Conclusion: These findings suggests that relative power in the parietal electrodes in the beta1 band may be a better way to discriminate between pMCI and sMCI at the time of diagnosis than the broad beta band. Similar findings have also been found with resting state fMRI. In addition, we found that anterograde memory was correlated to qEEG parietal beta1 power.

However, the brain is a system operating on multiple time scales, and characterization of dynamics across time scales remains a challenge. One framework to study such dynamics is that of fractal geometry; and currently there exist several methods for the study of brain dynamics using fractal geometry. We aim to highlight some of the practical challenges of applying fractal geometry to brain dynamics-and as a putative feature for machine learning applications, and propose solutions to enable its wider use in neuroscience. Using intracranially recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and simulated data, we compared monofractal and multifractal methods with regards to their sensitivity to signal variance. We found that both monofractal and multifractal properties correlate closely with signal variance, thus not being a useful feature of the signal. However, after applying an epoch-wise standardization procedure to the signal, we found that multifractal measures could offer non-redundant information compared to signal variance, power (in different frequency bands) and other established EEG signal measures. We also compared different multifractal estimation methods to each other in terms of reliability, and we found that the Chhabra-Jensen algorithm performed best. Finally, we investigated the impact of sampling frequency and epoch length on the estimation of multifractal properties. Using epileptic seizures as an example event in the EEG, we show that there may be an optimal time scale (i.e., combination of sampling frequency and epoch length) for detecting temporal changes in multifractal properties around seizures. The practical issues we highlighted and our suggested solutions should help in developing robust methods for the application of fractal geometry in EEG signals. Our analyses and observations also aid the theoretical understanding of the multifractal properties of the brain and might provide grounds for new discoveries in the study of brain signals. These could be crucial for the understanding of neurological function and for the developments of new treatments.	[Franca, Lucas G.

Measurement of insight is based on self-report scales, which are limited due to subjectivity. This study aimed to determine the correlation between resting state beta and gamma power in 23 patients with schizophrenia and insight. It was observed that as beta and gamma power measured via qualitative electroencephalography (qEEG) increased the level of insight decreased. Negative correlation was found in F3, C3, Cz for gamma activity and in F3 and C3 for beta activity. This finding indicates that resting state qEEG could be used to evaluate the level of insight in patients with schizophrenia.

This mnemonic process is thought to be mediated by thalamocortical spindle activity during NREM-stage2 sleep episodes as well as changes in striatal and hippocampal activity. However, direct experimental evidence supporting the contribution of such sleep-dependent physiological mechanisms to motor memory consolidation in humans is lacking. In the present study, we combined EEG and fMRI sleep recordings following practice of a motor sequence learning (MSL) task to determine whether spindle oscillations support sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation by transiently synchronizing and coordinating specialized cortical and subcortical networks. To that end, we conducted EEG source reconstruction on spindle epochs in both cortical and subcortical regions using novel deep-source localization techniques. Coherence-based metrics were adopted to estimate functional connectivity between cortical and subcortical structures over specific frequency bands. Our findings not only confirm the critical and functional role of NREM-stage2 sleep spindles in motor skill consolidation, but provide first-time evidence that spindle oscillations [11-17 Hz] may be involved in sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation by locally reactivating and functionally binding specific taskrelevant cortical and subcortical regions within networks including the hippocampus, putamen, thalamus and motor-related cortical regions.

Here, we examined the neural oscillation correlates of WM updating and of the control processes involved in gating. The reference-back paradigm was employed to manipulate gate opening, gate closing, and updating independently and examine how the control functions involved in these processes are mapped to oscillatory EEG activity. The results established that different oscillatory patterns were associated with the control process related to gate opening than in gate closing. During the time of gate closing, a relative increase in theta power was observed over midfrontal electrodes. This theta response is a known EEG signature of cognitive control that is proposed here to reflect reactive conflict resolution, achieved by closing the gate when facing irrelevant information. On the other hand, proactive gate opening in preparation for relevant information was associated with an increase in relative delta power over parietal-occipital electrodes. Finally, WM updating was associated with relative increase in delta power over midfrontal electrodes, suggesting a functional role of delta oscillations in WM updating.

J	Segaert, K; Mazaheri, A; Hagoort, P				Segaert, Katrien; Mazaheri, Ali; Hagoort, Peter			Binding language: structuring sentences through precisely timed oscillatory mechanisms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha and beta oscillations; EEG; language; syntactic binding	SYNTACTIC WORKING-MEMORY; BROCAS AREA; COMPREHENSION; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; ALPHA; INFORMATION; UNIFICATION; RETRIEVAL; RESPONSES	Syntactic binding refers to combining words into larger structures. Using EEG, we investigated the neural processes involved in syntactic binding. Participants were auditorily presented two-word sentences (i.e. pronoun and pseudoverb such as I grush' and she grushes', for which syntactic binding can take place) and wordlists (i.e. two pseudoverbs such as pob grush' and pob grushes', for which no binding occurs). Comparing these two conditions, we targeted syntactic binding while minimising contributions of semantic binding and of other cognitive processes such as working memory. We found a converging pattern of results using two distinct analysis approaches: one approach using frequency bands as defined in previous literature, and one data-driven approach in which we looked at the entire range of frequencies between 3 and 30Hz without the constraints of pre-defined frequency bands. In the syntactic binding (relative to the wordlist) condition, a power increase was observed in the alpha and beta frequency range shortly preceding the presentation of the target word that requires binding, which was maximal over frontal-central electrodes. Our interpretation is that these signatures reflect that language comprehenders expect the need for binding to occur. Following the presentation of the target word in a syntactic binding context (relative to the wordlist condition), an increase in alpha power maximal over a left-lateralised cluster of frontal-temporal electrodes was observed. We suggest that this alpha increase relates to syntactic binding taking place. Taken together, our findings suggest that increases in alpha and beta power are reflections of distinct the neural processes underlying syntactic binding.

CARE-rCortex: A Matlab toolbox for the analysis of CArdio-REspiratory-related activity in the Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Cardio-respiratory event-related potentials; Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD); Event-Related Synchronization (ERS)	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; TOPOGRAPHY; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; HUMANS	Background: Although cardio-respiratory (CR) system is generally controlled by the autonomic nervous system, interactions between the cortex and these primary functions are receiving an increasing interest in neurosciences. New method: In general, the timing of such internally paced events (e.g. heartbeats or respiratory cycles) may display a large variability. For the analysis of such CR event-related EEG potentials, a baseline must be correctly associated to each cycle of detected events. The open-source toolbox CARE-rCortex provides an easy-to-use interface to detect CR events, define baselines, and analyse in time-frequency (TF) domain the CR-based EEG potentials. Results: CARE-rCortex provides some practical tools to detect and validate these CR events. Users can define baselines time-locked to a phase of respiratory or heart cycle. A statistical test has also been integrated to highlight significant points of the TF maps with respect to the baseline. We illustrate the use of CARE-rCortex with the analysis of two real cardio-respiratory datasets. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to other open-source toolboxes, CARE-rCortex allows users to automatically detect CR events, to define and check baselines for each detected event. Different baseline normalizations can be used in the TF analysis of EEG epochs. Conclusions: The analysis of CR-related EEG activities could provide valuable information about cognitive or pathological brain states. CARE-rCortex runs in Matlab as a plug-in of the EEGLAB software, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/FannyGrosselin/CARE-rCortex.

Beta-band oscillations in the supplementary motor cortex are modulated by levodopa and associated with functional activity in the basal ganglia	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Ballistic movements; Levodopa; EEG; Supplementary motor area; fMRI	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; NAIVE PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; MOVEMENT; AREA; BRADYKINESIA; ACTIVATION	We investigated the effect of acute levodopa administration on movement-related cortical oscillations and movement velocity in Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients with PD on and off medication and age-and sex-matched healthy controls performed a ballistic upper limb flexion movement as fast and accurately as possible while cortical oscillations were recorded with high-density electroencephalography. Patients off medication were also studied using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a force control paradigm. Percent signal change of functional activity during the force control task was calculated for the putamen and subthalamic nucleus (STN) contralateral to the hand tested. We found that patients with PD off medication had an exaggerated movement-related beta-band (13-30 Hz) desynchronization in the supplementary motor area (SMA) compared to controls. In PD, spectral power in the beta-band was correlated with movement velocity. Following an acute dose of levodopa, we observed that the beta-band desynchronization in the SMA was reduced in PD, and was associated with increased movement velocity and increased voltage of agonist muscle activity. Further, using fMRI we found that the functional activity in the putamen and STN in the off medication state, was related to how responsive that cortical oscillations in the SMA of PD were to levodopa. Collectively, these findings provide the first direct evaluation of how movement-related cortical oscillations relate to movement velocity during the ballistic phase of movement in PD and demonstrate that functional brain activity in the basal ganglia pathways relate to the effects of dopaminergic medication on cortical neuronal oscillations during movement.

They are observed in several areas of the hippocampus and in parahippocampal structures. Theta oscillations play important roles in modulating synaptic plasticity during memory and learning; moreover, they are dependent on septal cholinergic inputs. Theta oscillations can be reproduced in vitro in several regions of the temporal lobe in the absence of the septum by employing the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh). Here, we review the mechanisms underlying CCh-induced theta oscillations. We address: (i) the ability of temporal lobe neuronal networks to oscillate independently at theta frequency during CCh treatment; (ii) the contribution of intrinsic ionic currents; (iii) the participation of principal cells and interneurons; and (iv) their pharmacological profiles. We also discuss the similarities between CCh-induced theta oscillations and physiological type II theta activity, as well as their roles in synaptic plasticity. Finally, we consider experimental evidence pointing to the contribution of spontaneous and CCh-induced theta activity to epileptiform synchronization.

Here we investigated whether the resting brain with eyes-close state was more likely a critical state than eyes-open state by using EEG recording technique and subsequent frequency domain analysis. EEGs of 26 healthy subjects (mean age +/- SD 21.54 +/- 3.70) during eyes-close and eyes-open state were collected. Then we analyzed the power law distribution of cascades size and duration and calculated the branch parameter of the EEG data in frequency domain. We found the critical exponent of cascade size and cascade duration of eyes-close state were consistently lower than that in the eyes-open state for different time-windows, and the branch parameter showed consistent results. The critical exponents of the distributed avalanche sizes and durations during eyes-close state were observed around -1.5 and -2 respectively for a certain time window, correspondingly, the branch parameter was approached 1. This indicated that the brain activity dynamic of eyes-close state was more likely around criticality, while eyes-open brain dynamics was inclined to a supercritical state.

EEG captures affective touch: CT-optimal touch and neural oscillations	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Affective touch; CT fibers; EEG; Neural oscillations	UNMYELINATED TACTILE AFFERENTS; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; MASSAGE THERAPY; PLEASANT TOUCH; FREQUENCY; ALPHA; ATTENTION; BAND; RESPONSES	Tactile interactions are of developmental importance to social and emotional interactions across species. In beginning to understand the affective component of tactile stimulation, research has begun to elucidate the neural mechanisms that underscore slow, affective touch. Here, we extended this emerging body of work and examined whether affective touch (C tactile [CT]-optimal speed), as compared to nonaffective touch (non-CT-optimal speed) and no touch conditions, modulated EEG oscillations. We report an attenuation in alpha and beta activity to affective and nonaffective touch relative to the no touch condition. Further, we found an attenuation in theta activity specific to the affective, as compared to the nonaffective touch and no touch conditions. Similar to theta, we also observed an attenuation of beta oscillations during the affective touch condition, although only in parietal scalp sites. Decreased activity in theta and parietal-beta ranges may reflect attentional-emotional regulatory mechanisms; however, future work is needed to provide insight into the potential neural coupling between theta and beta and their specific role in encoding slow, tactile stimulation.

J	von Wegner, F; Laufs, H; Tagliazucchi, E				von Wegner, Frederic; Laufs, Helmut; Tagliazucchi, Enzo			Mutual information identifies spurious Hurst phenomena in resting state EEG and fMRI data	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; FRACTAL DIMENSION; MICROSTATE SEQUENCES; MARKOV-PROCESSES; TIME-SERIES; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; WAKEFULNESS	Long-range memory in time series is often quantified by the Hurst exponent H, a measure of the signal's variance across several time scales. We analyze neurophysiological time series from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state experiments with two standard Hurst exponent estimators and with the time-lagged mutual information function applied to discretized versions of the signals. A confidence interval for the mutual information function is obtained from surrogate Markov processes with equilibrium distribution and transition matrix identical to the underlying signal. For EEG signals, we construct an additional mutual information confidence interval from a short-range correlated, tenth-order autoregressive model. We reproduce the previously described Hurst phenomenon (H > 0.5) in the analytical amplitude of alpha frequency band oscillations, in EEG microstate sequences, and in fMRI signals, but we show that the Hurst phenomenon occurs without long-range memory in the information-theoretical sense. We find that the mutual information function of neurophysiological data behaves differently from fractional Gaussian noise (fGn), for which the Hurst phenomenon is a sufficient condition to prove long-range memory. Two other well-characterized, short-range correlated stochastic processes (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross) also yieldH > 0.5, whereas their mutual information functions lie within the Markovian confidence intervals, similar to neural signals. In these processes, which do not have long-range memory by construction, a spurious Hurst phenomenon occurs due to slow relaxation times and heteroscedasticity (time-varying conditional variance). In summary, we find that mutual information correctly distinguishes long-range from short-range dependence in the theoretical and experimental cases discussed. Our results also suggest that the stationary fGn process is not sufficient to describe neural data, which seem to belong to a more general class of stochastic processes, in which multiscale variance effects produce Hurst phenomena without long-range dependence. In our experimental data, the Hurst phenomenon and long-range memory appear as different system properties that should be estimated and interpreted independently.

Time-frequency analysis is widely used in the past research; however, a variation of case study determines the brain signal analysis. In this paper, human emotion from brain waves is recognized in simple ways by calculating a frequency of signal variation. Entirely 35 healthy subjects from students with age 18-25 years old. The students are divided into 3 groups; the first group consists of 15 students; the second group consists of 10 students and the third group consists of 10 students. Each student takes 4 seconds to test his or her internal emotions. The signal speed is recorded during those 4 seconds. Based on stimulus time, various knocks for Z1 and Z2 is observed during a particular time. The experiment can be reproduced for in upcoming future by following the procedure. There are two main elements to measure signal speed which are Delta T and gap. Delta T subject to time differentiation of the changes in time-frequency of Alpha signals. For an evaluation of this work, there is an available benchmark database of EEG labeled with emotions; it mentions that emotional strength can be used as a factor to differentiate between human emotions. The results of this paper can be compared with previous researches which use the same device to differentiate between happy and sad emotions in terms of emotional strength. There is a strong correlation between emotional strength and frequency, we proved that sad feeling is speedier and beyond steady compared to happy since the number of Delta V to Z1 which represents sad emotion of Alpha signals is greater than Delta V to Z2 that represents a happy feeling in the same time period of the interaction process.

Previous studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and with magneto-and electroencephalography (MEG and EEG) have demonstrated consistent temporal dynamics of brain activity across movie viewers. However, little is known about the similarities and differences of fMRI and MEG or EEG dynamics during such naturalistic situations. We thus compared MEG and fMRI responses to the same 15-min black-and-white movie in the same eight subjects who watched the movie twice during both MEG and fMRI recordings. We analyzed intra-and intersubject voxel-wise correlations within each imaging modality as well as the correlation of the MEG envelopes and fMRI signals. The fMRI signals showed voxel-wise within-and between-subjects correlations up to r = 0.66 and r = 0.37, respectively, whereas these correlations were clearly weaker for the envelopes of band-pass filtered (7 frequency bands below 100 Hz) MEG signals (within-subjects correlation r < 0.14 and between-subjects r < 0.05). Direct MEG-fMRI voxel-wise correlations were unreliable. Notably, applying a spatial-filtering approach to the MEG data uncovered consistent canonical variates that showed considerably stronger (up to r = 0.25) between-subjects correlations than the univariate voxel-wise analysis. Furthermore, the envelopes of the time courses of these variates up to about 10 Hz showed association with fMRI signals in a general linear model. Similarities between envelopes of MEG canonical variates and fMRI voxel time-courses were seen mostly in occipital, but also in temporal and frontal brain regions, whereas intra-and intersubject correlations for MEG and fMRI separately were strongest only in the occipital areas. In contrast to the conventional univariate analysis, the spatial-filtering approach was able to uncover associations between the MEG envelopes and fMRI time courses, shedding light on the similarities of hemodynamic and electromagnetic brain activities during movie viewing.

Methods: The basic framework for the proposed method is the parallel use of a physiological model and a parametric phenomenological model: a neural field theory (NFT) of the corticothalamic system and an autoregressive (AR) model. The AR model is a "stochastic" model that shortens the time taken to extract spectral features and is also a "linear" model that is free from the local-minimum problem. From the relationship between the transfer function of the AR model and the transfer function of the NFT in the low frequency limit, we successfully derived a direct expression of CTC loop strength and the loop delay using AR coefficients. Results: Using this method to analyze sleep-EEG data, we were able to clearly track the wake-to-sleep transition, as the estimated CTC loop strength (c(2)) decreased to almost zero. We also found that the c(2)-distribution during nocturnal sleep is clearly bimodal in nature, which can be well approximated by the superposition of two Gaussian distributions that correspond to sleep and wake states, respectively. The estimated loop delay distributed similar to 0.08 s, which agrees well with the previously reported value estimated by other methods, confirming the validity of our method. Conclusions: A robust method with high time resolution was developed for estimating the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop strength and the delay when using a scalp electroencephalography. This method can contribute not only to detecting the wake-sleep transition, but also to further understanding of the transition, where the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop is thought to play an important role.

A Novel, Fast, Reliable, and Data-Driven Method for Simultaneous Single-Trial Mining and Amplitude-Latency Estimation Based on Proximity Graphs and Network Analysis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						single-trials; data-mining; proximity graphs; network analysis; amplitude; latency; reliability; signal to noise ratio (SNR)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; DIFFERENT REFERENCES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; EEG; BRAIN; VARIABILITY; RECORDINGS; COMPONENT	Both amplitude and latency of single-trial EEG/MEG recordings provide valuable information regarding functionality of the human brain. In this article, we provided a data-driven graph and network-based framework for mining information from multi-trial event-related brain recordings. In the first part, we provide the general outline of the proposed methodological approach. In the second part, we provide a more detailed illustration, and present the obtained results on every step of the algorithmic procedure. To justify the proposed framework instead of presenting the analytic data mining and graph-based steps, we address the problem of response variability, a prerequisite to reliable estimates for both the amplitude and latency on specific N/P components linked to the nature of the stimuli. The major question addressed in this study is the selection of representative single-trials with the aim of uncovering a less noisey averaged waveform elicited from the stimuli. This graph and network-based algorithmic procedure increases the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the brain response, a key pre-processing step to reveal significant and reliable amplitude and latency at a specific time after the onset of the stimulus and with the right polarity (N or P). We demonstrated the whole approach using electroencephalography (EEG) auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) recordings from 42 young healthy controls. The method is novel, fast and data-driven succeeding first to reveal the true waveform elicited by MMN on different conditions (frequency, intensity, duration, etc.). The proposed graph-oriented algorithmic pipeline increased the SNR of the characteristic waveforms and the reliability of amplitude and latency within the adopted cohort. We also demonstrated how different EEG reference schemes (REST vs. average) can influence amplitude-latency estimation. Simulation results revealed robust amplitude-latency estimations under different SNR and amplitude-latency variations with the proposed algorithm.

Experiments were conducted on male rat before and after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Experts in neurology performed a manual markup of signals as Epileptiform Discharges (ED) and Sleep Spindles (SS). A proprietary Event Detection Algorithm based on time-frequency analysis of wavelet spectrograms was developed. Feature space was based on Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and Frequency of signals, and each feature was assessed for importance of epileptic activity prediction. Resulted predictors were used for training logistic regression model, which estimated features weights in probability of epilepsy function. Validation of proposed model was done by multiple train-test division. It was shown that the accuracy of prediction is around 80%. Proposed Epilepsy Prediction Model, as well as Event Detection Algorithm, can be applied to identification of epileptiform activity in long term EEG records of rats and analysis of disease dynamics.

Recently, many researches show that the EEG of AD patients can be characterized by EEG slowing, enhanced complexity of the EEG signals, and EEG synchrony. In order to examine the neural synchrony at multi scales, and to find'a biomarker that help detecting AD in diagnosis, detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) of EEG signals is applied in this paper. Several parameters, namely DCCA coefficients in the whole brain, DCCA coefficients at a specific scale, maximum DCCA coefficient over the span of all time scales and the corresponding scale of such coefficients, were extracted to examine the synchronization, respectively. The results show that DCCA coefficients have a trend of increase as scale increases, and decreases as electrode distance increases. Comparing DCCA coefficients in AD patients with healthy controls, a decrease of synchronization in the whole brain, and a bigger scale corresponding to maximum correlation is discovered in AD patients. The change of max-correlation scale may relate to the slowing of oscillatory activities. Linear combination of max DCCA coefficient and max-correlation scale reaches a classification accuracy of 90%. From the above results, it is reasonable to conclude that DCCA coefficient reveals the change of both oscillation and synchrony in AD, and thus is a powerful tool to differentiate AD patients from healthy elderly individuals.

The organization of the functional brain network is associated with drowsiness, but little is known about the brain network topology that is modulated by drowsiness. To clarify this problem, in this study, we introduce a novel approach to detect driver drowsiness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been measured during a simulated driving task, in which participants are recruited to undergo both alert and drowsy states. The filtered EEG signals are then decomposed into multiple frequency bands by wavelet packet transform. Functional connectivity between all pairs of channels for multiple frequency bands is assessed using the phase lag index (PLI). Based on this, PLI-weighted networks are subsequently calculated, from which minimum spanning trees are constructeda graph method that corrects for comparison bias. Statistical analyses are performed on graph-derived metrics as well as on the PLI connectivity values. The major finding is that significant differences in the delta frequency band for three graph metrics and in the theta frequency band for five graph metrics suggesting network integration and communication between network nodes are increased from alertness to drowsiness. Together, our findings also suggest a more line-like configuration in alert states and a more star-like topology in drowsy states. Collectively, our findings point to a more proficient configuration in drowsy state for lower frequency bands. Graph metrics relate to the intrinsic organization of functional brain networks, and these graph metrics may provide additional insights on driver drowsiness detection for reducing and preventing traffic accidents and further understanding the neural mechanisms of driver drowsiness.

The link between neural synchrony and working memory (WM) has been supported at the theoretical and empirical level. However, findings have also shown that WM encoding is also related to significant alpha-beta desynchronization. These findings have been primarily recorded during subsequent memory effect paradigms that compare correct with incorrect encoding trials. The dissociable contribution imparted by various processes to WM performance suggests that incorrect performance may not be directly translatable to unsuccessful encoding. Here, we address the relationship between alpha-beta desynchronization and encoding through the use of an alternative paradigm design by contrasting frontal and parietal human scalp electroencephalography activity during the encoding interval of a delayed matching-to-sample task with that recorded during a control task. The additional use of non-verbal/semantic visual stimulation and recruitment of typically developing adolescent subjects has led us to the conclusion that encoding-relevant alpha-beta decrements can be replicated via a non-verbal/semantic delayed matching-to-sample task and these are also evident in typically developing adolescents, in addition to adults, as has been previously demonstrated. The identification of encoding-related alpha-beta decrements in adolescent subjects performing such WM tasks may open new avenues to explore whether such a rhythmic signature may explain WM and electrophysiological deficits that emerge in various adolescent neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Using the wavelet transformation, we considered the dynamics of the neural network of brain in different frequency bands, including high (up to 100 Hz) frequency gamma-waves. Along with the time-frequency analysis of single MEG traces, the interactions between remote brain regions, associated with the perception, were also taken into consideration. As the result, the new features of bistable visual perception were observed and the effect of image ambiguity was analyzed.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the differences in decision-making in PD patients with or without PG considering both neurophysiological and behavioral aspects. The IOWA Gambling Task (IGT) and electro-encephalographic (EEG) activity were considered to elucidate the decision and post-feedback processes in PG. The sample included fifty-two PD patients, divided in three groups: 17 PD patients with active gambling behavior (PD Gamblers, PDG); 15 PD patients who remitted from PG (PD Non-Gamblers, PDNG); and a Control Group (CG) composed by 20 patients with PD only. EEG and IGT performance were recorded during decision and post-feedback phase. Results showed worse performance and an increase of the low frequency bands in the frontal area for the PDG group compared to the other two groups. In addition, higher BAS (Behavioral Activation System) and BIS-11 (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) personality components were correlated to groups' behavioral response. These results show an anomalous behavioral (IGT) and cortical response of PDG patients related to their inability to use adequate control mechanisms during a decision-making task where reward mechanisms (BAS) and impulsivity (BIS-11) are relevant.

Recently, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI system has received more attention because it has a higher information transfer rate (ITR) and requires less user and system training. SSVEP is a periodic signal that generated by a periodic visual stimulation and its frequency spectrum contains stimulation frequency and its harmonics. The aim of the SSVEP based BCI system is to detect the stimulation frequency and thus understand the intention of the person. In recent years, various methods have been proposed for SSVEP recognition. Among these methods, the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) as a well-known powerful method and multivariate linear regression (MLR) as a state-of-the-art method can be mentioned. Although these methods find the dominant frequency in the short time EEG signal, their performance severely degraded by the presence of the noise. Therefore, the appropriate removal of the background EEG signal, that plays the role of the noise, is essential. In this paper, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is used as a preprocessing method for separating random and periodic components of the recorded EEG signal. Also, the skewness coefficient and the Spearman correlation are used to optimize the values of SSA parameters. The experimental results show a significant improvement in performance after preprocessing by SSA using CCA and MLR methods, especially for short data lengths. Also, it has been shown that SSA with the optimal parameters (OSSA) has a higher performance than SSA with fixed parameters. The superiority of proposed method suggests it as an appropriate choice for implementation of the real-time SSVEP based BCI system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to elucidate mnemonic neural dynamics during natural reading of literature by performing electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activities of human participants recruited on campus were correlated with their subsequent memory, which was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by them based on state of the art natural language processing procedures. The results of the EEG data analysis showed a significant positive relationship between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with N1-P2 and P3 fixation-related potential (FRP) components and fixation-related theta-band (4 - 8 Hz) EEG power, respectively. In contrast, the results of fMRI analysis showed a significant negative relationship between subsequent memory and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with networks of regions forming part of the salience network and the default mode network (DMN), respectively. Taken together with the EEG results, these memory-related deactivations in the salience network and the DMN were thought to reflect the reading of sentences characterized by low mnemonic load and the suppression of task-irreverent thoughts, respectively. It was suggested that the context-dependent mnemonic process during literature reading requires large-scale network deactivation, which might reflect coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.

However, how sensory processing differs between wakefulness and sleep remains unclear. A major difficulty in this field stems from using brief auditory stimuli that often trigger nonspecific high-amplitude "K-complex" responses and complicate interpretation. To overcome this challenge, here we delivered periodic visual flicker stimulation across sleep and wakefulness while recording high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in humans. We found that onset responses can be separated from frequency-specific steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) selectively observed over visual cortex. Sustained SSVEPs in response to fast (8/10 Hz) stimulation are substantially stronger in wakefulness than in both nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep, whereas SSVEP responses to slow (3/5 Hz) stimulation are stronger in both NREM and REM sleep than in wakefulness. Despite wake-like spontaneous activity, responses in REM sleep were similar to those in NREM sleep and different than wakefulness, in accordance with perceptual disconnection during REM sleep. Finally, analysis of amplitude and phase in single trials revealed that stronger fast SSVEPs in wakefulness are driven by more consistent phase locking and increased induced power. These results suggest that the sleeping brain is unable to effectively synchronize large neuronal populations in response to rapid sensory stimulation.

A novel methodology called complex network is capable of characterizing the functional connectivity of human brain by means of graph theoretical measures. We designed and conducted experiments to record electroencephalograph (EEG) signals during left and right hand movement imagery tasks and then probed into brain activities by analyzing multichannel motor imagery signals from the perspective of complex networks. More specifically, we first utilized wavelet time-frequency analysis to calculate energy sequence of each channel and then modeled human brain as a graph by treating the channels of scalp EEG as nodes and determining interconnections according to the distance between energy sequences of each channel. The functional connectivity of derived brain networks could be interpreted with characteristics of nodes and edges. Results demonstrated that when subjects imagined left hand movements, the node betweenness centrality (BC) of right sensorimotor area was greater than that of left sensorimotor area. The node BC distribution was roughly opposite when imagining right hand movements. It could be concluded that nodes of contralateral sensorimotor regions were more likely to be activated to control information flows during motor imagery tasks.

At the moment, neurophysiological mechanisms underlying creative thinking in aging are hardly studied. In the present study, we analyzed the synchronization/desynchronization of EEG (ERS/ERD) induced by solving problem "Unusual use of the subject" in the theta-beta frequency ranges in the subjects of the younger (YA, N = 82, 22.1 +/- 3.2 years) and elderly (EA, N = 84, 64.9 +/- 6.7 years) age groups, taking into account the level of originality. The middle time interval of creative problem solving, which is related to processes of generation and selection of preliminary ideas, was considered. The spatial localization of age differences was determined using the sLORETA method. Higher level of power reactivity in right hemisphere as compared with the left one was revealed in alpha-1, 2 and beta-1 rhythms in all subjects. Age differences in biopotentials of theta and beta-1 frequency ranges were found. Analysis of current source density estimates has revealed localization of larger theta ERS in EA as compared with YA in the middle cingulate gyrus and paracentral lobule. It was found that beta-1 ERD was more pronounced in EA in comparison with YA with localization of the effect in precentral, postcentral gyrus and middle cingulate cortex. Age differences that were mediated by level of originality were identified: higher alpha ERS in more original elderly group as compared with both less original elderly and more original young participants. It was concluded that processes related to top-down control are important for originality in the elderly during searching for solution of divergent problem.	[Privodnova, E. Yu; Volf, N.

Gert			EEG may serve as a biomarker in Huntington's disease using machine learning automatic classification	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; NEURODEGENERATION; MECHANISMS; NETWORKS; THETA	Reliable markers measuring disease progression in Huntington's disease (HD), before and after disease manifestation, may guide a therapy aimed at slowing or halting disease progression. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) may provide a quantification method for possible (sub) cortical dysfunction occurring prior to or concomitant with motor or cognitive disturbances observed in HD. In this pilot study we construct an automatic classifier distinguishing healthy controls from HD gene carriers using qEEG and derive qEEG features that correlate with clinical markers known to change with disease progression in HD, with the aim of exploring biomarker potential. We included twenty-six HD gene carriers (49.7 +/- 8.5 years) and 25 healthy controls (52.7 +/- 8.7 years). EEG was recorded for three minutes with subjects at rest. An EEG index was created by applying statistical pattern recognition to a large set of EEG features, which was subsequently tested using 10-fold cross-validation. The index resulted in a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 1: a low value indicating a state close to normal and a high value pointing to HD. qEEG features that correlate specifically with commonly used clinical markers in HD research were derived. The classification index had a specificity of 83%, a sensitivity of 83% and an accuracy of 83%. The area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.9. qEEG analysis on subsets of electrophysiological features resulted in two highly significant correlations with clinical scores. The results of this pilot study suggest that qEEG may serve as a biomarker in HD. The indices correlating with modalities changing with the progression of the disease may lead to tools based on qEEG that help monitor efficacy in intervention studies.	[Odish, Omar F.

J	Mesin, L				Mesin, Luca			Estimation of Complexity of Sampled Biomedical Continuous Time Signals Using Approximate Entropy	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						complexity; approximate entropy; EEG; time series embedding; signal prediction	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SERIES ANALYSIS; REGULARITY; SLEEP; DIMENSION; DYNAMICS; FEATURES; SYSTEMS; DEPTH; CHAOS	Non-linear analysis found many applications in biomedicine. Approximate entropy (ApEn) is a popular index of complexity often applied to biomedical data, as it provides quite stable indications when processing short and noisy epochs. However, ApEn strongly depends on parameters, which were chosen in the literature in wide ranges. This paper points out that ApEn depends on sampling rate of continuous time signals, embedding dimension, tolerance (under which a match is identified), epoch duration and low frequency trends. Moreover, contradicting results can be obtained changing parameters. This was found both in simulations and in experimental EEG. These limitations of ApEn suggest the introduction of an alternative index, here called modified ApEn, which is based on the following principles: oversampling is compensated, self-recurrences are ignored, a fixed percentage of recurrences is selected and low frequency trends are removed. The modified index allows to get more stable measurements of the complexity of the tested simulated data and EEG. The final conclusions are that, in order to get a reliable estimation of complexity using ApEn, parameters should be chosen within specific ranges, data must be sampled close to the Nyquist limit and low frequency trends should be removed. Following these indications, different studies could be more easily compared, interpreted and replicated. Moreover, the modified ApEn can be an interesting alternative, which extends the range of parameters for which stable indications can be achieved.

The neuropathogenesis of AD is suggested to be a result of the accumulation of amyloid- (A) peptides in the brain. To date, A-induced cognitive and neurophysiologic impairments have not been illuminated sufficiently. Therefore, we aimed to examine how spontaneous brain activities of rats changed by injection of increasing A doses into the brain hemispheres, and whether these changes could be used as a new biomarker for the early diagnosis of the AD. Rats were randomized into following groups: sham (Sham) and seven A-treated (i.c.v.) groups in increasing concentrations (from A-1 to A-7). After recovery, EEG recordings were obtained from implanted electrodes from eight electrode locations, and then, spectral and statistical analyses were performed. A significant decrement in gamma activity was observed in all A groups compared with the sham group. In delta activity, we observed significant changes from A-4 to A-7 group compared with sham group. Delta coherence values were decreased from A-4 to A-7 and A-5 to A-7 groups for frontal and temporal electrode pairs, respectively. A gradual increment was observed in A(1-42) level till A-4 group. Positive correlation for global delta power and negative correlation for global gamma power between A(1-42) peptide levels were detected. Consequently, it is conceivable to suggest gamma oscillation might be used to detect early stages of AD. Moreover, changes in delta activity provide information about the onset of major pathologic changes in the progress of AD.

Automatic slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) are two known phases of sleep. However, the level by which those changes contribute to brain interactions has not been well characterized. In recent years, it has been shown that brain connectivity measuring can be helpful in investigation of behavioral states of the brain. By considering the fact that brains have different states in different stages of sleep, the present work employs effective connectivity and machine-learning analysis to quantify and classify SWS and REM stages of sleep. We examine low-density 12-channel EEG data from 8 healthy participants during a full night of sleep. Data were epoched into 30-s windows and SWS and REM stages were labeled by a sleep consultant. Effective connectivity was quantified using a directed metric, generalized partial directed coherence, and measures were used as input features for a machine-learning system. A support vector machine classifier was used to solve 2 binary problems of REM vs. nREM and SWS vs. nSWS. Findings revealed an excellent balanced accuracy of 89.80% in REM detection and 87.32% in SWS detection. Overall, our work demonstrates a successful application of effective connectivity analysis and machine learning for sleep neuromarkers in EEG.

Bitemporal seizure spread and its effect on autonomic dysfunction	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy; Heart rate variability; Autonomic dysfunction; Bitemporal seizure	SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SHORT-TERM ANALYSIS; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; EPILEPSY; BRADYCARDIA; MECHANISMS; MORTALITY; ASYSTOLE	Objective: Autonomic dysregulation is a possible pathomechanism of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Cardiac arrhythmias and autonomic symptoms are most commonly associated with seizures arising from the temporal lobes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether simultaneous seizure activity in both temporal lobes affects the autonomic nervous system differently from seizure activity in one temporal lobe as assessed by heart rate variability (HRV). Methods: Electrocardiography (ECG) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data from 13 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy who had seizures that propagated electrically from one temporal lobe to the other during video-EEG-ECG monitoring were retrospectively reviewed. The time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear parameters of HRV were evaluated by analyzing 4-minute-long ECG epochs, sampling from baseline, preictal and postictal periods as well as epochs constituting unitemporal and bitemporal ictal activity. Results: Heart rate was significantly higher during bitemporal ictal activity compared with all other time points. The time domain and nonlinear parameters of HRV were significantly decreased during bitemporal activity compared with baseline, and multiple components of HRV (standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), coefficient of variation (CV), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and standard deviation of short-term variability (SD1)) were significantly lower during bitemporal activity compared with unitemporal activity. Frequency domain analysis showed no significant differences. Conclusion: This study shows that bitemporal seizure activity significantly increases heart rate and decreases HRV, indicating increased autonomic imbalance with a shift towards sympathetic predominance, and this may increase the risk of SUDEP.

This facilitation effect, however, has been primarily studied by focusing on high-level motor proficiency, whereas evidence on the effect of observing poorly performed actions is still lacking. We then devised a study to investigate neural correlates of the observation of suboptimal motor acts as mirrored by corticospinal activation (via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Experiment 1) and by modulation of cortical oscillatory activity (via electroencephalography (EEG), Experiment 2). 40 participants were presented with four randomly reiterated videos. Videos depicted a healthy confederate, a minimally impaired multiple sclerosis (MS) patient, a mildly impaired MS patient, or a confederate trying to simulate mild motor difficulties performing a test concerning fine motor abilities. In Experiment 1 we analyzed TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials during the observation of videos. In Experiment 2 EEG data were analyzed in the frequency-domain. Analyses highlighted both increased corticospinal excitability and desynchronized alpha-beta oscillations during the observation of poorly performed motor acts performed by the mildly impaired MS patient. Further, we observed gradually increasing beta activity across videos reiterations, specifically for the minimally impaired patient's video. Reported findings corroborate the hypotheses that the action-observation network and the motor system might be involved in processes evoked in the attempt to understand and predict observed actions which do not belong to the onlookers' motor repertoire, reflecting in an increased sensorimotor activity.

A Practical SSVEP-Based Algorithm for Perceptual Dominance Estimation in Binocular Rivalry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Acceleration of spectrogram difference; binocular rivalry; electroencephalogram (EEG); steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs)	VISUAL-CORTEX; PREDICTS; MACAQUE; MOTION	This paper presents a practical algorithm for perceptual dominance estimation in binocular rivalry. The algorithm using steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) effectively realizes a real-time estimation of perceptual dominance in binocular rivalry from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For accuracy of estimation, the algorithm utilizes the EEG spectrogram obtained via the short-time Fourier transformation with a short time analysis window. More importantly, the algorithm focuses on the acceleration (second-order time differential) of the spectrogram difference between SSVEP of left-eye stimulus and that of right-eye stimulus, where the left-eye stimulus and the right-eye stimulus are separately displayed for left-eye and right-eye, respectively, with different-flashing-frequency visual stimuli of dissimilar images. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of the algorithm, particularly, the importance of introducing the acceleration of the spectrogram difference. With the simplicity of the algorithm, it is in fact suitable to accurately measure binocular rivalry without verbal communications in real-time environments.

This may be caused by the associated processes of decision making, which take place when subject is deciding either perform the movement or imagine it. Obtained features have been found in untrained subject which it its turn gives the possibility to use our results in the development of brain-computer interfaces for controlling anthropomorphic robotic arm.

Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are neural oscillations from the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that are evoked from flickering visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail. Approach. In this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN), which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for user-specific calibration. Main results. The Compact-CNN demonstrates across subject mean accuracy of approximately 80%, out-performing current state-of-the-art, hand-crafted approaches using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, the Compact-CNN approach can reveal the underlying feature representation, revealing that the deep learner extracts additional phase-and amplitude-related features associated with the structure of the dataset. Significance. We discuss how our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g. asynchronous BCI) as well as provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.

Spatio-temporal dynamics of cortical drive to human subthalamic nucleus neurons in Parkinson's disease	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Subthalamic nucleus; Beta oscillations; Motor cortex; Neuronal synchronisation	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; MOVEMENT-RELATED CHANGES; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SYNCHRONIZATION	Pathological synchronisation of beta frequency (12-35 Hz) oscillations between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and cerebral cortex is thought to contribute to motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). For this corticosubthalamic oscillatory drive to be mechanistically important, it must influence the firing of STN neurons and, consequently, their downstream targets. Here, we examined the dynamics of synchronisation between STN LFPs and units with multiple cortical areas, measured using frontal ECoG, midline EEG and lateral EEG, during rest and movement. STN neurons lagged cortical signals recorded over midline (over premotor cortices) and frontal (over prefrontal cortices) with stable time delays, consistent with strong corticosubthalamic drive, and many neurons maintained these dynamics during movement. In contrast, most STN neurons desynchronised from lateral EEG signals (over primary motor cortices) during movement and those that did not had altered phase relations to the cortical signals. The strength of synchronisation between STN units and midline EEG in the high beta range (25-35 Hz) correlated positively with the severity of akinetic-rigid motor symptoms across patients. Together, these results suggest that sustained synchronisation of STN neurons to premotor-cortical beta oscillations play an important role in disrupting the normal coding of movement in PD.

This study investigated the preictal discharges (PIDs) by intracranial electroencephalogram of 11 seizures from 7 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: The EEG segments consisting of 30 seconds before ictal onset and 5 seconds after ictal onset were selected for analysis. After PID detection, the amplitude and interval were measured. According to the timing of PID onset, the 30-second period preceding seizure onset was divided into two stages: before PID stage and PID stage. The autocorrelation coefficients during the two stages were calculated and compared. Results: Preictal discharge amplitude progressively increased, while PID interval gradually decreased toward seizure onset. The autocorrelation coefficients of PID channels were significantly higher during PID stage than before PID stage. There was an overlap between channels with PIDs and seizure onset channels (80.77%). Conclusions: Preictal discharges emerge prior to ictal event, with a dynamic change and a spatial correlation with seizure onset zone. These findings deepen our understanding of seizure generation and help early prediction and localization of seizure onset zone.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract the most relevant features to epilepsy disease and use them to do classification process that yields fast and accurate automatic diagnosis. Hilbert Transform of EEG signals is calculated and mean power frequency is applied to reduce the feature vector dimensions. The classification process between normal and seizure cases is done using Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network. The classification accuracy achieved using this method is 100%. FPGA implementation of the proposed system is done for real-time analysis. High accuracy of the proposed system, power efficiency and its light weight make it a good candidate for automatic epileptic seizure detection.

Though a variety of experimental methodologies have been used to investigate cognitive fatigue in vigilance, relatively little research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG), specifically event-related potentials (ERPs), to explore the nature of cognitive fatigue, also known as the vigilance decrement. Moreover, much of the research that has been done on vigilance and ERPs uses non-traditional vigilance paradigms, limiting generalizability to the established body of behavioral results and corresponding theories. In this study, we address concerns with prior research by (1) investigating the vigilance decrement using a well-established visual vigilance task, (2) utilizing a task designed to attenuate possible confounding ERP components present within a vigilance paradigm, and (3) informing our interpretations with recent findings from ERP research. We averaged data across electrodes located over the frontal, central, and parietal scalp. Then, we generated waveforms locked to the onset of critical low-frequency or non-critical high-frequency events during a 40 min task that was segregated into time blocks for data analysis. There were three primary findings from the analyses of these data. First, mean amplitude of N1 was greater during later blocks for both low-frequency and high-frequency events, a contradictory finding compared to past visual vigilance studies that is further discussed with respect to current interpretations of the N1 in visual attention tasks. Second, P3b mean amplitude following low-frequency events was reduced during later blocks, with a later onset latency. Third and finally, the decrease in P3b amplitude correlated with individual differences in the magnitude of the vigilance decrement, assessed using d'. The results provide evidence for degradations of cognitive processing efficiency brought on by extended time on task, leading to delayed processing and decreased discriminability of critical stimuli from non-critical stimuli. These conclusions are discussed in the context of the vigilance decrement and corresponding theoretical accounts.

Exploring the advantages of multiband fMRI with simultaneous EEG to investigate coupling between gamma frequency neural activity and the BOLD response in humans	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; gamma-BOLD coupling; gradient artefacts; heating; multiband fMRI; multislice fMRI; motor gamma oscillations; safety	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; ARTIFACT CORRECTION; GRADIENT ARTIFACT; RESTING-STATE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; WHOLE-BRAIN	We established an optimal combination of EEG recording during sparse multiband (MB) fMRI that preserves high-resolution, whole-brain fMRI coverage while enabling broad-band EEG recordings which are uncorrupted by MRI gradient artefacts (GAs). We first determined the safety of simultaneous EEG recording during MB fMRI. Application of MB factor=4 produced <1 degrees C peak heating of electrode/hardware during 20min of GE-EPI data acquisition. However, higher SAR sequences require specific safety testing, with greater heating observed using PCASL with MB factor=4. Heating was greatest in the electrocardiogram channel, likely due to it possessing longest lead length. We investigated the effect of MB factor on the temporal signal-to-noise ratio for a range of GE-EPI sequences (varying MB factor and temporal interval between slice acquisitions). We found that, for our experimental purpose, the optimal acquisition was achieved with MB factor=3, 3mm isotropic voxels, and 33 slices providing whole head coverage. This sequence afforded a 2.25s duration quiet period (without GAs) in every 3s TR. Using this sequence, we demonstrated the ability to record gamma frequency (55-80Hz) EEG oscillations, in response to right index finger abduction, that are usually obscured by GAs during continuous fMRI data acquisition. In this novel application of EEG-MB fMRI to a motor task, we observed a positive correlation between gamma and BOLD responses in bilateral motor regions. These findings support and extend previous work regarding coupling between neural and hemodynamic measures of brain activity in humans and showcase the utility of EEG-MB fMRI for future investigations.

Design: Spectro-temporal processing skills were assessed using a psychoacoustic test battery. Speech-in-noise perception was measured using the Listening in Spatialised Noise - Sentences (LiSN-S) test and Cortical Auditory Evoked Potentials (CAEPs) recorded to the speech syllable/da/presented in quiet and in 8-talker babble noise at 0, 5, and 10dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Study sample: Ten professional musicians and 10 non-musicians participated in this study. Results: Musicians significantly outperformed non-musicians in the frequency discrimination task and low-cue condition of the LiSN-S test. Musicians' N1 amplitude showed no difference between 5dB and 0dB SNR conditions while non-musicians showed significantly lower N1 amplitude at 0dB SNR compared to 5dB SNR. Brain-behaviour correlation for musicians showed a significant association between CAEPs at 5dB SNR and the low-cue condition of the LiSN-S test at 30-70ms. Time-frequency analysis indicated musicians had significantly higher alpha power desynchronisation in the 0dB SNR condition indicating involvement of attention. Conclusions: Through the use of behavioural and electrophysiological data, the results provide converging evidence for improved speech recognition in noise in musicians.

However, these EEG patterns cannot be quantitatively identified using commercially available depth of anesthesia (DoA) monitors. This study proposes an effective classification method and indices to classify these patterns among patients. Approach: Four types of emergence EEG patterns were identified based on the EEG data set from 52 patients undergoing sevoflurane general anesthesia from two hospitals. Then, the relative power spectrum density (RPSD) of five frequency sub-bands of clinical interest (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) were selected for emergence state analysis. Finally, a genetic algorithm support vector machine (GA-SVM) was used to identify the emergence EEG patterns. The performance was reported in terms of sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP) and accuracy (AC). Main results: The combination of the mean and mode of RPSD in the delta and alpha band (P (delta)/P (alpha) performed the best in the GA-SVM classification. The AC indices obtained by GA-SVM across the four patterns were 90.64 +/- 7.61, 81.79 +/- 5.84, 82.14 +/- 7.99 and 72.86 +/- 11.11 respectively. Furthermore, the emergence time of the patients with EEG emergence patterns I and III increased as the patients' age increased. However, for patients with EEG emergence pattern IV, the emergence time positively correlates with the patients' age when they are under 50, and negatively correlates with it when they are over 50. Significance: The mean and mode of P (delta)/P (alpha) is a useful index to classify the different emergence EEG patterns. In addition, these patterns may correlate with an underlying neural substrate which is related to the patients' age.

Stereotyped high-frequency oscillations discriminate seizure onset zones and critical functional cortex in focal epilepsy	BRAIN			English	Article						epilepsy; high-frequency oscillations; seizure onset zone; intracranial EEG	80-500 HZ; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FAST RIPPLES; SLOW WAVES; RECORDINGS; BRAIN; EEG; AREAS	High-frequency oscillations are putative biomarkers of seizure onset zones, but can also be recorded from non-epileptic structures. Using machine-learning, Liu et al. show that HFOs generated by epileptic tissues produce stereotyped waveform patterns rarely observed in non-epileptogenic cortex, and discriminate between seizure onset zones, "eloquent" cortex and other cerebral regions.High-frequency oscillations in local field potentials recorded with intracranial EEG are putative biomarkers of seizure onset zones in epileptic brain. However, localized 80-500 Hz oscillations can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, physiological high-frequency oscillations are indistinguishable from pathological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy presurgical planning. We hypothesized that pathological high-frequency oscillations occur in a repetitive fashion with a similar waveform morphology that specifically indicates seizure onset zones. We investigated the waveform patterns of automatically detected high-frequency oscillations in 13 epilepsy patients and five control subjects, with an average of 73 subdural and intracerebral electrodes recorded per patient. The repetitive oscillatory waveforms were identified by using a pipeline of unsupervised machine learning techniques and were then correlated with independently clinician-defined seizure onset zones. Consistently in all patients, the stereotypical high-frequency oscillations with the highest degree of waveform similarity were localized within the seizure onset zones only, whereas the channels generating high-frequency oscillations embedded in random waveforms were found in the functional regions independent from the epileptogenic locations. The repetitive waveform pattern was more evident in fast ripples compared to ripples, suggesting a potential association between waveform repetition and the underlying pathological network. Our findings provided a new tool for the interpretation of pathological high-frequency oscillations that can be efficiently applied to distinguish seizure onset zones from functionally important sites, which is a critical step towards the translation of these signature events into valid clinical biomarkers.

One's surname is an important form of collective self-concept; it represents the line of ancestry, and is psychologically salient. According to this concept, a stranger with the same surname may also elicit salient self-relevant processing, despite unfamiliarity; however, this has not yet been directly investigated. The present study adopted a three-stimulus oddball paradigm and multimodal electroencephalography to study the potential self-relevant processing of such stimuli. Behavioral results indicated that same-surname unfamiliar (SSU) names were rated more self-relevant than different-surname unfamiliar (DSU) names, although they were rated equally unfamiliar to subjects. Analysis of EEG data showed similar P2 enhancement in response to SN and SSU when compared to DSU. In contrast, the self-relevant effect on P3 amplitudes and theta synchronization decreased linearly from SN, SSU, to DSU conditions. Thus, both the behavioral and electrophysiological data indicate that unfamiliar names with the same surname can evoke reliable self-relevant processing.

Here, we tested this prediction by using state-dependent millisecond-resolved real-time electroencephalography-triggered dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) (Zrenner et al., 2018) to target the EEG-negative (high-excitability state) versus EEG-positive peak (low-excitability state) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm in the left (conditioning) and right (test) motor cortex (M1) of 16 healthy human subjects (9 female, 7 male). Effective connectivity was tested by short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI); that is, the inhibitory effect of the conditioning TMS pulse given 10-12 ms before the test pulse on the test motor-evoked potential. We compared the four possible combinations of excitability states (negative peak, positive peak) and phase relations (in-phase, out-of-phase) of the mu-rhythm in the conditioning and test M1 and a random phase condition. Strongest SIHI was found when the two M1 were in phase for the high-excitability state (negative peak of the mu-rhythm), whereas the weakest SIHI occurred when they were out of phase and the conditioning M1 was in the low-excitability state (positive peak). Phase synchronicity contributed significantly to SIHI variation, with stronger SIHI in the in-phase than out-of-phase conditions. These findings are in exact accord with the predictions of the theory of communication through coherence. They open a translational route for highly effective modification of brain connections by repetitive stimulation at instants in time when nodes in the network are phase synchronized and excitable.

Seizure susceptibility and infraslow modulatory activity in the intracranial electroencephalogram	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						coherence; envelope; epilepsy; infraslow; second spectrum; seizure	CORTICAL CORRELATION STRUCTURE; SCALP EEG; EPILEPSY; OSCILLATIONS; STEREOELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; SPIKES	Objective Studies of infraslow amplitude modulations (<0.15 Hz) of band power time series suggest that these envelope correlations may form a basis for distant spatial coupling in the brain. In this study, we sought to determine how infraslow relationships are affected by antiepileptic drug (AED) taper, time of day, and seizure. Methods Results We studied intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) data collected from 13 medically refractory adult epilepsy patients who underwent monitoring at Yale-New Haven Hospital. We estimated the magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) at <0.15 Hz of traditional EEG frequency band power time series for all electrode contact pairs to quantify infraslow envelope correlations between them. We studied, first, hour-long background icEEG epochs before and after AED taper to understand the effect of taper. Second, we analyzed the entire record for each patient to study the effect of time of day. Finally, for each patient, we reviewed the clinical record to find all seizures that were at least 6 hours removed from other seizures and analyzed infraslow envelope MSC before and after them. Infraslow envelope MSC increased slightly, but significantly, after AED taper, and increased on average during the night and decreased during the day. It was also increased significantly in all frequency bands up to 3 hours preseizure and 1 hour postseizure as compared to background icEEG (61 seizures studied). These changes occurred for both daytime and nighttime seizures (28 daytime, 33 nighttime). Interestingly, there was significant spatial variability to these changes, with the seizure onset area peaking at 3 hours preseizure, then showing progressive desynchronization from 3 hours preseizure to 1 hour postseizure. Significance Infraslow envelope analysis may be used to understand long-term changes over the course of icEEG monitoring, provide unique insight into interictal electrophysiological changes related to ictogenesis, and contribute to the development of novel seizure forecasting algorithms.

The research reveals that brain activity is monitored through electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients suffered from seizure to detect the epileptic seizure. The performance of EEG detection based epilepsy require feature extracting strategies. In this research, we have extracted varying features extracting strategies based on time and frequency domain characteristics, nonlinear, wavelet based entropy and few statistical features. A deeper study was undertaken using novel machine learning classifiers by considering multiple factors. The support vector machine kernels are evaluated based on multiclass kernel and box constraint level. Likewise, for K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we computed the different distance metrics, Neighbor weights and Neighbors. Similarly, the decision trees we tuned the paramours based on maximum splits and split criteria and ensemble classifiers are evaluated based on different ensemble methods and learning rate. For training/testing tenfold Cross validation was employed and performance was evaluated in form of TPR, NPR, PPV, accuracy and AUC. In this research, a deeper analysis approach was performed using diverse features extracting strategies using robust machine learning classifiers with more advanced optimal options. Support Vector Machine linear kernel and KNN with City block distance metric give the overall highest accuracy of 99.5% which was higher than using the default parameters for these classifiers. Moreover, highest separation (AUC = 0.9991, 0.9990) were obtained at different kernel scales using SVM. Additionally, the K-nearest neighbors with inverse squared distance weight give higher performance at different Neighbors. Moreover, to distinguish the postictal heart rate oscillations from epileptic ictal subjects, and highest performance of 100% was obtained using different machine learning classifiers.

Here, we tested the ability of this tripolar EEG (tEEG) system to detect the extent to which the alpha rhythm-an 8-13 Hz oscillation found in the EEG when the subject is at rest with the eyes closed-is modulated by opening the eyes, and compared it with simultaneous conventional EEG measurements. In a preliminary study comprising ten independent sessions on seven subjects, opening the eyes reduced alpha power by an average of 66.5 +/- 9% and 59.1 +/- 10% in tEEG and conventional EEG recordings, respectively. These findings suggest that the dynamical changes in brain rhythms may be more easily detected by tEEG than by conventional EEG with implications for clinical diagnosis and neurofeedback applications.

Both oscillatory events, especially when co-occurring in the constellation of spindles nesting in the slow oscillation upstate, are considered to support memory formation and underlying synaptic plasticity. The regulatory mechanisms of this function at the circuit level are poorly understood. Here, using two-photon imaging in mice, we relate EEG-recorded slow oscillations and spindles to calcium signals recorded from the soma of cortical putative pyramidal-like (Pyr) cells and neighboring parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-Ins) or somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOM-Ins). Pyr calcium activity was increased more than threefold when spindles co-occurred with slow oscillation upstates compared with slow oscillations or spindles occurring in isolation. Independent of whether or not a spindlewas nested in the slow oscillation upstate, the slow oscillation downstate was preceded by enhanced calcium signal in SOM-Ins that vanished during the upstate, whereas spindles were associated with strongly increased PV-In calcium activity. Additional wide-field calcium imaging of Pyr cells confirmed the enhanced calcium activity and its widespread topography associated with spindles nested in slow oscillation upstates. In conclusion, when spindles are nested in slow oscillation upstates, maximum Pyr activity appears to concur with strong perisomatic inhibition of Pyr cells via PV-Ins and low dendritic inhibition via SOM-Ins (i.e., conditions that might optimize synaptic plasticity within local cortical circuits).

Gamma oscillations as a biomarker for major depression: an emerging topic	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK DISORDERS; THETA; SCHIZOPHRENIA; STIMULATION; SYNCHRONY; EPILEPSY; LEARN; RTMS	Identifying biomarkers for major depression is of high importance for improving diagnosis and treatment of this common and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder, as the field seeks to move toward both personalized and more effective treatments. Here we focus on electroencephalography (EEG) or direct scalp voltage recordings as such a biomarker, with an emphasis on gamma and high gamma oscillations (or "rhythms"). In the last several decades, alpha and theta band rhythms have been found to provide information on depressive state as well as recovery, but the gamma band is less well characterized with respect to depression. We summarize some key findings on gamma rhythms (especially their amplitude) as a biomarker or endophenotype for major depression. These studies suggest: (1) under certain conditions gamma rhythms can distinguish subjects with major depression from healthy controls, (2) gamma may distinguish bipolar disorder from unipolar depression, (3) various pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments that counteract depression also alter gamma, (4) animal models of depression-like behavior show gamma abnormalities, with changes in gamma associated with therapeutic recovery. The most informative approaches in the future may combine profiles of gamma band power across the brain to assess ratios of activity across regions. Overall we have good evidence to suggest that gamma rhythms may provide objective information on major depressive disease status, but we will need further work to better define the precise measures to follow.

However, the extent to which mirror neurons (MNs) or other populations of neurons contribute to such EEG desynchronization is still unknown. Here, we provide the first evidence that, in the monkey, the neuronal activity recorded from the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) strongly contributes to the EEG changes occurring in the beta band over central scalp electrodes, during executed and observed actions. We simultaneously recorded scalp EEG and extracellular activity, Multi Unit Activity (MUA) and Local Field Potentials (LFP), from area F5 of two macaques executing and observing grasping actions. We found that MUA highly correlates with an increase in high gamma LFP power and, interestingly, such LFP power increase also correlates to EEG beta - and in part also to alpha - desynchronization. In terms of timing of signal changes, the increase in high gamma LFP power precedes the EEG desynchronization, during both action observation and execution, thus suggesting a causal role of PMv neuronal activity in the modulation of the alpha and beta mu-rhythm. Lastly, neuronal signals from deeper layers of PMv exert a greater contribution than superficial layers to the EEG beta rhythm modulation, especially during the motor task. Our findings have clear implications for EEG studies in that they demonstrate that the activity of different populations of neurons in PMv contribute to the generation of the mu-rhythm.

However, it is unknown how the sequence order information is maintained and represented in working memory and its behavioral significance, particularly in human subjects. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with a temporal response function (TRF) method to dissociate item-specific neuronal reactivations. We demonstrate that serially remembered items are successively reactivated during memory retention. The sequential replay displays two interesting properties compared to the actual sequence. First, the item-by-item reactivation is compressed within a 200 - 400 ms window, suggesting that external events are associated within a plasticity-relevant window to facilitate memory consolidation. Second, the replay is in a temporally reversed order and is strongly related to the recency effect in behavior. This fast-backward replay, previously revealed in rat hippocampus and demonstrated here in human cortical activities, might constitute a general neural mechanism for sequence memory and learning.

In view of the limitations of individual differences leading to reduce the accuracy of fatigue assessment, this paper proposed a method for driving fatigue assessment based on the feature fusion and transfer learning of electroencephalogram(EEG) and electromyography(EMG). The EEG and cervical EMG signals from 20 healthy subjects were recruited synchronously using the simulated driving platform. The time-frequency analysis method was used to extract the fatigue characteristics of EEG signals and EMG signals. A driver fatigue assessment model based on feature fusion and transfer learning was constructed to achieve effective identification of different drivers' fatigue state. The results showed that the recognition rate of driving fatigue based on the feature fusion and transfer learning of EEG and EMG was higher than traditional support vector machine method, and it could improve the robustness of driving fatigue assessment in different subjects. Therefore, this paper provides a new method for practical application of driving fatigue assessment based on physiological signal.

It is accompanied by a range of cognitive, affective, and social problems, but the neural dynamics underlying changes in emotional functions is poorly understood. To investigate the behavioral and brain indices of affective processing as a function of binge drinking, young, healthy participants (23.3 +/- 3.3 years) were assigned to two groups (n = 32 each) based on their drinking habits. Binge drinking (BD) participants reported drinking heavily with at least five binge episodes in the last 6 months, whereas light drinkers (LD) reported no more than one binge episode in the last 6 months. Participants provided subjective ratings of emotionally evocative images with negative, positive, erotic, and neutral themes mostly selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Electroencephalography (EEG) signal was recorded with a 64-channel system and analyzed in theta frequency band (4-7 Hz) with Morlet wavelets. Subjective ratings of the IAPS pictures were equivalent across both groups. However, affective modulation of event-related theta power both during early appraisal and later integrative processing stages was attenuated in BD, particularly those engaging in high-intensity drinking. These findings suggest that binge drinking is associated with altered neurophysiological indices of affective functions that are reflected in lower theta responsivity to emotions. The blunted long-range cortico-cortical and corticolimbic integration is consistent with compromised affective functions in alcohol use disorder. These findings may have implications for diagnostic and intervention strategies in heavy alcohol users.

EEG Factors After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Cardiac arrest; Pediatric	ELECTROGRAPHIC STATUS EPILEPTICUS; HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; CRITICALLY-ILL CHILDREN; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; INCREASED MORTALITY; ADULTS; AGREEMENT; OUTCOMES; TERMINOLOGY	Purpose: We aimed to determine whether conventional standardized EEG features could be consolidated into a more limited number of factors and whether the derived factor scores changed during the acute period after pediatric cardiac arrest. Methods: Children resuscitated after cardiac arrest underwent conventional continuous EEG monitoring. The EEG was scored in 12-hour epochs for up to 72-hours after return of circulation by an electroencephalographer using standardized critical care EEG terminology. We performed a polychoric factor analysis to determine whether numerous observed EEG features could be represented by a smaller number of derived factors. Linear mixed-effects regression models and heat maps evaluated whether the factor scores remained stable across epochs. Results: We performed EEG monitoring in 89 consecutive children, which yielded 453 EEG segments. We identified two factors, which were not correlated. The background features were factor loaded with the features continuity, voltage, and frequency. The intermittent features were factor loaded with the features of seizures, periodic patterns, and interictal discharges. Factor scores were calculated for each EEG segment. Linear, mixed-effect, regression results indicated that the factor scores did not change over time for the background features factor (coefficient, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.07; P = 0.52) or the intermittent features factor (coefficient, -0.003; 95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.01; P = 0.70). However, heat maps showed that some individual subjects did experience factor score changes over time, particularly if they had medium initial factor scores. Conclusions: Subsequent studies assessing whether EEG is informative for neurobehavioral outcomes after pediatric cardiac arrest could combine numerous EEG features into two factors, each reflecting multiple background and intermittent features. Furthermore, the factor scores would be expected to remain stable during the acute period for most subjects.

In this context we demonstrate the application of parallel computing for the estimation of the spectral properties of multichannel EEG signals, associated with the visual perception. Using CUDA C library we run wavelet-based algorithm on GPUs and show possibility for detection of specific patterns in multichannel set of EEG data in real-time.

It hereby can help improve the accuracy of EEG source localization. However, most of the current methods directly penalize the sources whose fMRI activation probability is low and estimate the sources activities at every time point. Thus, they do not account for the temporal interrelated and non-stationary features of electromagnetic brain signals, and some are too much dependent on the fMRI prior. Here, we propose a new fMRI informed EEG source localization method and is termed fMRI-informed spatio-temporal unifying tomography (FIST). It uses a mixed norm constraint defined in terms of time frequency decomposition of the sources and combines it with fMRI prior. The Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem. Both simulated and real EEG data are applied to assess the performance of the proposed method. Compared with L2-norm constrained methods, FIST has the superiority brain source estimation both in the spatial and temporal domains. By virtue of the fMRI information as a prior, FIST has great improvement in spatial accuracy and computational efficiency, when comparing with the method which only uses mixed-norm constraint. In addition, FIST shows good ability to select the fMRI priors to get a better estimation without totally depending on the prior, when comparing with the method which also has fMRI prior information.

Physical Activity, Nutrition, Cognition, Neurophysiology, and Short-Time Synaptic Plasticity in Healthy Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						older adults; synaptic plasticity; physical activity; nutrition; cognition; paired associative stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation; neurophysiology	MOTOR CORTICAL PLASTICITY; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PAIRED ASSOCIATIVE STIMULATION; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; CORTEX PLASTICITY; INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; DIFFERENTIAL MODULATION; EXERCISE; AGE; EXCITABILITY	The aging brain undergoes remodeling processes because of biological and environmental factors. To counteract brain aging, neuronal plasticity should be preserved. The aim of this study was to test if the capacity of generating short-time synaptic plasticity in older adults may be related to either physical activity, nutritional status, cognition, or neurophysiological activity. Thirty-six participants (mean age 73.3 +/- 5.9 years) received transcranial magnetic stimulation in combination with peripheral nerve stimulation to experimentally induce short-time synaptic plasticity by paired associative stimulation (PAS). Adaptations in neuronal excitability were assessed by motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the right m. tibialis anterior before and after PAS. The Physical Activity Questionnaire 50+ and the StepWatch (TM) captured physical activity levels. Nutritional status was assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment. Cognition was assessed by reaction time for a divided attention test and with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Neurophysiological activity was assessed by electroencephalography during the divided attention test. MEPs of the highest stimulation intensity resulted significantly different comparing before, 5 min, or 30 min after PAS (p < 0.05). Data-driven automatic hierarchical classification of the individual recruitment curve slopes over the three-time points indicated four different response types, however, response groups did not significantly differ based on physical activity, nutritional status, cognition, or neurophysiological activity. In a second-level analysis, participants having an increased slope showed a significant higher energy expenditure (z = -2.165, p = 0.030, r = 0.36) and revealed a significant higher power activity in the alpha frequency band (z = 2.008, p = 0.046, r = 0.37) at the prefrontal-located EEG electrodes, compared to the participants having a decreased slope. This study hints toward older adults differing in their neuronal excitability which is strongly associated to their short-time synaptic plasticity levels. Furthermore, a physically active lifestyle and higher EEG power in the alpha frequency band seem to be connected to the capacity of generating long-term potentiation-like synaptic plasticity in older adults. Future studies should consider more sensitive assessments and bigger sample sizes to get a broad scope of the older adults' population.

The power of EEG signal's phase synchronization is a parameter that has been commonly used in brain investigations. The Interchannels Phase Clustering (ICPC) method that we propose in our study, is an improved version of the Intertrial Phase Clustering (ICPC) method. Global and regional phase synchronization studies can be done with ICPC method. The method is applied to the signals produced by an EEG simulator and the results are computed with high accuracy. This method can be applied to neuropsychiatric diseases and provide important information on functional connectivity and cognitive functions.

Detection of generalized tonic-clonic seizures from ear-EEG based on EMG analysis	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Ear-EEG; Neurophysiological monitoring; GTCS; SUDEP prevention; Seizure detection; Epilepsy	SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; EPILEPSY; BIOMARKERS	Purpose: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) with most deaths occurring during sleep. Seizure detection devices have been suggested as a SUDEP prevention strategy. EMG-based GTCS detection can take advantage of the GTCS characteristic of sustained high-amplitude, high-frequency activity in the time-domain. Method: We present a GTCS-detection method based on median-filtered variance estimates on surface EMG measurements and describe its performance in a small exploratory proof-of-concept setting involving a group of 15 patients with 3 GTCS recorded with ear-EEG and another group of 6 patients with 11 GTCS recorded with scalp-EEG. Results: GTCS intervals were detected within 4.2-12.9 s of onset with 100% sensitivity (CI 29.2-100%) without false positives in 820.7 h of ear-EEG. The same detection method worked for the 11 GTCS from scalp EEG data with 100% sensitivity (CI 71.5-100%) and no false positives. Conclusions: Ear-EEG contains enough GTCS-specific EMG activity for GTCS detection to be feasible. Ear EEG could be considered for nocturnal GTCS monitoring as a supplement to SUDEP preventive interventions. (C) 2018 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In total, 29 pre-adolescents (9-12 years, 14 females), 29 mid-adolescents (13-17 years, 14 females), and 33 late adolescents (18-23 years, 17 females) had their resting brain activity measured using electroencephalography (EEG) during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Standardised Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) was used to estimate the cortical sources of spontaneous alpha. Two cortical sources were chosen as regions of interest (ROIs): prefrontal cortex and occipital cortex. Significant age-related changes in the cortical sources of alpha were found, particularly in prefrontal regions; prefrontal alpha power was greater during the eyes-open condition compared to the eyes-closed condition for late adolescents, but equivalent across the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions for both pre- and mid-adolescents. In addition, more advanced pubertal stage predicted reduced alpha power in male, but not female, adolescents aged 9-17 years. This study provides an important initial step towards understanding developmental changes in the cortical sources of spontaneous alpha in the typically developing brain. Moreover, the results from this study underscore the need to tease out the effects of age, gender, and puberty when examining the cortical sources of alpha during the adolescent period.

As window views are the most immediate medium of visual connection with one's neighbourhood, we surmised that the quality of this view would have an impact on the mental health and well-being of urban dwellers. Accordingly, we investigated how window views taken from different floors of a high-rise block with varying extents of green cover affected 29 healthy residents in an exploratory electroencephalography (EEG) experiment. The results showed that the amount of green cover within the view captured at different floor levels can cause an important interaction effect on the frontal alpha and temporal beta brain oscillations while participants view photographs. These results suggest that the brainwave patterns commonly associated with positive emotional states, motivation, and visual attention mechanisms may be increased by the extent of green cover within the view. This phenomenon seems more pronounced on the higher than lower floors. The observed findings at this stage cannot confirm major effects between floor level, green cover, and brainwaves, however, they emphasize the importance of considering the quality of window views in the planning and design of urban high-rise neighbourhoods. Having a green window view can potentially contribute to the mental health and well-being of urban dwellers.

We report our results with dataset IIb from BCI Competition 2008 provided by Graz University, and show an error reduction of 23% i.e. reduction from 34% to 26% error when compared with the best previously reported technique that used HMMs for brain signal classification. A comparison of performance with various types of wavelets combined with HMMs is also presented in this paper. Since wavelet decomposition increases feature dimensions, we anticipate that further improvement can be achieved by reducing the feature size by exploiting spatial correlation of data from EEG sensors.

The tight anatomical connections of the RSC with a wide range of other cortical regions processing spatial information support its vital role within the human navigation network. To better understand how different areas of the navigational network interact, we investigated the dynamic causal interactions of brain regions involved in solving a virtual navigation task. EEG signals were decomposed by independent component analysis (ICA) and subsequently examined for information flow between clusters of independent components (ICs) using direct short-time directed transfer function (sdDTF). The results revealed information flow between the anterior cingulate cortex and the left prefrontal cortex in the theta (4-7 Hz) frequency band and between the prefrontal, motor, parietal, and occipital cortices as well as the RSC in the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency band. When participants prefered to use distinct reference frames (egocentric vs. allocentric) during navigation was considered, a dominant occipito-parieto-RSC network was identified in allocentric navigators. These results are in line with the assumption that the RSC, parietal, and occipital cortices are involved in transforming egocentric visual-spatial information into an allocentric reference frame. Moreover, the RSC demonstrated the strongest causal flow during changes in orientation, suggesting that this structure directly provides information on heading changes in humans.

We leverage the time-frequency analysis capability of wavelets as well as HMMs ability of modeling dynamic signals to classify the movement of hands based on EEG signals captured from the brain. We report our results with dataset IIb from BCI Competition 2008 provided by Graz University, and show an error reduction of 23% i.e. reduction from 34% to 26% error when compared with the best previously reported technique that used HMMs for brain signal classification. A comparison of performance with various types of wavelets combined with HMMs is also presented in this paper. Since wavelet decomposition increases feature dimensions, we anticipate that further improvement can be achieved by reducing the feature size by exploiting spatial correlation of data from EEG sensors.

When multiple stimuli are involved, conditional associative learning is a gradual process with learning based on trial and error. It is established that a distributed network of regions track associative learning, however the role of neural oscillations in human learning remains less clear. Here we used scalp EEG to test how neural oscillations change during learning of arbitrary visuo-motor associations. Participants learned to associative 48 different abstract shapes to one of four button responses through trial and error over repetitions of the shapes. To quantify how well the associations were learned for each trial, we used a state-space computational model of learning that provided a probability of each trial being correct given past performance for that stimulus, that we take as a measure of the strength of the association. We used linear modelling to relate single-trial neural oscillations to single-trial measures of association strength. We found frontal midline theta oscillations during the delay period tracked learning, where theta activity was strongest during the early stages of learning and declined as the associations were formed. Further, posterior alpha and low-beta oscillations in the cue period showed strong desynchronised activity early in learning, while stronger alpha activity during the delay period was seen as associations became well learned. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects during early learning, before the associations were learned, related to improvements in memory seen on the next presentation of the stimulus. The current study provides clear evidence that frontal theta and posterior alpha/beta oscillations play a key role during associative memory formation.

More in particular, artists have been amongst the pioneers of the design of relevant applications since their emergence in the 1960s, pushing the boundaries of applications in real-life contexts. With the new research, advancements, and since 2007, the new low-cost commercial-grade wireless devices, there is a new increasing number of computer games, interactive installations, and performances that involve the use of these interfaces, combining scientific, and creative methodologies. The vast majority of these works use the brain-activity of a single participant. However, earlier, as well as recent examples, involve the simultaneous interaction of more than one participants or performers with the use of Electroencephalography (EEG)-based multi-brain BCIs. In this frame, we discuss and evaluate "Enheduanna-A Manifesto of Falling," a live brain-computer cinema performance that enables for the first time the simultaneous real-time multi-brain interaction of more than two participants, including a performer and members of the audience, using a passive EEG-based BCI system in the context of a mixed-media performance. The performance was realised as a neuroscientific study conducted in a real-life setting. The raw EEG data of seven participants, one performer and two different members of the audience for each performance, were simultaneously recorded during three live events. The results reveal that the majority of the participants were able to successfully identify whether their brain-activity was interacting with the live video projections or not. A correlation has been found between their answers to the questionnaires, the elements of the performance that they identified as most special, and the audience's indicators of attention and emotional engagement. Also, the results obtained from the performer's data analysis are consistent with the recall of working memory representations and the increase of cognitive load. Thus, these results prove the efficiency of the interaction design, as well as the importance of the directing strategy, dramaturgy and narrative structure on the audience's perception, cognitive state, and engagement.

As an approach to enhance the effectiveness of rTMS, continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) has been demonstrated to be efficient and safe. However, it is unclear how cTBS affects brain processes related to emotion. In particular, psychophysiological studies on the underlying neural mechanisms are sparse. In the current study, we investigated how the cTBS influences emotional processing when applied over the right PFC. Participants performed an emotion recognition Go/NoGo task, which asked them to select a GO response to either happy or fearful faces after the cTBS or after sham stimulation, while 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. EEG oscillation was examined using event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in a time-interval between 170 and 310 ms after face stimuli onset. In the sham group, we found a significant difference in the alpha band between response to happy and fearful stimuli but that effect did not exist in the cTBS group. The alpha band activity at the scalp was reduced suggesting the excitatory effect at the brain level. The beta and gamma band activity was not sensitive to cTBS intervention. The results of the current study demonstrate that cTBS does affect emotion processing and the effect is reflected in changes in EEG oscillations in the alpha band specifically. The results confirm the role of prefrontal cortex in emotion processing. We also suggest that this pattern of cTBS results elucidates mechanisms by which mood improvement in depressive disorders is achieved using cTBS intervention.

The approach includes the study of EEG (electroencephalogram) signal features acquired in a spatial attention task. The process comprises of EEG feature selection based on the feature distribution, followed by the stepwise discriminant analysis- (SDA-) based channel selection. Repeated measure analysis of variance (rANOVA) is applied to test the statistical significance of the selected features. Classifiers are developed and compared using the selected features to classify the target and distractor present in visual hemifields. The results provide a maximum classification accuracy of 87.2% and 86.1% and an average classification accuracy of 76.5 +/- 4% and 76.2 +/- 5.3% over the thirteen subjects corresponding to the two task conditions. These correlates present a step towards building a feature-based neurofeedback system for visual attention.

Although most of studies treat nonsinusoidal waves as a nuisance or just ignore them, fortunately some scientists are starting to exploit their neurophysiological relevance opening new research vistas with critical implications.

Addressing the Language Binding Problem With Dynamic Functional Connectivity During Meaningful Spoken Language Comprehension	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						speech comprehension; dynamic functional connectivity; phase synchrony; PLI (phase lag index); gamma; theta	HUMAN EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; SPEECH; INTEGRATION; BRAIN; MECHANISMS; SENTENCES; COHERENCE; FRAMEWORK	During speech, how does the brain integrate information processed on different timescales and in separate brain areas so we can understand what is said? This is the language binding problem. Dynamic functional connectivity (brief periods of synchronization in the phase of EEG oscillations) may provide some answers. Here we investigate time and frequency characteristics of oscillatory power and phase synchrony (dynamic functional connectivity) during speech comprehension. Twenty adults listened to meaningful English sentences and non-sensical "Jabberwocky" sentences in which pseudo-words replaced all content words, while EEG was recorded. Results showed greater oscillatory power and global connectivity strength (mean phase lag index) in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) for English compared to Jabberwocky. Increased power and connectivity relative to baseline was also seen in the theta frequency range (4-7 Hz), but was similar for English and Jabberwocky. High-frequency gamma oscillations may reflect a mechanism by which the brain transfers and integrates linguistic information so we can extract meaning and understand what is said. Slower frequency theta oscillations may support domain-general processing of the rhythmic features of speech. Our findings suggest that constructing a meaningful representation of speech involves dynamic interactions among distributed brain regions that communicate through frequency-specific functional networks.

These signals are usually analyzed using features taken from time and frequency domain. In theoryaEuroe these dynamics can also be analyzed utilizing Poincar, plane that intersects system's trajectory. HoweveraEuroe selecting an appropriate Poincar, plane is a crucial part of extracting best Poincar, samples. There is no unique way to choose a Poincar, planeaEuroe because it is highly dependent to the system dynamics. In this study, a new algorithm is introduced that automatically selects an optimum Poincar, plane able to transfer maximum information from EEG time series to a set of Poincar, samples. In this algorithmaEuroe EEG time series are first embedded; then a parametric Poincar, plane is designed and finally the parameters of the plane are optimized using genetic algorithm. The presented algorithm is tested on EEG signals and the optimum Poincar, plane is obtained with more than 99% data information transferred. Results are compared with some typical method of creating Poinare samples and showed that the transferred information using with this method is higher. The generated samples can be used for feature extraction and further analysis.

Physiological neocortical ripples can be recognized in scalp EEGs of children. We investigated how often scalp-EEG recorded ripples co-occur with different types of sleep-specific transients, the distribution and spatial extent of ripples with and without co-occurring sleep-specific transients, and the occurrence of ripples across sleep stages. Methods: We marked ripples in daytime sleep-EEGs of 19 children and determined for each ripple if it co-occurred with a sleep-specific transient. We compared the distribution of ripples without co-occurring sleep-specific transients to the distribution of all ripples. We estimated the spatial extent of simultaneously occurring ripples by counting how many EEG regions they comprised. We compared ripple rate per sleep stage using Friedman's analysis of variance and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: 74.4 % of ripples co-occurred with sleep-specific transients: 27.8 % with vertex waves, 14.7 % with hypnagogic hypersynchrony, 13.7 % with slow waves, 12.2 % with spindles, and 6.0 % with K-complexes. Ripples without co-occurring sleep-specific transients showed the same central dominance but a significantly less pronounced midline dominance than the overall distribution pattern. Spatial extent was larger when ripples co-occurred with sleep-specific transients. Ripple rates during nonrapid eye movement (N) sleep stages N1 and N2 were higher than during N3 (T = 22.00, p = 0.02 and T = 23.00, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Scalp-EEG recorded physiological ripples co-occur with various sleep-specific EEG-transients, especially with vertex waves. These ripples occur most frequently during light sleep.

In previous studies, neural entrainment related to auditory stimuli and motor activity was observed during SMS to auditory stimuli. This study investigates the cross-modulation responses to oscillations of auditory stimuli and motor-related activity. The results suggest that a population of output neurons, which occur products of the two input oscillations caused by stimuli and motor activity, could exist. It has not been clarified, however, whether cross interaction is observable in the EEG during SMS while using visual stimuli. This paper presents the results of an analysis of electroencephalogram during SMS to visual and auditory stimuli. We observed cross-modulation responses during SMS not only to auditory stimuli, but also to visual stimuli. Our results confirm the existence of output neurons, which result as a product of two input oscillations.

Across four experiments using different samples of participants, we provide evidence that right temporal alpha oscillations play a crucial role in inhibiting habitual thinking modes, thereby paving the way for accessing more remote ideas. In the first experiment, participants completed the compound remote associate task (RAT) in three separate sessions: during right temporal alpha (10 Hz) transcranial alternating current brain stimulation (tACS), left temporal alpha tACS, and sham tACS. Participants performed better under right tACS only on RAT items in which two of the three words shared misleading semantic associations. In the second experiment, we measured EEG while the participants solved RAT items with or without shared misleading associations. We observed an increase in right temporal alpha power when participants correctly solved RAT items with misleading semantic associations. The third experiment demonstrated that while solving divergent thinking tasks participants came up with more remote ideas when stimulated by right temporal alpha tACS. In the fourth experiment, we found that participants showed higher right temporal alpha power when generating more remote uses for common objects. These studies altogether indicate that right temporal alpha oscillations may support creativity by acting as a neural mechanism for an active inhibition of obvious semantic associations.

This recent experience is usually an information-rich and dynamic representation of the world around us. We here show that associating a static cue with a previously shown dynamic stimulus yields a detectable, dynamic representation of this stimulus. We further implicate this representation in the decrease of low-frequency power (approximate to 4-30 Hz) in the ongoing EEG, which is a well-known correlate of successful memory formation. The reappearance of content-specific patterns in desynchronizing brain oscillations was observed in two sensory domains, that is, in a visual condition and in an auditory condition. Together with previous results, these data suggest a mechanism that generalizes across domains and processes, in which the decrease in oscillatory power allows for the dynamic representation of information in ongoing brain oscillations.

The frequency dependent properties for the main steps of the mechanism, the rotation of dipolar water molecules, the disturbance of hydrogen bonds and the enhancement of diffusion, were evaluated based on published theoretical and experimental data. The investigation of frequency dependence of the MWR effect on the modulation frequency was performed using 450 MHz MWR, SAR 0.3 W/kg. The relative changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) signal power between the EEG segments with and without MWR exposure were selected as a measure for detection of the effect. Additional experiment at modulation frequencies 217 and 1000 Hz was performed and the raw data from our EEG database at modulation frequencies 14, 21, 40 and 70 Hz were also employed. Experimental results showed enhancement of EEG power with MWR exposure at all modulation frequencies; the changes were statistically significant at 14, 21, 40, 70 and 217 Hz. The analysis of published data confirms that the low-level MWR effect is limited to carrier frequencies up to around 100 GHz. The experimental results suggest that the effect of modulated low-level MWR on brain bioelectrical oscillations is not limited to the modulation frequencies within the EEG spectrum.

The mechanisms underlying the time-dependent effects of acute cardiovascular exercise on motor memory consolidation, however, remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of a single bout of cardiovascular exercise performed immediately after motor skill practice on those mechanisms using electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG). Specifically, we assessed exercise-induced changes in the activity and connectivity of cortico-motor networks during early consolidation and the impact of these changes on skill retention. Participants practiced a visuo-motor tracking task followed by either a short bout of intense exercise or a rest period. EEG along with EMG data of hand muscles were collected during the production of low-force isometric contractions. Event-related desynchronization, functional connectivity and corticomuscular coherence were measured at baseline, 30, 60 and 90 min after the bout of exercise or the rest period. Improvements in motor memory were inferred via retention tests of the motor skill performed 8 and 24 h after motor practice. We found that participants who performed the single bout of exercise showed better motor skill retention 24 h after motor practice. This improvement in skill retention in the exercise group was associated with significant decreases in beta-band event-related desynchronization in EEG electrodes located over the left sensorimotor areas. We also found that after exercise, alpha-, and even more significantly, beta-band functional connectivity, increased between EEG electrodes located over left and right sensorimotor areas. The exercise group also showed greater beta-band corticomuscular coherence but only in a small number of electrodes. Neither functional connectivity nor corticomuscular coherence measures correlated with skill retention scores. This is the first study exploring brain mechanisms underlying the summative effects of motor learning and cardiovascular exercise on motor memory consolidation. We have identified potential neural substrates through which a single bout of acute exercise, when performed in close temporal proximity to motor practice, strengthens motor memories. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into a better understanding of the complex temporal relationship existing between cardiovascular exercise and motor memory consolidation.

Competition, in particular, has become a core topic in social neuroscience since it stresses the relevance and salience of social comparison processes between the inter-agents that are involved in a common task. The majority of studies, however, investigated such kind of social interaction via one-person individual paradigms, thus not taking into account relevant information concerning interdependent participants' behavioral and neural responses. In the present study, dyads of volunteers participated in a hyperscanning paradigm and competed in a computerized attention task while their electrophysiological (EEG) activity and performance were monitored and recorded. Behavioral data and inter-brain coupling measures based on EEG frequency data were then computed and compared across different experimental conditions: a control condition (individual task, t0), a first competitive condition (pre-feedback condition, t1), and a second competitive condition following a positive reinforcing feedback (post-feedback condition, t2). Results: Results showed that during competitive tasks participants' performance was improved with respect to control condition (reduced response times and error rates), with a further specific improvement after receiving a reinforcing feedback. Concurrently, we observed a reduction of inter-brain functional connectivity (primarily involving bilateral prefrontal areas) for slower EEG frequency bands (delta and theta). Finally, correlation analyses highlighted a significant association between cognitive performance and inter-brain connectivity measures. Conclusions: The present results may help identifying specific patterns of behavioral and inter-brain coupling measures associated to competition and processing of social reinforcements.

Diverse lines of evidence suggest that neuronal accumulation of tau promotes network dysfunction and cognitive decline. The A152T-variant of human tau (hTau-A152T) increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several other tauopathies. When overexpressed in neurons of transgenic mice, it causes age-dependent neuronal loss and cognitive decline, as well as non-convulsive epileptic activity, which is also seen in patients with AD. Using intracranial EEG recordings with electrodes implanted over the parietal cortex, we demonstrate that hTau-A152T increases the power of brain oscillations in the 0.5-6 Hz range more than wildtype human tau in transgenic lines with comparable levels of human tau protein in brain, and that genetic ablation of endogenous tau in Mapt(-/-) mice decreases the power of these oscillations as compared to wildtype controls. Suppression of hTau-A152T production in doxycycline-regulatable transgenic mice reversed their abnormal network activity. Treatment of hTau-A152T mice with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam also rapidly and persistently reversed their brain dysrhythmia and network hypersynchrony. These findings suggest that both the level and the sequence of tau modulate the power of specific brain oscillations. The potential of EEG spectral changes as a biomarker deserves to be explored in clinical trials of tau-lowering therapeutics. Our results also suggest that levetiracetam treatment is able to counteract tau-dependent neural network dysfunction. Tau reduction and levetiracetam treatment may be of benefit in AD and other conditions associated with brain dysrhythmias and network hypersynchrony.

In this study, we propose discriminative periodic component analysis (D pi CA) that takes advantage of the almost periodic nature of SSVEP without depending on ideal rigid templates. D pi CA tries to maximize the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of SSVEP components by utilizing the time structure of the stimulus frequencies embedded in the electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The performance of the proposed method was compared with standard canonical correlation analysis (CCA) using data collected from ten subjects. The results suggest that the D pi CA provides better detection accuracy compared to standard CCA across various window lengths and subjects. Furthermore, the statistical tests show that the D pi CA provides consistent and significant performance improvement than CCA even at short window lengths.	[Kumar, Kiran G.

In this study, we demonstrate that the classical algorithm of multiscale Lempel-Ziv complexity (multiscale LZC or MLZ) has a critical limitation in neglecting rapid rhythms in complex systems. To this end, simulations added with different levels of white noise are designed to examine whether or not MLZ calculation neglects the effects of high-frequency noise. In addition, an algorithm by obtaining coarse-grained multiscale LZC, so-called generalized multiscale LZC (gMLZ), is proposed to yield a spectrum of complexity. A series of simulated non-stationary signals are generated for comparing the performances between MLZ and gMLZ. Besides, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), characterized by the excessive synchronization of neuronal activity, has been associated with its power and physiological states. To understand how the synchronization of neuronal activities in different phase-A subtypes in exerting an influence over its power and complexity, we analyze the gMLZ of the real CAP database and compare it to its power spectra as well as modified multiscale entropy (MMSE), which is one of the most well-known multiscale complexity-based measures. The novel algorithm reveals that the evaluated complexities in different phase-A subtypes are inversely related to both the power and excessive synchronization in different timescales in general. The impact of frequencies, sleep stages and pathophysiological conditions on these two complexity measures is also examined. The discerning abilities of different phase-A subtypes using coarse-grained complexity measures (gMLZ and MMSE) are more consistent than power across different time scales. Our approach makes up a deficiency in handling with high-frequency oscillations and enables us to examine complexities of nonlinear systems in a wide-range of timescales.

Detecting Unattended Stimuli Depends on the Phase of Prestimulus Neural Oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; attention; neural oscillations; perception; phase; theta	VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; EEG; EXCITABILITY; RESOLUTION	Neural oscillations appear important for perception and attention processes because stimulus detection is dependent upon the phase of 7-11 Hz oscillations before stimulus onset. Previous work has examined stimulus detection at attended locations, but it is unknown whether unattended locations are also subject to phasic modulation by ongoing oscillatory activity, as would be predicted by theories proposing a role for neural oscillations in organizing general neural processing. Here, we recorded brain activity with EEG while human participants of both sexes detected brief visual targets preceded by a spatial cue and determined whether performance for cued (attended) and uncued (unattended) targets was influenced by oscillatory phase across a range of frequencies. Detection of both attended and unattended targets depended upon an similar to 5 Hz theta rhythm and an similar to 11-15 Hz alpha rhythm. Critically, detection of unattended stimuli was more strongly modulated by the phase of theta oscillations than was detection of attended stimuli, suggesting that attentional allocation involves a disengagement from ongoing theta sampling. There was no attention-related difference in the strength of alpha phase dependence, consistent with a perceptual rather than attentional role of oscillatory phase in this frequency range. These results demonstrate the importance of neural oscillations in modulating visual processing at both attended and unattended locations and clarify one way in which attention may produce its effects: through disengagement from low-frequency sampling at attended locations.

J	Adamos, DA; Laskaris, NA; Micheloyannis, S				Adamos, Dimitrios A.; Laskaris, Nikolaos A.; Micheloyannis, Sifis			Harnessing functional segregation across brain rhythms as a means to detect EEG oscillatory multiplexing during music listening	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						functional segregation; node-switching; functional reorganization	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA-BAND; CONNECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; NETWORKS; RESPONSES; SYNTAX; CORTEX	Objective. Music, being a multifaceted stimulus evolving at multiple timescales, modulates brain function in a manifold way that encompasses not only the distinct stages of auditory perception, but also higher cognitive processes like memory and appraisal. Network theory is apparently a promising approach to describe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during music listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined within the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Approach. Using naturalistic music, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with different cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to quantify the interplay among rhythms. It was also contrasted against the structure from the rest and noise listening conditions to reveal the specific components stemming from music listening. Our methodology includes an efficient graph-partitioning algorithm, which is further utilized for mining prototypical modular patterns, and a novel algorithmic procedure for identifying 'switching nodes' (i.e. recording sites) that consistently change module during music listening. Main results. Our results suggest the multiplex character of the music-induced functional reorganization and particularly indicate the dependence between the networks reconstructed from the delta and beta(H) rhythms. This dependence is further justified within the framework of nested neural oscillations and fits perfectly within the context of recently introduced cortical entrainment to music. Significance. Complying with the contemporary trends towards a multi-scale examination of the brain network organization, our approach specifies the form of neural coordination among rhythms during music listening. Considering its computational efficiency, and in conjunction with the flexibility of in situ electroencephalography, it may lead to novel assistive tools for real-life applications.

J	Diaz, J; Bassi, A; Coolen, A; Vivaldi, EA; Letelier, JC				Diaz, Javier; Bassi, Alejandro; Coolen, Alex; Vivaldi, Ennio A.; Letelier, Juan-Carlos			Envelope analysis links oscillatory and arrhythmic EEG activities to two types of neuronal synchronization	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							THETA OSCILLATIONS; CELL ASSEMBLIES; SLEEP; ORIGIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MECHANISMS; AVALANCHES; PATTERNS; KURAMOTO; BEHAVIOR	Traditionally, EEG is understood as originating from the synchronous activation of neuronal populations that generate rhythmic oscillations in specific frequency bands. Recently, new neuronal dynamics regimes have been identified (e.g. neuronal avalanches) characterized by irregular or arrhythmic activity. In addition, it is starting to be acknowledged that broadband properties of EEG spectrum (following a 1/f law) are tightly linked to brain function. Nevertheless, there is still no theoretical framework accommodating the coexistence of these two EEG phenomenologies: rhythmic/narrowband and arrhythmic/broadband. To address this problem, we present a new framework for EEG analysis based on the relation between the Gaussianity and the envelope of a given signal. EEG Gaussianity is a relevant assessment because if EEG emerges from the superposition of uncorrelated sources, it should exhibit properties of a Gaussian process, otherwise, as in the case of neural synchronization, deviations from Gaussianity should be observed. We use analytical results demonstrating that the coefficient of variation of the envelope (CVE) of Gaussian noise (or any of its filtered sub-bands) is the constant root 4/pi - 1 approximate to 0.523, thus enabling CVE to be a useful metric to assess EEG Gaussianity. Furthermore, a new and highly informative analysis space (envelope characterization space) is generated by combining the CVE and the envelope average amplitude. We use this space to analyze rat EEG recordings during sleep-wake cycles. Our results show that delta, theta and sigma bands approach Gaussianity at the lowest EEG amplitudes while exhibiting significant deviations at high EEG amplitudes. Deviations to low-CVE appeared prominently during REM sleep, associated with theta rhythm, a regime consistent with the dynamics shown by the synchronization of weakly coupled oscillators. On the other hand, deviations to high-CVE, appearing mostly during NREM sleep associated with EEG phasic activity and high-amplitude Gaussian waves, can be interpreted as the arrhythmic superposition of transient neural synchronization events. These two different manifestations of neural synchrony (low-CVE/high-CVE) explain the well-known spectral differences between REM and NREM sleep, while also illuminating the origin of the EEG 1/f spectrum.

It mainly targets brain status and communication, thus providing potential to trace differences in the brain's activity under different anesthetics. In this article, two kinds of gamma-amino butyric acid (type A -GABAA) dependent anesthetic agents, propofol and desflurane (28 and 23 patients), were studied and compared with respect to EEG spectrogram dynamics. Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was employed to compute the time varying spectrum for different anesthetic levels in comparison with Fourier based method. Results show that the HHT method generates consistent band power (slow and alpha) dominance pattern as Fourier method does, but exhibits higher concentrated power distribution within each frequency band than the Fourier method during both drugs induced unconsciousness. HHT also finds slow and theta bands peak frequency with better convergence by standard deviation (propofol-slow: 0.46 to 0.24; theta: 1.42 to 0.79; desflurane-slow: 0.30 to 0.25; theta: 1.42 to 0.98) and a shift to relatively lower values for alpha band (propofol: 9.94 Hz to 10.33 Hz, desflurane 8.44 Hz to 8.84 Hz) than Fourier one. For different stage comparisons, although HHT shows significant alpha power increases during unconsciousness stage as the Fourier did previously, it finds no significant high frequency (low gamma) band power difference in propofol whereas it does in desflurane. In addition, when comparing the HHT results within two groups during unconsciousness, high beta band power in propofol is significantly larger than that of desflurane while delta band power behaves oppositely. In conclusion, this study convincingly shows that EEG analyzed here considerably differs between the HHT and Fourier method.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of TGC. The subjects included 90 patients with schizophrenia and 90 healthy controls. We compared the TGC results between the groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to adjust for age and sex and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to examine the discrimination ability of delta to gamma frequency bands and TGC. Patients with schizophrenia showed a significant increase in the resting-state TGC at all 19 electrodes. The analysis of the ROC curves for each frequency band exhibited relatively low classification accuracies for the delta, theta, slow alpha, fast alpha, and beta power. The TGC generated the most accurate results among the electroencephalography (EEG) measures, with an overall classification accuracy of 92.5%. The resting-state TGC value was increased in patients with schizophrenia compared to that in healthy controls and had a higher discriminating ability than the other parameters. These findings may be related to the compensatory hyper-arousal patterns of the dysfunctional default-mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. Therefore, resting-state TGC is a promising neurophysiological marker of schizophrenia.

J	Gupta, A; Bhushan, B; Behera, L				Gupta, Ashish; Bhushan, Braj; Behera, Laxmidhar			Short-term enhancement of cognitive functions and music: A three-channel model	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SPECTRAL EEG PARAMETERS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MOZART MUSIC; INTELLIGENCE; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; COHERENCE; ATTENTION; ALPHA; CONNECTIVITY	Short-term effects of music stimulus on enhancement of cognitive functions in human brain are documented, however the underlying neural mechanisms in these cognitive effects are not well investigated. In this study, we have attempted to decipher the mechanisms involved in alterations of neural networks that lead to enhanced cognitive effects post-exposure to music. We have investigated the changes in Electroencephalography (EEG) power and functional connectivity of alpha band in resting state of the brain after exposure to Indian classical music. We have quantified the changes in functional connectivity by phase coherence, phase delay, and phase slope index analyses. Spatial mapping of functional connectivity dynamics thus obtained, on brain networks revealed reduced information flow in long-distance connections between frontal and parietal cortex, and between other cortical regions underpinning intelligence. Analyses also showed increased power in the prefrontal and occipital cortex. With these findings, we have developed a stimulus-mechanism-end effect based neuro-cognitive model that explains the music induced cognitive enhancement by a three-channel framework - (1) enhanced global efficiency of brain, (2) enhanced local neural efficiency at the prefrontal lobe, and (3) increased sustained attention. Results signify that music directly affects the cognitive system and leads to improved brain efficiency through well-defined mechanisms.

The impact of goal-oriented task design on neurofeedback learning for brain-computer interface control	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						EEG; Neurofeedback; Biofeedback; Motor imagery; Brain-computer interface	MOTOR IMAGERY; MENTAL PRACTICE; STROKE; RECOVERY; SKILL; OSCILLATIONS; SEQUENCES; BLIND; TRIAL; EEG	Neurofeedback training teaches individuals to modulate brain activity by providing real-time feedback and can be used for brain-computer interface control. The present study aimed to optimize training by maximizing engagement through goal-oriented task design. Participants were shown either a visual display or a robot, where each was manipulated using motor imagery (MI)-related electroencephalography signals. Those with the robot were instructed to quickly navigate grid spaces, as the potential for goal-oriented design to strengthen learning was central to our investigation. Both groups were hypothesized to show increased magnitude of these signals across 10 sessions, with the greatest gains being seen in those navigating the robot due to increased engagement. Participants demonstrated the predicted increase in magnitude, with no differentiation between hemispheres. Participants navigating the robot showed stronger left-hand MI increases than those with the computer display. This is likely due to success being reliant on maintaining strong MI-related signals. While older participants showed stronger signals in early sessions, this trend later reversed, suggesting greater natural proficiency but reduced flexibility. These results demonstrate capacity for modulating neurofeedback using MI over a series of training sessions, using tasks of varied design. Importantly, the more goal-oriented robot control task resulted in greater improvements.	[McWhinney, S. R.; Tremblay, A.; Boe, S.

J	Wu, ZH				Wu, Zhenghua			Application of a reconstruction technique in detection of dominant SSVEP frequency	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); Brain-computer interface (BCI); Reconstruction extraction (RE); Power spectrum (PS); Canonical correlation analysis (CCA)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; BCIS; RECOGNITION; TOPOGRAPHY; COMPONENTS; RESPONSES; TASK	Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) have a number of specific properties such as an oscillating feature when compared to event-related potentials (ERPs). Based on this oscillating property, a short electroencephalogram (EEG) segment containing an SSVEP can be used to reconstruct a series of EEG segments where the SSVEP has the same initial phase but the phase of the background EEG varies randomly. When these reconstructed EEG segments are averaged, the background EEG is weakened, whereas the SSVEP is strengthened. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SSVEP in the averaged signal is significantly improved. This reconstruction technique is first proposed in this work, and the method of extracting SSVEPs based on this technique is referred to as the reconstruction extraction (RE) method. The RE, power spectrum (PS), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods were applied to EEG segments that were 1s in length in order to detect SSVEPs. The results show that the detection accuracy of the RE method is similar to that of the CCA method, although it is higher than that of the PS method in situations where the SSVEP has low strength. However, in contrast to the CCA, the RE can be applied using only one signal electrode. This suggests that the RE method can be adopted in a real-time SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accordingly, our recent study on transgenic TgF344-AD rats modeling AD showed an age-dependent reduction of stimulation-induced oscillations in the hippocampus, and disrupted long-range connectivity together with enhanced neuronal excitability in the cortex, reflected in greatly increased expression of high-voltage spindles, an epileptic absence seizure-like activity. To better understand the translational value of observed oscillatory abnormalities in these rats, we examine here the effects of donepezil, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor clinically approved for AD treatment. Methods: Brainstem nucleus pontis oralis stimulation-induced hippocampal oscillations were recorded under urethane anesthesia in adult (6-month-old) and aged (12-month-old) TgF344-AD and wild-type rats. Spontaneous cortical activity was monitored in a cohort of freely behaving aged rats implanted with frontal and occipital cortical electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes. Results: Subcutaneous administration of donepezil significantly augmented stimulation-induced hippocampal theta oscillation in aged wild-type rats and both adult and aged TgF344-AD rats, which have been previously shown to have diminished response to nucleus pontis oralis stimulation. Moreover, in adult TgF344-AD rats, donepezil also significantly increased theta phase-gamma amplitude coupling in the hippocampus during stimulation. However, neither of these effects were significantly changed in adult wild-type rats. Under freely behaving conditions, donepezil treatment had the opposite effect on cortical oscillatory connectivity in TgF344-AD and wild-type rats, and it reduced the occurrence of high-voltage spindle activity in TgF344-AD rats. Conclusions: Together, these results imply that pharmacologically enhancing cholinergic tone with donepezil could partially reverse oscillatory abnormalities in TgF344-AD rats, which is in line with its clinical effectiveness in AD patients. Therefore, our study suggests good translational opportunities for these neurophysiological signals recorded in TgF344-AD rats, and their application could be considered in drug discovery efforts for developing therapies with disease-modifying potential.

This study utilizes the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to categorize emotions from encephalography (EEG) recordings. In the past, EMD has proven to be a very useful signal analysis tool because of its ability to decompose nonstationary signals, like those from an EEG, into component signals with varying frequency content called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The method in this paper utilizes three features extracted from the IMFs-the first difference of time, the first difference of phase, and the normalized energy-for data categorization using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Two classifiers were trained for each subject, one for valence and another for arousal. The mean accuracies yielded for valence and arousal were 75.86% and 75.31%, respectively. The results of this study verify previous findings by other researchers that these three features are useful in emotion recognition when applied to previously recorded EEG data, though we add the caveat that subject-specific classifiers are needed instead of generalized, global classifiers.

Slow waves often appear in the A1 part of the cyclic alternating patterns (CAP), which correlate with a number of behavioral and biological parameters, but their physiological significance is not adequately known. We automatically detected slow waves from the scalp recordings of 37 healthy patients, visually identified CAP A1 events and compared slow waves during CAP A1 with those during NCAP. For each slow wave, we computed the amplitude, slopes, frequency, synchronization (synchronization likelihood) between specific cortical areas, as well as the location of origin and scalp propagation of individual waves. CAP A1 slow waves were characterized by greater spatial extent and amplitude, steeper slopes and greater cortical synchronization, but a similar prominence in frontal areas and similar propagation patterns to other areas on the scalp. Our results indicate that CAP A1 represents a period of highly synchronous neuronal firing over large areas of the cortical mantle. This feature may contribute to the role CAP A1 plays in both normal synaptic homeostasis and in the generation of epileptiform phenomena in epileptic patients.

Patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) were classified into these two categories by fitting and testing a generalised linear model. We aimed subsequently to develop an automated system for outcome prediction in severe DOC by selecting an optimal subset of features using sequential floating forward selection (SFFS). The two outcome categories were defined as UWS or dead, and MCS or emerged from MCS. Percentage of time spent in microstate D in the alpha frequency band performed best at distinguishing MCS from UWS patients. The average clustering coefficient obtained from thresholding beta coherence performed best at predicting outcome. The optimal subset of features selected with SFFS consisted of the frequency of microstate A in the 2-20 Hz frequency band, path length obtained from thresholding alpha coherence, and average path length obtained from thresholding alpha coherence. Combining these features seemed to afford high prediction power.

However, studies examining whether the adjustment of the phase angle of oscillations is under top-down attentional control have thus far yielded conflicting results. A possible source for the discrepancy could be that the estimation of the phase of ongoing oscillations as well as its uniformity across trials could be affected by task induced changes in the power of oscillations or concurrent evoked responses. One measure, Inter-Trial Phase-Locking (ITPC), or the uniformity of phase angles across trials, is particularly vulnerable to these factors. Here, using various simulations modelling the common task induced changes in the EEG reported in the literature, we demonstrate that apparent changes in Inter-Trial Phase-Locking of oscillatory activity can occur independent of any actual change in the phase of the ongoing activity.

J	van Ede, F				van Ede, Freek			Mnemonic and attentional roles for states of attenuated alpha oscillations in perceptual working memory: a review	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						attentional prioritisation; electroencephalography; neuronal oscillations; sensory recruitment; working memory retention	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ORIENTING ATTENTION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; MODULATION; INFORMATION; MAINTENANCE; CORTEX	Alpha oscillations are often reported to be amplified during working memory (WM) retention, serving to disengage sensory areas to protect internal representations from external interference. At the same time, contemporary views of WM postulate that sensory areas may often also be recruited for retention. I here review recent evidence that during such perceptual' WM, alpha oscillations in mnemonically relevant sensory areas are not amplified but attenuated instead. I will argue that such attenuated alpha states serve a mnemonic role and, further, that larger attenuation may support item-specific attentional prioritisation within perceptual WM. In critically evaluating this role, I also consider (and argue against) four alternatives to a strictly mnemonic account of the available data that may also prove useful to consider in future research. Finally, I highlight key implications of these data for the study of WM and for our understanding of the functional roles of states of attenuated alpha oscillations in cognition.

A person's current and chronic motivational direction - that is, approach versus avoidance orientation - is reliably reflected in the asymmetry of frontal cortical low-frequency oscillations. Using resting electroencephalography (EEG), we show that frontal asymmetry is predictive of the tendency to yield to social influence: Stronger right- than left-side frontolateral activation during a resting-state session prior to the experiment was robustly associated with a stronger inclination to adopt a peer group's judgments during perceptual decision-making (Study 1). We posit that this reflects the role of a person's chronic avoidance orientation in socially adjusted behavior. This claim was strongly supported by additional survey investigations (Studies 2a, 2b, 2c), all of which consistently revealed that trait avoidance was positively linked to the susceptibility to social influence. The present contribution thus stresses the relevance of chronic avoidance orientation in social conformity, refining (yet not contradicting) the longstanding view that socially influenced behavior is motivated by approach-related goals. Moreover, our findings valuably underscore and extend our knowledge on the association between frontal cortical asymmetry and a variety of psychological variables.

Gamma oscillations are considered as an index of the brain's general cognitive activity; however, the role of gamma oscillations in disease has not been studied sufficiently. Aim: This study aimed to determine if gamma power during rest can be used to predict response to anti-depressant medication treatment. Method: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score and resting state gamma power was measured in 18 medication-free patients during an episode of major depression. After 6 weeks of paroxetine monotherapy HDRS was administered again. Results: Baseline gamma power at frontal, central and temporal electrodes before treatment was significantly related to post-treatment change in HDRS scores.

EEG has been used in various neurological disorders tomonitor functional brain states such as impaired consciousness including brain death, epilepsy, sleep disorders and cerebrovascular diseases. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by producing epileptic seizure caused by abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. EEG is an essential method to make diagnosis, classification, and localization of seizure focus in epilepsy, and is actually most commonly used in epilepsy and seizure disorders. In this chapter, I'll focus on how EEG analysis can contribute to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, particularly to epilepsy surgery. As detailed theoretical and technological aspects of EEG analyses are introduced in other chapters, only clinical applicability and significance of these methods will be reviewed here.

Although portable electroencephalography (EEG) can be used while exergaming, it is unknown whether brain activity will be obscured by movement artifacts. The aims of this study were to assess whether electrophysiological measurements during exergaming are feasible and if so, whether cortical activity changes with additional cognitive elements. Twenty-four young adults performed self-paced sideways leaning movements, followed by two blocks of exergaming in which participants completed a puzzle by leaning left or right to select the correct piece. At the easy level, only the correct piece was shown, while two pieces were presented at the choice level. Brain activity was recorded using a 64-channel passive EEG system. After filtering, an adaptive mixture independent component analysis identified the spatio-temporal sources of brain activity. Results showed that it is feasible to record brain activity in young adults while playing exergames. Furthermore, five spatially different clusters were identified located frontal, bilateral central, and bilateral parietal. The frontal cluster had significantly higher theta power in the exergaming condition with choice compared to self-paced leaning movements and exergaming without choice, while both central clusters showed a significant increase in absolute alpha-2 power in the exergaming conditions compared to the self-paced movements. This is the first study to show that it is feasible to record brain activity while exergaming. Furthermore, results indicated that even a simple exergame without explicit cognitive demands inherently requires cognitive processing. These results pave the way for studying brain activity during various exergames in different populations to help improve their effective use in rehabilitation settings.

Eventually, machine learning technique is required for automatic sleep stage scoring. Therefore, a new feature extraction method for EEG analysis and classification is discussed based on the statistical properties of cepstral coefficients. The sleep EEG signal is segmented into 30 s epoch and each epoch is decomposed into different frequency bands: Gamma (gamma), Beta (beta), Alpha (alpha), Theta (theta) and Delta (delta) by employing the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The statistical properties of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which represent the short term spectral characteristics of the wavelet coefficients, are extracted. The MFCC feature vectors are incorporated into the Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation Maximization (GMM-EM) to classify various sleep stages: Wake, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (N-REM) stage1 (S1), N-REM stage2 (S2), N-REM stage3 (S3), N-REM stage4 (S4). The proposed feature extraction for sleep stage scoring achieves 88.71% of average classification accuracy.

Brain-machine interfaces for controlling lower-limb powered robotic systems	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						BMI; EEG; lower-limb; exoskeleton; walk; classification; neural decoding	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; COMPUTER INTERFACE; GAIT; EXOSKELETONS; REHABILITATION; WALKING; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; IMAGINATION; WHEELCHAIR	Objective. Lower-limb, powered robotics systems such as exoskeletons and orthoses have emerged as novel robotic interventions to assist or rehabilitate people with walking disabilities. These devices are generally controlled by certain physical maneuvers, for example pressing buttons or shifting body weight. Although effective, these control schemes are not what humans naturally use. The usability and clinical relevance of these robotics systems could be further enhanced by brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). A number of preliminary studies have been published on this topic, but a systematic understanding of the experimental design, tasks, and performance of BMI-exoskeleton systems for restoration of gait is lacking. Approach. To address this gap, we applied standard systematic review methodology for a literature search in PubMed and EMBASE databases and identified 11 studies involving BMI-robotics systems. The devices, user population, input and output of the BMIs and robot systems respectively, neural features, decoders, denoising techniques, and system performance were reviewed and compared. Main results. Results showed BMIs classifying walk versus stand tasks are the most common. The results also indicate that electroencephalography (EEG) is the only recording method for humans. Performance was not clearly presented in most of the studies. Several challenges were summarized, including EEG denoising, safety, responsiveness and others. Significance. We conclude that lower-body powered exoskeletons with automated gait intention detection based on BMIs open new possibilities in the assistance and rehabilitation fields, although the current performance, clinical benefits and several key challenging issues indicate that additional research and development is required to deploy these systems in the clinic and at home. Moreover, rigorous EEG denoising techniques, suitable performance metrics, consistent trial reporting, and more clinical trials are needed to advance the field.

Reduced electroencephalogram responses to standard and target auditory stimuli in bipolar disorder and the impact of psychotic features: Analysis of event-related potentials, spectral power, and inter-trial coherence	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						event-related spectral perturbation; inter-trial coherence; N1; oddball; P3b; psychotic features	ODDBALL TASK; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ENDOPHENOTYPES; RATING-SCALE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; P300; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ALPHA; DELTA; ABNORMALITIES	Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with reductions in the P3b event-related potential (ERP) response to target auditory stimuli, which suggests deficits in context updating. Previous studies have typically examined these responses in the temporal domain, which may not capture alterations in specific frequencies of phase-locked or induced electrophysiological activity. Therefore, the present study examined early and late ERPs in temporal and frequency domains in a bipolar sample with and without current psychotic features. Methods: The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during an auditory oddball task. Seventy-five BD patients and 98 healthy controls (HCs) discriminated between standard and target tones. N1 ERPs to standards and P3b ERPs to targets were analyzed in the temporal domain. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were analyzed in the frequency domain. Results: The early N1 response to standard tones was not significantly different between the total HC and BD samples irrespective of psychotic features. However, N1 amplitude was reduced in BD patients with psychotic features (BDP) compared to HCs and BD patients without psychotic features. P3b was reduced in BD patients versus HCs, with the BDP sample having the most reduced amplitude. In the time-frequency analysis, delta and theta ERSP and ITC were reduced across the time window for both standard and target stimuli in BD patients compared to HCs, but did not differ in the psychotic features analysis. Conclusions: The results provide neural evidence that BD is associated with disrupted sensory, attentional, and cognitive processing of auditory stimuli, which may be worsened with the presence of psychotic features.

Multi-scale Weighted Inherent Fuzzy Entropy for EEG Biomarkers	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	JUL 08-13, 2018	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE			SIGNALS	Entropy has been widely investigated as an effective metric to evaluate the dynamic complexity of signals. EEG is biological signals that contain rich complex dynamics. Transforming the information encoded in the rich dynamics embedded within EEG into appropriate biomarkers with discriminatory powers is important for event detection. It has broad prospects in a wide range of applications including medical diagnosis, therapy, and rehabilitation. This paper proposes a new entropy-based measure, Multi-scale Weighted Inherent Fuzzy Entropy (WIFEn), as an effective EEG biomarker for improving event detection performance. WIFEn first extracts Inherent Mode Functions (IMFs) using the Empirical Mode Decomposition method, then uses a weighted sum scheme to fuse the fuzzy entropy metrics calculated on each IMF. Finally, the multi-scale variation accounts for the multi-timescale dynamics inherent in EEG signals. Since EEG signals are a superposition of series of oscillations where information embedded in these oscillations is useful for estimating signal complexity, the aforementioned decomposition, and weighted sum procedures can improve the estimation results. The proposed method is tested with three entropy-based metrics for two tasks. The first task is eye-open and eye-closed detection with resting state EEG signals recorded from 10 subjects; while the second task is seizure detection for 8 epilepsy patients. The results indicate that the multi-scale WIFEn provides a better discriminatory power that improves detection performance than classic entropy-based measures, with an averaged improvement of 13:7% (p-value < 0.05) for resting-state classification and 5:9% (p-value < 0.05) for seizure detection.

It leads to a recalibration of visuomotor coordination during pointing as well as to aftereffects on a number of sensorimotor and attention tasks, but whether these effects originate at a motor or attentional level remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to further characterize PA aftereffects by using an approach that allows distinguishing between effects on attentional and motor processes. We recorded EEG in healthy human participants (9 females and 7 males) while performing a new double step, anticipatory attention/motor preparation paradigm before and after adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms, with neutral lenses as a control. We then examined PA aftereffects through changes in known oscillatory EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting and motor preparation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Our results were twofold. First, we found PA to rightward-shifting prisms to selectively affect EEG signatures of motor but not attentional processes. More specifically, PA modulated preparatory motor EEG activity over central electrodes in the right hemisphere, contralateral to the PA-induced, compensatory leftward shift in pointing movements. No effects were found on EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting over occipitoparietal sites. Second, we found the PA effect on preparatory motor EEG activity to dominate in the beta frequency band. Weconclude that changes to intentional visuomotor, rather than attentional visuospatial, processes underlie the PA aftereffect of rightward-deviating prisms in healthy participants.

MEG and electroencephalography (EEG) are closely related complementary methods and should be interpreted together whenever possible. This manuscript covers the basic physical and physiological principles of MEG and discusses the main aspects of state-of-the-art MEG data analysis. We provide guidelines for best practices of patient preparation, stimulus presentation, MEG data collection and analysis, as well as for MEG interpretation in routine clinical examinations. In 2017, about 200 whole-scalp MEG devices were in operation worldwide, many of them located in clinical environments. Yet, the established clinical indications for MEG examinations remain few, mainly restricted to the diagnostics of epilepsy and to preoperative functional evaluation of neurosurgical patients. We are confident that the extensive ongoing basic MEG research indicates potential for the evaluation of neurological and psychiatric syndromes, developmental disorders, and the integrity of cortical brain networks after stroke.

Neurophysiological predictors and spectro-spatial discriminative features for enhancing SMR-BCI	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; electroencephalography; discriminative spectro-spatial patterns; neurophysiological predictors	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; ALPHA BAND; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; PATTERNS; CORTEX; RHYTHMS	Neural engineering research is actively engaged in optimizing the robustness of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR)-brain-computer interface (BCI) to boost its potential real-world use. Objective. This paper investigates two vital factors in efficient and robust SMR-BCI design-algorithms that address subject-variability of optimal features and neurophysiological factors that correlate with BCI performance. Existing SMR-BCI research using electroencephalogram (EEG) to classify bilateral motor imagery (MI) focus on identifying subject-specific frequency bands with most discriminative motor patterns localized to sensorimotor region. Approach. A novel strategy to further optimize BCI performance by taking into account the variability of discriminative spectral regions across various EEG channels is proposed in this paper. Main results. The proposed technique results in a significant (p < 0.007) increase in average (N = 10) classification accuracy by 5.96% accompanied by a considerable reduction in number of channels and bands. The session-to-session transfer variation in spectro-spatial patterns using proposed algorithm is investigated offline and classification performance of the optimized BCI model is successfully evaluated in an online SMR-BCI. Further, the effective prediction of SMR-BCI performance with physiological indicators derived from multi-channel resting-state EEG is demonstrated. The results indicate that the resting state activation patterns such as entropy and gamma power from pre-motor (fronto-central) and posterior (parietal and centro-parietal) areas, and beta power from posterior (centro-parietal) areas estimate BCI performance with minimum error. These patterns, strongly related to BCI performance, may represent certain cognitive states during rest. Significance. Findings reported in this paper imply the need for subject-specific modelling of BCI and the prediction of BCI performance using multi-channel rest-state parameters, to ensure enhanced BCI performance.

The seizure is one type of brain epilepsy which needs to be properly detected and subsequently analyzed to provide both clinical and medical care for a person. In this paper, OTA based novel method of analyzing EEG for the detection of early stage or onset of patient's seizure is discussed. The onset of seizure results into abnormal band of EEG signal. The frequency band (above 40Hz up to 160Hz) during seizure lies well above normal band (up to 20Hz) of EEG. OTA provides several competences and advantages over conventional operational amplifiers. Hence, OTA based signal conditioning circuit in the form of narrow pass band filter is used to separate normal EEG signal. The abnormal range of EEG signal can be conveniently filtered out for interfacing purposes and further analysis.

Electrophysiological correlates of encoding processes in a full-report visual working memory paradigm	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Encephalography; Attention	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TASK; CAPACITY; CORTEX; ALPHA; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	Why are some visual stimuli remembered, whereas others are forgotten? A limitation of recognition paradigms is that they measure aggregate behavioral performance and/or neural responses to all stimuli presented in a visual working memory (VWM) array. To address this limitation, we paired an electroencephalography (EEG) frequency-tagging technique with two full-report VWM paradigms. This permitted the tracking of individual stimuli as well as the aggregate response. We recorded high-density EEG (256 channel) while participants viewed four shape stimuli, each flickering at a different frequency. At retrieval, participants either recalled the location of all stimuli in any order (simultaneous full report) or were cued to report the item in a particular location over multiple screen displays (sequential full report). The individual frequency tag amplitudes evoked for correctly recalled items were significantly larger than the amplitudes of subsequently forgotten stimuli, regardless of retrieval task. An induced-power analysis examined the aggregate neural correlates of VWM encoding as a function of items correctly recalled. We found increased induced power across a large number of electrodes in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands when more items were successfully recalled. This effect was more robust for sequential full report, suggesting that retrieval demands can influence encoding processes. These data are consistent with a model in which encoding-related resources are directed to a subset of items, rather than a model in which resources are allocated evenly across the array. These data extend previous work using recognition paradigms and stress the importance of encoding in determining later VWM retrieval success.

It has been proposed that integration of activity across cortical areas is mediated anatomically by associative connections terminating in superficial layers, and physiologically by slow cortical rhythms. However, the means through which neocortical anatomy and physiology interact to coordinate neural activity remains obscure. Using laminar microelectrode arrays in 19 human participants, we found that most EEG activity is below 10-Hz (delta/theta) and generated by superficial cortical layers during both wakefulness and sleep. Cortical surface grid, grid-laminar, and dual-laminar recordings demonstrate that these slow rhythms are synchronous within upper layers across broad cortical areas. The phase of this superficial slow activity is reset by infrequent stimuli and coupled to the amplitude of faster oscillations and neuronal firing across all layers. These findings support a primary role of superficial slow rhythms in generating the EEG and integrating cortical activity.

If the concentration level of student is lower, the word can be repeated and presented in other ways. In that way, lessons will be repeated and altered depending upon students' focus. It's an assisted learning paradigm where individuals first learn the Chinese characters with and without pinyin and then trained themselves. And for the judgment of training, there is recall phase. Neuronal oscillations with its relative frequency relate in important ways to memory processes and aid as a model for learning oscillatory activity in cognition. More imprecisely theta relativity is increased markedly during training phase while memorizing of character without pinyin at the parietal lobe. While at same instant gamma relativity dropped at the same region. It is also observed that the gamma relativity is increased with pinyin associated with the character during training and recall phase at temporal lobe. The results showed a strong association between theta and gamma relativity during learning, training and recall phase.

Across a night of sleep in adults, wave propagation is scaled down, becoming more local. Yet, it is unknown whether slow wave propagation undergoes similar across-night dynamics in childhood-a period of extensive cortical rewiring. Methods: High-density electroencephalography (EEG; 128 channels) was recorded during sleep in three groups of healthy children: 2.0-4.9 years (n = 11), 5.0-8.9 years (n = 9) and 9.0-16.9 years (n = 9). Slow wave propagation speed, distance, and cortical involvement were quantified. To characterize across-night dynamics, the 20% most pronounced (highest amplitude) slow waves were subdivided into five time-based quintiles. Results: We found indications that slow wave propagation distance decreased across a night of sleep. We observed an interesting interaction of across-night slow wave propagation dynamics with age (p < 0.05). When comparing the first and last quintiles, there was a trend level difference between age groups: 2- to 4.9-year-old children showed an 11.9% across-night decrease in slow wave propagation distance, which was not observed in the older two age groups. Regardless of age, cortical involvement decreased by 10.4%-23.7% across a night of sleep. No across-night changes were observed in slow wave speed. Conclusions: Findings provide evidence that signatures of brain connectivity undergo across-night dynamics specific to maturational periods. These results suggest that across-night dynamics in slow wave propagation distance reflect heightened plasticity in underlying cerebral networks specific to developmental periods.

Importantly, these studies focused on decisions that were (1) indicated immediately after stimulus presentation, and (2) for which a direct motor mapping was provided. Here, we investigated whether the putative beta band choice signal also extends to postponed decisions, and how such a decision signal might be influenced by a response mapping that is dissociated from a specific motor command. We recorded EEG data in two separate experiments, both employing the vibrotactile frequency comparison task with delayed decision reports. In the first experiment, delayed choices were associated with a fixed motor mapping, whereas in the second experiment, choices were mapped onto a color code concealing a specific motor response until the end of the delay phase. In between stimulus presentations, as well as after the second stimulus, prefrontal beta band power indexed stimulus information held in working memory. Beta band power also encoded choices during the response delay, notably, in different cortical areas depending on the provided response mapping. In particular, when decisions were associated with a specific motor mapping, choices were represented in premotor cortices, whereas the color mapping resulted in a choice-selective modulation of beta band power in parietal cortices. Together, our findings imply that how a choice is expressed (i.e., the decision consequence) determines where in the cortical sensorimotor hierarchy an according decision signal is processed.

The test consists of an acquisition (pair learning) and a test (rule transfer) phase, associated with the function of the basal ganglia and the hippocampi, respectively. Obviously, such a complex task also requires cortical involvement. To investigate the activity of different cortical areas during this test, 64-channel EEG recordings were recorded in 24 healthy volunteers. Fast-Fourier and Morlet wavelet convolution analyses were performed on the recordings. The most robust power changes were observed in the theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (>30 Hz) frequency bands, in which significant power elevation was observed in the vast majority of the subjects, over the parieto-occipital and temporo-parietal areas during the acquisition phase. The involvement of the frontal areas in the acquisition phase was remarkably weaker. No remarkable cortical power elevations were found in the test phase. In fact, the power of the alpha and beta bands was significantly decreased over the parietooccipital areas. We conclude that the initial acquisition of the image pairs requires strong cortical involvement, but once the pairs have been learned, neither retrieval nor generalization requires strong cortical contribution.

It has been often used as a proxy of audiovisual (AV) integration and to infer the properties of the integration process in natural (congruent) AV conditions. Nonetheless, a blatant difference between McGurk stimuli and natural, congruent, AV speech is the conflict between the auditory and the visual information in the former. Here, we hypothesized that McGurk stimuli (and any AV incongruency) engage brain responses similar to those found in more general cases of perceptual conflict (e.g., Stroop), and propose that the McGurk illusion arises as a result of the resolution of such conflict. We used electroencephalography to measure variations in the power of theta, a well-known marker of the brain response to conflict. The results showed that perception of AV McGurk stimuli, just like AV incongruence in general, induces an increase in activity in the theta band. This response was similar to that evoked by Stroop stimuli, as measured in the same participants. This finding suggests that the McGurk illusion is mediated by general-purpose conflict mechanisms, and calls for caution in generalizing findings obtained using the McGurk illusion, to the general case of multisensory integration.

In this preliminary study, we tested a cohort of 36 nurses (mean age = 30.3, SD = 8.52; 2 male) who participated in an 8-week MBT intervention to examine the improvements in sustained attention and its energetic costs that may result from MBT. Changes in sustained attention were measured using the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and electroencephalography (EEG) was collected both during PVT performance, and during a brief period of meditation. As there was substantial variability in training attendance, this variable was used a covariate in all analyses. Following the MBT program, we observed changes in alpha power across all scalp regions during meditation that were correlated with attendance. Similarly, PVT performance worsened over the 8-week period, but that this decline was mitigated by good attendance on the MBT program. The subjective energy depletion due to PVT performance (measured using self-report on Likert-type scales) was also less in regular attendees. Finally, changes in known EEG markers of attention during PVT performance (P300 and alpha-band event-related desynchronization) paralleled these behavioral shifts. Taken together, our data suggest that sustained attention and its associated costs may be negatively affected over time in the nursing profession, but that regular attendance of MBT may help to attenuate these effects. However, as this study contained no control condition, we cannot rule out that other factors (e.g., motivation, placebo effects) may also account for our findings.

The first of them is the technology of eye-tracking (i.e. registration of eye movements), which is increasingly used for controlling and correcting attention and visual perception in sportsmen and their trainers. The second technology consists in creating artificial -virtual- environments for training as well as for competitions in such emerging fields as cyberpsychology and e-Sport. Finally, the third technology is about to realize a neurobiocontrol of sportsmen's functional state on the base of methods for analysis of brain electrophysiological activity. As these three technologies are completely non-invasive they are all-around accepted alternatives to the use of chemical substances that may well improve human resilience and complex skill learning in sport but are prohibited by national and international antidoping laws. Still unresolved problems of their application are analyzed. Two such problems are, first, the necessity of interrupting the continuous activity in eye-tracking to recalibrate the measurement instruments and, second, an underestimation of spatial depth as well as insufficient supply of sensors and actuators for producing somatosensory and vestibular sensations in the virtual reality systems. In the field of neurobiocontrol, the paradox behavior of the EEG alpha rhythm in shouting is discussed: the rhythm is suppressed during aiming in beginners but is disinhibited in the sportsmen of highest qualification. The authors tentatively explain this phenomenon and argue for a strictly individual approach in using these high-tech instruments.	[Belousov, L. S.; Pehsin, N.

The synchronization likelihood (SL) is a novel method to assessed synchronization in multivariate time series for non-stationary systems. To evaluate this method to study the mechanisms of WM, we calculated the SL values in brain electrical activity for both resting state and task state. EEG signals were recorded from 14 young adults and 12 old adults during two different states, respectively. SL was used to measure EEG synchronization between 19 electrodes in delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2 and beta frequency bands. Bad task performance and significantly decreased EEG synchronization were found in old group compared to young group in alpha1, alpha2 and beta frequency bands during the WM task. Moreover, significantly decreased EEG synchronization in beta band in the elder was also detected during the resting state. The findings suggested that reduced EEG synchronization may be one of causes for WM capacity decline along with healthy aging.

Sleep plays a fundamental role in this process. Both slow waves and spindles are key features of nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) that exhibit pronounced developmental trajectories from infancy to adulthood. Yet, these prominent features of NREM sleep are poorly understood in infants and toddlers in the age range of 12 to 30 months. Moreover, it is unknown how network dynamics of NREM sleep are associated with outcomes of early development. Addressing this gap in our understanding of sleep during development will enable the subsequent study of pathological changes in neurodevelopmental disorders. The aim of the current study was to characterize the sleep topography with high-density electroencephalography in this age group. We found that delta, 0, and beta oscillations and sleep spindles exhibited clear developmental changes. Low delta and high theta oscillations correlated with motor, language, and social skills, independent of age. These findings suggest an important role of network dynamics of NREM sleep in cortical maturation and the associated development of skills during this important developmental period.

J	Tokimoto, S; Tokimoto, N				Tokimoto, Shingo; Tokimoto, Naoko			Perspective-Taking in Sentence Comprehension: Time and Empathy	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						perspective-taking; empathy; dipole fitting; EEG; event-related potential; time-frequency analysis; IC clustering	SOCIAL COGNITION; EEG; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; NETWORK; MODELS; FMRI	This study examines the neural substrate of perspective-taking by analyzing the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity elicited by the auditory comprehension of sentences for which the comprehender had to adopt the perspective of the person described in them. Recent studies suggest that the ability of perspective-taking can be an integrative function of temporal and spatial information processing. We thus examined the independence and possible interaction of human perspective shifts and temporal perspective-taking by utilizing Japanese subsidiary verbs for giving, namely -ageru and -kureru. We manipulated human perspective shifts and temporal perspective-taking independently in experimental sentences by syntactically changing the subject and the object between the speaker and a third person, while we manipulated the tense to be past or non-past tense via sentence-final particles ru/ta (non-past/past). The EEG analyses via electrodes indicated the suppression of the beta band for human perspective shifts in sentences in non-past tense and the absence of such suppression in sentences in past tense. The analyses for the clusters of independent components indicated beta suppression for past tense against non-past tense in sentences without a human perspective shift. This response pattern suggests a close relationship between human perspective shifting and temporal perspective-taking. The beta suppression for the human perspective shift in our experiment can be understood as a replication of the previous EEG findings observed for perspective-taking in the presentation of visual images. The preceding findings and our result suggest that the ability or the function of perspective-taking is not specific to the modality. Furthermore, the generator of the beta suppression for past tense against non-past tense without human perspective shifting was localized in the precuneus, which is consistent with recent findings indicating that the precuneus is deeply involved in time perception.

Reducing the time required for an experiment is necessary because the stimulation required to elicit SSVEPs causes great fatigue in the subjects. Although the additional synchronous processing is essential to reduce noise, especially when the responses have relatively low amplitudes and a large amount of additional synchronous processing achieves more accurate results, it also lengthens the experiments. In the conventional method, the frequency resolution is low because of the dependence of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) on the analysis window length, and it is not possible to analyze a response with a small amount of additional synchronous processing. We propose a method to analyze the frequency change and SSVEP stimulus using non-harmonic analysis, which is not dependent on the analysis window length. We found that the precision was improved exponentially compared with the STFT, and the frequency resolution remained high even when a small amount of additional synchronous processing was performed.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid automatic sleep stage scoring approach, named HyCLASSS, based on single channel electroencephalogram ( EEG). HyCLASSS, for the first time, leverages both signal and stage transition features of human sleep for automatic identification of sleep stages. HyCLASSS consists of two parts: A random forest classifier and correction rules. Random forest classifier is trained using 30 EEG signal features, including temporal, frequency, and nonlinear features. The correction rules are constructed based on stage transition feature, importing the continuity property of sleep, and characteristic of sleep stage transition. Compared with the gold standard of manual scoring using Rechtschaffen and Kales criterion, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient applied on 198 subjects has reached 85.95% and 0.8046 in our experiment, respectively. The performance of HyCLASS compared favorably to previous work, and it could be integrated with sleep evaluation or sleep diagnosis system in the future.

Comparison of the Wavelet and Gabor Transforms in the Spectral Analysis of Nonstationary Signals	TECHNICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SHORT-TIME FOURIER; EEG; NOISE; MODEL; STFT	Two approaches to the analysis of nonstationary random processes (short-time Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform) are compared. The comparison is based on the study of several model signals with known time-frequency characteristics. The application of the approaches is also analyzed in the study of spectral dynamics of fluorescence of cold atomic clouds excited by pulsed radiation. It is shown that the two approaches make it possible to reveal the main specific features of the signals under study. However, the continuous wavelet transform has several advantages, since the optimal conditions for the analysis using the short-time Fourier transform are reached if additional calculations aimed at determination of the optimal width of the window are performed.

We introduce the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on raw EEG samples for supervised learning of 5 class sleep stage prediction. The network has 14 layers, takes as input the 30-s epoch to be classified as well as two preceding epochs and one following epoch for temporal context, and requires no signal preprocessing or feature extraction phase. We train and evaluate our system using data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), a large multi-center cohort study including expert-rated polysomnographic records. Performance metrics reach the state of the art, with accuracy of 0.87 and Cohen kappa of 0.81. The use of a large cohort with multiple expert raters guarantees good generalization. Finally, we present a method for visualizing class-wise patterns learned by the network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it remains unclear exactly which aspects of perception are shaped by this pre-stimulus activity and what role stochastic (trial-by-trial) variability plays in driving these relationships. We employed a novel jackknife approach to link single-trial variability in oscillatory activity to psychometric measures from a task that requires judgement of the relative length of two line segments (the landmark task). The results provide evidence that pre-stimulus alpha fluctuations influence perceptual bias. Importantly, a mediation analysis showed that this relationship is partially driven by long-term (deterministic) alpha changes over time, highlighting the need to account for sources of trial-by-trial variability when interpreting EEG predictors of perception. These results provide fundamental insight into the nature of the effects of ongoing oscillatory activity on perception. The jackknife approach we implemented may serve to identify and investigate neural signatures of perceptual relevance in more detail.	[Benwell, Christopher S.

Several studies have proposed that the anticorrelation originates from a causal link between changes in the alpha power and BOLD signal. However, the results in this study reveal that fluctuations in alpha and BOLD power do not generate one another but instead respectively result from high- and low-frequency components of the same underlying cortical activity, and that they are inversely correlated via variations in the strengths of corticothalamic and intrathalamic feedback, thereby explaining their anticorrelation.

Previous studies have suggested that voluntary forgetting relies on active inhibition of encoding processes in the hippocampus by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) [1-4]. During attentional and sensorimotor processing, enhanced DLPFC theta power alongside increased alpha/ beta oscillations are a neural signature of an inhibitory top-down mechanism, with theta oscillations reflecting prefrontal control and alpha/ beta oscillations occurring in areas targeted by inhibition [5-12]. Here, we used intracranial EEG recordings in presurgical epilepsy patients implanted in DLPFC (n = 13) and hippocampus (n = 15) during an item-method directed forgetting paradigm. We found that voluntary forgetting is associated with increased neural oscillations in the low theta band (3-5 Hz) in DLPFC and in a broad theta/ alpha/ beta (6-18 Hz) frequency range in hippocampus. Combining timelagged correlation analysis, phase synchronization, and Granger causality in 6 patients with electrodes in both DLPFC and hippocampus, we obtained converging evidence for a top-down control of hippocampal activity by the DLPFC. Together, our results provide strong support for a model in which voluntary forgetting relies on enhanced inhibition of the hippocampus by the DLPFC.

Representation of steady-state visual evoked potentials elicited by luminance flicker in human occipital cortex: An electrocorticography study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						SSVEP; ECoG; Alpha; Theta; Gamma; Fundamental; Harmonic	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; RESONANCE PHENOMENA; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FREQUENCY; EEG; STIMULUS; RESPONSES	Despite the widespread use of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by luminance flicker in clinical and research settings, their spatial and temporal representation in the occipital cortex largely remain elusive. We performed intracranial-EEG recordings in response to targets flickering at frequencies from 11 to 15 Hz using a subdural electrode grid covering the entire right occipital cortex of a human subject, and we were able to consistently locate the gazed stimulus frequency at the posterior side of the primary visual cortex (V1). Peripheral flickering, undetectable in scalp-EEG, elicited activations in the interhemispheric fissure at locations consistent with retinotopic maps. Both foveal and peripheral activations spatially coincided with activations in the high gamma band. We detected localized alpha synchronization at the lateral edge of V2 during stimulation and transient post-stimulation theta band activations at the posterior part of the occipital cortex. Scalp-EEG exhibited only a minor occipital post-stimulation theta activation, but a strong transient frontal activation.

A Prospective Study of the Impact of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation on EEG Correlates of Somatosensory Perception	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation; somatosensory perception; tactile detection; alpha; neuromodulation	EVOKED-RESPONSES; MU RHYTHM; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; AWAKE MONKEYS; BETA RHYTHMS; ALPHA; MODULATION; CORTEX; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ENTRAINMENT	The (8-12 Hz) neocortical alpha rhythm is associated with shifts in attention across sensory systems, and is thought to represent a sensory gating mechanism for the inhibitory control of cortical processing. The present preliminary study sought to explore whether alpha frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) could modulate endogenous alpha power in the somatosensory system, and whether the hypothesized modulation would causally impact perception of tactile stimuli at perceptual threshold. We combined electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneous brief and intermittent tACS applied over primary somatosensory cortex at individuals' endogenous alpha frequency during a tactile detection task (n = 12 for EEG, n = 20 for behavior). EEG-measured pre-stimulus alpha power was higher on non-perceived than perceived trials, and analogous perceptual correlates emerged in early components of the tactile evoked response. Further, baseline normalized tactile detection performance was significantly lower during alpha than sham tACS, but the effect did not last into the post-tACS time period. Pre- to post-tACS changes in alpha power were linearly dependent upon baseline state, such that alpha power tended to increase when pre-tACS alpha power was low, and decrease when it was high. However, these observations were comparable in both groups, and not associated with evidence of tACS-induced alpha power modulation. Nevertheless, the tactile stimulus evoked response potential (ERP) revealed a potentially lasting impact of alpha tACS on circuit dynamics. The post-tACS ERP was marked by the emergence of a prominent peak similar to 70 ms post-stimulus, which was not discernible post-sham, or in either pre-stimulation condition. Computational neural modeling designed to simulate macroscale EEG signals supported the hypothesis that the emergence of this peak could reflect synaptic plasticity mechanisms induced by tACS. The primary lesson learned in this study, which commanded a small sample size, was that while our experimental paradigm provided some evidence of an influence of tACS on behavior and circuit dynamics, it was not sufficient to induce observable causal effects of tACS on EEG-measured alpha oscillations. We discuss limitations and suggest improvements that may help further delineate a causal influence of tACS on cortical dynamics and perception in future studies.

Using event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), we tried to determine the brain dynamics during hypsarrhythmia. Routine 1-h scalp EEGs were retrieved from 31 patients with infantile spasms and 20 age-matched controls. Using the EEGLAB toolbox of MATLAB 2015b, the ERSPs of fast oscillations (FOs; 20-100 Hz) of selected channels were analyzed and compared among groups according to their MRI lesions. FO-ERSP cutoff values for predicting the pathologic foci were estimated. The mean FO-ERSPs across all analyzed electrodes of patients with spasms were significantly higher than those of controls. When the patients were categorized into nonlesional, focal/multifocal, or diffuse lesional groups, the FO-ERSP of patients in the focal/multifocal lesional group was significantly lower than that of those in the nonfocal or diffuse lesional groups. In the focal/multifocal lesional group, seven patients (7/9, 77.8%) showed that the locations of channels with high FO-ERSPs were matched to the pathologic MRI lesions. Thus, the localization of high FO-ERSPs is closely associated with the location of pathologic brain lesions. Further research is required to prove the value of the FO-ERSP as an important quantitative localizing biomarker of West syndrome. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The locations of high fast oscillation-event-related spectral perturbations (FO-ERSPs) are closely associated with brain pathologic lesions, and high FO-ERSPs can be used as a localization biomarker of pathologic brain lesions in patients with hypsarrhythmia. With further validation, FO-ERSP might be useful as a biomarker for the localization of hidden pathologies in conditions with generalized epileptiform activities such as West syndrome.

However, its clinical significance has not been fully clarified. Although infra-slow activity was recently defined as activity between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz, we focus on the activity recorded with time constant of 2 seconds for practical usage. We defined short "infraslow" activity (SISA) less than 0.5 Hz recorded with time constant of 2 seconds and investigated the occurrence and clinical significance of SISA in acute anoxic encephalopathy. Methods: This study evaluated the findings of electroencephalography in consecutive 98 comatose patients with acute anoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest. We first classified electroencephalography findings conventionally, then investigated SISA by time constant of 2 second and a high-cut filter of 120 Hz, to clarify the relationship between SISA and clinical profiles, especially of clinical outcomes and occurrence of acute posthypoxic myoclonus or acute symptomatic seizures. Results: Short infra-slow activity was found in six patients (6.2%), superimposed on the burst phase of the burst-suppression pattern. All six patients showed acute posthypoxic myoclonus or acute symptomatic seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and its prognosis was poor. This 100% occurrence of acute posthypoxic myoclonus or acute symptomatic seizures was significantly higher than that in patients without SISA (39.1%; P < 0.05). Conclusions: Short infra-slow activity in acute anoxic encephalopathy could be associated with acute posthypoxic myoclonus and acute symptomatic seizures. Short infra-slow activity could be a practically feasible biomarker for myoclonus or seizures and poor prognosis in acute anoxic encephalopathy, if it occurs with burst suppression.

To get a better understanding of this structure, its local neurophysiological properties and cortical connectivity patterns were studied. Methods: We simultaneously recorded DBS local field potentials (LFPs) and electroencephalography (EEG) in two patients with PDD. Both patients had DBS electrodes in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) with one or more distal contacts close to or inside the NBM. Measurements were obtained during routine battery replacement. The distance of DBS contacts to the NBM were calculated using CT-MRI fusion. Results: Delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations were more prominently present in the NBM region than in its vicinity, whereas temporal coherence in the theta (4-8 Hz) range was less outspoken. Conclusion: These neurophysiological characteristics, if also proven in larger cohorts, might help to map the NBM more precisely during electrode implantation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during an emotion discrimination task for happy, sad and neutral faces. The correlation between the non-phase-locked power of frequency bands and reaction times (RTs) was assessed. The results revealed that beta played a major role in positive classification advantage (PCA) within the 100-200 and 300-400 ms intervals, whereas theta was important within the 200-300 ms interval. We propose that the beta band modulated the neutral and emotional face classification process, and that the theta band modulated for happy and sad face classification.

OBJECTIVE: A pilot traffic pattern task was designed in a flight simulation environment in order to carry out the pilot workload prediction and improve the evaluation method. METHODS: The prediction of typical flight subtasks and dynamic workloads (cruise, approach, and landing) were built up based on multiple resource theory, and a favorable validity was achieved by the correlation analysis verification between sensitive physiological data and the predicted value. RESULTS: Statistical analysis indicated that eye movement indices (fixation frequency, mean fixation time, saccade frequency, mean saccade time, and mean pupil diameter), Electrocardiogram indices (mean normal-to-normal interval and the ratio between low frequency and sum of low frequency and high frequency), and Electrodermal Activity indices (mean tonic and mean phasic) were all sensitive to typical workloads of subjects. CONCLUSION: A multinominal logistic regression model based on combination of physiological indices (fixation frequency, mean normal-to-normal interval, the ratio between low frequency and sum of low frequency and high frequency, and mean tonic) was constructed, and the discriminate accuracy was comparatively ideal with a rate of 84.85%.

Research testing the relationship between AUD and specific cognitive control psychophysiological correlates, such as medial frontal (MF) theta-band EEG power, is scarce, and the etiology of this relationship is largely unknown. The current report tested relationship between pathological alcohol use through young adulthood and reduced conflict-related theta at age 29 in a large prospective population-based twin sample. Greater lifetime AUD symptomatology was associated with reduced MF theta power during response conflict, but not alpha-band visual attention processing. Follow-up analyses using cotwin control analysis and biometric modeling suggested that genetic influences, and not the consequences of sustained AUD symptomatology, explained the theta-AUD association. Results provide strong evidence that AUD is genetically related to diminished conflict-related MF theta, and advance MF theta as a promising electrophysiological correlate of AUD-related dysfunctional frontal circuitry.

Midfrontal brain areas signal the need for control, and control is subsequently implemented by biasing sensory representations, boosting or suppressing activity in brain areas processing task-relevant or task-irrelevant information. To assess the timescale of this process, we employed EEG. In order to pinpoint control implementation in specific sensory areas, we used a flanker task with incongruent flankers shown in only one hemifield (congruent flankers in the other hemifield) isolating their processing in the contralateral hemisphere. ERPs revealed fast modulations specifically in visual processing areas contralateral to the incongruent flankers. To test whether these modulations reflect increased or decreased processing of incongruent flankers, we investigated alpha power, a marker for attentional inhibition. Importantly, we show increased alpha power over visual areas processing incongruent flankers from 300 to 500 ms poststimulus onset. This suggests fast cognitive control by attentional inhibition for information disrupting goal-oriented actions. Additionally, we show that midfrontal theta earlier in the trial is also modulated by incongruency, and that theta power predicts subsequent alpha power modulations. This supports the hypothesis that midfrontal incongruency detection leads to control implementation, and reveals that these mechanisms take place on a fast, within-trial timescale.

Elucidating relations between fMRI, ECoG, and EEG through a common natural stimulus	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; ECoG; EEG; Repeat-reliability; Inter-method correlation	FIELD POTENTIAL POWER; MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; RESTING-STATE; NEUROIMAGING DATA; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL; HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS	Human brain mapping relies heavily on fMRI, ECoG and EEG, which capture different physiological signals. Relationships between these signals have been established in the context of specific tasks or during resting state, often using spatially confined concurrent recordings in animals. But it is not certain whether these correlations generalize to other contexts relevant for human cognitive neuroscience. Here, we address the case of complex naturalistic stimuli and ask two basic questions. First, how reliable are the responses evoked by a naturalistic audio-visual stimulus in each of these imaging methods, and second, how similar are stimulus-related responses across methods? To this end, we investigated a wide range of brain regions and frequency bands. We presented the same movie clip twice to three different cohorts of subjects (N-EEG = 45, N-fMRI = 11, N-ECoG = 5) and assessed stimulus-driven correlations across viewings and between imaging methods, thereby ruling out task-irrelevant confounds. All three imaging methods had similar repeat-reliability across viewings when fMRI and EEG data were averaged across subjects, highlighting the potential to achieve large signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging large sample sizes. The fMRI signal correlated positively with high-frequency ECoG power across multiple task-related cortical structures but positively with low-frequency EEG and ECoG power. In contrast to previous studies, these correlations were as strong for low-frequency as for high frequency ECoG. We also observed links between fMRI and infra-slow EEG voltage fluctuations. These results extend previous findings to the case of natural stimulus processing.

In this regard, an electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely applied to assess individuals' stress by analyzing brain waves in the clinical domains. With recent advancements in wearable EEG devices, EEG's ability can be extended to field workers, particularly by non-invasively assessing construction workers' stress. This study proposes a procedure to automatically recognize workers' stress in construction sites using EEG signals. Specifically, the authors collected construction field workers' EEG signals and preprocessed them to capture high-quality signals. Workers' salivary cortisol, a stress hormone, was also collected to label low or high-stress levels when they work at sites. Time and frequency domain features from EEG signals were calculated using fixed and sliding windowing approaches. Finally, the authors applied several supervised learning algorithms to recognize workers' stress while they are working at sites. The results showed that the fixed windowing approach and the Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) yielded the highest classification accuracy of 80.32%, which is very promising given the similar accuracy of stress recognition in clinical domains where extricate and wired EEG devices were used and the subjects engage in minimal body movement. The results demonstrate that the proposed field stress recognition procedure can be used for the early detection of workers' stress, which can contribute to improving workers' safety, health, wellbeing, and productivity.

Fifty subjects were presented more than a thousand spoken words during either a go/no go lexical decision task (Experiment 1) or a go/no go semantic categorisation task (Experiment 2) while EEG was collected. Linear mixed effects modelling was used to analyze the data. Effects of word frequency were found on the N400 and also as early as 100 ms in Experiment 1 but not Experiment 2. Phonological neighbourhood density produced an early effect around 250 ms and the typical N400 effect. Concreteness elicited effects in later epochs on the N400. Stimulus duration affected all epochs and its influence reflected changes in the timing of the ERP components. Overall the results support cascaded interactive models of spoken word recognition.

The role of tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b) in regulation of hyperpolarization-activated inward current, I-h, in the thalamocortical system and its functional relevance for the physiological thalamocortical oscillations were investigated. A significant decrease in I-h current density, in both thalamocortical relay (TC) and cortical pyramidal neurons was found in TRIP8b-deficient mice (TRIP8b(-/-)). In addition basal cAMP levels in the brain were found to be decreased while the availability of the fast transient A-type K+ current, I-A, in TC neurons was increased. These changes were associated with alterations in intrinsic properties and firing patterns of TC neurons, as well as intrathalamic and thalamocortical network oscillations, revealing a significant increase in slow oscillations in the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) during episodes of active-wakefulness. In addition, absence of TRIP8b suppresses the normal desynchronization response of the EEG during the switch from slow-wave sleep to wakefulness. It is concluded that TRIP8b is necessary for the modulation of physiological thalamocortical oscillations due to its direct effect on HCN channel expression in thalamus and cortex and that mechanisms related to reduced cAMP signaling may contribute to the present findings.

We were interested in the interrater reliability or epoch generalizability to describe how similar the evaluations were between reviewers, and in the reviewer generalizability to represent the consistency of the internal threshold each individual reviewer. Methods: We studied 41 adult epilepsy patients (mean age: 35.6 years) who underwent intracranial electroencephalography. A morphology detector was designed and used to detect candidate HFO events, lower-threshold events, and distractor events. These events were subsequently presented to six expert reviewers, who visually evaluated events for the presence of HFOs. Generalizability theory was used to characterize the epoch generalizability (interrater reliability) and reviewer generalizability (internal threshold consistency) of visual evaluations, as well as to project the numbers of epochs, reviewers, and datasets required to achieve strong generalizability (threshold of 0.8). Results: The reviewer generalizability was almost perfect (0.983), indicating there were sufficient evaluations to determine the internal threshold of each reviewer. However, the interrater reliability for 6 reviewers (0.588) and pairwise interrater reliability (0.322) were both poor, indicating that the agreement of 6 reviewers is insufficient to reliably establish the presence or absence of individual HFOs. Strong interrater reliability (>0.8) was projected as requiring a minimum of 17 reviewers, while strong reviewer generalizability could be achieved with <30 epoch evaluations per reviewer. Significance: This study reaffirms the poor reliability of using small numbers of reviewers to identify HFOs, and projects the number of reviewers required to overcome this limitation. It also provides a set of tools which may be used for training reviewers, tracking changes to interrater reliability, and for constructing a benchmark set of epochs that can serve as a generalizable gold standard, against which other HFO detection algorithms may be compared. This study represents an important step toward the reconciliation of important but discordant findings from HFO studies undertaken with different sets of HFOs, and ultimately toward transitioning HFO analysis into a meaningful part of the clinical epilepsy workup.

Methods: Scalp EEG recordings of a subset of children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsy from two large multicenter observational TSC studies were analyzed and compared to control children without epilepsy or any other brain-based diagnoses. FR were identified both by human visual review and compared with semi-automated review utilizing a deep learning-based FR detector. Results: Seven out of 7 children with TSC-associated epilepsy had scalp FR compared to 0 out of 4 children in the control group (p = 0.003). The automatic detector has a sensitivity of 98% and false positive rate with average of 11.2 false positives per minute. Conclusions: Non-invasive detection of interictal scalp FR was feasible, by both visual and semi-automatic detection. Interictal scalp FR occurred exclusively in children with TSC-associated epilepsy and were absent in controls without epilepsy. The proposed detector achieves high sensitivity of FR detection; however, expert review of the results to reduce false positives is advised. Significance: Interictal FR are detectable on scalp EEG and may potentially serve as a biomarker of epilepsy in children with TSC. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Achieving this accuracy is still a challenge because of the low signal-to-noise ratio in electroencephalography signals and high variability of sensorimotor rhythms. To address this need, we proposed a novel scheme that combined a frequency band selection common spatial pattern algorithm and a particle swarm optimization least squares twin support vector machine classifier for recognition of motor imagery patterns. We used self-adaptive artifact removal and the common spatial pattern method to obtain the most distinguishable features. To improve the classification results, we investigated linear, polynomial, sigmoid, wavelet and gaussian kernel functions for the nonlinear least squares twin support vector machine classifier. Particle swarm optimization, chaotic particle swarm optimization, a genetic algorithm and a quantum genetic algorithm were compared and used to tune the hyper-parameters for the classifier. To evaluate our proposed method, we used BCI Competition IV data sets 2A and 2B. Experimental results showed, that for our method, the average recognition accuracy of data set 2A is increased by 6.10%, 6.71%, 3.87%, 4.01%, 2.55% and 4.86% compared with the results obtained by regularization projection twin support vector machine, twin support vector machine, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, back propagation and probabilistic neural network, respectively. Using data set 2B, the average recognition accuracy achieved by our method was greater by 4.73%, 5.46%, 4.45%, 4.10%, 8.62% and 4.27%, respectively. The standard deviation of the accuracy values of the two data sets decreased. Furthermore, compared with the traditional support vector machines, our proposed method achieved a faster central processing unit running time for training classifiers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatiospectral Decomposition of Multi-subject EEG: Evaluating Blind Source Separation Algorithms on Real and Realistic Simulated Data	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Blind source separation; Multi-subject; decomposition; Resting EEG; Simulated EEG; Wavelets; ICA	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; 2ND-ORDER STATISTICS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; FMRI; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; INFERENCES; TOOLBOX; NUMBER	Electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations predominantly appear with periods between 1 s (1 Hz) and 20 ms (50 Hz), and are subdivided into distinct frequency bands which appear to correspond to distinct cognitive processes. A variety of blind source separation (BSS) approaches have been developed and implemented within the past few decades, providing an improved isolation of these distinct processes. Within the present study, we demonstrate the feasibility of multi-subject BSS for deriving distinct EEG spatiospectral maps. Multi-subject spatiospectral EEG decompositions were implemented using the EEGIFT toolbox (http://mialab. mrn. org/software/eegift/) with real and realistic simulated datasets (the simulation code is available at http://mialab. mrn. org/soft ware/simeeg). Twelve different decomposition algorithms were evaluated. Within the simulated data, WASOBI and COMBI appeared to be the best performing algorithms, as they decomposed the four sources across a range of component numbers and noise levels. RADICAL ICA, ERBM, INFOMAX ICA, ICA EBM, FAST ICA, and JADE OPAC decomposed a subset of sources within a smaller range of component numbers and noise levels. INFOMAX ICA, FAST ICA, WASOBI, and COMBI generated the largest number of stable sources within the real dataset and provided partially distinct views of underlying spatiospectral maps. We recommend the multi-subject BSS approach and the selected algorithms for further studies examining distinct spatiospectral networks within healthy and clinical populations.

Alpha oscillations covary with changes in visual processing and have been associated with a broad range of neurocognitive functions. In this article, we review these associations and suggest that alpha oscillations can be thought to exhibit at least five distinct characters': those of the inhibitor, perceiver, predictor, communicator and stabiliser. In short, while alpha oscillations are strongly associated with reductions in visual attention, they also appear to play important roles in regulating the timing and temporal resolution of perception. Furthermore, alpha oscillations are strongly associated with top-down control and may facilitate transmission of predictions to visual cortex. This is in addition to promoting communication between frontal and posterior brain regions more generally, as well as maintaining ongoing perceptual states. We discuss why alpha oscillations might associate with such a broad range of cognitive functions and suggest ways in which these diverse associations can be studied experimentally.

Altered theta oscillations in resting EEG of fibromyalgia syndrome patients	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; NEUROGENIC PAIN; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; NEURAL RESPONSES; BRAIN; POWER; ABNORMALITIES; STIMULATION; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION	BackgroundFibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue and cognitive/affective symptoms. Functional imaging studies have revealed that FM and other chronic pain syndromes can affect resting brain activity. This study utilized electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate the relative power of ongoing oscillatory activity in the resting brain. MethodsA 64-channel EEG was recorded at rest in 19 female FM patients and 18 healthy, age-matched, control subjects. The Manual Tender Point Scale (MTPS) examination was performed to quantify tonic pain and tenderness on the day of testing along with measures of mood, arousal and fatigue. Oscillations in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands were analysed using Standardised Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography to evaluate sources of spectral activity throughout the whole brain. ResultsFM patients exhibited greater pain, tiredness and tension on the day of testing relative to healthy control participants and augmented theta activity in prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. No significant differences were seen in other frequency bands. Augmented frontal theta activity in FM patients significantly correlated with measures of tenderness and mean tiredness scores. ConclusionsThe findings indicate that alterations to resting-state oscillatory activity may relate to ongoing tonic pain and fatigue in FM, and manifest in brain regions relevant for cognitive-attentional aspects of pain processing and endogenous pain inhibition. Enhanced low-frequency oscillations were previously seen in FM and other chronic pain syndromes, and may relate to pathophysiological mechanisms for ongoing pain such as thalamocortical dysrhythmia. SignificanceIncreased prefrontal theta activity may contribute to persistent pain in fibromyalgia or represent the outcome of prolonged symptoms. The findings point to the potential for therapeutic interventions aimed at normalizing neural oscillations, while further research utilizing quantitative analysis of resting EEG could benefit our understanding of fibromyalgia pathophysiology.

In these case series, we document a shift of the APF towards the lower end of the EEG spectrum in two completely locked-in ALS patients. In not completely locked-in ALS patients, the alpha rhythm lies within the common frequency range. We discuss potential implications of this shift for the largely unknown cognitive state of completely locked-in ALS patients. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: Sixteen adult patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) had intra-operative ECoG recordings at the time of resection. The computer-annotated ECoG recordings were visually inspected and false positive detections were removed. We retrospectively determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) of HFO detections in unresected regions for determining post-operative seizure outcome. Results: Visual validation revealed that 2.81% of ripple and 43.68% of fast ripple detections were false positive. Inter-reader agreement for false positive fast ripple on spike classification was good (ICC = 0.713, 95% CI: 0.632-0.779). After removing false positive detections, the PPV of a single fast ripple on spike in an unresected electrode site for post-operative non-seizure free outcome was 85.7 [50-100%]. Including false positive detections reduced the PPV to 64.2 [57.8-69.83%]. Conclusions: Applying automated HFO methods to intraoperative electrocorticography recordings results in false positive fast ripple detections. True fast ripples on spikes are rare, but predict non-seizure free postoperative outcome if found in an unresected site. Significance: Semi-automated HFO detection methods are required to accurately identify fast ripple events in intra-operative ECoG recordings.

Moreover, processing multiple tasks simultaneously often involve more cognitive demands. Two visual tasks, lane-keeping task and mental calculation, were utilized to assess the brain dynamics through 32-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from 14 participants. A 400-ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) factor was used to induce distinct levels of attentional requirements. In the dual-task conditions, the deteriorated behavior reflected the divided attention and the overlapping brain resources used. The frontal, parietal and occipital components were decomposed by independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm. The event-and response-related theta and alpha oscillations in selected brain regions were investigated first. The increased theta oscillation in frontal component and decreased alpha oscillations in parietal and occipital components reflect the cognitive demands and attentional requirements as executing the designed tasks. Furthermore, time-varying interactive over-additive (O-Add), additive (Add) and under-additive (U-Add) activations were explored and summarized through the comparison between the summation of the elicited spectral perturbations in two single-task conditions and the spectral perturbations in the dual task. Add and U-Add activations were observed while executing the dual tasks. U-Add theta and alpha activations dominated the posterior region in dual-task situations. Our results show that both deteriorated behaviors and interactive brain activations should be comprehensively considered for evaluating workload or attentional interaction precisely.

J	Mehraei, G; Shinn-Cunningham, B; Dau, T				Mehraei, Golbarg; Shinn-Cunningham, Barbara; Dau, Torsten			Influence of talker discontinuity on cortical dynamics of auditory spatial attention	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory attention; Event-related potentials; Neural oscillations; Alpha lateralization	SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; CONTINUITY; MODULATION; COMPLEX; TASK	In everyday acoustic scenes, listeners face the challenge of selectively attending to a sound source and maintaining attention on that source long enough to extract meaning. This task is made more daunting by frequent perceptual discontinuities in the acoustic scene: talkers move in space and conversations switch from one speaker to another in a background of many other sources. The inherent dynamics of such switches directly impact our ability to sustain attention. Here we asked how discontinuity in talker voice affects the ability to focus auditory attention to sounds from a particular location as well as neural correlates of underlying processes. During electroencephalography recordings, listeners attended to a stream of spoken syllables from one direction while ignoring distracting syllables from a different talker from the opposite hemifield. On some trials, the talker switched locations in the middle of the streams, creating a discontinuity. This switch disrupted attentional modulation of cortical responses; specifically, event-related potentials evoked by syllables in the to-be-attended direction were suppressed and power in alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) were reduced following the discontinuity. Importantly, at an individual level, the ability to maintain attention to a target stream and report its content, despite the discontinuity, correlates with the magnitude of the disruption of these cortical responses. These results have implications for understanding cortical mechanisms supporting attention. The changes in the cortical responses may serve as a predictor of how well individuals can communicate in complex acoustic scenes and may help in the development of assistive devices and interventions to aid clinical populations.

Group Analysis in FieldTrip of Time-Frequency Responses: A Pipeline for Reproducibility at Every Step of Processing, Going From Individual Sensor Space Representations to an Across-Group Source Space Representation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MEG; analysis pipeline; fieldtrip; beamformer; tactile expectations; group analysis; good practice	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MEG-DATA; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; EEG RECORDINGS; HUMAN BRAIN; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; LOCALIZATION; STIMULATION	An important aim of an analysis pipeline for magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data is that it allows for the researcher spendingmaximal effort onmaking the statistical comparisons that will answer his or her questions. The example question being answered here is whether the so-called beta rebound differs between novel and repeated stimulations. Two analyses are presented: going from individual sensor space representations to, respectively, an across-group sensor space representation and an across-group source space representation. The data analyzed are neural responses to tactile stimulations of the right index finger in a group of 20 healthy participants acquired from an Elekta Neuromag System. The processing steps covered for the first analysis are MaxFiltering the raw data, defining, preprocessing and epoching the data, cleaning the data, finding and removing independent components related to eye blinks, eye movements and heart beats, calculating participants' individual evoked responses by averaging over epoched data and subsequently removing the average response from single epochs, calculating a time-frequency representation and baselining it with non-stimulation trials and finally calculating a grand average, an across-group sensor space representation. The second analysis starts from the grand average sensor space representation and after identification of the beta rebound the neural origin is imaged using beamformer source reconstruction. This analysis covers reading in co-registered magnetic resonance images, segmenting the data, creating a volume conductor, creating a forward model, cutting out MEG data of interest in the time and frequency domains, getting Fourier transforms and estimating source activity with a beamformer model where power is expressed relative to MEG data measured during periods of non-stimulation. Finally, morphing the source estimates onto a common template and performing group-level statistics on the data are covered. Functions for saving relevant figures in an automated and structured manner are also included. The protocol presented here can be applied to any research protocol where the emphasis is on source reconstruction of induced responses where the underlying sources are not coherent.

The present investigation sought to determine whether liking was preserved during spontaneous auditory imagery. To this purpose, we inserted two-second silent intervals into liked and disliked songs, a method known to automatically recreate a mental image of these songs. Neural correlates of musical preference were measured by high-density electroencephalography in twenty subjects who had to listen to a set of five pre-selected unknown songs the same number of times for two weeks. Time frequency analysis of the two most liked and the two most disliked songs confirmed the presence of neural responses related to liking. At the beginning of silent intervals (400-900 ms and 1000-1300 ms), significant differences in theta activity were originating from the inferior frontal and superior temporal gyrus. These two brain structures are known to work together to process various aspects of music and are also activated when measuring liking while listening to music. At the end of silent intervals (1400-1900), significant alpha activity differences originating from the insula were observed, whose exact role remains to be explored. Although exposure was controlled for liked and disliked songs, liked songs were rated as more familiar, underlying the strong relationship that exists between liking, exposure, and familiarity.

However, motor impairment and cognitive-motor dissociation can bias such approaches. Fourteen patients with post-traumatic DoC and ten healthy controls (HC) were provided with three motor tasks related to mirror neuron system (MNS) activation (movement observation, movement execution, and passive motor imagery of a movement) while recording electroencephalographic (EEG) metrics [EEG power and Granger Casualty Index (GCI)] to detect residual signs of conscious awareness. The most relevant finding was that all HCs, all patients with Minimally Conscious State and one with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome demonstrated an event-related synchronization in the gamma range over left frontal regions, with high GCI values, in the passive motor imagery condition. These data significantly correlated with the level of behavioral responsiveness measured by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Thus, our findings may indicate that motor tasks related to MNS can activate frontoparietal networks, although leading to different conscious processes. Hence, MNS assessment can be usefully employed to differentiate among patients with DoC.

The precuneus (PC) has been recently emphasized as a key area for the memory impairment observed in early AD, likely due to disconnection mechanisms within large-scale networks such as the default mode network (DMN). Using a multimodal approach we investigated in a two-week, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the PC on cognition, as measured by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite in 14 patients with early AD (7 females). TMS combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) was used to detect changes in brain connectivity. We found that rTMS of the PC induced a selective improvement in episodic memory, but not in other cognitive domains. Analysis of TMS-EEG signal revealed an increase of neural activity in patients' PC, an enhancement of brain oscillations in the beta band and a modification of functional connections between the PC and medial frontal areas within the DMN. Our findings show that high-frequency rTMS of the PC is a promising, non-invasive treatment for memory dysfunction in patients at early stages of AD. This clinical improvement is accompanied by modulation of brain connectivity, consistently with the pathophysiological model of brain disconnection in AD.

Methods: Simultaneous intracranial electrical recordings of the amygdala, hippocampus, and scalp electroencephalography during spontaneous sleep polysomnography in four patients suffering from epilepsy were analyzed. Results: Power spectrum of the amygdala revealed no differences between rapid eye movement (REM) and wakefulness for all frequencies except higher power at 9 Hz during wakefulness and some low Gamma frequencies. Conversely, higher power was observed in non-REM (NREM) sleep than wakefulness for Delta, Theta and Sigma. Conclusions: Our results showed similar activity in the amygdala between wakefulness and REM sleep suggesting that the amygdala is as active in REM as during wakefulness. The higher power in Sigma frequencies during NREM sleep suggests that amygdala slow activity may play a significant role during NREM in concurrence with hippocampal activity. Significance: While studies have described the metabolic activity of the human amygdala during sleep, our results show the corresponding electrical pattern during the whole night, pointing out an increase of slow activity during NREM sleep that might be subjected to similar influences as other subcortical brain structures, such as the hippocampus.

Many outstanding studies have reported great results in providing sensible indirect (warning systems) or direct (interactive neural stimulation) control over refractory seizures, some of which achieved high performance. However, to achieve high sensitivity and a low false prediction rate, many of these studies relied on handcraft feature extraction and/or tailored feature extraction, which is performed for each patient independently. This approach, however, is not generalizable, and requires significant modifications for each new patient within a new dataset. In this article, we apply convolutional neural networks to different intracranial and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and propose a generalized retrospective and patient-specific seizure prediction method. We use the short-time Fourier transform on 30-s EEG windows to extract information in both the frequency domain and the time domain. The algorithm automatically generates optimized features for each patient to best classify preictal and interictal segments. The method can be applied to any other patient from any dataset without the need for manual feature extraction. The proposed approach achieves sensitivity of 81.4%, 81.2%, and 75% and a false prediction rate of 0.06/h, 0.16/h, and 0.21/h on the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset, the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG dataset, and the American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge dataset, respectively. Our prediction method is also statistically better than an unspecific random predictor for most of the patients in all three datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study aims to clarify alterations of the executive control (EC) network in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Twenty patients with TLE and 20 matched healthy control subjects participated in the attention network test (ANT), and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were set up. The ANT was used to evaluate attention network behavior deficits. Power spectral density (PSD), coherence and correlation were used to detect power and oscillation alterations of attention network in patients with TLE. The most significant differences in executive control were found between patients with TLE and healthy control subjects. Power spectral density in the theta band, and coherence and correlation in the theta band in the frontal area were decreased in patients with TLE. Our results indicate that patients with TLE have severe attention dysfunction, especially in executive control. In addition, brain theta oscillation impairment in frontal area might be connected with poor executive control behavior. These findings will provide new insight into diagnosing and treating patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.

The traditional method deals with the electroencephalogram (EEG) induced by MI by common spatial pattern (CSP), which is used to extract information from a frequency band. In order to further improve the classification accuracy of the system, information of two characteristic frequency bands is extracted.

Electrophysiological measures reveal the role of anterior cingulate cortex in learning from unreliable feedback	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Frontal midline theta; Reward positivity; Anterior cingulate cortex; Feedback reliability	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; PREDICTION ERROR; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; EEG OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; CORTICAL AREAS; MIDLINE THETA; REWARD; NEGATIVITY	Although a growing number of studies have investigated the neural mechanisms of reinforcement learning, it remains unclear how the brain responds to feedback that is unreliable. A recent theory proposes that the reward positivity (RewP) component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) and frontal midline theta (FMT) power reflect separate feedback-related processing functions of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In the present study, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from participants as they engaged in a time estimation task in which feedback reliability was manipulated across conditions. After each response, they received a cue that indicated that the following feedback stimulus was 100%, 75%, or 50% reliable. The results showed that participants' time estimates adjusted linearly according to the feedback reliability. Moreover, presentation of the cue indicating 100% reliability elicited a larger RewP-like ERP component than the other cues did, and feedback presentation elicited a RewP of approximately equal amplitude for all of the three reliability conditions. By contrast, FMT power elicited by negative feedback decreased linearly from the 100% condition to 75% and 50% condition, and only FMT power predicted behavioral adjustments on the following trials. In addition, an analysis of Beta power and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) of Beta power with FMT phase suggested that Beta-FMT communication modulated motor areas for the purpose of adjusting behavior. We interpreted these findings in terms of the hierarchical reinforcement learning account of ACC, in which the RewP and FMT are proposed to reflect reward processing and control functions of ACC, respectively.

Little is known about how the ignored sound sources in the background are mentally represented after the source of interest has formed the perceptual foreground. This is due to a key methodological challenge: the background representation is by definition not overtly reportable. Here we developed a paradigm based on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to assess the mental representation of background sounds. Participants listened to sequences of three repeatedly presented tones arranged in an ascending order (low, middle, high frequency). They were instructed to detect intensity deviants in one of the tones, creating the perceptual foreground. The remaining two background tones contained timing and location deviants. Those deviants were set up such that mismatch negativity (MMN) components would be elicited in distinct ways if the background was decomposed into two separate sound streams (background segregation) or if it was not further decomposed (background integration). Results provide MMN-based evidence for background segregation and integration in parallel. This suggests that mental representations of background integration and segregation can be concurrently available, and that collecting empirical evidence for only one of these background organization alternatives might lead to erroneous conclusions.

Subjects enter several stages during the sleep, and N-REM2 is one of them which has also the highest duration among the other stages. Approximately half of the sleep consists of N-REM2. One of the important parameters in determining N-REM2 stage is K-complex (Kc). In this study, some time and frequency analysis methods were used to determine the locations of Kcs, automatically. These are singular value decomposition (SVD), variational mode decomposition and discrete wavelet transform. The performance of them in detecting Kcs was compared. Furthermore, systems with combinations of these methods were presented with logic AND operations. The EEG recordings of seven subjects were obtained from the Sleep Research Laboratory of Necmettin Erbakan University. A database with total 359 Kcs in 320 epochs was prepared from the recordings. According to the results, the highest average recognition rate was found as 92.29% for the SVD method. Thanks to this study, the sleep experts can find out whether there were Kcs in related epochs and also know their locations in these epochs, automatically. Also, it will help automatic sleep stage classification systems.

Although the idea of discrete frames in conscious perception cannot be regarded as falsified, there are many problems. Evidence does not consistently support any proposed duration or range of durations for frames. EEG waveforms provide evidence of periodicity in brain activity, but not necessarily in conscious perception. Temporal properties of perceptual processes are flexible in response to competing processing demands, which is hard to reconcile with the relative inflexibility of regular frames. There are also problems concerning the definition of frames, the need for informational connections between frames, the means by which boundaries between frames are established, and the apparent requirement for a storage buffer for information awaiting entry to the next frame.

J	Dickinson, A; DiStefano, C; Senturk, D; Jeste, SS				Dickinson, Abigail; DiStefano, Charlotte; Senturk, Damla; Jeste, Shafali Spurling			Peak alpha frequency is a neural marker of cognitive function across the autism spectrum	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism; cognitive function; electroencephalography; peak alpha frequency; spontaneous alpha	YOUNG-CHILDREN; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MULLEN SCALES; EEG POWER; DISORDERS; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; VARIABILITY	Cognitive function varies substantially and serves as a key predictor of outcome and response to intervention in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet we know little about the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie cognitive function in children with ASD. The dynamics of neuronal oscillations in the alpha range (6-12Hz) are associated with cognition in typical development. Peak alpha frequency is also highly sensitive to developmental changes in neural networks, which underlie cognitive function, and therefore, it holds promise as a developmentally sensitive neural marker of cognitive function in ASD. Here, we measured peak alpha band frequency under a task-free condition in a heterogeneous sample of children with ASD (N=59) and age-matched typically developing (TD) children (N=38). At a group level, peak alpha frequency was decreased in ASD compared to TD children. Moreover, within the ASD group, peak alpha frequency correlated strongly with non-verbal cognition. As peak alpha frequency reflects the integrity of neural networks, our results suggest that deviations in network development may underlie cognitive function in individuals with ASD. By shedding light on the neurobiological correlates of cognitive function in ASD, our findings lay the groundwork for considering peak alpha frequency as a useful biomarker of cognitive function within this population which, in turn, will facilitate investigations of early markers of cognitive impairment and predictors of outcome in high risk infants.

Virtual localization of the seizure onset zone: Using non-invasive MEG virtual electrodes at stereo-EEG electrode locations in refractory epilepsy patients	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Virtual electrodes; Refractory epilepsy; Epilepsy surgery; Stereo-electroencephalography; Functional connectivity	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EPILEPTOGENIC ZONE; FOCAL EPILEPSY; BRAIN NETWORKS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SEEG; RECORDINGS	In some patients with medically refractory epilepsy, EEG with intracerebrally placed electrodes (stereo-electroencephalography, SEEG) is needed to locate the seizure onset zone (SOZ) for successful epilepsy surgery. SEEG has limitations and entails risk of complications because of its invasive character. Non-invasive magnetoencephalography virtual electrodes (MEG-VEs) may overcome SEEG limitations and optimize electrode placement making SOZ localization safer. Our purpose was to assess whether interictal activity measured by MEG-VEs and SEEG at identical anatomical locations were comparable, and whether MEG-VEs activity properties could determine the location of a later resected brain area (RA) as an approximation of the SOZ. We analyzed data from nine patients who underwent MEG and SEEG evaluation, and surgery for medically refractory epilepsy. MEG activity was retrospectively reconstructed using beamforming to obtain VEs at the anatomical locations corresponding to those of SEEG electrodes. Spectral, functional connectivity and functional network properties were obtained for both, MEG-VEs and SEEG time series, and their correlation and reliability were established. Based on these properties, the approximation of the SOZ was characterized by the differences between RA and non-RA (NRA). We found significant positive correlation and reliability between MEG-VEs and SEEG spectral measures (particularly in delta [0.5-4 Hz], alpha2 [10-13 Hz], and beta [13-30 Hz] bands) and broadband functional connectivity. Both modalities showed significantly slower activity and a tendency towards increased broadband functional connectivity in the RA compared to the NRA. Our findings show that spectral and functional connectivity properties of non-invasively obtained MEG-VEs match those of invasive SEEG recordings, and can characterize the SOZ. This suggests that MEG-VEs might be used for optimal SEEG planning and fewer depth electrode implantations, making the localization of the SOZ safer and more successful.

To target the phase online, it is necessary to deal with distortions at the edge of the time-window used for online filtering and to predict the targeted phase at the time of stimulation. We propose a simple algorithm involving a padding step to minimize the filter-induced distortion and the prediction of the phase from the last peaks of the filtered signal. The novel peak-projection algorithm was validated for online phase targeting of precentral alpha activity on a set of resting-state EEG data in four healthy volunteers.

On the Efficiency of Individualized Theta/Beta Ratio Neurofeedback Combined with Forehead EMG Training in ADHD Children	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurofeedback training; ADHD; individual alpha activity; EMG; theta/beta ratio	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; EEG-ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; BIOFEEDBACK; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION	Background : Neurofeedback training (NFT) to decrease the theta/beta ratio (TBR) has been used for treating hyperactivity and impulsivity in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, often with low efficiency. Individual variance in EEG profile can confound NFT, because it may lead to influencing non-relevant activity, if ignored. More importantly, it may lead to influencing ADHD-related activities adversely, which may even result in worsening ADHD symptoms. Electromyogenic (EMG) signal resulted from forehead muscles can also explain the low efficiency of the NFT in ADHD from both practical and psychological point-of-view. The first aim of this study was to determine EEG and EMG biomarkers most related to the main ADHD characteristics, such as impulsivity and hyperactivity. The second aim was to confirm our hypothesis that the efficiency of the TBR NFT can be increased by individual adjustment of the frequency bands and simultaneous training on forehead muscle tension. Methods : We recruited 94 children diagnosed with ADHD (ADHD) and 23 healthy controls (HC). All participants were male and aged between six and nine. Impulsivity and attention were assessed with Go/no-Go task and delayed gratification task, respectively; and 19-channel EEG and forehead EMG were recorded. Then, the ADHD group was randomly subdivided into (1) standard, (2) individualized, (3) individualized+EMG, and (4) sham NFT (control) groups. The groups were compared based on TBR and EEG alpha activity, as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity three times: pre-NFT, post-NFT and 6 months after the NFT (follow-up). Results : ADHD children were characterized with decreased individual alpha peak frequency, alpha bandwidth and alpha amplitude suppression magnitude, as well as with increased alpha1/alpha2 (a1/a2) ratio and scalp muscle tension when c (eta(2) >= 0.212). All contingent TBR NFT groups exhibited significant NFT-related decrease in TBR not evident in the control group. Moreover, we detected a higher overall alpha activity in the individualized but not in the standard NFT group. Mixed MANOVA considering between-subject factor GROUP and within-subject factor TIME showed that the individualized+EMG group exhibited the highest level of clinical improvement, which was associated with increase in the individual alpha activity at the 6 months follow-up when comparing with the other approaches (post hoc t = 3.456, p = 0.011). Conclusions: This study identified various (adjusted) alpha activity metrics as biomarkers with close relationship with ADHD symptoms, and demonstrated that TBR NFT individually adjusted for variances in alpha activity is more successful and clinically more efficient than standard, non-individualized NFT. Moreover, these training effects of the individualized TBR NFT lasted longer when combined with EMG.

The desynchronization of alpha (10 Hz) oscillations in the neocortex has been shown to predict successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, when engaging in learning, it has been found that the hippocampus synchronizes in theta (4 Hz) oscillations, and that learning is dependent on the phase of theta. This inconsistency as to whether synchronization is "good" for memory formation leads to confusion over which oscillations we should expect to see and where during learning paradigm experiments. This paper seeks to respond to this inconsistency by presenting a neural network model of how a well functioning learning system could exhibit both of these phenomena, i.e., desynchronization of alpha and synchronization of theta during successful memory encoding. We present a spiking neural network (the Sync/deSync model) of the neocortical and hippocampal system. The simulated hippocampus learns through an adapted spike-time dependent plasticity rule, in which weight change is modulated by the phase of an extrinsically generated theta oscillation. Additionally, a global passive weight decay is incorporated, which is also modulated by theta phase. In this way, the Sync/deSync model exhibits theta phase-dependent long-term potentiation and long-term depression. We simulated a learning paradigm experiment and compared the oscillatory dynamics of our model with those observed in single-cell and scalp-EEG studies of the medial temporal lobe. Our Sync/deSync model suggests that both the desynchronization of neocortical alpha and the synchronization of hippocampal theta are necessary for successful memory encoding and retrieval.

Deficiencies in both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NMDA receptor function have been implicated in the disorder and may play causal and synergistic roles. Perturbations in the regulation of electrophysiological signals, including high-frequency (gamma: 30-80 Hz and beta: 20-30 Hz) neuronal oscillations, are also associated with the disorder. This study investigated the influence of BDNF deficiency and NMDA receptor hypofunction on electrophysiological responses to brief acoustic stimuli. Adult BDNF heterozygote (BDNF+/-) and wild-type littermate C57Bl/ 6J mice were surgically implanted with EEG recording electrodes. All mice underwent EEG recording sessions to measure ongoing and auditory-evoked electrophysiological responses following treatment with MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg ip) or vehicle. Western blotting on post-mortem cortical tissue assessed parvalbumin and GAD67 expression -markers of interneurons which are involved in the generation of gamma oscillations. Compared with wild-type controls, BDNF+/-mice exhibited markedly dampened electrophysiological responses to auditory stimuli, including reductions in the amplitude of multiple components of the event-related potential and auditory-evoked oscillations, as well as reduced ongoing cortical gamma oscillations. MK-801 elevated ongoing gamma power but suppressed evoked gamma power, and this was observed equally across genotypes. BDNF+/-mice also displayed reductions in parvalbumin, but not GAD67 expression. We conclude that reduced BDNF expression leads to impairments in the generation of high-frequency neural oscillations, but this is not synergistic with NMDA receptor hypofunction. Reduced parvalbumin expression associated with BDNF haploinsufficiency may provide a molecular explanation for these electrophysiological deficits.

J	Price, MH; Johnson, JD				Price, Mason H.; Johnson, Jeffrey D.			Failure to reactivate salient episodic information during indirect and direct tests of memory retrieval	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Episodic memory; Reinstatement; Unconscious; Retrieval; EEG	COMPLEMENTARY-LEARNING-SYSTEMS; MULTIVOXEL PATTERN-ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; FALSE MEMORIES; SENSORY SIGNATURE; NETWORK MODEL; ITEM MEMORY; RECOLLECTION	Several fMRI and EEG studies have demonstrated that successful episodic retrieval is accompanied by the reactivation of cortical regions that were active during encoding. These findings are consistent with influential models of episodic memory that posit that conscious retrieval (recollection) relies on hippocampally-mediated cortical reinstatement. Evidence of reactivation corresponding to episodic information that is beyond conscious awareness at the time of memory retrieval, however, is limited. A recent exception is from an EEG study by Wimber, Maa beta, Staudigl, Richardson-Klavehn, and Hanslmayr et al. (2009) in which words were encoded in the context of highly salient visual flicker entrainment and then presented at retrieval in the absence of any flicker. In that study, coherent (phase-locked) neural activity was observed at the corresponding entrained frequencies during retrieval, consistent with the notion that encoding representations were reactivated. Given the important implications of unconscious reactivation to past findings and the modeling literature, the current study set out to provide a direct replication of the previous study. Additionally, an attempt was made to extend such findings to intentional retrieval by acquiring EEG while subjects were explicitly asked to make memory judgments about the flicker frequency from encoding. Throughout a comprehensive set of analyses, the current study consistently failed to demonstrate evidence for unconscious reactivation, and instead provided support that test items were indistinguishable according to their prior encoding context. The findings thus establish an important boundary condition for the involvement of cortical reinstatement in episodic memory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sedation and Analgesia Influence Electroencephalography Monitoring in Pediatric Neurocritical Care	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Critical illness; Intensive care; Seizures; Neuropharmacology; Neuroactive drugs	ELECTROGRAPHIC STATUS EPILEPTICUS; NONCONVULSIVE SEIZURES; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; CHILDREN; OUTCOMES; EEG; MULTICENTER; HYPOTHERMIA; EXPOSURE; COMMON	OBJECTIVES: We assessed neuroactive medication use in critically ill children who require neurological consultation and evaluated the associations between administration of these medications and continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) utilization and seizure frequency. METHODS: We evaluated exposure to sedatives, analgesics, anesthetics, and paralytics in consecutive patients (0 days to 18 years) for whom neurological consultation was requested in three intensive care units (ICUs) [neonatal (NICU), pediatric (PICU), and cardiothoracic (PCTU)]) at one children's hospital. We assessed cEEG usage and seizure incidence in relation to drug exposure. RESULTS: From November 2015 to November 2016, 300 consecutive patients were evaluated (93 NICU, 139 PICU, and 68 PCTU). Ninety-seven (32%) were receiving >= 1 sedative infusion at the time of consultation [NICU 7 (8%), PICU 50(36%), PCTU 40 (58%%]; 91 (30%) received >= 1 paralytic agent within the preceding 24 hours. Continuous electroen-cephalography was performed more often for patients treated with sedative infusions (81 of 97 versus 133 of 203, P = 0.001) and paralytic medications (80 of 91 versus 134 of 209, P < 0.001) within 24 hours preceding consultation than those who were not. Sixty-eight of 214 (32%) had electrographic seizures (65 of 68 within initial 24 hours of monitoring); seizures were less common among patients who had received sedative infusions (18 of 81 versus 51 of 133, P = 0.014). In multivariable analysis of seizure likelihood, only younger age was associated with increased risk (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill infants and children are frequently treated with sedatives, anesthetics, analgesics, and paralytics. Neuroactive medications limit bedside neurological assessments and, in this cohort, were associated with increased cEEG usage. Our data underscore the need to study the effect of these medications on clinical care and long-term outcomes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electrodiagnostic applications of somatosensory evoked high-frequency EEG oscillations: Technical considerations	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs); High-frequency oscillations (HFOs); EEG	600 HZ; MIGRAINE PATIENTS; POTENTIALS; CORTEX; COMPONENTS; EPILEPSY	Introduction: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) embedded within the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) are not routinely recorded/measured as part of standard clinical SEPs. However, HFOs could provide important additional diagnostic/prognostic information in various patient groups in whom SEPs are tested routinely. One area is the management of patients with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the sensitivity of standard clinical SEP recording techniques for detecting HFOs is unknown. Methods: SEPs were recorded using routine clinical methods in 17 healthy subjects (median nerve stimulation; 0.5 ms pulse width; 5 Hz; maximum 4000 stimuli) in an unshielded laboratory. Bipolar EEG recordings were acquired (gain 50 k; bandpass 3Hz-2 kHz; sampling rate 5 kHz; non-inverting electrode 2 cm anterior to C3/C4; inverting electrode 2 cm posterior to C3/C4). Data analysis was performed in MATLAB. Results: SEP-HFOs were detected in 65% of controls using standard clinical recording techniques. In 3 controls without significant HFOs, experiments were repeated using a linear electrode array with higher spatial sampling frequency. SEP-HFOs were observed in all 3 subjects. Conclusions: Currently standard clinical methods of recording SEPs are not sufficiently sensitive to permit the inclusion of SEP-HFOs in routine clinical diagnostic/prognostic assessments. Whilst an increase in the number/density of EEG electrodes should improve the sensitivity for detecting SEP-HFOs, this requires confirmation. By improving and standardising clinical SEP recording protocols to permit the acquisition/analysis of SEP-HFOs, it should be possible to gain important insights into the pathophysiology of neurological disorders and refine the management of conditions such as HIE.

In natural environments, events that demand sensorimotor predictions unfold across many timescales, and corresponding temporal predictions (either explicit or implicit) should therefore emerge in brain dynamics. Neuronal oscillations are scale-specific processes found in several frequency bands. They underlie periodicity in sensorimotor processing and can represent temporal predictions via their phase dynamics. These processes build upon endogenous neural rhythmicity and adapt in response to exogenous timing demands. While much of the research on periodicity in neural processing has focused on subsecond oscillations, these fast-scale rhythms are in fact paralleled by critical-like, scale-free dynamics and fluctuations of brain activity at various timescales, ranging from seconds to hundreds of seconds. In this review, we put forth a framework positing that critical brain dynamics are essential for the role of neuronal oscillations in timing and that cross-frequency coupling flexibly organizes neuronal processing across multiple frequencies.

Emotion-related cognitive functions are difficult to detect in patients with DOC using motor response-based clinical assessment scales such as the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) because DOC patients have motor impairments and are unable to provide sufficient motor responses for emotion-related communication. In this study, we proposed an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system for emotion recognition in patients with DOC. Eight patients with DOC (5 VS and 3 MCS) and eight healthy controls participated in the BCI-based experiment. During the experiment, two movie clips flashed (appearing and disappearing) eight times with a random interstimulus interval between flashes to evoke P300 potentials. The subjects were instructed to focus on the crying or laughing movie clip and to count the flashes of the corresponding movie clip cued by instruction. The BCI system performed online P300 detection to determine which movie clip the patients responsed to and presented the result as feedback. Three of the eight patients and all eight healthy controls achieved online accuracies based on P300 detection that were significantly greater than chance level. P300 potentials were observed in the EEG signals from the three patients. These results indicated the three patients had abilities of emotion recognition and command following. Through spectral analysis, common spatial pattern (CSP) and differential entropy (DE) features in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands were employed to classify the EEG signals during the crying and laughing movie clips. Two patients and all eight healthy controls achieved offline accuracies significantly greater than chance levels in the spectral analysis. Furthermore, stable topographic distribution patterns of CSP and DE features were observed in both the healthy subjects and these two patients. Our results suggest that cognitive experiments may be conducted using BCI systems in patients with DOC despite the inability of such patients to provide sufficient behavioral responses.

However, little is known about how the neural oscillation of LPFC functions during intertemporal choice, owing to the technical limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related brain potential recordings. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a novel neuroimaging technique that has high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we used ECoG and projected the ECoG data onto individual brain spaces to investigate human intracranial cortex activity and how neural oscillations of the LPFC impact intertemporal choice. We found that neural activity of theta oscillation was significantly higher during impulsive decisions, while beta oscillation activity was significantly higher during non-impulsive ones. Our findings suggest a functional dissociation between cortical theta and beta oscillations during decision-making processes involved in intertemporal choice, and that decision outcomes may be determined by LPFC modulation, which involves neural oscillations at different frequencies.

Subcortical sources dominate the neuroelectric auditory frequency-following response to speech	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs); Auditory brainstem response (ABR) to speech; Classical low resolution electromagnetic; tomography analysis recursively applied (CLARA); Intracerebral dipole generators; Time-frequency analysis	HUMAN BRAIN-STEM; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PHASE-LOCKED RESPONSES; MODULATION FOLLOWING RESPONSE; RELEVANT PITCH PATTERNS; EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SPHERICAL HEAD MODELS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; PURE-TONES	Frequency-following responses (FFRs) are neurophonic potentials that provide a window into the encoding of complex sounds (e.g., speech/music), auditory disorders, and neuroplasticity. While the neural origins of the FFR remain debated, renewed controversy has reemerged after demonstration that FFRs recorded via magnetoencephalography (MEG) are dominated by cortical rather than brainstem structures as previously assumed. Here, we recorded high-density (64 ch) FFRs via EEG and applied state-of-the art source imaging techniques to multichannel data (discrete dipole modeling, distributed imaging, independent component analysis, computational simulations). Our data confirm a mixture of generators localized to bilateral auditory nerve (AN), brainstem inferior colliculus (BS), and bilateral primary auditory cortex (PAC). However, frequency-specific scrutiny of source waveforms showed the relative contribution of these nuclei to the aggregate FFR varied across stimulus frequencies. Whereas AN and BS sources produced robust FFRs up to similar to 700 Hz, PAC showed weak phase-locking with little FFR energy above the speech fundamental (100 Hz). Notably, CLARA imaging further showed PAC activation was eradicated for FFRs > 150 Hz, above which only subcortical sources remained active. Our results show (i) the site of FFR generation varies critically with stimulus frequency; and (ii) opposite the pattern observed in MEG, subcortical structures make the largest contribution to electrically recorded FFRs (AN >= BS > PAC). We infer that cortical dominance observed in previous neuromagnetic data is likely due to the bias of MEG to superficial brain tissue, underestimating subcortical structures that drive most of the speech-FFR. Cleanly separating subcortical from cortical FFRs can be achieved by ensuring stimulus frequencies are > 150-200 Hz, above the phase-locking limit of cortical neurons.

However, it is unclear which constituent in cannabis is responsible for these effects, or whether these are cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) mediated. Therefore, the present study in humans and rats examined whether cannabinoid administration would disrupt sensory gating and evoked oscillations utilizing electroen-cephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFPs), respectively. Human subjects (n = 15) completed four test days during which they received intravenous delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), Delta(9)-THC + CBD, or placebo. Subjects engaged in a dual-click paradigm, and outcome measures included P50 gating ratio (S2/S1) and evoked power to S1 and S2. In order to examine CB1R specificity, rats (n = 6) were administered the CB1R agonist CP-55940, CP-55940+AM-251 (a CB1R antagonist), or vehicle using the same paradigm. LFPs were recorded from CA3 and entorhinal cortex. Both Delta(9)-THC (p < 0.007) and Delta(9)-THC + CBD (p < 0.004) disrupted P50 gating ratio compared to placebo, while CBD alone had no effect. Delta(9)-THC (p <0.048) and Delta(9)-THC + CBD (p < 0.035) decreased S1 evoked theta power, and in the Delta(9)-THC condition, S1 theta negatively correlated with gating ratios (r = -0.629, p < 0.012 (p < 0.048 adjusted)). In rats, CP-55940 disrupted gating in both brain regions (p < 0.0001), and this was reversed by AM-251. Further, CP-55940 decreased evoked theta (p < 0.0077) and gamma (p < 0.011) power to Si, which was partially blocked by AM-251. These convergent human/animal data suggest that CB1R agonists disrupt sensory gating by altering neural oscillations in the theta-band. Moreover, this suggests that the endocannabinoid system mediates theta oscillations relevant to perception and cognition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oscillatory neural activity is crucial for these processes, but how such rhythms are expressed across the cortex within and across individuals is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic characterization of brain-wide activity across frequency bands and oscillatory features during rest and task execution. We found that oscillatory profiles exhibit sizable group-level similarities, indicating the presence of common templates of oscillatory organization. Nonetheless, well-defined subject-specific network profiles were discernible beyond the structure shared across individuals. These individualized patterns were sufficiently stable to recognize individuals several months later. Moreover, network structure of rhythmic activity varied considerably across distinct oscillatory frequencies and features, indicating the existence of several parallel information processing streams embedded in distributed electrophysiological activity. These findings suggest that network similarity analyses may be useful for understanding the role of large-scale brain oscillations in physiology and behavior.

A versatile set of techniques for studying non-Gaussian signals relies on the spectral representations of higher moments, known as polyspectra, which describe forms of cross-frequency dependence that do not arise in time-invariant Gaussian signals. The most commonly used of these employ the bispectrum. Recently, other measures of cross-frequency dependence have drawn interest in EEG literature, in particular those which address phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Here we demonstrate a close relationship between the bispectrum and popular measures of PAC, which we relate to smoothings of the signal bispectrum, making them fundamentally bispectral estimators. Viewed this way, however, conventional PAC measures exhibit some unfavorable qualities, including poor bias properties, lack of correct symmetry and artificial constraints on the spectral range and resolution of the estimate. Moreover, information obscured by smoothing in measures of PAC, but preserved in standard bispectral estimators, may be critical for distinguishing nested oscillations from transient signal features and other nonoscillatory causes of "spurious" PAC. We propose guidelines for gauging the nature and origin of cross-frequency coupling with bispectral statistics. Beyond clarifying the relationship between PAC and the bispectrum, the present work lays out a general framework for the interpretation of the bispectrum, which extends to other higher-order spectra. In particular, this framework holds promise for the detailed identification of signal features related to both nested oscillations and transient phenomena. We conclude with a discussion of some broader theoretical implications of this framework and highlight promising directions for future development.

We investigated the consequences of momentary lapses in attention during listening comprehension on neural activity and behavior. Participants listened to two full-length stories while EEG was recorded, and afterwards completed multiple choice comprehension questions. Listening was periodically interrupted by attention probes, in which participants were asked whether their attention immediately preceding the probe's appearance was focused on the story. The results showed that (1) participants spent a substantial amount of time off-task, endorsing attention lapses on over 30% of probes; (2) for probes on which an attention lapse was endorsed, later accuracy on comprehension questions querying pre-probe information was decreased; (3) the pre-probe period just before the endorsement of an attention lapse was characterized by a greater percentage of above-threshold oscillations in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) compared to just prior to the endorsement of on-task or split-attention listening; and (4) when participants made "I have no idea" responses to comprehension questions, their EEG record revealed a greater percentage of above-threshold alpha oscillations during the original presentation of the information queried by the comprehension questions, compared to correct responses or incorrect guesses. These results connect changes in neural activity in the alpha band to episodes of mind-wandering during listening comprehension, and in turn to decreased comprehension accuracy. This demonstrates how alpha can be used to track attentional engagement during language comprehension, and illustrates the dependence of successful language comprehension on attention.	[Boudewyn, M.

To do this, We used the Moving Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and the Hurst exponent estimator to visualize short. and long term EEG behavior during 2 minutes of EEG recording in closed eyes basal conditions. The EEG of 8 subjects served as data source for exploring the time series organtzation of the EEG in resting state. We found inter-subjects shared network patterns of high synchronic functional connectivity in frontal and right temporo-occipital regions. We also found a diversity of individual different networks of variable degree of synchronicity, in the range of -0.5<R<0.5 (Spearinan linear r). The nonlinear approach using Hurst exponent estimator for the chaos/order balance in the EEG time series, gave us averages values of H >0.5 for all channels. The short-term approximation to the chaos oscillation (M-Hurst)revealed several individual differences and a potential tool for subject's characterization. (C) 2018 The Authors.

However, in addition to the common artifacts in standard EEG data, spTMS-EEG data suffer from enormous stimulation-induced artifacts, posing significant challenges to the extraction of neural information. Typically, neural signals are analyzed after a manual time-intensive and often subjective process of artifact rejection. Here we describe a fully automated algorithm for spTMS-EEG artifact rejection. A key step of this algorithm is to decompose the spTMS-EEG data into statistically independent components (ICs), and then train a pattern classifier to automatically identify artifact components based on knowledge of the spatio-temporal profile of both neural and artefactual activities. The autocleaned and hand-cleaned data yield qualitatively similar group evoked potential waveforms. The algorithm achieves a 95% IC classification accuracy referenced to expert artifact rejection performance, and does so across a large number of spTMS-EEG data sets (n=90 stimulation sites), retains high accuracy across stimulation sites/subjects/populations/montages, and outperforms current automated algorithms. Moreover, the algorithm was superior to the artifact rejection performance of relatively novice individuals, who would be the likely users of spTMS-EEG as the technique becomes more broadly disseminated. In summary, our algorithm provides an automated, fast, objective, and accurate method for cleaning spTMS-EEG data, which can increase the utility of TMS-EEG in both clinical and basic neuroscience settings.

Increased gamma power during sensory processing of physical salience has been shown to be associated with positive trait schizotypy. In the present study, this is assessed in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: The early evoked visual gamma-band response (GBR) at 40 Hz was assessed for a schizophrenia patient group (N = 22) and a matched healthy control group (N = 22) applying EEG time-frequency analysis. The GBR was assessed for two conditions within a visual detection paradigm: a target with or without a physically salient distracter and evaluated in relation to the PANSS. Results: A 2 x 2 ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of condition and a trend interaction of group and condition for the GBR, with highest power for schizophrenia patients in the physically salient distracter condition. Moreover, evoked GBR power in this condition was correlated with positive (r = 0.664; P = 0.001**) and disorganised (r = 0.618; P = 0.002**) schizophrenia symptoms. Conclusions: Evoked GBR power during processing of physical salience in schizophrenia was associated with positive symptoms. We suggest that abnormal processing of physically salient stimuli might be involved in the pathophysiological genesis of positive symptoms.

Time-invariant multi-scale matrices are constructed in the first step. The two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis then operates on the multi-scale matrices to reduce the dimension, rather than vectors in conventional PCA. Results are presented from an experiment to classify twenty hand motions using 89-channel EMG signals recorded in stroke survivors, which illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for biomedical signal analysis. With this multi-scale two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis for high-dimensional signal classification, spatial-time-frequency discriminant information from high-dimensional EMG electrode array can be effectively extracted and reduced using the proposed method. Compared with the time domain feature extraction in conjunction with PCA, MS2D(2)PCA performed better with higher classification accuracy and less PCs in EMG classification. The efficiency and effectiveness of the method can be further validated by using high-dimensional EEG, MEG, fMRI signals. Although the present study focuses on high-dimensional signal pattern classification, based on the PCs obtained at multiple scales, it is relatively straightforward to expand MS2D(2)PCA for high-dimensional signal compression, denoising, component extraction, and other related tasks.

In this study, we administered EEG-neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) to a healthy population to determine the efficacy of this procedure. We evaluated feedback manipulation in the beta band (12-22 Hz), known to be involved in visual attention processing. Two groups of healthy adults were trained to either up- or down-regulate beta band activity, thus providing mutual control. Up-regulation training induced increases in beta and alpha band (8-12 Hz) amplitudes during the first three sessions. Group-independent increases in the activity of both bands were observed in the later phase of training. EEG changes were not matched by measured behavioural indices of attention. Parallel changes in the two bands challenge the idea of frequency-specific EEG-NFB protocols and suggest their interdependence. Our study exposes the possibility (i) that the alpha band is more prone to manipulation, and (ii) that changes in the bands' amplitudes are independent from specified training. We therefore encourage a more comprehensive approach to EEG-neurofeedback training embracing physiological and/or operational relations among various EEG bands.

These impulses also known as Neural Oscillations can be observed by the measuring technique known as Electroencephalogram (EEG). Even though research in the field has been carried out since the 1960s, high level applications using brain waves have not emerged yet. Our objective will be to obtain EEG data for different thinking process and visual stimulus. The primary deterrent while obtaining EEG data is noise. The hardware setup is optimized to acquire the data with minimal interference. After initial data acquisition, filters are applied to reduce the noise and leave relevant data. After noise has been reduced and bandwidth limited, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification techniques are applied on the dataset to discreetly identify different wave charts generated due to different stimulus.

Combined assessment of attentional reserve and cognitive-motor effort under various levels of challenge with a dry EEG system	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attentional reserve; dry EEG; EEG spectral content; ERP; mental workload; motor performance	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; MENTAL WORKLOAD; THETA OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT ARTIFACT; TASK-DIFFICULTY; HEAD MOVEMENT; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; P300	A novel ERP approach was proposed to index variations in mental workload, particularly in attentional reserve, which is complementary to EEG spectral content thought to reflect mental effort. To our knowledge, no study has assessed mental effort and attentional reserve simultaneously in EEG gel-based and, importantly, dry systems, which are particularly well suited for real-world settings. Therefore, by systematically considering ERP, EEG spectral, and importantly the combination of both, this study examined if a small set of dry EEG electrodes could detect changes in both spectral and ERP metrics to assess the mental workload under various challenges with a similar fidelity to their gel-based counterparts in a laboratory setting. By employing both EEG gel-based and dry systems, the ERP and spectral markers were computed while participants executed a visuomotor task under three levels of challenge. For both EEG systems, more challenging levels of difficulty were associated with concomitant changes in ERP amplitude, and spectral power reflected a reduction of the attentional reserve and an increase in cognitive-motor effort, respectively. Those variations in attentional reserve and cognitive-motor effort collectively indexed mental workload with nearly identical fidelity for both gel-based and dry EEG systems. These findings promise to assess the mental workload in situations where the use of dry EEG systems could be advantageously employed to examine human cognitive-motor performance.

Diagnosing the sleep disorder in an early curable stage may help to provide better treatment and save the life. The EEG (Electroencephalogram) signal is one of the most uses bio signal for capturing brain activities to detect and diagnosis the sleep disorders. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is an efficient time-frequency data analysis technique for diagnosing disease by analyzing EEG signal. However, it is a challenging issue to select the optimal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for extracting discriminant properties of EEG signals to diagnosis the sleep disorder. From this point of view, this paper presents a model to select optimal IMF of EMD for diagnosing the sleep disorder using EEG brain signal. In this proposed model, EMD is applied to decompose and analyze EEG signal for extracting biomarker/feature of sleep disorders. During the EMD decomposition process, different levels of IMF are extracted and features, i.e., Shannon Entropy, Spectral Entropy, Standard deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis are calculated from those IMFs for detecting the sleep disorders. In identification process, the multiclass support vector machine (MC-SVM) classification algorithm is used and sleep disorders are classified based on trained knowledge. Finally, the performance of proposed model is evaluated for different IMFs of EMD and find the optimal IMF for sleep disorder diagnosis. For evaluating the proposed model, a benchmark dataset including 4 types of data such as Apnea, REM, PLM and healthy subjects are used in experiment. According to the experimental result, the proposed model achieves the optimal classification performance for IMF 8, i.e., 93.24% average classification accuracy.

In pathological chronic pain which is more severe and common in clinic practice, it is of great interest to investigate the oscillatory activity especially at the broad gamma frequency bands. Our present study explored the resting state oscillatory activities of EEG in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) over 3 months which is a typical neuropathic pain model in clinical researches. It was found that the PHN patients showed anxiety and depression revealed by Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) examinations. Power spectrum analysis revealed that the power at gamma frequency band (from 40 to 70 Hz) of EEG was significantly higher in the PHN patients, and positively correlated with pain intensity, anxiety, and depression indexes. Further, increased gamma activity derived from the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum were revealed by cluster-based sensor level and the beamforming source level analyses. These results suggest the enhanced gamma oscillatory activity in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum is a characteristic marker in chronic neuropathic pain patients.

Forty-two healthy volunteers (men, dextrals, age 18 to 23 years) took part in the tests. The ERS and ERD indices were estimated within the EEG frequency range 8-35 Hz in frontal, central, and parietal leads. In the series with cessation of the triggered MM program and its subsequent switching over to the alternative movement, modifications of neocortical EEG activity, compared to those at complete cessation of the movement, were the following: (i) comparative decrease in the ERS intensity with respect to the 9, 11, and 16 Hz oscillations in the fronto-central cortical regions and intensification of ERD at 11 and 16 Hz in parietal leads, (ii) relative intensification of ERS in the left central neocortical zone (11 Hz frequency), that in the right frontal and parietal zones (16 Hz frequency), and (iii) ERD for the frequencies of 19-20 Hz extensively developed in the neocortex (first of all, in the left hemisphere). Oscillations with the frequency 25 Hz and higher were synchronized to a greater extent at switching of the MM program than at complete cessation of this movement.	[Korzhik, O. V.; Morenko, A.

This study investigates whether top-down attention or specific tasks are required for the brain to apply lexical knowledge to group syllables into words. Neural responses tracking the syllabic and word rhythms of a rhythmic speech sequence were concurrently monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). The participants performed different tasks, attending to either the rhythmic speech sequence or a distractor, which was another speech stream or a nonlinguistic auditory/visual stimulus. Attention to speech, but not a lexical-meaning-related task, was required for reliable neural tracking of words, even when the distractor was a nonlinguistic stimulus presented cross-modally. Neural tracking of syllables, however, was reliably observed in all tested conditions. These results strongly suggest that neural encoding of individual auditory events (i.e., syllables) is automatic, while knowledge-based construction of temporal chunks (i.e., words) crucially relies on top-down attention.

Jansen's neural mass model (NMM) was initially proposed to study the origin of alpha oscillations. Most of previous studies of the spontaneous alpha oscillations in the NMM were conducted using numerical methods. In this study, we aim to propose an analytical approach using the describing function method to elucidate the spontaneous alpha oscillation mechanism in the NMM. First, the sigmoid nonlinear function in the NMM is approximated by its describing function, allowing us to reformulate the NMM and derive its standard form composed of one nonlinear part and one linear part. Second, by conducting a theoretical analysis, we can assess whether or not the spontaneous alpha oscillation would occur in the NMM and, furthermore, accurately determine its amplitude and frequency. The results reveal analytically that the interaction between linearity and nonlinearity of the NMM plays a key role in generating the spontaneous alpha oscillations. Furthermore, strong nonlinearity and large linear strength are required to generate the spontaneous alpha oscillations.

We designed and tested two NFT protocols based on training alpha and beta EEG oscillations selectively measured over the right parietal region. A total of 80 participants were involved, 40 in the alpha NFT protocol and 40 in the beta NFT protocol. The NFT loop was closed on a video stream that would advance only when oscillation power exceeded a normalized threshold. The total duration of the protocol was two hours in a single day, hence its classification as rapid. Changes in ideational fluency and originality, measured with a divergent thinking task, were compared between participants receiving real video feedback and participants receiving sham feedback. We controlled for individual differences in creative achievement level. Results showed that the protocols were effective at enhancing alpha and beta activities in the targeted area. Differences between the two protocols emerged in their effectiveness at promoting divergent thinking. While no significant changes in originality resulted from the rapid alpha NFT, increases in both originality and fluency emerged as a consequence of the rapid beta NFT. These results were particularly evident in participants starting with a low creative achievement level. Possible interpretations and future directions are proposed and discussed.

Despite this promising potential, BCIs are still scarcely used outside laboratories for practical applications. The main reason preventing EEG-based BCIs from being widely used is arguably their poor usability, which is notably due to their low robustness and reliability. To operate a BCI, the user has to encode commands in his/her EEG signals, typically using mental imagery tasks, such as imagining hand movement or mental calculation. The execution of these tasks leads to specific EEG patterns, which the machine has to decode by using signal processing and machine learning. So far, to address the reliability issue of BCI, most research efforts have been focused on command decoding only. However, if the user is unable to encode commands in her EEG patterns, no signal-processing algorithm would be able to decode them. Therefore, we argue in this chapter that BCI design is not only a decoding challenge (i.e., translating EEG signals into control commands) but also a human-computer interaction challenge, which aims at ensuring the user can control the BCI. Interestingly enough, there are a number of open challenges to take the user into account, for which signal-processing and machine-learning methods could provide solutions. These challenges notably concerns (1) the modeling of the user and (2) understanding and improving how and what the user is learning. More precisely, the BCI community should first work on user modeling, i.e., modeling and updating the user's states and skills overtime from his/her EEG signals, behavior, BCI performances and possibly other sensors. The community should also identify new performance metrics-beyond classification accuracy-that could better describe users' skills at BCI control. Second, the BCI community has to understand how and what the user learns to control the BCI. This includes thoroughly identifying the features to be extracted and the classifier to be used to ensure the user's understanding of the feedback resulting from them, as well as how to present this feedback. Being able to update machine-learning parameters in a specific manner and a precise moment to favor learning without confusing the user with the ever-changeable feedback is another challenge. Finally, it is necessary to gain a clearer understanding of the reasons why mental commands are sometimes correctly decoded and sometimes not; what makes people sometimes fail at BCI control, in order to be able to guide them to do better. Overall, this chapter identifies a number of open and important challenges for the BCI community, at the user level, to which experts in machine learning and signal processing could contribute.

To investigate their potential as electrophysiological markers of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), we recorded beta EEG activity during resting and during an omitted tone task in patients and healthy elderly. Thirty participants were enrolled (15 patients, 15 healthy controls). In particular, we investigated event-related spectral perturbation and intertrial coherence indices. Analyses showed that (a) healthy elderly presented greater beta power at rest than patients with aMCI patients; (b) during the task, healthy elderly were more accurate than aMCI patients and presented greater beta power than aMCI patients; (c) both groups showed qualitatively similar spectral perturbation responses during the task, but different spatiotemporal response patterns; and (d) aMCI patients presented greater beta phase locking than healthy elderly during the task. Results indicate that beta activity in healthy elderly differs from that of patients with aMCI. Furthermore, the analysis of task-related EEG activity extends evidences obtained during resting and suggests that during the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease there is a reduced efficiency in information exchange by large-scale neural networks. The study for the first time shows the potential of task-related beta responses as early markers of aMCI impairments.

According to the callosal relay model, directed information flow from the right to the left auditory cortex has been suggested, but this has not yet been proven. For this purpose, 33 healthy participants were investigated with 64-channel EEG while performing the dichotic listening task in which two different consonant-vowel syllables were presented simultaneously to the left (LE) and right ear (RE). eLORETA source estimation was used to investigate the functional (lagged phase synchronization/LPS) and effective (isolated effective coherence/ICoh) connectivity between right and left primary (PAC) and secondary auditory cortices (SAC) in the gamma-band (30-100 Hz) during right and left ear reports. The major finding was a significantly increased effective connectivity in the gamma-band from the right to the left SAC during conscious perception of LE stimuli. In addition, effective and functional connectivity was significantly enhanced during LE as compared to RE reports. These findings give novel insight into transcallosal information transfer during auditory perception by showing that LE performance requires causal interhemispheric inputs from the right to the left auditory cortices, and that this interaction is mediated by synchronized gamma-band oscillations.

With the use of new technologies that allow multichannel recordings at high sampling rates and the development of computer algorithms that permit the automated analysis of extensive amounts of data, it is now possible to extract high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 80 and 500 Hz from the EEG; HFOs have been further categorised as ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz). Within the context of epileptic disorders, HFOs should reflect the pathological activity of neural networks that sustain seizure generation, and could serve as biomarkers of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. We review here the presumptive cellular mechanisms of ripples and fast ripples in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We also focus on recent findings regarding the occurrence of HFOs during epileptiform activity observed in in vitro models of epileptiform synchronization, in in vivo models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and in epileptic patients. Finally, we address the effects of anti-epileptic drugs on HFOs and raise some questions and issues related to the definition of HFOs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main motivation comes from the observed PW-LFM nature of several real life signals. It is essential that the characteristics of these types of signals be taken into account for the design of high resolution Time-Frequency Distributions (TFDs) and therefore to improve the application and interpretation of time-frequency signal analysis and processing. In this paper the ambiguity function (AF) of a general PW LFM signal is derived exactly and then analyzed to deduce important properties. The precise location and behavior of both auto-terms and cross-terms of a general piecewise LFM signal can be deduced from its AF. Numerical simulations using different types of test signals confirm the analytical derivations. An extension of the PW-LFM test signal is also presented by using HFM signals. For such signals, the exact analytical expression of auto-terms is given as well as the expression of cross-terms between HFM and LFM. The results obtained can be used in future studies to design more advanced quadratic time-frequency distributions (QTFDs) that exhibit improved properties in terms of resolution and accuracy.

Generalized Cross-Frequency Decomposition: A Method for the Extraction of Neuronal Components Coupled at Different Frequencies	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						cross-frequency coupling; EEG & MEG; phase-to-phase coupling; brain oscillations; source localization	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG-DATA; COHERENCE; ALPHA; THETA; COMMUNICATION; AMPLITUDE; RHYTHMS	Perceptual, motor and cognitive processes are based on rich interactions between remote regions in the human brain. Such interactions can be carried out through phase synchronization of oscillatory signals. Neuronal synchronization has been primarily studied within the same frequency range, e.g., within alpha or beta frequency bands. Yet, recent research shows that neuronal populations can also demonstrate phase synchronization between different frequency ranges. An extraction of such cross-frequency interactions in EEG/MEG recordings remains, however, methodologically challenging. Here we present a new method for the robust extraction of cross-frequency phase-to-phase synchronized components. Generalized Cross-Frequency Decomposition (GCFD) reconstructs the time courses of synchronized neuronal components, their spatial filters and patterns. Our method extends the previous state of the art, Cross-Frequency Decomposition (CFD), to the whole range of frequencies: it works for any f(1) and f(2) whenever f(1) : f(2) is a rational number. GCFD gives a compact description of non-linearly interacting neuronal sources on the basis of their cross-frequency phase coupling. We successfully validated the new method in simulations and tested it with real EEG recordings including resting state data and steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP).

Assessing an infant's brain development remains a challenge for neuroscientists and pediatricians despite great technological advances. As a non-invasive neuroimaging tool, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has great advantages in monitoring an infant's brain activity. To explore the dynamic features of hemodynamic changes in infants, in-pattern exponent (IPE), anti-pattern exponent (APE), as well as permutation cross-mutual information (PCMI) based on symbolic dynamics are proposed to measure the phase differences and coupling strength in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) signals from fNIRS. Approach. First, simulated sinusoidal oscillation signals and four coupled nonlinear systems were employed for performance assessments. Hilbert transform based measurements of hemoglobin phase oxygenation and deoxygenation (hPod) and phase-locking index of hPod (hPodL) were calculated for comparison. Then, the IPE, APE and PCMI indices from resting state fNIRS data of preterm, term infants and adults were calculated to estimate the phase difference and coupling of HbO and Hb. All indices' performance was assessed by the degree of monotonicity (DoM). The box plots and coefficients of variation (CV) were employed to assess the measurements and robustness in the results. Main results. In the simulation analysis, IPE and APE can distinguish the phase difference of two sinusoidal oscillation signals. Both hPodL and PCMI can track the strength of two coupled nonlinear systems. Compared to hPodL, the PCMI had higher DoM indices in measuring the coupling of two nonlinear systems. In the fNIRS data analysis, similar to hPod, the IPE and APE can distinguish preterm, term infants, and adults in 0.01-0.05 Hz, 0.05-0.1 Hz, and 0.01-0.1 Hz frequency bands, respectively. PCMI more effectively distinguished the term and preterm infants than hPodL in the 0.05-0.1 Hz frequency band. As symbolic time series measures, the IPE and APE were able to detect the brain developmental changes in subjects of different ages. PCMI can assess the resting-state HbO and Hb coupling changes across different developmental ages, which may reflect the metabolic and neurovascular development. Significance. The symbolic-based methodologies are promising measures for fNIRS in estimating the brain development, especially in assessing newborns' brain developmental status.

Whereas optimal cognitive agers show highly preserved cognitive functions throughout life, other subjects experience cognitive deficits in various cognitive domains. Among them, elderly individuals frequently report difficulties in spatial navigation. In this study, we aimed to determine whether elderly participants with different cognitive profiles would perform differently at a navigation task, and explore underlying medial hippocampal activity. Method: Two groups of elderly subjects were selected, high- and low-performing (HP and LP, respectively), based on their performance on a detailed neuropsychological examination. A group of young adults was recruited as controls. Cerebral activity was recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during a virtual navigation task in which participants had 3 trials to find their way in mazes. We analyzed theta activity during navigation in the mazes and performed source reconstruction analyses. Results: The LP group was less accurate than the HP group during the navigation task. Theta activity during navigation was greater in HP subjects compared with controls, whereas that theta activity was reduced in LP subjects. Moreover, theta activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus increased across trials in HP, but not in LP, subjects. Conclusion: Elderly participants performed differently at a navigation task according to their cognitive profile: elderly with cognitive deficits seem to have greater difficulties in spatial navigation than HP elderly. Navigational difficulties in elderly with cognitive deficits might be related to functional alteration of the parahippocampal gyrus.

In this paper, the Trail Making Test-B (TMT-B) task was used to evaluate the cool executive function of first-episode SZ patients and electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from 14 first-episode SZ patients and 14 healthy controls during this cool executive function task. Brain functional connectivity between all pairs of EEG channels was constructed based on mutual information (MI) analysis. The constructed brain functional networks were filtered by three thresholding schemes: absolute threshold, mean degree, and a novel data-driven scheme based on orthogonal minimal spanning trees (OMST), and graph theory was then used to study the topographical characteristics of the filtered brain graphs. Results indicated that the graph theoretical measures of the theta band showed obvious difference between SZ patients and healthy controls. In the theta band, the characteristic path length was significantly longer and the cluster coefficient was significantly smaller in the SZ patients for a wide range of absolute threshold T. However, the cluster coefficient showed no significant changes, and the characteristic path length was still significantly longer in SZ patients when calculated as a function of mean degree K. Interestingly, we also found that only the characteristic path length was significantly longer in SZ patients compared with healthy controls after using the OMST scheme. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the characteristic path length was positively correlated with executive time of TMT-B for the combined SZ patients and healthy controls (r = 0.507, P = 0.006), but not for SZ patients alone (r = 0.072, P = 0.612). The above results suggested a less optimal organization of the brain network and could be useful for understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying cool executive dysfunction in first-episode SZ patients.

We therefore sought to determine the in vivo effects of NPY on neuronal firing in the cortico-thalamo-cortical network activity, known to play a critical role in the generation of SWDs in these rats. MethodsNPY was administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) or in separate experiments locally on the neurons of caudal thalamic reticular nucleus (NRT) by use of juxtacellular iontophoresis in triple-barrel electrodes in male GAERS aged 12-15 weeks, in vivo under neuroleptic anesthesia. Drug infusions and electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring were performed simultaneously with juxtacellular single neuronal recordings. Effect of NPY on electrically induced SWD induction threshold were also measured. ResultsNPY administration ICV led to a decrease in the total length of SWDs in EEG recordings. Both ICV administration and iontophoresis of NPY on NRT neurons led to an increase in interictal neuronal firing of NRT neurons. During ictal periods, ICV NPY administration reduced the number of thalamic action potentials per SWDs, as well as reduced waveform correlations between field potentials within the NRT and the cortical EEG. NPY administration ICV did not significantly alter the firing patterns of relay thalamic neurons interictally and cortical neurons during ictal and interictal periods. In addition, SWD induction threshold in the S2 region of the cortex was significantly increased after NPY administration. SignificanceOur results show alterations in cortico-thalamo-cortical local and network properties following ICV administration of NPY, suggesting mechanisms of SWD suppression in GAERS. Cellular and network alteration of NRT activity, resulting from a direct action of NPY, may be a contributor to this effect.

We start by considering the problem of estimating ERP ensemble averages in the time domain. An estimator allowing for weights and time shifts for each trial is discussed. Then we consider spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal multivariate filters for improving the estimation, including principal component analysis, the common spatial pattern and blind source separation. Then, we review time-frequency analysis methods. The reader is provided with definitions in order to understand the most commonly used linear and non-linear measures used in the time-frequency domain. We continue with a brief discussion on the importance of the analysis in the spatial domain, including topographic maps and tomographies. Next, we review procedures for applying inferential statistics to ERP studies. Emphasis is given to procedures based on permutation tests, which account for the multiple comparison problem and adapt to the form and degree of correlation between hypotheses. Finally, we consider the problem of classifying ERP single-trials, pointing to recent literature covering the most promisingmethods currently available, namely, Riemannian geometry, random forests and neural networks.

Closed-Loop Slow-Wave tACS Improves Sleep-Dependent Long-Term Memory Generalization by Modulating Endogenous Oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consolidation; EEG; long-term memory; sleep; tACS	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; DYNAMICS; SPINDLES; TOOLBOX	Benefits in long-term memory retention and generalization have been shown to be related to sleep-dependent processes, which correlate with neural oscillations as measured by changes in electric potential. The specificity and causal role of these oscillations, however, are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the potential for augmenting endogenous slow-wave (SW) oscillations in humans with closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with an aim toward enhancing the consolidation of recent experiences into long-term memory. Sixteen (three female) participants were trained presleep on a target detection task identifying targets hidden in complex visual scenes. During post-training sleep, closed-loop SW detection and stimulation were used to deliver tACS matching the phase and frequency of the dominant oscillation in the range of 0.5- 1.2 Hz. Changes in performance were assessed the following day using test images that were identical to the training ("repeated"), and images generated from training scenes but with novel viewpoints ("generalized"). Results showed that active SW tACS during sleep enhanced the postsleep versus presleep target detection accuracy for the generalized images compared with sham nights, while no significant change was found for repeated images. Using a frequency-agnostic clustering approach sensitive to stimulation-induced spectral power changes in scalp EEG, this behavioral enhancement significantly correlated with both a poststimulation increase and a subsequent decrease in measured spectral power within the SW band, which in turn showed increased coupling with spindle amplitude. These results suggest that augmenting endogenous SW oscillations can enhance consolidation by specifically improving generalization over recognition or cued recall.

The purpose of this study is to optimize focused attention in expert rifle shooters with the use of NFT tools and to enhance shooting performance. We designed and implemented an experiment, conducted NFT sessions, and confirmed that NFT can boost performance of the shooters. The efficiency of the NFT was examined by comparing the shooters' performance, their results of standardized tests of general cognitive abilities on the Vienna Test System (VTS), and the brain patterns in before and after NFT sessions. According to the results, we confirmed that NFT can be used to boost the shooters' performance. EEG data were recorded during the shooting tasks. We extracted different types of EEG-based indexes and identified the emotion and mental workload levels of the shooters right before they pulled the trigger. These indexes and emotion/workload levels were then correlated with the shooting scores to understand what are the optimal brain states for "good" shots. According to the results, we confirmed that (1) mental workload level is negatively correlated with the shooting performance; (2) the correlations analyses results between EEG-based power features and shooting performance are consistent with the literature review results; (3) the difference of brain states in the before and after NFT shooting session could be because of NFT.

Priority Switches in Visual Working Memory are Supported by Frontal Delta and Posterior Alpha Interactions	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cognitive control; cross-frequency-coupling; EEG; neural oscillations; visual attention	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; SEARCH; THETA; INFORMATION	Visual working memory (VWM) distinguishes between representations relevant for imminent versus future perceptual goals. We investigated how the brain sequentially prioritizes visual working memory representations that serve consecutive tasks. Observers remembered two targets for a sequence of two visual search tasks, thus making one target currently relevant, and the other prospectively relevant. We show that during the retention interval prior to the first search, lateralized parieto-occipital EEG alpha (8-14 Hz) suppression is stronger for current compared with prospective search targets. Crucially, between the first and second search task, this difference in posterior alpha lateralization reverses, reflecting the change in priority states of the two target representations. Connectivity analyses indicate that this switch in posterior alpha lateralization is driven by frontal delta/low-theta (2-6 Hz) activity. Moreover, this frontal low-frequency signal also predicts task performance after the switch. We thus obtained evidence for large-scale network interactions underlying the flexible shifting between the priority states of multiple memory representations in VWM.	[de Vries, Ingmar E.

Methods: We analyzed 64-channel scalp EEG in 12 isolated dystonia patients treated with chronic DBS (7 generalized, 5 cervical/segmental; 7 globus pallidus (GP), 5 subthalamic nucleus (STN)), and 20 healthy age-matched controls. Recordings during rest and movement task, and clinical motor scores, were collected with DBS-on and during a 90-min DBS washout. Results: Resting state alpha power in the dominant (or contralateral to more dystonic side) motor cortex channel during DBS was comparable to healthy controls, but it increased when DBS was stopped. Resting state and movement-related alpha coherence between bilateral motor cortex channels was increased off DBS. Conclusions: Chronic DBS reduces exaggerated alpha oscillations and interhemispheric alpha coherence in the motor cortex of patients with isolated dystonia.

To demonstrate the importance of averaging in timefrequency space and the added localizing value in time and space in a case of cortical myoclonus. Methods. One hundred myoclonic jerks were averaged in time series and in spectral domain. For the latter, we chose 100 (10-second) segments from interictal background and used the unpaired t-test for the jerk-related and control spectral data to obtain the t value and corresponding p value at each pixel. We corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate procedure. We generated maps of spectral significance per electrode. All insignificant t-values were converted to 0 for easier visual analysis. Results. Standard back-averaging of 100 jerks disclosed a single spike preceding EMG activity by 19-27 milliseconds. No other definite ictal patterns were discernible in the time domain. Statistical analysis of the same 100 epochs in the time-frequency domain disclosed a greater temporal extent of the seizure, aswell as a more detailed rendering of rhythms and frequencies involved. Valproate was added and led to substantial improvement. Conclusions. Averaging in the spectral domain may reveal frequencyspecific changes that may not be otherwise appreciated in the time domain. Future studies may elucidate the effect on the sensitivity of diagnosis of simple partial seizures and auras.

Small sharp spikes as EEG markers of mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Small sharp spikes; SSS; Benign epileptiform transients of sleep; BETS; Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy	EUROPEAN COHORT; RECORDINGS; MORBIDITY	Objective: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy, but often lacks scalp EEG correlates. We ask if hippocampal epileptiform discharges that are characteristic of mTLE are associated with small sharp spikes (SSS) recorded on scalp EEG. SSS are considered benign waveforms, so are not currently used as markers of epilepsy. Methods: To determine if there is a relationship between SSS and hippocampal discharges, simultaneous scalp and hippocampal depth electrode EEGs were recorded from 27 patients being evaluated for possible mTLE. Scalp EEG waveforms were assessed at the time of hippocampal discharges identified on intracranial hippocampal depth electrodes. Results: 15 of 27 patients had SSS on scalp EEG that were time locked to hippocampal epileptiform discharges measured intracranially. These hippocampal spikes tended to have overlying high frequency oscillations and to co-localize with a seizure onset zone, suggesting that they were pathological discharges. Conclusions: There is a tight coupling between a subset of pathological hippocampal discharges and SSS. Significance: SSS can be scalp EEG markers of mTLE rather than normal EEG variants.

Analysis of the Emotional-Cognitive Processes using a Modified Multisource Interference Task and Recording of EEG and Behavioral Responses	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related potentials (ERPs); sensorimotor reaction; modified multisource interference task (mMSIT); emotional facial images	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; AROUSAL; FACES; REPETITION; ERP	We investigated changes in the EEG signals and the latency of behavioral responses in the cognitive test with interfering emotional stimuli. It was hypothesized that the cognitive process would be not only influenced by emotional factors but would also result in different patterns by emotional types (e.g., annoyance, happiness, neutrality, etc.) We developed a new method, the modified multisource interference task (mMSIT), to test our hypotheses. The EEG signals and behavioral responses were collected. Participants were required to press a button after stimulation; simultaneously, four-channel EEGs (F3, F4, Cz, and Pz) were recorded from 21 healthy participants. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency EEG spectrograms were analyzed. Behavioral patterns were quantified by measuring the reaction times and error rates for button pressing. The P2 amplitudes at presentation of images of annoyed faces were found to be significantly lower than those for neutral and happy interference faces. The spectral powers of the range in F4 and Pz were also significantly smaller in annoyed interference compared to others. Additionally, the latency of behavioral responses for annoyed faces was significantly longer compared to that for happy faces. However, an error rate increase for annoyed faces was not observed. These results show that electrophysiological responses and behavioral reactions are significantly affected at visual perception of annoyed faces. Our findings demonstrate that negative emotional interference can increase the load of cognitive processing as a distractor, and our results show that the mMSIT is a useful task in studies of normal human cognition and emotions.

Resting-State Alpha-Band Oscillations in Migraine	PERCEPTION			English	Article						lower alpha band; EEG; spectral analysis; contrast discrimination	PROCESSING DEFICITS; ANTICIPATORY ATTENTION; VISUAL NOISE; GLOBAL FORM; EEG; MOTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; DISCRIMINATION; PERCEPTION; FLICKER	Migraine groups show differences in motion perception compared with controls, when tested in between migraine attacks (interictally). This is thought to be due to an increased susceptibility to stimulus degradation (multiplicative internal noise). Fluctuations in alpha-band oscillations are thought to regulate visual perception, and so differences could provide a mechanism for the increased multiplicative noise seen in migraine. The aim of this article was to characterise resting-state alpha-band oscillations (between 8 and 12Hz) in the visual areas of the brain in migraine and control groups. Alpha-band activity in the resting state (with eyes closed) was recorded before and after a visual psychophysics task to estimate equivalent noise, specifically a contrast detection task. The lower alpha-band (8 to 10Hz) resting-state alpha-band power was increased in the migraine compared with the control group, which may provide a mechanism for increased multiplicative noise. In agreement with previous research, there were no differences found in the additive (baseline) internal noise, estimated using an equivalent noise task in the same observers. As fluctuations in alpha-band oscillations control the timing of perceptual processing, increased lower alpha-band (8 to 10Hz) power could explain the behavioural differences in migraine compared with control groups, particularly on tasks relying on temporal integration.

Touching lips and hearing fingers: effector-specific congruency between tactile and auditory stimulation modulates N1 amplitude and alpha desynchronization	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Touch; Speech; Audition; Multisensory integration; ERP; Alpha oscillations	MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; ARTICULATORY FEATURES; SPEECH SOUNDS; BRAIN-REGIONS; BAND ACTIVITY; HUMAN SI; PERCEPTION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION	Understanding the interactions between audition and sensorimotor processes is of theoretical importance, particularly in relation to speech processing. Although one current focus in this area is on interactions between auditory perception and the motor system, there has been less research on connections between the auditory and somatosensory modalities. The current study takes a novel approach to this omission by examining specific auditory-tactile interactions in the context of speech and non-speech sound production. Electroencephalography was used to examine brain responses when participants were presented with speech syllables (a bilabial sound /pa/ and a non-labial sound /ka/) or finger-snapping sounds that were simultaneously paired with tactile stimulation of either the lower lip or the right middle finger. Analyses focused on the sensory-evoked N1 in the event-related potential and the extent of alpha band desynchronization elicited by the stimuli. N1 amplitude over fronto-central sites was significantly enhanced when the bilabial /pa/ sound was paired with tactile lip stimulation and when the finger-snapping sound was paired with tactile stimulation of the finger. Post-stimulus alpha desynchronization at central sites was also enhanced when the /pa/ sound was accompanied by tactile stimulation of the lip. These novel findings indicate that neural aspects of somatosensory-auditory interactions are influenced by the congruency between the location of the bodily touch and the bodily origin of a perceived sound.

Conventional connectivity analysis is usually conducted at the scalp-level and in an unsupervised manner. However, due to the volume conduction effect, EEG data suffer from lowsignal-to-noise ratio and poor spatial resolution. Thus, it is hard to effectively identify the task-related connectivity pattern at the scalp-level using unsupervised method. There exist extensive discriminative spatial filtering methods for different BCI paradigms. However, in conventional spatial filter optimization methods, signal correlations or connectivities are not taken into consideration in the objective functions. To address the issue, in this work, we propose a discriminative connectivity pattern-learning method. In the proposed framework, EEG correlations are used as the features, with which Fisher's ratio objective function is adopted to optimize spatial filters. The proposed method is evaluated with a binary motor imagery EEG dataset. Experimental results show that more connectivity information are maintained with the proposed method, and classification accuracies yielded by the proposed method are comparable to conventional discriminative spatial filtering method.

This study aimed to determine a suitable epoch length for nonlinear analysis of EEG data based on its recurrence rate in EEG alpha activity (electrodes Fz, Oz, and Pz) from 28 healthy and 64 major depressive disorder subjects. Two nonlinear metrics, Lempel-Ziv complexity and scaling index, were applied in sliding windows of 20 seconds shifted every 1 second and in nonoverlapping windows of 1 minute. In addition, linear spectral analysis was carried out for comparison with the nonlinear results. The analysis with sliding windows showed that the cortical dynamics underlying alpha activity had a recurrence period of around 40 seconds in both groups. In the analysis with nonoverlapping windows, long-term nonstationarities entailed changes over time in the nonlinear dynamics that became significantly different between epochs across time, which was not detected with the linear spectral analysis. Findings suggest that epoch lengths shorter than 40 seconds neglect information in EEG nonlinear studies. In turn, linear analysis did not detect characteristics from long-term nonstationarities in EEG alpha waves of control subjects and patients with major depressive disorder patients. We recommend that application of nonlinear metrics in EEG time series, particularly of alpha activity, should be carried out with epochs around 60 seconds. In addition, this study aimed to demonstrate that long-term nonlinearities are inherent to the cortical brain dynamics regardless of the presence or absence of a mental disorder.

In mice, theta (5-10 Hz) stands as one of the most studied slow rhythms. However, mice often breathe at theta frequency, and we recently reported that nasal respiration leads to local field potential (LFP) oscillations that are independent of theta. Namely, we showed respiration-coupled oscillations in the hippocampus, prelimbic cortex, and parietal cortex, suggesting that respiration could impose a global brain rhythm. Here we extend these findings by analyzing LFPs from 15 brain regions recorded simultaneously with respiration during exploration and REM sleep. We find that respiration-coupled oscillations can be detected in parallel with theta in several neocortical regions, from prefrontal to visual areas, and also in subcortical structures such as the thalamus, amygdala and ventral hippocampus. They might have escaped attention in previous studies due to the absence of respiration monitoring, the similarity with theta oscillations, and the highly variable peak frequency. We hypothesize that respiration-coupled oscillations constitute a global brain rhythm suited to entrain distributed networks into a common regime. However, whether their widespread presence reflects local network activity or is due to volume conduction remains to be determined.	[Tort, Adriano B.

The aim of this study was to assess the topography of EEG power and the activation of brain structures during slow wave sleep under normal conditions and after sleep deprivation. Sleep EEG recordings during baseline and recovery sleep after 40 h of sustained wakefulness were analyzed (eight healthy young men, 27 channel EEG). Power maps were computed for the first non-REM sleep episode (where sleep pressure is highest) in baseline and recovery sleep, at frequencies between 0.5 and 2 Hz. Power maps had a frontal predominance at all frequencies between 0.5 and 2 Hz. An additional occipital focus of activity was observed below 1 Hz. Power maps <= 1 Hz were not affected by sleep deprivation, whereas an increase in power was observed in the maps >= 1.25 Hz. Based on the response to sleep deprivation, low-delta (0.5-1 Hz) and mid-delta activity (1.25-2 Hz) were dissociated. Electrical sources within the cortex of low- and mid-delta activity were estimated using eLORETA. Source localization revealed a predominantly frontal distribution of activity for low-delta and mid-delta activity. Sleep deprivation resulted in an increase in source strength only for mid-delta activity, mainly in parietal and frontal regions. Low-delta activity dominated in occipital and temporal regions and mid-delta activity in limbic and frontal regions independent of the level of sleep pressure. Both, power maps and electrical sources exhibited trait-like aspects.

Recent work has suggested a supramodal role for beta oscillations in measuring temporal intervals. However, the precise function of beta oscillations and whether their manipulation alters timing has yet to be determined. To accomplish this, we first re-analyzed two, separate EEG datasets and demonstrate that beta oscillations are associated with the retention and comparison of a memory standard for duration. We next conducted a study of 20 human participants using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), over frontocentral cortex, at alpha and beta frequencies, during a visual temporal bisection task, finding that beta stimulation exclusively shifts the perception of time such that stimuli are reported as longer in duration. Finally, we decomposed trialwise choice data with a drift diffusion model of timing, revealing that the shift in timing is caused by a change in the starting point of accumulation, rather than the drift rate or threshold. Our results provide evidence for the intrinsic involvement of beta oscillations in the perception of time, and point to a specific role for beta oscillations in the encoding and retention of memory for temporal intervals.

Differential between normal aging at early stages can be really challenging; available biomarkers need to be combined and can be quite invasive and expensive. Objective: The aim of this pilot study is to examine possible EEG alterations in MCI and SCI compared to controls, analyzing if a cognitive task could highlight early AD hallmarks. Method: We recruited 11 MCI, 8 SCI and 7 healthy subjects as controls (CS), all matched for age and education. Neuropsychological assessment and EEG recording, at resting state and during a mental memory task, were performed. Classical spectral measures and nonlinear parameters were used to characterize EEGs. Results: During cognitive task, alpha-band power reduction was found predominantly in frontal regions in SCI and CS, diffused to all regions in MCI; moreover, decreased EEG complexity was found in SCI compared to controls. The alpha-band power attenuation restricted to frontal regions in SCI during a free recall task (involving frontal areas), suggests that MCI patients compensate for encoding deficit by activating different brain networks to perform the same task. Furthermore, EEG complexity reduction - that has been found already in SCI - could be a possible early hallmark of AD. Conclusion: This study draws attention on the importance of nonlinear approach in EEG analysis and the potential role of cognitive task in highlighting EEG alterations at very early stages of cognitive impairment; EEG could therefore have a practical impact on dementia diagnosis.

This attention orientation is needed to make sure that information is encoded for later remembering. Here we designed an episodic long-term memory (LTM) EEG experiment where we examined brain oscillatory activity associated with attention allocation towards the temporal link between an item and its context. The remembering of this temporal conjunction is crucial for item-context binding and hence for the formation of episodic memories. Participants saw a background picture and a word in a central position on a computer screen and were instructed to memorise (a) the picture only, (b) the word, (c) both individually (i.e. ignoring their co-occurrence) and (d) both with them being presented together. Attention allocation towards item-context binding was associated with oscillatory alpha desynchronization in the upper alpha band (10-13 Hz) over dominantly left posterior brain areas. The results highlight the role of alpha desynchronization in voluntary attention allocation towards the temporal conjunction of item and its context in episodic binding and the involvement of posterior brain areas. The pattern of results suggest that they most likely reflect additional visual processes recruited by attentional mechanisms and do not tap into neural processes of item-context binding per se. Moreover, it indicates that the involvement of alpha oscillations in cognitive processes may be more complex.

However, most of the networks, even the event-related ones, are highly heterogeneous due to spurious interactions, which bring challenges to revealing the change patterns of interactive information in the complex dynamic process. In this paper, we propose a network entropy (NE) method to measure connectivity uncertainty of FCGB sequences to alleviate the spurious interaction problem in dynamic network analysis to realize associations with different events during a complex cognitive task. The proposed dynamic analysis approach calculated the adjacency matrices from ongoing electroencephalpgram (EEG) in a sliding time-window to form the FCGB sequences. The probability distribution of Shannon entropy was replaced by the connection sequence distribution to measure the uncertainty of FCGB constituting NE. Without averaging, we used time frequency transform of the NE of FCGB sequences to analyze the event-related changes in oscillatory activity in the single-trial traces during the complex cognitive process of driving. Finally, the results of a verification experiment showed that the NE of the FCGB sequences has a certain time-locked performance for different events related to driver fatigue in a prolonged driving task. The time errors between the extracted time of high-power NE and the recorded time of event occurrence were distributed within the range [-30 s, 30 s] and 90.1% of the time errors were distributed within the range [-10 s, 10 s]. The high correlation (r = 0.99997, p < 0.001) between the timing characteristics of the two types of signals indicates that the NE can reflect the actual dynamic interaction states of brain. Thus, the method may have potential implications for cognitive studies and for the detection of physiological states.

However, it remains unknown whether this age difference is reflected on the central level, i.e., in electrophysiological correlates such as EEG task-related power (TRPow) in alpha (8-13 Hz) or beta band (13-30 Hz). Furthermore, we were interested in the association between age and alpha/beta power at rest as a potential determinant for TRPow changes. Twenty-five YA (19-29 years) and 45 OA (67-83 years) performed a force modulation (FM) task requiring to match a sinusoidal target force by exerting an isometric force with thumb and index finger. EEG was measured at rest and during FM task. YA outperformed OA in the FM task. For alpha, OA demonstrated less frontal power at rest than YA. For beta, OA revealed more power than YA in frontal, central, and parietal areas at rest. TRPow results depended on whether analyses were controlled for power at rest. When analyses were controlled, OA showed higher TRPow decreases than YA in beta in parietal and occipital areas during FM performance. TRPow decreases for beta were stronger in the contralateral than in the ipsilateral frontal hemisphere in OA than in YA. Decreases in TRPow indicate increased cortical activity to accomplish the FM task. Our findings suggest higher parietal and occipital processing demands while performing the FM task in OA than in YA. This study further confirmed the importance of controlling for EEG power at rest when investigating TRPow during motor performance to account for interindividual variability.

Here, we tested in mice the wake-promoting properties of NLS-4 and its effects on the following sleep as compared with those of modafinil and vehicle. C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle, NLS-4 (64 mg/kg), or modafinil (150 mg/kg) at light onset. EEG and EMG were recorded continuously for 24 h after injections and vigilance states as well as EEG power densities were analyzed. NLS-4 at 64 mg/kg induced significantly longer wakefulness duration than modafinil at 150 mg/kg. Although no significant sleep rebound was observed after sleep onset for both treatments as compared with their vehicles, modafinil-treated mice showed significantly more NREM sleep when compared to NLS-4. Spectral analysis of the NREM EEG after NLS-4 treatment indicated an increased power density in delta activity (0.75-3.5 Hz) and a decreased power in theta frequency range (6.25-7.25 Hz), while there was no differences after modafinil treatment. Also, time course analysis of the delta activity showed a significant increase only during the first 2 time intervals of sleep after NLS-4 treatment, while delta power was increased during the first 9 time intervals after modafinil. Our results indicate that NLS-4 is a highly potent wake-promoting drug with no sign of hypersomnia rebound. As opposed to modafinil, recovery sleep after NLS-4 treatment is characterized by less NREM amount and delta activity, suggesting a lower need for recovery despite longer drug-induced wakefulness.

To explore the abnormal mechanisms how the brain controls shoulder abduction and elbow flexion in "flexion synergy" following stroke, we used the functional corticomuscular coupling (FCMC) between the brain and the muscles as a tool to identify the temporal evolution of corticomuscular interaction between the synkinetic and separate phases. 59-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) over brain scalp and 2-channel electromyogram (EMG) from biceps brachii (BB)/deltoid (DT) were recorded in sixteen stroke patients with motor dysfunction and eight healthy controls during a task of uplifting the arm (stage 1) and maintaining up to the chest (stage 2). As a result, compared to healthy controls, stroke patients had abnormally reduced coherence in EEG-BB combination and increased coherence in EEG-DT combination. Compared to synkinetic stroke patients, separate ones exhibited higher coupling at gamma-band during stage 1 and higher at beta-band during stage 2 in EEG-BB combination, but lower at beta-band during stage 2 in EEG-DT combination. Therefore, we infer that the disorders of efferent control and afferent proprioception in sensorimotor system for stroke patients effect on the oscillation at beta and gamma bands. Patients need integrate more information for shoulder abduction to compensate for the functional loss of elbow flexion in the recovery process, so that partial cortical cortex controlling on the elbow flexion may work on the shoulder abduction during "flexion synergy". Such researches could provide new perspective on the temporal evolution of corticomuscular interaction after stroke and add to our understanding of possible pathomechanisms how the brain abnormally controls shoulder abduction and elbow flexion in "flexion synergy".

Since the mechanisms underlying epileptic disorders should affect such interactions, abnormal level of cross-frequency coupling is expected to provide a signal marker of epileptogenesis. We measured phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a form of cross-frequency coupling between neural oscillations, in a rodent model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 4, 250-300 g) were injected with pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, i.p) to induce a status epilepticus (SE) that was stopped after 1 h with diazepam (5 mg/kg, s.c.) and ketamine (50 mg/kg, s.c.). Control animals (n = 6) did not receive any injection or treatment. Three days after SE, all animals were implanted with bipolar electrodes in the hippocampal CA3 subfield, entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus and subiculum. Continuous video/EEG recordings were performed 24/7 at a sampling rate of 2 kHz, over 15 consecutive days. Pilocarpine-treated animals showed interictal spikes (5.25 (+/- 2.5) per minute) and seizures (n = 32) that appeared 7 (+/- 0.8) days after SE. We found that CA3 was the seizure onset zone in most epileptic animals, with stronger ongoing PAC coupling between seizures than in controls (Kruskal-Wallis test: chi(2) (1,36) = 46.3, Bonferroni corrected, p < 0.001). Strong PAC in CA3 occurred between the phase of slow-wave oscillations (< 1 Hz) and the amplitude of faster rhythms (50-180 Hz), with the strongest bouts of high-frequency activity occurring preferentially on the ascending phase of the slow wave. We also identified that cross-frequency coupling in CA3 (rho = 0.44, p < 0.001) and subiculum (rho = 0.41, p < 0.001) was positively correlated with the daily number of seizures. Overall, our study demonstrates that cross-frequency coupling may represent a signal marker in epilepsy and suggests that this methodology could be transferred to clinical scalp MEG and EEG recordings.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cross-frequency coupling; high-density EEG; mindfulness and compassion-and-loving-kindness meditation; NREM sleep; plasticity; resting wakefulness	PSYCHOMETRIC EVALUATION; MINDFULNESS MEDITATION; PERMUTATION TESTS; LOCAL SLEEP; SLOW WAVES; EEG; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION	Our recent finding of a meditation-related increase in low-frequency NREM sleep EEG oscillatory activities peaking in the theta-alpha range (4-12 Hz) was not predicted. From a consolidated body of research on sleep homeostasis, we would expect a change peaking in slow wave activity (1-4 Hz) following an intense meditation session. Here we compared these changes in sleep with the post-meditation changes in waking rest scalp power to further characterize their functional significance. High-density EEG recordings were acquired from 27 long-term meditators (LTM) on three separate days at baseline and following two 8-hr sessions of either mindfulness or compassion-and-loving-kindness meditation. Thirty-one meditation-naive participants (MNP) were recorded at the same time points. As a common effect of meditation practice, we found increases in low and fast waking EEG oscillations for LTM only, peaking at eight and 15 Hz respectively, over prefrontal, and left centro-parietal electrodes. Paralleling our previous findings in sleep, there was no significant difference between meditation styles in LTM as well as no difference between matched sessions in MNP. Meditation-related changes in wakefulness and NREM sleep were correlated across space and frequency. A significant correlation was found in the EEG low frequencies (<12 Hz). Since the peak of coupling was observed in the theta-alpha oscillatory range, sleep homeostatic response to meditation practice is not sufficient to explain our findings. Another likely phenomenon into play is a reverberation of meditation-related processes during subsequent sleep. Future studies should ascertain the interplay between these processes in promoting the beneficial effects of meditation practice.

Ultra-slow mechanical stimulation of olfactory epithelium modulates consciousness by slowing cerebral rhythms in humans	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; AUTONOMIC NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; DECISION-MAKING; DEFAULT MODE; TIME-SERIES; BRAIN; EEG	The coupling between respiration and neural activity within olfactory areas and hippocampus has recently been unambiguously demonstrated, its neurophysiological basis sustained by the well-assessed mechanical sensitivity of the olfactory epithelium. We herein hypothesize that this coupling reverberates to the whole brain, possibly modulating the subject's behavior and state of consciousness. The olfactory epithelium of 12 healthy subjects was stimulated with periodical odorless air-delivery (frequency 0.05 Hz, 8 s on, 12 off). Cortical electrical activity (High Density-EEG) and perceived state of consciousness have been studied. The stimulation induced i) an enhancement of delta-theta EEG activity over the whole cortex mainly involving the Limbic System and Default Mode Network structures, ii) a reversal of the overall information flow directionality from wake-like postero-anterior to NREM sleep-like antero-posterior, iii) the perception of having experienced an Altered State of Consciousness. These findings could shed further light via a neurophenomenological approach on the links between respiration, cerebral activity and subjective experience, suggesting a plausible neurophysiological basis for interpreting altered states of consciousness induced by respiration-based meditative practices.

Attention improves memory by suppressing spiking-neuron activity in the human anterior temporal lobe	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; RETRIEVAL; POWER	We identify a memory-specific attention mechanism in the human anterior temporal lobe, an area implicated in semantic processing and episodic memory formation. Spiking neuron activity is suppressed and becomes more reliable in preparation for verbal memory formation. Intracranial electroencephalography signals implicate this region as a source of executive control for attentional selection. Consistent with this interpretation, its surgical removal causes significant memory impairment for attended words relative to unattended words.

We employed an EEG data set from a previous study, which was recorded from 34 healthy participants during a memory retrieval process. The data set consists of EEG collected during two tasks, a learning task, in which participants studied animated learning material, and a memory recall task, in which they recalled the learned information. We analyzed both EEG signals and behavioral responses. We conducted spectral analyses for the absolute power and relative power of EEG frequency bands, EEG coherence, absolute phase delay, and EEG amplitude asymmetry features. The delta-band EEG and theta-band absolute power were negatively correlated with task performance at frontal regions, while the alpha-band activity was positively correlated in frontal regions and negatively correlated in parietal and temporal sites. High-beta in the frontal lobe was positively correlated with memory recall score. EEG coherence was negatively correlated in the delta band at the fronto-parietal and fronto-central sites, and positively correlated in the gamma band at widespread regions, including all lobes. EEG phase delay showed the highest degree of connectivity in the delta and alpha bands at frontal sites, and was negatively correlated with memory recall score. The negative correlation in phase delay demonstrated the synchronization and positive correlation reflected the de-synchronization of electrode pairs during memory recollection in the delta and alpha frequencies. We concluded that neuronal networks producing low EEG frequencies at frontal regions and those producing high frequencies in widespread regions are active during the memory recollection process. Thus, semantic memory storage involves widespread neuronal networks across the brain.

Clinical signs and electroencephalographic patterns of emergence from sevoflurane anaesthesia in children: An observational study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; INFANTS; HALOTHANE; INDUCTION; PROPOFOL; CONSCIOUSNESS; BRAIN; AGE; DESFLURANE	BACKGROUNDFew studies have systematically described relationships between clinical-behavioural signs, electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns and age during emergence from anaesthesia in young children.OBJECTIVETo identify the relationships between end-tidal sevoflurane (ETsevoflurane) concentration, age and frontal EEG spectral properties in predicting recovery of clinical-behavioural signs during emergence from sevoflurane in children 0 to 3 years of age, with and without exposure to nitrous oxide. The hypothesis was that clinical signs occur sequentially during emergence, and that for infants aged more than 3 months, changes in alpha EEG power are correlated with clinical-behavioural signs.DESIGNAn observational study.SETTINGA tertiary paediatric teaching hospital from December 2012 to August 2016.PATIENTSNinety-five children aged 0 to 3 years who required surgery below the neck.OUTCOME MEASURESTime-course of, and ETsevoflurane concentrations at first gross body movement, first cough, first grimace, dysconjugate eye gaze, frontal (F7/F8) alpha EEG power (8 to 12Hz), frontal beta EEG power (13 to 30Hz), surgery-end.RESULTSClinical signs of emergence followed an orderly sequence of events across all ages. Clinical signs occurred over a narrow ETsevoflurane, independent of age [movement: 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3 to 0.4), cough 0.3% (95% CI, 0.3 to 0.4), grimace 0.2% (95% CI, 0 to 0.3); P>0.5 for age vs. ETsevoflurane]. Dysconjugate eye gaze was observed between ETsevoflurane 1 to 0%. In children more than 3 months old, frontal alpha EEG oscillations were present at ETsevoflurane 2.0% and disappeared at 0.5%. Movement occurred within 5min of alpha oscillation disappearance in 99% of patients. Nitrous oxide had no effect on the time course or ETsevoflurane at which children showed body movement, grimace or cough.CONCLUSIONSeveral clinical signs occur sequentially during emergence, and are independent of exposure to nitrous oxide. Eye position is poorly correlated with other clinical signs or ETsevoflurane. EEG spectral characteristics may aid prediction of clinical-behavioural signs in children more than 3 months.

J	Singh, LK; Nizamie, H; Tikka, SK				Singh, Lokesh Kumar; Nizamie, Haque; Tikka, Sai Krishna			Sleep architecture and EEG power spectra in recently detoxified alcohol dependent patients	ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Alcohol dependence; Recently detoxified; Polysomnography; Sleep architecture; Power spectral analysis	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; NREM SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; WITHDRAWAL; PATTERNS; IMPAIRMENT; ABSTINENCE; IMPACT; SIGMA	Objectives: Persistent sleep abnormalities during abstinence are a harbinger for relapse in patients with chronic alcohol dependence. The present study aimed to compare polysomnography (PSG) data between 'recently detoxified' patients with chronic alcohol dependence and healthy controls. Methods: Both conventional sleep architectural and power spectral analyses were conducted. Twenty subjects in each of the groups were enrolled. A 2 nights' sleep (first-habituation and second-experimental) PSG data was collected. Computer assisted scoring supplemented by manual method using the Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria were used for sleep staging. Twenty eight channels were used for the EEG recording. Spectral power across early NREM (Non-rapid-eye-movement), Slow Wave Sleep and REM was computed using the Welch's averaged periodogram method. Results: Results on conventional sleep staging showed that patients had significantly lesser total sleep time, sleep efficiency and stage shifts and longer sleep onset latency; while duration of each NREM stages were significantly lower, and latency of stage 2 NREM was significantly longer in patients. After controlling for multiple comparisons, spectral power analysis revealed significant differences only during REM sleep and specifically in high frequency (beta and gamma) bands. Conclusions: Stating the mutually complementary role of conventional and spectral analyses of polysomnography EEG data, we conclude that sleep abnormalities are fairly evident in recently detoxified alcohol dependent patients.

J	Klimesch, W				Klimesch, Wolfgang			The frequency architecture of brain and brain body oscillations: an analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						body oscillations; brain oscillations; cross-frequency coupling; oscillatory hierarchy; phase coupling	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; RESPIRATORY SINUS ARRHYTHMIA; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; TRAVELING ALPHA-WAVES; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG ALPHA; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE	Research on brain oscillations has brought up a picture of coupled oscillators. Some of the most important questions that will be analyzed are, how many frequencies are there, what are the coupling principles, what their functional meaning is, and whether body oscillations follow similar coupling principles. It is argued that physiologically, two basic coupling principles govern brain as well as body oscillations: (i) amplitude (envelope) modulation between any frequencies m and n, where the phase of the slower frequency m modulates the envelope of the faster frequency n, and (ii) phase coupling between m and n, where the frequency of n is a harmonic multiple of m. An analysis of the center frequency of traditional frequency bands and their coupling principles suggest a binary hierarchy of frequencies. This principle leads to the foundation of the binary hierarchy brain body oscillation theory. Its central hypotheses are that the frequencies of body oscillations can be predicted from brain oscillations and that brain and body oscillations are aligned to each other. The empirical evaluation of the predicted frequencies for body oscillations is discussed on the basis of findings for heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing frequencies, fluctuations in the BOLD signal, and other body oscillations. The conclusion is that brain and many body oscillations can be described by a single system, where the cross talk - reflecting communication - within and between brain and body oscillations is governed by m:n phase to envelope and phase to phase coupling.

A large body of knowledge focusing on psychophysiological animal and human studies suggests the involvement of key brain structures that interact via neural oscillations during the acquisition and extinction of fear. Consequently, neural oscillatory correlates of such mechanisms appear relevant regarding the development of novel therapeutic approaches to counterbalance abnormal activity in fear-related brain circuits, which, in turn, could alleviate fear and anxiety symptoms. Here, we provide an account of state-of-the-art neural oscillatory correlates for the conditioning and extinction of fear, and also deal with recent translational efforts aimed at fear extinction by neural oscillatory modulation.

Investigating the role of mGluR2 versus mGluR3 in antipsychotic-like effects, sleep-wake architecture and network oscillatory activity using novel Han Wistar rats lacking mGluR2 expression	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Metabotropic glutamate receptor; mGluR2; mGluR3; Han Wistar; Hyperlocomotion; Sleep; EEG	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; AGONIST LY379268; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; D-AMPHETAMINE; G-PROTEIN; PHENCYCLIDINE	Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2 and mGluR3) are implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders. They also control sleep-wake architecture and may offer novel therapeutic targets. However, the roles of the mGluR2 versus mGluR3 subtypes are not well understood. Here, we have taken advantage of the recently described mutant strain of Han Wistar rats, which do not express mGluR2 receptors, to investigate behavioural, sleep and EEG responses to mGluR2/3 ligands. The mGluR2/3 agonist, LY354740 (10 mg/kg), reversed amphetamine- and phencyclidine-induced locomotion and rearing behaviours in control Wistar but not in mGluR2 lacking Han Wistar rats. In control Wistar but not in Han Wistar rats the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (3 & 10 mg/kg) induced REM sleep suppression with dose-dependent effects on wake and NREM sleep. By contrast, the mGluR2/3 antagonist LY3020371 (3 & 10 mg/kg) had wake-promoting effects in both rat strains, albeit smaller in the mGluR2-lacking Han Wistar rats, indicating both mGluR2 and mGluR3-mediated effects on wakefulness. LY3020371 enhanced wake cortical oscillations in the theta (4-9 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) range in both Wistar and Han Wistar rat strains, whereas LY379268 reduced theta and gamma oscillations in control Wistar rats, with minimal effects in Han Wistar rats. Together these studies illustrate the significant contribution of mGluR2 to the antipsychotic-like, sleep and EEG effects of drugs acting on group II mGluRs. However, we also provide evidence of a role for mGluR3 activity in the control of sleep and wake cortical theta and gamma oscillations. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These hyperscanning studies have enabled us to discover new and important evidences of interbrain interactions. Yet, very little is known about verbal interaction without any visual input. Therefore, we conducted a new hyperscanning study based on verbal, interbrain turn-taking interaction using simultaneous EEG/MEG, which measures rapidly changing brain activities. To establish turn-taking verbal interactions between a pair of subjects, we set up two EEG/MEG systems (19 and 146 channels of EEG and MEG, respectively) located approximate to 100 miles apart. Subjects engaged in verbal communication via condenser microphones and magnetic-compatible earphones, and a network time protocol synchronized the two systems. Ten subjects participated in this experiment and performed verbal interaction and noninteraction tasks separately. We found significant oscillations in EEG alpha and MEG alpha/gamma bands in several brain regions for all subjects. Furthermore, we estimated phase synchronization between two brains using the weighted phase lag index and found statistically significant synchronization in EEG and MEG data. Our novel paradigm and neurophysiological findings may foster a basic understanding of the functional mechanisms involved in human social interactions. Hum Brain Mapp 39:171-188, 2018.

EEG time-warping to study non-strictly-periodic EEG signals related to the production of rhythmic movements	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Frequency tagging; Time warping; Rhythm; Sensorimotor synchronization; Anisochrony; Non-stationarity	STATE EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; ENTRAINMENT; DYNAMICS; STIMULATION; SEPARATION; REMOVAL; BEAT	Background: Many sensorimotor functions are intrinsically rhythmic, and are underlined by neural processes that are functionally distinct from neural responses related to the processing of transient events. EEG frequency tagging is a technique that is increasingly used in neuroscience to study these processes. It relies on the fact that perceiving and/or producing rhythms generates periodic neural activity that translates into periodic variations of the EEG signal. In the EEG spectrum, those variations appear as peaks localized at the frequency of the rhythm and its harmonics. New method: Many natural rhythms, such as music or dance, are not strictly periodic and, instead, show fluctuations of their period over time. Here, we introduce a time-warping method to identify non-strictly-periodic EEG activities in the frequency domain. Results: EEG time-warping can be used to characterize the sensorimotor activity related to the performance of self-paced rhythmic finger movements. Furthermore, the EEG time-warping method can disentangle auditoryand movement-related EEG activity produced when participants perform rhythmic movements synchronized to an acoustic rhythm. This is possible because the movement-related activity has different period fluctuations than the auditory-related activity. Comparison with existing methods: With the classic frequency-tagging approach, rhythm fluctuations result in a spreading of the peaks to neighboring frequencies, to the point that they cannot be distinguished from background noise. Conclusions: The proposed time-warping procedure is as a simple and effective mean to study natural nonstrictly-periodic rhythmic neural processes such as rhythmic movement production, acoustic rhythm perception and sensorimotor synchronization.

Despite increasing recognition of the clinical heterogeneity of RTT and its variants (e.g Classical, Hanefeld and PSV(Preserved Speech Variant)), the link between causative mutations and observed clinical phenotypes remains unclear. Quantitative analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings may further elucidate important differences between the different clinical and genetic forms of RTT. Methods: Using a large cohort (n = 42) of RTT patients, we analysed the electrophysiological profiles of RTT variants (genetic and clinical) in addition to epilepsy status (no epilepsy/treatment-responsive epilepsy/treatment-resistant epilepsy). The distribution of spectral power and inter-electrode coherence measures were derived from continuous resting-state EEG recordings. Results: RTT genetic variants (MeCP2/CDLK5) were characterised by significant differences in network architecture on comparing first principal components of inter-electrode coherence across all frequency bands (p < 0.0001). Greater coherence in occipital and temporal pairs were seen in MeCP2 vs CDLK5 variants, the main drivers in between group differences. Similarly, clinical phenotypes (Classical RTT/Hanefeld/PSV) demonstrated significant differences in network architecture (p < 0.0001). Right tempero-parietal connectivity was found to differ between groups (p = 0.04), with greatest coherence in the Classical RTT phenotype. PSV demonstrated a significant difference in left-sided parieto-occipital coherence (p = 0.026). Whilst overall power decreased over time, there were no difference in asymmetry and inter-electrode coherence profiles over time. There was a significant difference in asymmetry in the overall power spectra between epilepsy groups (p = 0.04) in addition to occipital asymmetry across all frequency bands. Significant differences in network architecture were also seen across epilepsy groups (p = 0.044). Conclusions: Genetic and clinical variants of RTT are characterised by discrete patterns of inter-electrode coherence and network architecture which remain stable over time. Further, hemispheric distribution of spectral power and measures of network dysfunction are associated with epilepsy status and treatment responsiveness. These findings support the role of discrete EEG profiles as non-invasive biomarkers in RTT and its genetic/clinical variants.

The activation of the hMNS response to AO remains controversial for several reasons. Therefore, this study investigated the activation of the hMNS response to a speed factor of AO by controlling the movement speed modes of a humanoid robot's arm movements. Since hMNS activation is reflected by ERD suppressions, electroencephalography (EEG) with BCI analysis methods for ERD suppressions were used as the recording and analysis modalities. Six healthy individuals were asked to participate in experiments comprising five different conditions. Four incremental-speed AO tasks and a motor imagery (MI) task involving imaging of the same movement were presented to the individuals. Occipital and sensorimotor regions were selected for BCI analyses. The experimental results showed that hMNS activation was higher in the occipital region but more robust in the sensorimotor region. Since the attended information impacts the activations of the hMNS during AO, the pattern of hMNS activations first rises and subsequently falls to a stable level during incremental-speed modes of AO. The discipline curves suggested that a moderate speed within a decent inter-stimulus interval (ISI) range produced the highest hMNS activations. Since a brain computer/machine interface (BCI) builds a path-way between human and computer/mahcine, the discipline curves will help to construct BCIs made by patterns of action observation (AO-BCI). Furthermore, a new method for constructing non-invasive brain machine brain interfaces (BMBIs) with moderate AO-BCI and motor imagery BCI (MI-BCI) was inspired by this paper.

Enhancing Performance and Bit Rates in a Brain-Computer Interface System With Phase-to-Amplitude Cross-Frequency Coupling: Evidences From Traditional c-VEP, Fast c-VEP, and SSVEP Designs	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; c-VEP; SSVEP; disabled subjects; cross-frequency coupling; accuracy; phase-to-amplitude coupling; performance	BCI COMPETITION 2003; DATA SET IIB; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FLICKER FREQUENCY; EEG SIGNAL; RHYTHMS; ATTENTION; TIME; CLASSIFICATION	A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a channel of communication that transforms brain activity into specific commands for manipulating a personal computer or other home or electrical devices. In other words, a BCI is an alternative way of interacting with the environment by using brain activity instead of muscles and nerves. For that reason, BCI systems are of high clinical value for targeted populations suffering from neurological disorders. In this paper, we present a new processing approach in three publicly available BCI data sets: (a) a well-known multi-class (N = 6) coded-modulated Visual Evoked potential (c-VEP)-based BCI system for able-bodied and disabled subjects; (b) a multi-class (N = 32) c-VEP with slow and fast stimulus representation; and (c) a steady-state Visual Evoked potential (SSVEP) multi-class (N = 5) flickering BCI system. Estimating cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and namely delta-theta [delta: (0.5-4Hz), theta: (4-8Hz)] phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) within sensor and across experimental time, we succeeded in achieving high classification accuracy and Information Transfer Rates (ITR) in the three data sets. Our approach outperformed the originally presented ITR on the three data sets. The bit rates obtained for both the disabled and able-bodied subjects reached the fastest reported level of 324 bits/min with the PAC estimator. Additionally, our approach outperformed alternative signal features such as the relative power (29.73 bits/min) and raw time series analysis (24.93 bits/min) and also the original reported bit rates of 10-25 bits/min. In the second data set, we succeeded in achieving an average ITR of 124.40 +/- 11.68 for the slow 60Hz and an average ITR of 233.99 +/- 15.75 for the fast 120Hz. In the third data set, we succeeded in achieving an average ITR of 106.44 +/- 8.94. Current methodology outperforms any previous methodologies applied to each of the three free available BCI datasets.

In somatosensory cortex (S1), negative linear and inverted U-shape relationships exist, whereas its effect on the primary motor cortex (M1) is hardly known. Objective: We used real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 to characterize the relationship between spontaneous sensorimotor mu-alpha power fluctuations at rest and corticospinal excitability. Methods: In 16 subjects, mu-alpha power was continuously monitored over the left sensorimotor cortex, and each 10%-percentile bin of the individual mu-alpha power distribution was repeatedly targeted in pseudorandomized order by single-pulse TMS of left M1, measuring motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the contralateral hand. Results: We found a weak positive relationship between mu-alpha power and MEP amplitude. Conclusion: Sensorimotor mu-alpha power may reflect a net facilitation or disinhibition of M1, possibly resulting from mu-alpha based suppression of excitatory and inhibitory input from S1.

Pre-intervention test-retest reliability of EEG and ERP over four recording intervals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Test-retest reliability; EEG; ERP; Repeated measurements; Crossover design	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; TEMPORAL STABILITY; ALZHEIMER PATIENTS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; COMPONENTS	In this study we present the test-retest reliability of pre-intervention EEG/ERP (electroencephalogram/event-related potentials) data across four recording intervals separated by a washout period (18-22 days). POz-recording-reference EEG/ERP (28 sites, average reference) were recorded from thirty-two healthy male participants. Participants were randomly allocated into different intervention sequences, each with four intervention regimens: 10 mg vortioxetine, 20 mg vortioxetine, 15 mg escitalopram and Placebo. We report classical EEG spectra: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), gamma 1 (30-45 Hz) and gamma 2 (45-80 Hz) of resting state and vigilance-controlled, and of auditory steady state response, as well as ERP components N100, P200 and P300 in auditory oddball task and error related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) in hybrid flanker task. Reliability was quantified using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). We found that theta, alpha and beta of continuous EEG were highly reliable (ICCs >= 0.84). Evoked power of other tasks demonstrated larger variability and less reliability compared to the absolute power of continuous EEG. Furthermore, reliabilities of ERP measures were lower compared to those of the EEG spectra. We saw fair to excellent reliability of the amplitude of the components such as Pe (0.60-0.82) and P300 (0.55-0.80). Moreover, blood tests confirmed that there was no measurable drug carry-over from the previous intervention. The results support that EEG/ERP is reliable across four recording intervals, thus it can be used to assess the effect of different doses and types of drugs with CNS effects.

Parietofrontal network upregulation after motor stroke	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						EEG; Coherence; Motor recovery; Stroke; Parietal lobe	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; HAND MOVEMENTS; BRAIN; RECOVERY; REORGANIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; FMRI	Objective: Motor recovery after stroke shows a high inter-subject variability. The brain's potential to form new connections determines individual levels of recovery of motor function. Most of our daily activities require visuomotor integration, which engages parietal areas. Compared to the frontal motor system, less is known about the parietal motor system's reconfiguration related to stroke recovery. Here, we tested if functional connectivity among parietal and frontal motor areas undergoes plastic changes after stroke and assessed the behavioral relevance for motor function after stroke. Methods: We investigated stroke lesion-induced changes in functional connectivity by measuring high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and assessing task-related changes in coherence during a visually guided grip task with the paretic hand in 30 chronic stroke patients with variable motor deficits and 19 healthy control subjects. Quantitative changes in task-related coherence in sensorimotor rhythms were compared to the residual motor deficit. Results: Parietofrontal coupling was significantly stronger in patients compared to controls. Whereas motor network coupling generally increased during the task in both groups, the task-related coherence between the parietal and primary motor cortex in the stroke lesioned hemisphere showed increased connectivity across a broad range of sensorimotor rhythms. Particularly the parietofrontal task-induced coupling pattern was significantly and positively related to residual impairment in the Nine-Hole Peg Test performance and grip force. Interpretation: These results demonstrate that parietofrontal motor system integration during visually guided movements is stronger in the stroke-lesioned brain. The correlation with the residual motor deficit could either indicate an unspecific marker of motor network damage or it might indicate that upregulated parietofrontal connectivity has some impact on post-stroke motor function.

Working memory impairment is among the earliest signs of MCI. Oscillatory analysis of working memory might be a potential tool for identifying patients at increased risk of developing dementia. Our study aimed to assess the temporospatial pattern of spectral differences during working memory maintenance between MCI patients and healthy controls and to compare the sources of oscillatory activity between the two groups. Event-related spectral perturbation of 17 MCI patients and 21 healthy control participants was studied with 128-channel EEG during the Sternberg working memory task. Source localization was performed by using the eLORETA software. Among the participants, 13 MCI and 15 control participants underwent a structural brain MRI examination. Event-related synchronization (ERS) in the alpha and beta frequency band was significantly lower in MCI patients compared to healthy control participants during retention. Both study groups showed significant memory load-related enhancement in both frequency band. In the MCI group, source localization revealed significantly attenuated beta oscillatory activity in the inferior and middle temporal gyrus, in the fusiform gyrus, and in the cuneus. Beta ERS correlated significantly with the size of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. During the retention period, MCI is characterized by decreased alpha and beta ERS compared to controls indicating early impairment in neural networks serving working memory maintenance. The assessment of electrophysiological changes in the beta frequency range may provide a useful diagnostic tool for the early detection of cognitive impairment.

Expectations Do Not Alter Early Sensory Processing during Perceptual Decision-Making	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; decision-making; electroencephalography (EEG); expectation; sensory modulation	FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; AUDITORY SIGNAL-DETECTION; INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL	Two factors play important roles in shaping perception: the allocation of selective attention to behaviorally relevant sensory features, and prior expectations about regularities in the environment. Signal detection theory proposes distinct roles of attention and expectation on decision-making such that attention modulates early sensory processing, whereas expectation influences the selection and execution of motor responses. Challenging this classic framework, recent studies suggest that expectations about sensory regularities enhance the encoding and accumulation of sensory evidence during decision-making. However, it is possible, that these findings reflect well documented attentional modulations in visual cortex. Here, we tested this framework in a group of male and female human participants by examining how expectations about stimulus features (orientation and color) and expectations about motor responses impacted electro-encephalography (EEG) markers of early sensory processing and the accumulation of sensory evidence during decision-making (the early visual negative potential and the centro-parietal positive potential, respectively). We first demonstrate that these markers are sensitive to changes in the amount of sensory evidence in the display. Then we show, counter to recent findings, that neither marker is modulated by either feature or motor expectations, despite a robust effect of expectations on behavior. Instead, violating expectations about likely sensory features and motor responses impacts posterior alpha and frontal theta oscillations, signals thought to index overall processing time and cognitive conflict. These findings are inconsistent with recent theoretical accounts and suggest instead that expectations primarily influence decisions by modulating post-perceptual stages of information processing.

Reduced delta-band modulation underlies the loss of P300 responses in disorders of consciousness	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Vegetative state; Minimally conscious state; Electroencephalography; Delta waves; Theta waves; P300	DETECTING AWARENESS; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; VEGETATIVE STATE; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; RECOVERY; MEMORY; ALPHA; CORRELATE	Objective: The P300 component of a sensory event-related potential is one of the major electrophysiological markers used to explore remnants of cognitive function in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). However, measuring the P300 in patients is complicated by significant inter-trial variability commonly observed in levels of arousal and awareness. To overcome this limitation, we analyzed single-trial modulation of power in the delta and theta frequency bands, which underlie the P300. Methods: In a preliminary cross-sectional study using a 24-channel EEG and a passive own-name oddball paradigm, we analyzed event-related synchronization (ERS) across trials in the delta and theta bands in a sample of 10 control and 12 DoC subjects. Results: In comparison to controls, DoC subjects presented a low percentage of trials where delta ERS was observed. In particular, coordinated modulation between delta and theta in response to the stimulus was absent, with a high percentage of trials where only theta ERS was observed. Further, we found a positive correlation between the percentage of epochs with delta ERS and the strength of the P300. Conclusions: Reduced modulation of spectral activity in the delta band in response to stimuli indicates a dissociation in the activity of the neural networks that oscillate in delta and theta ranges and contribute to the generation of the P300. Significance: The reduction in spectral modulation observed in DoC provides a deeper understanding of neurophysiological dysfunction and the means to develop a more fine-grained marker of residual cognitive function in individual patients.

One hypothesis is that individuals with ASD engage in piecemeal compared to holistic face processing strategies. To investigate the role of possible impairments in holistic face processing in individuals with autism, the current study investigated behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of face processing (P1/N170 and gamma-band activity) in adolescents with ASD and sex-, age-, and IQ-matched neurotypical controls. Methods: Participants were presented with upright and inverted Mooney stimuli; black and white low information faces that are only perceived as faces when processed holistically. Participants indicated behaviorally the detection of a face. EEG was collected time-locked to the presentation of the stimuli. Results: Adolescents with ASD perceived Mooney stimuli as faces suggesting ability to use holistic processing but displayed a lower face detection rate and slower response times. ERP components suggest slowed temporal processing of Mooney stimuli in the ASD compared to control group for P1 latency but no differences between groups for P1 amplitude and at the N170. Increases in gamma-band activity was similar during the perception of the Mooney images by group, but the ASD group showed prolonged temporal elevation in activity. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that adolescents with ASD were able to utilize holistic processing to perceive a face within the Mooney stimuli. Delays in early processing, marked by the P1, and elongated elevation in gamma activity indicate that the neural systems supporting holistic processing are slightly altered suggesting a less automatic and less efficient facial processing system.

Here, we show that large visual stimuli induce a slow gamma (25-45 Hz) in area V1 of two awake adult female bonnet monkeys and in the EEG of 15 human subjects (7 males and 8 females), in addition to the traditionally known fast gamma (45-70 Hz). The two rhythms had different tuning characteristics for stimulus orientation, contrast, drift speed, and size. Further, fast gamma had short latency, strongly entrained spikes and was coherent over short distances, reflecting short-range processing, whereas slow gamma appeared to reflect long-range processing. Together, two gamma rhythms can potentially provide better coding or communication mechanisms and a more comprehensive biomarker for diagnosis of mental disorders.	[Murty, Dinavahi V. P.

Imaging studies have shown that multiple brain regions are actively engaged in the processing of pain. However, roles of each brain regions and their contribution to pain are still largely unknown. Recent studies with electrophysiology especially high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) or multichannel recordings techniques have provided more insights into the dynamics of pain signature. The accumulations of the evidence could facilitate our understanding of pain and provide potential methods for objective pain evaluation and treatment of chronic pain.

Cortical Measures of Phoneme-Level Speech Encoding Correlate with the Perceived Clarity of Natural Speech	ENEURO			English	Article						cortical entrainment; EEG; intelligibility; phonetics; predictive coding; prior knowledge	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; OSCILLATIONS; ENTRAINMENT; RESPONSES; ORGANIZATION; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; REPETITION; ENVELOPE	In real-world environments, humans comprehend speech by actively integrating prior knowledge (P) and expectations with sensory input. Recent studies have revealed effects of prior information in temporal and frontal cortical areas and have suggested that these effects are underpinned by enhanced encoding of speech-specific features, rather than a broad enhancement or suppression of cortical activity. However, in terms of the specific hierarchical stages of processing involved in speech comprehension, the effects of integrating bottom-up sensory responses and top-down predictions are still unclear. In addition, it is unclear whether the predictability that comes with prior information may differentially affect speech encoding relative to the perceptual enhancement that comes with that prediction. One way to investigate these issues is through examining the impact of P on indices of cortical tracking of continuous speech features. Here, we did this by presenting participants with degraded speech sentences that either were or were not preceded by a clear recording of the same sentences while recording non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). We assessed the impact of prior information on an isolated index of cortical tracking that reflected phoneme-level processing. Our findings suggest the possibility that prior information affects the early encoding of natural speech in a dual manner. Firstly, the availability of prior information, as hypothesized, enhanced the perceived clarity of degraded speech, which was positively correlated with changes in phoneme-level encoding across subjects. In addition, P induced an overall reduction of this cortical measure, which we interpret as resulting from the increase in predictability.

An example of this influence is demonstrated by the McGurk-effect where illusory (cross-modal) sounds are perceived following presentation of incongruent audio-visual (AV) stimuli. Previous studies report the engagement of specific cortical modules that are spatially distributed during cross-modal perception. However, the limits of the underlying representational space and the cortical network mechanisms remain unclear. In this combined psychophysical and electroencephalography (EEG) study, the participants reported their perception while listening to a set of synchronous and asynchronous incongruent AV stimuli. We identified the neural representation of subjective cross-modal perception at different organizational levels - at specific locations in sensor space and at the level of the large-scale brain network estimated from between-sensor interactions. We identified an enhanced positivity in the event-related potential peak around 300 ms following stimulus onset associated with cross-modal perception. At the spectral level, cross-modal perception involved an overall decrease in power at the frontal and temporal regions at multiple frequency bands and at all AV lags, along with an increased power at the occipital scalp region for synchronous AV stimuli. At the level of large-scale neuronal networks, enhanced functional connectivity at the gamma band involving frontal regions serves as a marker of AV integration. Thus, we report in one single study that segregation of information processing at individual brain locations and integration of information over candidate brain networks underlie multisensory speech perception.

Spatial frequency supports the emergence of categorical representations in visual cortex during natural scene perception	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA); Representational similarity analysis (RSA); Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Scene categorization	LEVEL IMAGE PROPERTIES; NEURAL RESPONSE; TIME-COURSE; SELECTIVE REGIONS; PATTERNS; CATEGORIZATION; BRAIN; INFORMATION; EEG; STATISTICS	In navigating our environment, we rapidly process and extract meaning from visual cues. However, the relationship between visual features and categorical representations in natural scene perception is still not well understood. Here, we used natural scene stimuli from different categories and filtered at different spatial frequencies to address this question in a passive viewing paradigm. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and cross-decoding of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, we show that categorical representations emerge in human visual cortex at similar to 180 ms and are linked to spatial frequency processing. Furthermore, dorsal and ventral stream areas reveal temporally and spatially overlapping representations of low and high-level layer activations extracted from a feedforward neural network. Our results suggest that neural patterns from extrastriate visual cortex switch from low-level to categorical representations within 200 ms, highlighting the rapid cascade of processing stages essential in human visual perception.

J	Benedetto, A; Lozano-Soldevilla, D; VanRullen, R				Benedetto, Alessandro; Lozano-Soldevilla, Diego; VanRullen, Rufin			Different responses of spontaneous and stimulus-related alpha activity to ambient luminance changes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; ambient luminance; brain oscillations; critical flicker frequency; echo function; impulse response function	CRITICAL FLICKER FREQUENCY; EEG ALPHA; VISUAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; CORTICAL ALPHA; PERCEPTION; PERFORMANCE; MEMORY; RHYTHM; PHASE	Alpha oscillations are particularly important in determining our percepts and have been implicated in fundamental brain functions. Oscillatory activity can be spontaneous or stimulus-related. Furthermore, stimulus-related responses can be phase- or non-phase-locked to the stimulus. Non-phase-locked (induced) activity can be identified as the average amplitude changes in response to a stimulation, while phase-locked activity can be measured via reverse-correlation techniques (echo function). However, the mechanisms and the functional roles of these oscillations are far from clear. Here, we investigated the effect of ambient luminance changes, known to dramatically modulate neural oscillations, on spontaneous and stimulus-related alpha. We investigated the effect of ambient luminance on EEG alpha during spontaneous human brain activity at rest (experiment 1) and during visual stimulation (experiment 2). Results show that spontaneous alpha amplitude increased by decreasing ambient luminance, while alpha frequency remained unaffected. In the second experiment, we found that under low-luminance viewing, the stimulus-related alpha amplitude was lower, and its frequency was slightly faster. These effects were evident in the phase-locked part of the alpha response (echo function), but weaker or absent in the induced (non-phase-locked) alpha responses. Finally, we explored the possible behavioural correlates of these modulations in a monocular critical flicker frequency task (experiment 3), finding that dark adaptation in the left eye decreased the temporal threshold of the right eye. Overall, we found that ambient luminance changes impact differently on spontaneous and stimulus-related alpha expression. We suggest that stimulus-related alpha activity is crucial in determining human temporal segmentation abilities.

With the development of pervasive sensor technologies, physiological signals can be captured continuously to prevent the serious outcomes caused by epilepsy. However, the progress on seizure prediction has been hindered by the lack of automatic early warning system. The existing research is classifying electroencephalograph (EEG) clips and is distinguishing the clips of onset epileptic seizures. Deep learning is a promising method to analyze the large-scale unlabeled data and to widely spread the clinical treatment and risk prediction. In this paper, we outline a patient-specific method for extracting the frequency domain and time-series data features based on the two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A data preprocessing method based on the discrete Fourier transform is proposed to convert the time-domain signal of the EEG data to the frequency-domain signal. Long short-term memory networks are introduced in seizure prediction using pre-seizure clips of the EEG dataset, expanding the use of deep learning algorithms with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Furthermore, the proposed CNN and RNN are compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms, such as linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression, and the evaluation criteria are on the area under the curve. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively extract the latent features with meaningful interpretation and exhibits excellent performance for predicting epileptic preictal state changes, and hence is an effective method in detecting the epileptic seizure.

S	Zhang, D		Im, CH		Zhang, Dan			Computational EEG Analysis for Hyperscanning and Social Neuroscience	COMPUTATIONAL EEG ANALYSIS: METHODS AND APPLICATIONS	Biological and Medical Physics Biomedical Engineering		English	Article; Book Chapter							BRAIN ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; MEG	Hyperscanning, the technique that simultaneously records neural activities from multiple interacting participants, has attracted increasing attention in the field of social neuroscience. EEG is among the most popular neuroimaging techniques for hyperscanning, as its high portability enables neural signal recordings in naturalistic social interaction scenarios. This chapter summarizes the state-of-the-art progress on the computational EEG analysis methods for hyperscanning and social neuroscience. These methods are divided into two categories, focusing on social perception and social interaction, respectively. A variety of computational models have been proposed and implemented to quantitatively describe the hyperlinks among interacting brains, and significant hyperlinks have been reported in social tasks covering typical social activities. As the development of hyperscanning methods is still at its early beginning, future perspectives are discussed at the end of the chapter.

The existing empirical wavelet transform (EWT) has been enhanced using Fourier-Besse series expansion (FBSE) in order to obtain improved TF representation of non-stationary signals. We have used the FBSE method for the spectral representation of the analyzed multi-component signals with good frequency resolution. The scale-space based boundary detection method has been applied for the accurate estimation of boundary frequencies in the FBSE based spectrum of the signal. After that, wavelet based filter banks have been generated in order to decompose non-stationary multi component signals into narrow-band components. Finally, the normalized Hilbert transform has been applied for the estimation of amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency functions from the narrow-band components and obtained the TF representation of the analyzed non-stationary signal. We have applied our proposed method for the TF representation of multi-component synthetic signals and real electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The proposed method has provided better TF representation as compared to existing EWT method and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) method, especially when analyzed signal possesses closed frequency components and of short time duration.

This requires the epileptogenic zone (EZ) to be accurately delineated. In this paper, a two-stage approach for EZ delineation is proposed. The algorithm starts by detecting events of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) directly from the multi-channel intracranial electroencephalograms (iEEGs). The sample entropy is then computed for each of their channels that will be used for determining the channels correlated with the EZ. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and the results indicate that our proposed approach can provide an accurate estimation of the EZ.

Several studies have investigated the underlying neural mechanisms of maintaining various visuospatial stimuli simultaneously (i.e., WM load, the number of representations that need to be maintained in WM). However, two confounding factors, namely verbal representation and encoding load (the number of items that need to be encoded into WM), have not been well controlled in previous studies. In this study, we developed a novel delayed-match-to-sample task (DMST) controlling for these two confounding factors and recorded scalp EEG signals during the task. We found that behavioral performance deteriorated severely as memory load increased. Neural activity was modulated by WM load in a dynamic manner. Specifically, higher memory load induced stronger amplitude in occipital and central channel-clusters during the early delay period, while the inverse trend was observed in central and frontal channel-clusters during late delay. In addition, the same inverse memory load effect, that was lower memory load induced stronger amplitude, was observed in occipital channel-cluster alpha power during late delay. Finally, significant correlations between neural activity and individual reaction time showed a role of late-delay central and frontal channel-cluster amplitude in predicting behavioral performance. Because the occipital cortex is important for visual information maintenance, the decrease in alpha oscillation was consistent with the cognitive role that is "gating by inhibition." Together, our results from a well-controlled DMST suggest that WM load not exerted constant but dynamic effect on neural activity during maintenance of visuospatial objects.

Disrupted thalamocortical brain oscillations hold promise as putative biomarkers or endophenotypes of the disorder. Despite an increase in studies related to sleep spindle and slow-wave activity, findings remain in part contradictory. Although sleep spindle deficits have been confirmed in several groups of patients with chronic, medicated schizophrenia, data on the early stages of the disorder and in unmedicated subjects are still insufficient. Findings on slow-wave abnormalities are largely inconclusive, possibly due to the different criteria employed to define the phenomenon and to the influence of atypical antipsychotics. In this review, we aim to address the methodological and practical issues that may have limited the consistency of findings across research groups and different patient populations. Given the neurobiological relevance of these oscillations, which reflect the integrity of thalamocortical and cortico-cortical function, research in this domain should be encouraged. To promote widespread consensus over the scientific and clinical implications of these sleep-related phenomena, we advocate uniform and sound methodological approaches. These should encompass electroencephalographic recording and analysis techniques but also selection criteria and characterization of clinical populations.

Using behavioral measures and EEG, we studied whether an own-age bias (OAB) also exists in voice memory. Young (19 - 26 years) and old (60-75 years) participants studied young (18-25 years) and old (60-77 years) unfamiliar voices from short sentences. Subsequently, they classified studied and novel voices as "old" (i.e. studied) or "new", from the same sentences. Recognition performance was higher in young compared to old participants, and for old compared to young voices, with no OAB. At the same time, we found evidence for higher distinctiveness of old compared to young voices, both in terms of acoustic measures and subjective ratings (independent of rater age). Analyses of event related brain potentials (ERPs) indicated more negative-going deflections (400-1000 ms) for old compared to young voices in young participants. In old participants, we observed a reversed OLD/NEW memory effect, with overall more positive amplitudes for novel compared to studied old (but not young) voices (400-1000 ms). Time frequency analyses revealed less beta power (16-26 Hz) for young compared to old voices at left anterior sites, and also reduced beta power for correctly recognized studied (compared to novel) voices at left posterior sites (300-900 ms). These findings could suggest an engagement of cortical areas during stimulus-specific recollection from about 300 ms, in a task that emphasized the analysis of individual acoustic features.

A 130-nm CMOS neural interface processor is presented to perform the brain-state classification and closed-loop control using programmable-waveform electrical stimulation. The architecture features an autoencoder neural network for both spatial filtering and dimensionality reduction. Dedicated feature extraction blocks are implemented for univariate (signal-band energy) and multivariate (phase locking value, and cross-frequency coupling) neural signal processing. The proceeding exponentially decaying memory support vector machine (EDM-SVM) accelerator employs these features for hardware-efficient brain-state classification with a high temporal resolution.

Cortical tracking refers to the process by which neural activity follows the dynamic patterns of the speech input. In adults, it has been shown to involve attentional mechanisms and to facilitate effective speech encoding. However, in infants, cortical tracking or its effects on speech processing have not been investigated. This study measured cortical tracking of speech in infants and, given the involvement of attentional mechanisms in this process, cortical tracking of both infant-directed speech (IDS), which is highly attractive to infants, and the less captivating adult-directed speech (ADS), were compared. IDS is the speech register parents use when addressing young infants. In comparison to ADS, it is characterised by several acoustic qualities that capture infants' attention to linguistic input and assist language learning. Seven-month-old infants' cortical responses were recorded via electroencephalography as they listened to IDS or ADS recordings. Results showed stronger low-frequency cortical tracking of the speech envelope in IDS than in ADS. This suggests that IDS has a privileged status in facilitating successful cortical tracking of incoming speech which may, in turn, augment infants' early speech processing and even later language development.

There is increasing evidence that fast epileptic activity (FEA, 14-250 Hz) occurring interictally, i.e. between seizures, is predominantly localized within the SOZ. Currently it is unknown, which frequency band of FEA performs best in identifying the SOZ, although prior studies suggest highest concordance of spectral changes with the SOZ for high frequency changes. We suspected that FEA reflects dampened oscillations in local cortical excitatory-inhibitory neural networks, and that interictal FEA in the SOZ is a consequence of reduced oscillatory damping. We therefore predict a narrowing of the spectral bandwidth alongside increased amplitudes of spectral peaks during interictal FEA events. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated spectral changes during interictal FEA in invasive EEG (iEEG) recordings of 13 patients with focal epilepsy. In relative spectra of beta and gamma band changes (14-250 Hz) during FEA, we found that spectral peaks within the SOZ indeed were significantly more narrow-banded and their power changes were significantly higher than outside the SOZ. In contrast, the peak frequency did not differ within and outside the SOZ. Our results show that bandwidth and power changes of spectral modulations during FEA both help localizing the SOZ. We propose the spectral bandwidth as new source of information for the evaluation of EEG data.

However, strong stimulation artifacts complicate the investigation of neural activity with EEG or MEG during tES. Thus, studying brain signals during tES requires detailed knowledge about the properties of these artifacts. Recently, we characterized the phase-and amplitude-relationship between tES stimulation currents and tES artifacts in EEG and MEG and provided a mathematical model of these artifacts (Noury and Siegel, 2017, and Noury et al., 2016, respectively). Among several other features, we showed that, independent of the stimulation current, the amplitude of tES artifacts is modulated time locked to heartbeat and respiration. In response to our work, a recent paper (Neuling et al., 2017) raised several points concerning the employed stimulation device and methodology. Here, we discuss these points, explain potential misunderstandings, and show that none of the raised concerns are applicable to our results. Furthermore, we explain in detail the physics underlying tES artifacts, and discuss several approaches how to study brain function during tES in the presence of residual artifacts.

Temporal stability of posterior EEG alpha over twelve years	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Temporal stability; Trait biomarker; Surface Laplacian; Current source density (CSD); Principal components analysis (PCA)	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; RESTING EEG; LOW-RISK; MULTICHANNEL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ELECTRICAL DISTANCE; DEPRESSED PARENTS; SURFACE LAPLACIAN	Objective: We previously identified posterior EEG alpha as a potential biomarker for antidepressant treat-ment response. To meet the definition of a trait biomarker or endophenotype, it should be independent of the course of depression. Accordingly, this report evaluated the temporal stability of posterior EEG alpha at rest. Methods: Resting EEG was recorded from 70 participants (29 male; 46 adults), during testing sessions separated by 12 +/- 1.1 years. EEG alpha was identified, separated and quantified using reference-free methods that combine current source density (CSD) with principal components analysis (PCA). Measures of overall (eyes closed-plus-open) and net (eyes closed-minus-open) posterior alpha amplitude and asymmetry were compared across testing sessions. Results: Overall alpha was stable for the full sample (Spearman-Brown [tau(SB)] = .834, Pearson's tau= .718), and showed excellent reliability for adults (tau(SB) = .918; tau = 0.848). Net alpha showed acceptable reliability for adults (tau(SB)=.750; tau=.600). Hemispheric asymmetries (right-minus-left hemisphere) of posterior overall alpha showed significant correlations, but revealed acceptable reliability only for adults (tau(SB) = .728; tau= .573). Findings were highly comparable between 29 male and 41 female participants. Conclusions: Overall posterior EEG alpha amplitude is reliable over long time intervals in adults. Significance: The temporal stability of posterior EEG alpha oscillations at rest over long time intervals is indicative of an individual trait.

This study aims to determine whether recording macroelectrode iEEG with higher sampling rates improves seizure localization in clinical practice. Methods: 14 iEEG seizures from 10 patients recorded with >2000 Hz sampling rate were downsampled to four sampling rates: 100, 200, 500, 1000 Hz. In the 56 seizures, seizure onset time and location was marked by 5 independent, blinded EEG experts. Results: When reading iEEG under clinical conditions, there was no consistent difference in time or localization of seizure onset or number of electrodes involved in the seizure onset zone with sampling rates varying from 100 to 1000 Hz. Stratification of patients by outcome did not improve with higher sampling rate. Conclusion: When utilizing standard clinical protocols, there was no benefit to acquiring iEEGs with sampling rate >100 Hz. Significant variability was noted in EEG marking both within and between individual expert EEG readers. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

This methodology is limited by the need of relatively long signal recordings, and it is sensitive to EEG artifacts. Here, we analytically derive and experimentally validate a new method for automatic extraction of the tremor-related EEG component in pathological tremor patients that aims to overcome these limitations. Methods: We exploit the coupling between the tremor-related cortical activity and motor unit population firings to build a linear minimum mean square error estimator of the tremor component in EEG. We estimated the motor unit population activity by decomposing surface EMG signals into constituent motor unit spike trains, which we summed up into a cumulative spike train (CST). We used this CST to initialize our tremor-related EEG component estimate, which we optimized using a novel approach proposed here. Results: Tests on simulated signals demonstrate that our new method is robust to both noise and motor unit firing variability, and that it performs well across a wide range of spectral characteristics of the tremor. Results on 9 essential (ET) and 9 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show a similar to 2-fold increase in amplitude of the coherence between the estimated EEG component and the CST, compared to the classical EEG-EMG coherence analysis. Conclusions: We have developed a novel method that allows for more precise and robust estimation of the tremor-related EEG component. This method does not require artifact removal, provides reliable results in relatively short datasets, and tracks changes in the tremor-related cortical activity over time.

Here, we review fluctuations in ANS activity in association with CNS-defined sleep stages and cycles, and with phasic cortical events during sleep (e.g., arousals, K-complexes). Recent novel analytic methods reveal a dynamic organization of integrated physiological networks during sleep and indicate how multiple factors (e.g., sleep structure, age, sleep disorders) affect "CNS-ANS coupling". However, these data are mostly correlational and there is a lack of clarity of the underlying physiology, making it challenging to interpret causality and direction of coupling. Experimental manipulations (e.g., evoking K-complexes or arousals) provide information on the precise temporal sequence of cortical-cardiac activity, and are useful for investigating physiological pathways underlying CNS-ANS coupling. With the emergence of new analytical approaches and a renewed interest in ANS and CNS communication during sleep, future work may reveal novel insights into sleep and cardiovascular interactions during health and disease, in which coupling could be adversely impacted.

However, the latter claim remains inconclusive, mainly due to methodological limitations, such as the spectral constraints of scalp-level electroencephalographic recordings or volume-conduction confounds. Here, we circumvented these caveats by comparing gamma-band connectivity between two global states of consciousness via intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which provides the most reliable measurements of high-frequency activity in the human brain. Non-REM Sleep recordings were compared to passive-wakefulness recordings of the same duration in three subjects with surgically implanted electrodes. Signals were analyzed through the weighted Phase Lag Index connectivity measure and relevant graph theory metrics. We found that connectivity in the high-gamma range (90-120 Hz), as well as relevant graph theory properties, were higher during wakefulness than during sleep and discriminated between conditions better than any other canonical frequency band. Our results constitute the first report of iEEG differences between wakefulness and sleep in the high-gamma range at both local and distant sites, highlighting the utility of this technique in the search for the neural correlates of global states of consciousness.

Abnormal coherence and sleep composition in children with Angelman syndrome: a retrospective EEG study	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Angelman syndrome; UBE3A; EEG; Coherence; Spindles; Biomarker	NEOCORTICAL GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; AUTISM; BRAIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INDIVIDUALS; PHENOTYPE; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; ARCHITECTURE	Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, speech and motor impairments, epilepsy, abnormal sleep, and phenotypic overlap with autism. Individuals with AS display characteristic EEG patterns including high-amplitude rhythmic delta waves. Here, we sought to quantitatively explore EEG architecture in AS beyond known spectral power phenotypes. We were motivated by studies of functional connectivity and sleep spindles in autism to study these EEG readouts in children with AS. Methods: We analyzed retrospective wake and sleep EEGs from children with AS (age 4-11) and age-matched neurotypical controls. We assessed long-range and short-range functional connectivity by measuring coherence across multiple frequencies during wake and sleep. We quantified sleep spindles using automated and manual approaches. Results: During wakefulness, children with AS showed enhanced long-range EEG coherence across a wide range of frequencies. During sleep, children with AS showed increased long-range EEG coherence specifically in the gamma band. EEGs from children with AS contained fewer sleep spindles, and these spindles were shorter in duration than their neurotypical counterparts. Conclusions: We demonstrate two quantitative readouts of dysregulated sleep composition in children with AS-gamma coherence and spindles-and describe how functional connectivity patterns may be disrupted during wakefulness. Quantitative EEG phenotypes have potential as biomarkers and readouts of target engagement for future clinical trials and provide clues into how neural circuits are dysregulated in children with AS.

J	Tune, S; Wostmann, M; Obleser, J				Tune, Sarah; Woestmann, Malte; Obleser, Jonas			Probing the limits of alpha power lateralisation as a neural marker of selective attention in middle-aged and older listeners	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; EEG; spatial attention; speech processing	DOWN SUPPRESSION DEFICIT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; IN-NOISE PERCEPTION; HEARING-LOSS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; YOUNGER; ADULTS	In recent years, hemispheric lateralisation of alpha power has emerged as a neural mechanism thought to underpin spatial attention across sensory modalities. Yet, how healthy ageing, beginning in middle adulthood, impacts the modulation of lateralised alpha power supporting auditory attention remains poorly understood. In the current electroencephalography study, middle-aged and older adults (N=29; similar to 40-70years) performed a dichotic listening task that simulates a challenging, multitalker scenario. We examined the extent to which the modulation of 8-12Hz alpha power would serve as neural marker of listening success across age. With respect to the increase in interindividual variability with age, we examined an extensive battery of behavioural, perceptual and neural measures. Similar to findings on younger adults, middle-aged and older listeners' auditory spatial attention induced robust lateralisation of alpha power, which synchronised with the speech rate. Notably, the observed relationship between this alpha lateralisation and task performance did not co-vary with age. Instead, task performance was strongly related to an individual's attentional and working memory capacity. Multivariate analyses revealed a separation of neural and behavioural variables independent of age. Our results suggest that in age-varying samples as the present one, the lateralisation of alpha power is neither a sufficient nor necessary neural strategy for an individual's auditory spatial attention, as higher age might come with increased use of alternative, compensatory mechanisms. Our findings emphasise that explaining interindividual variability will be key to understanding the role of alpha oscillations in auditory attention in the ageing listener.

Research has shown that neuroplasticity-oriented training can improve task-related oscillatory dynamics, indicating some reorganization capacity in schizophrenia. Demonstrating a generalization of such task training effects to spontaneous oscillations at rest would not only enrich understanding of this neuroplastic potential but inform the interpretation of spontaneous gamma oscillations in the service of normal cognitive function. In the present study, neuromagnetic resting-state oscillatory brain activity and cognitive performance were assessed before and after training in 61 schizophrenia patients, who were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of neuroplasticity-oriented targeted cognitive training or treatment as usual (TAU). Gamma power of 40-90 Hz increased after training, but not after TAU, in a frontoparietal network. Across two types of training, this increase was related to improved cognitive test performance. These results indicate that abnormal oscillatory dynamics in schizophrenia patients manifested in spontaneous gamma activity can be changed with neuroplasticity-oriented training parallel to cognitive performance.

Listening in such situations is notoriously more difficult and more poorly encoded to long-term memory in older than in young adults (Tun, O'Kane, & Wingfield, 2002). Recent work by Payne, Rogers, Wingfield, and Sekuler (2017) in young adults demonstrated a neural correlate of auditory attention in the directed dichotic listening task (DDLT), where listeners attend to one ear while ignoring the other. Measured using electroencephalography, differences in alpha band power (8-14 Hz) between left and right hemisphere parietal regions mark the direction to which auditory attention is focused. Little prior research has been conducted on alpha power modulations in older adults, particularly with regard to auditory attention directed toward speech stimuli. In the current study, an older adult sample was administered the DDLT and delayed recognition procedures used by Payne et al. (2017). Compared to young adults, older adults showed reduced selective attention in the DDLT, evidenced by a higher rate of intrusions from the unattended ear. Moreover, older adults did not exhibit attention-related alpha modulation evidenced by young adults, nor did their event-related potentials (ERPs) to recognition probes differentiate between attended or unattended probes. Older adults' delayed recognition did not reveal a pattern of suppression of unattended items evidenced by young adults. These results serve as evidence for an age-related decline in selective auditory attention, potentially mediated by age-related decline in the ability to modulate alpha oscillations.

Hexadirectional Modulation of High-Frequency Electrophysiological Activity in the Human Anterior Medial Temporal Lobe Maps Visual Space	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN ENTORHINAL CORTEX; THETA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPUS; NAVIGATION; BRAIN; CELLS; CODE	Grid cells are one of the core building blocks of spatial navigation [1]. Single-cell recordings of grid cells in the rodent entorhinal cortex revealed hexagonal coding of the local environment during spatial navigation [1]. Grid-like activity has also been identified in human single-cell recordings during virtual navigation [2]. Human fMRI studies further provide evidence that grid-like signals are also accessible on a macroscopic level [3-7]. Studies in both non-human primates [8] and humans [9, 10] suggest that grid-like coding in the entorhinal cortex generalizes beyond spatial navigation during locomotion, providing evidence for grid-like mapping of visual space during visual exploration-akin to the grid cell positional code in rodents during spatial navigation. However, electrophysiological correlates of the grid code in humans remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence for grid-like, hexadirectional coding of visual space by human high-frequency activity, based on two independent datasets: non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy subjects and entorhinal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in an epileptic patient. Both datasets consistently show a hexadirectional modulation of broadband high-frequency activity (60-120 Hz). Our findings provide first evidence for a grid-like MEG signal, indicating that the human entorhinal cortex codes visual space in a grid-like manner [8-10], and support the view that grid coding generalizes beyond environmental mapping during locomotion [4-6, 11]. Due to their millisecond accuracy, MEG recordings allow linking of grid-like activity to epochs during relevant behavior, thereby opening up the possibility for new MEG-based investigations of grid coding at high temporal resolution.

However, previous studies mainly focused on the IGE-induced dynamic changes of functional connectivity (FC) in specific frequency band (0.01-0.08Hz or 0.01-0.15Hz), ignoring the changes across different frequency bands. Here, 24 patients with IGE characterized by juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and 24 matched healthy controls were studied using a data-driven frequency decomposition approach and a sliding window approach. The RSN dynamics, including intra-RSN dynamics and inter-RSN dynamics, was further calculated to investigate dynamic FC changes within and between RSNs in JME patients in each decomposed frequency band. Compared to healthy controls, JME patients not only showed frequency-dependent decrease in intra-RSN dynamics within multiple RSNs but also exhibited fluctuant alterations in inter-RSN dynamics among several RSNs over different frequency bands especially in the ventral/dorsal attention network and the subcortical network. Additionally, the disease severity had significantly negative correlations with both intra-RSN dynamics within the subcortical network and inter-RSN dynamics between the subcortical network and the default network at the lower frequency band (0.0095-0.0195Hz). These results suggested that abnormal dynamic FC within and between RSNs in JME occurs at multiple frequency bands and the lower frequency band (0.0095-0.0195Hz) was probably more sensitive to JME-caused dynamic FC abnormalities. The frequency subdivision and selection are potentially helpful for detecting particular changes of dynamic FC in JME.

It also allows for the stimulation of deep brain structures important to memory, such as the hippocampus, that are difficult, if not impossible, to target non-invasively. Direct stimulation studies of these deep memory structures, though, have produced mixed results, with some reporting improvement, some impairment, and others, no consistent changes. Objective/hypothesis: We hypothesize that to modulate cognitive function using brain stimulation, it is essential to modulate connected nodes comprising a network, rather than just alter local activity. Methods: iEEG data collected while patients performed a spatiotemporal memory retrieval task were used to map frequency-specific, coherent oscillatory activity between different brain regions associated with successful memory retrieval. We used these to identify two target nodes that exhibited selectively stronger coupling for spatial vs. temporal retrieval. In a subsequent session, electrical stimulation - theta-bursts with a fixed phase-lag (0 degrees or 180 degrees) - was applied to the two target regions while patients performed spatiotemporal retrieval. Results: Stimulation selectively impaired spatial retrieval while not affecting temporal retrieval, and this selective impairment was associated with theta decoupling of the spatial retrieval network. Conclusion: These findings suggest that stimulating tightly connected nodes in a functional network at the appropriate phase-lag may effectively modulate the network function, and while in this case it impaired memory processes, it sets a foundation for further network-based perturbation studies.

These EEG differences were obtained in the course of performing tasks of the divergent type that are associated with the cognitive style of "impulsivity-reflexivity", which in its turn is based on the ability of an individual to make quick or slow decisions. It was established that in males, who are reflexive, the level of spatial synchronization was higher than the one of impulsive men in the Delta-, theta-, and beta-frequency bands while performing the divergent task. And this was mainly achieved due to closer long-distance connections of the frontal areas of the cerebral cortex with occipital, temporal and parietal areas.

Methods: We applied nonlinear methods, the error reduction ratio (ERR) causality test and cross-frequency analysis, with a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model, to electroencephalograms (EEGs) from CAE, selected with stringent electro-clinical criteria (17 cases, 42 absences). We analysed the pre-ictal and ictal strength of association between homologous and heterologous EEG derivations and estimated the direction of synchronisation and corresponding time lags. Results: A frontal/fronto-central onset of the absences is detected in 13 of the 17 cases with the highest ictal strength of association between homologous frontal followed by centro-temporal and fronto-central areas. Delays consistently in excess of 4 ms occur at the very onset between these regions, swiftly followed by the emergence of "isochronous" (0-2 ms) synchronisation but dynamic time lag changes occur during SW discharges. Conclusions: In absences an initial cortico-cortical spread leads to dynamic lag changes to include periods of isochronous interhemispheric synchronisation, which we hypothesize is mediated by the thalamus.

Methods: The Higuchi's Fractal Dimension (FD) was analyzed from 64-channels EEG signals in five physiological frequency bands and every channel separately. Changes of FD were analyzed before and after 1st, 10th, and 20th session of rTMS. Results: Some differences in response to the rTMS therapy was found across individual groups. In MDD responders, FD decreased in all bands after longer stimulation (20th session). Whereas, in BP non-responders, FD decreased after 1st session in all bands as well as after 10th session in lower frequencies (delta and theta). In MDD non-responders and BP responders FD increased at the beginning of the therapy (1st and 10th session, respectively), but the final FD value did not changed in comparison to the initial FD value, except the FD decrease for theta band in BP responders. Comparison between groups showed a higher FD in MDD responders than in MDD non-responders in every band before as well as after stimulation. In contrast to MDD patients, FD was lower in BP responders than in BP non-responders in higher frequency bands (alpha, beta, and gamma) in both conditions as well as in lower frequency bands (delta and theta) after stimulation. Comparing both groups of responders, FD was lower in MDD than in BP in every band, except alpha. In case of non-responders, FD was higher in BP than in MDD in all bands in both conditions. Conclusion: The results showed that FD may be useful marker for evaluation of the rTMS effectiveness and the therapy progress as well as for group differentiation between MDD and BP or between responders and non-responders. The changes of FD under the influence of rTMS allow to unambiguously conclude whether the effect of stimulation is positive or negative as well as allow to evaluate an optimal time of rTMS.

J	Schindler, K				Schindler, Kaspar			Analyses of Intracranial EEG Networks in Focal Epilepsies	KLINISCHE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE			German	Article						Epilepsy; networks; EEG; emergence; complex systems	EPILEPTOGENIC ZONE; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN	Network theory has become a powerful tool to assess complex systems in our highly interconnected world. The methods involved have also successfully been applied to uncover the network nature of epilepsies. Here a non-technical introduction into the concepts of network science is given. Using intracranial EEG signals it is demonstrated step by step how functional networks may be derived and how these networks can be visualized and analysed. The fundamental notions of "nodes", "links" and "node centrality" are explained and an experimentally testable hypothetical model of network seizure dynamics is presented. This model suggests that the hierarchical and modular network structure of brains may predispose local neuro-glial activity to become uncontrolled, which might explain the surprisingly high prevalence of epilepsies. Network neuroscience can be expected to help develop better diagnostics and therapeutics for epilepsy in the near future.

In the lack of an objective method to assess this moment, the development of a new methodology is needed. In this observational study, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures that were associated with the moment of LOC are examined as a starting point, so as to create a robust model for tracking the dynamic changes between conscious and unconscious states. The data from 12 patients under general anesthesia for neurosurgical procedures with remifentanil and propofol, are used is this study. Multitaper spectrograms were computed to observe the dynamics of EEG oscillations before and after LOC. At LOC, a decrease in gamma power and an increase in delta and alpha bands were identified.

Methods: In order to accurately replicate HFOs we developed virtual-brain/virtual-electrode simulation environment combining novel neurophysiological models of neuronal populations with biophysical models for the source/sensor relationship. Both (patho) physiological mechanisms (synaptic transmission, depolarizing GABA(A) effect, hyperexcitability) and physical factors (geometry of extended cortical sources, size and position of electrodes) were taken into account. Simulated HFOs were compared to real HFOs extracted from intracerebral recordings of 2 patients. Results: Our results revealed that HFO pathological activity is being generated by feed-forward activation of cortical interneurons that produce fast depolarizing GABAergic post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) onto pyramidal cells. Out of phase patterns of depolarizing GABAergic PSPs explained the shape, entropy and spatiotemporal features of real human HFOs. Conclusions: The terminology "high-frequency oscillation" (HFO) might be misleading as the fast ripple component (200-600 Hz) is more likely a "high-frequency activity" (HFA), the origin of which is independent from any oscillatory process. Significance: New insights regarding the origins and observability of HFOs along depth-EEG electrodes were gained in terms of spatial extent and 3D geometry of neuronal sources.

Sharing behavior is an essential part of maintaining these dynamic networks. However, the precise neural factors that could be related to sharing behavior in online communities remain unclear. In this study, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations of human subjects while they were watching short videos. The subjects were later asked to evaluate the videos based on how much they liked them and whether they would share them. We found that, at the population level, subjects watching videos that would not be shared had higher power spectral density (PSD) amplitudes in the theta band (4-8 Hz), primarily over the frontal and parietal sites of the right hemisphere, than subjects watching videos that would be shared. Previous studies have associated task disengagement with an increase in scalp-wide theta activation, which can be interpreted as a mind-wandering effect. This might suggest that the decision to not share the video may lead to a more automatic/effortless neural pattern. We also found that watching videos that would be shared was associated with lower PSD amplitudes in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) over the central and right frontal sites, and with more negative scores of frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) index scores. These results may be related to previous work linking right-sided frontal EEG asymmetry to the pursuit of social conformity and avoidance of negative outcomes, such as social isolation. Finally, using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, we show that these EEG parameters and preference rating scores can be used to improve the predictability of sharing information behavior. The information sharing-related EEG pattern described here could therefore improve our understanding of the neural markers associated with sharing behavior and contribute to studies about stimuli propagation.

Suitable time-frequency (TF) and time-scale (TS) representations of such signals are reviewed for these purposes, and, the relationships between such TF and TS signal transformations is discussed. Both linear (atomic) decompositions and quadratic distributions are considered as well as other related methods such as fractional Fourier transform, polynomial Wigner-Ville distributions and time-varying order spectra. Current state-of-the-art methods are reviewed, and new results are presented including extensions of existing methods. Machine learning methodologies using TF/TS features can result in the design of systems that improve the classification of non-stationary signals. Using selected TF distributions (TFDs) and TS distributions (TSDs), the extraction of such TF/TS features is demonstrated on multi-channel recordings using channel fusion or feature fusion approaches. Extending the findings of previous studies, a TF/TS feature set is formed by including two complementary categories: signal related features and image features. The design of high-resolution TF/TS algorithms is then refined to account for issues of accuracy and robustness. Then, the desired TF/TS features are selected using different feature selection algorithms and compared with respect to the classification performance. Finally, other features from related methods are added, and comparisons performed. Improvements of up to 5% are obtained when using the chosen feature set after wrapper feature selection with channel feature fusion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We wanted to assess if EEG profiles varied across different meditation techniques, proficiency levels and experience of the practitioners. We examined EEG dynamics in Vipassana meditators (Novice, Senior meditators and Teachers) while they engaged in their traditional meditation practice (concentration, mindfulness and loving kindness in a structured manner) as taught by S.N. Goenka. Seniors and Teachers (vs Novices) showed trait increases in delta (1-4 Hz), theta-alpha (6-10 Hz) and low-gamma power (30-40 Hz) at baseline rest; state-trait increases in low-alpha (8-10 Hz) and low-gamma power during concentrative and mindfulness meditation; and theta-alpha and low-gamma power during loving-kindness meditation. Permutation entropy and Higuchi fractal dimension measures further dissociated high proficiency from duration of experience as only Teachers showed consistent increase in network complexity from baseline rest and state transitions between the different meditation states.

Based on our previous findings indicating exhaustive exercise induces an increase of the post-exercise iAPF, we scrutinized the influence of exercise on post-exercise alpha power by comparing fixed and iAPF-adjusted alpha frequency bands. Resting EEG was recorded from 13 scalp locations in nine subjects before, immediately after as well as ten minutes following an exhaustive exercise protocol on a cycle ergometer. Lower and upper band alpha power was calculated for fixed and iAPF-adjusted frequency bands. Post-exercise lower alpha power increased in both fixed and individually defined bands while a higher upper alpha power was only observed in the fixed frequency band condition. Further, the increase in iAPF was positively related to the changes in fixed-band upper alpha power. It is concluded that lower alpha power is significantly increased following exhaustive exercise whereas the results for upper alpha power are substantially influenced by the method of frequency band definition. Therefore, caution is indicated when analyzing and interpreting exercise-induced changes in alpha power.

These events, however, are too frequent, and occur on too small a time scale to be identified quickly or reliably by human reviewers. Many of the deficiencies of the HFO detection algorithms published to date are addressed by the CS algorithm presented here. New Method: The algorithm employs novel methods for: 1) normalization; 2) storage of parameters to model human expertise; 3) differentiating highly localized oscillations from filtering phenomena; and 4) defining temporal extents of detected events. Results: Receiver-operator characteristic curves demonstrate very low false positive rates with concomitantly high true positive rates over a large range of detector thresholds. The temporal resolution is shown to be +/-similar to 5 ms for event boundaries. Computational efficiency is sufficient for use in a clinical setting. Comparison with existing methods: The algorithm performance is directly compared to two established algorithms by Staba (2002) and Gardner (2007). Comparison with all published algorithms is beyond the scope of this work, but the features of all are discussed. All code and example data sets are freely available. Conclusions: The algorithm is shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for HFOs, be robust to common forms of artifact in EEG, and have performance adequate for use in a clinical setting.

Previous study of our group showed that a local (i.e. parietal) anticipatory EEG marker (i.e. the event related de-synchronization of the alpha rhythms; ERD) is selectively affected when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is delivered over crucial nodes belonging to well-known human networks involved in different cognitive domains. Here, we investigated whether such distinction is also present in the whole brain activity as seen through the pre-stimulus microstate's topography, representing a global and reference-free measure of the neural activity. First, when subjects received a pseudo-stimulation (sham), we found two distinct pre-stimulus topographies during perceptual or memory task, respectively. Second, we reported that, during the visuo-spatial attention task, stimulation of left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but not left angular gyrus (AG), significantly modifies the topography observed in the Sham condition. Conversely, stimulation of AG, but not IPS, changes the topography observed in the Sham condition during a semantic memory task. These findings provide the first causal evidence for the task and region specificity of the pre-stimulus EEG microstates, thus proposing this EEG index as of particular interest for the assessment of the period that precedes a predictable event.

It is characterized by a common oscillatory pattern in which resting-state alpha activity is replaced by cross-frequency coupling of low- and high-frequency oscillations. We undertook a data-driven approach using support vector machine learning for analyzing resting-state electroencephalography oscillatory patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain, tinnitus, and depression. We show a spectrally equivalent but spatially distinct form of TCD that depends on the specific disorder. However, we also identify brain areas that are common to the pathology of Parkinson's disease, pain, tinnitus, and depression. This study therefore supports the validity of TCD as an oscillatory mechanism underlying diverse neurological disorders.

To investigate whether face-specific perceptual processes are influenced in schizophrenia patients, both face detection and configural analysis were assessed in normal individuals and schizophrenia patients by recording electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Here, a face processing model was built based on the frequency oscillations, and the evoked power (theta, alpha, and beta bands) and the induced power (gamma bands) were recorded while the subjects passively viewed face and nonface images presented in upright and inverted orientations. The healthy adults showed a significant face-specific effect in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands, and an inversion effect was observed in the gamma band in the occipital lobe and right temporal lobe. Importantly, the schizophrenia patients showed face-specific deficits in the low-frequency beta and gamma bands, and the face inversion effect in the gamma band was absent from the occipital lobe. All these results revealed face-specific processing in patients due to the disorder of high-frequency EEG, providing additional evidence to enrich future studies investigating neural mechanisms and serving as a marked diagnostic basis.

While this process is established in spoken-language bilinguals, there is less known about its occurrence in deaf bilinguals who know signed and spoken languages. Since sign language uses motion and space to convey linguistic content, it is possible that action simulation in the brain's sensorimotor system plays a role in this process. We recorded EEG from deaf participants fluent in ASL as they read individual English words and found significant differences in alpha and beta EEG at central electrode sites during the reading of English words whose ASL translations use two hands, compared to English words whose ASL translations use one hand. Hearing non-signers did not show any differences between conditions. These results demonstrate the involvement of the sensorimotor system in cross linguistic, cross-modal translation, and suggest that covert action simulation processes are involved when deaf signers read.

Here, we describe a new mechanism for large-scale coordination in the human brain: traveling waves of theta and alpha oscillations. Examining direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients performing a memory task, we found contiguous clusters of cortex in individual patients with oscillations at specific frequencies within 2 to 15 Hz. These oscillatory clusters displayed spatial phase gradients, indicating that they formed traveling waves that propagated at similar to 0.25-0.75 m/s. Traveling waves were relevant behaviorally because their propagation correlated with task events and was more consistent when subjects performed the task well. Human traveling theta and alpha waves can be modeled by a network of coupled oscillators because the direction of wave propagation correlated with the spatial orientation of local frequency gradients. Our findings suggest that oscillations support brain connectivity by organizing neural processes across space and time.

The present simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging-electroencephalography study examines neural mechanisms of response inhibition under the influence of a monetary reward or punishment by implementing a modified stop-signal task in a virtual battlefield scenario. The participants were instructed to play as snipers who open fire at a terrorist target but withhold shooting in the presence of a hostage. The participants performed the task under three different feedback conditions in counterbalanced order: a reward condition where each successfully withheld response added a bonus (i.e., positive feedback) to the startup credit, a punishment condition where each failure in stopping deduced a penalty (i.e., negative feedback), and a no-feedback condition where response outcome had no consequences and served as a control setting. Behaviorally both reward and punishment conditions led to significantly down-regulated inhibitory function in terms of the critical stop-signal delay. As for the neuroimaging results, increased activities were found for the no-feedback condition in regions previously reported to be associated with response inhibition, including the right inferior frontal gyrus and the pre-supplementary motor area. Moreover, higher activation of the lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and inferior parietal lobule were found in the reward condition, while stronger activation of the precuneus gyrus was found in the punishment condition. The positive feedback was also associated with stronger changes of delta, theta, and alpha synchronization in the PCG than were the negative or no-feedback conditions. These findings depicted the intertwining relationship between response inhibition and motivation networks.

Electroencephalography Source Functional Connectivity Reveals Abnormal High-Frequency Communication Among Large-Scale Functional Networks in Depression	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Default mode network; eLORETA; Frontoparietal network; Lagged phase synchronization; Major depressive disorder; Resting-state functional connectivity	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; EEG POWER SPECTRA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; TOP-DOWN; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; LOCALIZATION; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	BACKGROUND: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of resting-state functional connectivity have shown that major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by increased connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and the frontoparietal network (FPN). However, much remains unknown about abnormalities in higher frequency (>1 Hz) synchronization. Findings of abnormal synchronization in specific frequencies would contribute to a better understanding of the potential neurophysiological origins of disrupted functional connectivity in MDD. METHODS: We used the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography to compare the spectral properties of resting-state functional connectivity in individuals with MDD (n = 65) with healthy control subjects (n = 79) and examined the extent to which connectivity disturbances were evident in a third sample of individuals in remission from depression (n = 30). Exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography was used to compute intracortical activity from regions within the DMN and FPN, and functional connectivity was computed using lagged phase synchronization. RESULTS: Compared to control subjects, the MDD group showed greater within-DMN beta 2 band (18.5-21 Hz) connectivity and greater beta 1 band (12.5-18 Hz) connectivity between the DMN and FPN. This hyperconnectivity was not observed in the remitted MDD group. However, greater beta 1 band DMN-FPN connectivity was associated with more frequent depressive episodes since first depression onset, even after controlling for current symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings extend our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of abnormal resting-state functional connectivity in MDD and indicate that elevations in high-frequency DMN-FPN connectivity may be a neural marker linked to a more recurrent illness course.

J	Cardenas, VA; Price, M; Fein, G				Cardenas, Valerie A.; Price, Mathew; Fein, George			EEG coherence related to fMRI resting state synchrony in long-term abstinent alcoholics	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Independent components analysis; Resting state; EEG; fMRI; Networks	DECISION-MAKING; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; USE DISORDERS; SUBSTANCE USE; FREQUENCY; ACTIVATION; DRINKERS	Recent work suggests that faulty co-activation or synchrony of multiple brain regions comprising "networks," or an imbalance between opposing brain networks, is important in alcoholism. Previous studies showed higher fMRI resting state synchrony (RSS) within the executive control (inhibitory control and emotion regulation) networks and lower RSS within the appetitive drive network in long-term (multi-year) abstinent alcoholics (LTAA) vs. non substance abusing controls (NSAC). Our goal was to identify EEG networks that are correlated with the appetitive drive and executive function networks identified with fMRI in our previous alcohol studies. We used parallel ICA for multimodal data fusion for the 20 LTAA and 21 NSAC that had both usable fMRI and 64-channel EEG data. Our major result was that parallel ICA identified a pair of components that significantly separated NSAC from LTAA and were correlated with each other. Examination of the resting-state fMRI seed-correlation map component showed higher bilateral nucleus accumbens seed-correlation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and lower seed-correlation in the thalamus. This single component thus encompassed both the executive control and appetitive drive networks, consistent with our previous work. The correlated EEG coherence component showed mostly higher theta and alpha coherence in LTAA compared to NSAC, and lower gamma coherence in LTAA compared to NSAC. The EEG theta and alpha coherence results suggest enhanced top-down control in LTAA and the gamma coherence results suggest impaired appetitive drive in LTAA. Our results support the notion that fMRI RSS is reflected in spontaneous EEG, even when the EEG and fMRI are not obtained simultaneously.

Cortical networks show a slow oscillation when the excitatory inputs are reduced (during slow wave sleep, anesthesia), or absent (in vitro preparations). It was recently shown that a homeostatic response to electrical stimulation can be induced in cortical cultures. Here we used cortical cultures grown on microelectrode arrays and stimulated them with a cocktail of waking neuromodulators. We found that recovery from stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent homeostatic response. Specifically, the inter-burst intervals decreased, the burst duration increased, the network showed higher cross-correlation and strong phasic synchronized burst activity. Spectral power below <1.75 Hz significantly increased and the increase was related to steeper slopes of bursts. Computer simulation suggested that a small number of clustered neurons could potently drive the behavior of the network both at baseline and during recovery. Thus, this in vitro model appears valuable for dissecting network mechanisms of sleep homeostasis.

Integrated information in the EEG of preterm infants increases with family nurture intervention, age, and conscious state	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; EMERGENCE; RESPONSES; DENSITY; POWER	A putative quantifier of consciousness, integrated information, was applied to preterm infant EEG data after novel pre-processing. Integrated information had a non-random structure as a function of the time lag over which it was computed. For most lags, it increased with age in early life, but even more so in infants exposed to Family Nurture Intervention (FNI), providing further evidence that FNI advances brain maturation in preterm infants. Also, it discriminated between conscious states (awake, REM sleep, NREM sleep), providing empirical support for the Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness in human infants.

Surprisingly, there is no combined EEG-DTI study directly addressing the role of functional and structural connectivity in the same group of subjects. Accordingly, nothing is known about the relationship between functional connectivity such as gamma-band synchrony, structural integrity of the interhemispheric auditory pathways (IAPs) and language lateralization as well as whether the gamma-band synchrony is configured on the backbone of IAPs. By applying multimodal imaging of 64-channel EEG and DTI tractography, we investigated in 27 healthy volunteers the functional gamma-band synchrony between either bilateral primary or secondary auditory cortices from eLORETA source-estimation during dichotic listening, as well as the correspondent IAPs from which fractional anisotropy (FA) values were extracted. Correlation and regression analyses revealed highest values for gamma-band synchrony, followed by FA for secondary auditory cortices, which were both significantly related to a reduced language lateralization. There was no such association between the white-matter microstructure and gamma-band synchrony, suggesting that structural connectivity might also be relevant for other (minor) aspects of information transfer in addition to gamma-band synchrony, which are not detected in the present coupling analyses. The combination of multimodal EEG-DTI imaging provides converging evidence of neural correlates by showing that both stronger pathways and increased gamma-band synchrony within one cohort of subjects are related to a reduced leftward-lateralization for language.

To investigate whether brain activity recorded via multi-channel EEG is predictive of memory formation, we perform statistical analysis followed by single-trial classification: first by using linear discriminant analysis, and then with convolutional neural networks. Our preliminary results confirm previous neurophysiological findings, that above-chance prediction of vocabulary memory formation is possible in both LDA and deep neural networks.

The paper first describes a human physiology based time-frequency (TF) representation (HPTF) using Mel filterbanks. It is then used to improve a noise reduction algorithm that does not require any a priori information about the signal of interest and the noise. This algorithm is efficiently implemented using an original wavelet shrinkage method. The overall method results in an original TF denoising procedure that yields a denoised HPTF (DHPTF). From this representation, one can reconstruct a denoised time-domain signal and therefore define a new improved noise reduction algorithm, whose performance is evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The performance assessment uses several criteria: (1) signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), (2) segmental SNR (SSNR) and (3) mean square error (MSE). The results indicate an improvement of up to 4.72 dB with respect to (w.r.t.) SNR, 2.79 dB w.r.t. SSNR and 4.72 dB w.r.t. MSE for a speech database signals corrupted with four different noises. In addition, other applications such as EEG signal enhancement show promising results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Most studies examining human memory, however, have largely focused on the neural correlates of successful memory formation within individuals, rather than the differences among them. As such, what gives rise to this variability is poorly understood. Here, we examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings captured from 43 participants (23 male) implanted with subdural electrodes for seizure monitoring as they performed a paired-associates verbal memory task. We identified three separate but related signatures of neural activity that tracked differences in successful memory formation across individuals. High-performing individuals consistently exhibited less broadband power, flatter power spectral density slopes, and greater complexity in their iEEG signals. Furthermore, within individuals across three separate time scales ranging from seconds to days, successful recall was positively associated with these same metrics. Our data therefore suggest that memory ability across individuals can be indexed by increased neural signal complexity.

By applying graph theory indexes of brain segregation - such as modularity and transitivity - to functional connectivity data derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, we further studied pre- (baseline) versus post-task brain network architecture to understand whether motor learning induces changes in functional brain connectivity. The results showed that, after the training session with measurable learning, transitivity increased in the alpha1 EEG frequency band and modularity increased in the theta band and decreased in the gamma band, suggesting that brain segregation is modulated by the cognitive task. Furthermore, it was observed that theta modularity at the baseline negatively correlated with the performance improvement; namely, the lower this connectivity index at the baseline pre- task period, the higher the improvement of performance with training. The present results show that brain segregation is modulated by the cognitive task and that it is possible to predict performance by the study of pre- task EEG rhythm connectivity parameters.

Moreover, oscillations related to pain perception and modulation change dynamically over time. Fluctuations in these neural oscillations reflect the dynamic neural states of the nucleus. In this study, an approach to classifying the synchronization level was developed to dynamically identify the neural states. An oscillation extraction model based on windowed wavelet packet transform was designed to characterize the activity level of oscillations. The wavelet packet coefficients sparsely represented the activity level of theta and alpha oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs). Then, a state discrimination model was designed to calculate an adaptive threshold to determine the activity level of oscillations. Finally, the neural state was represented by the activity levels of both theta and alpha oscillations. The relationship between neural states and pain relief was further evaluated. The performance of the state identification approach achieved sensitivity and specificity beyond 80% in simulation signals. Neural states of the PVAG and VPL were dynamically identified from LFPs of neuropathic pain patients. The occurrence of neural states based on theta and alpha oscillations were correlated to the degree of pain relief by deep brain stimulation. In the PVAG LFPs, the occurrence of the state with high activity levels of theta oscillations independent of alpha and the state with low-level alpha and high-level theta oscillations were significantly correlated with pain relief by deep brain stimulation. This study provides a reliable approach to identifying the dynamic neural states in LFPs with a low signal-to-noise ratio by using sparse representation based on wavelet packet transform. Furthermore, it may advance closed-loop deep brain stimulation based on neural states integrating multiple neural oscillations.

J	Whitehead, K; Meek, J; Fabrizi, L				Whitehead, Kimberley; Meek, Judith; Fabrizi, Lorenzo			Developmental trajectory of movement-related cortical oscillations during active sleep in a cross-sectional cohort of pre-term and full-term human infants	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EARLY MOTOR-ACTIVITY; SPINDLE BURSTS; SUBPLATE NEURONS; REM-SLEEP; BRAIN; NETWORKS; EEG; SUPPRESSION; EMERGENCE; BEHAVIOR	In neonatal animal models, isolated limb movements during active sleep provide input to immature somatomotor cortex necessary for its development and are somatotopically encoded by alpha-beta oscillations as late as the equivalent of human full-term. Limb movements elicit similar neural patterns in very pre-term human infants (average 30 corrected gestational weeks), suggesting an analogous role in humans, but it is unknown until when they subserve this function. In a cohort of 19 neonates (31-42 corrected gestational weeks) we showed that isolated hand movements during active sleep continue to induce these same somatotopically distributed oscillations well into the perinatal period, but that these oscillations decline towards full-term and fully disappear at 41 corrected gestational weeks (equivalent to the end of gestation). We also showed that these highly localised alpha-beta oscillations are associated with an increase in delta oscillations which extends to the frontal area and does not decline with age. These results suggest that isolated limb movements during active sleep could have an important role in experience-dependent somatomotor development up until normal birth in humans.

Consistency of Long-Term Subdural Electrocorticography in Humans	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biomedical engineering; biomedical signal processing; brain-computer interfaces; electroencephalography; neural prosthesis	INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP; PREDICTION; RECORDINGS; EPILEPSY; SIGNALS; ARM	Objective: Subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) can provide a robust control signal for a brain-computer interface (BCI). However, the long-term recording properties of ECoG are poorly understood as most ECoG studies in the BCI field have only used signals recorded for less than 28 days. We assessed human ECoG recordings over durations of many months to investigate changes to recording quality that occur with long-term implantation. Methods: We examined changes in signal properties over time from 15 ambulatory humans who had continuous subdural ECoG monitoring for 184-766 days. Results: Individual electrodes demonstrated varying changes in frequency power characteristics over time within individual patients and between patients. Group level analyses demonstrated that there were only small changes in effective signal bandwidth and spectral band power across months. High-gamma signals could be recorded throughout the study, though there was a decline in signal power for some electrodes. Conclusion: ECoG-based BCI systems can robustly record high-frequency activity over multiple years, albeit with marked intersubject variability. Significance: Group level results demonstrated that ECoG is a promising modality for long-term BCI and neural prosthesis applications.

Across development, the maturation of APAs is characterized by an accurate adjustment of the timing parameters of electromyographic (EMG) response. The study aimed at investigating the maturation of cortical oscillations involved in the improvement of APAs efficiency. Thirty-six healthy participants (8-16 yr) performed the bimanual load-lifting task in which subjects are instructed to lift a load, placed on the left forearm, with the right hand. EMG data were acquired over the biceps brachii on the postural arm to the determine EMG response onset. Electro-encephalographic signals were analyzed in the time-frequency domain by convolution with complex Gaussian Morlet wavelets. Electrophysiological signature of APAs in children and adolescents consisted of a mu-rhythm desynchronization over the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the postural ann. Across development, the mu-rhythm desynchronization was characterized by a progressive shift forward of the onset of the desynchronization, lower amplitude, and velocity. These changes occurred along with an alteration of the timing of the EMG response, as shown by an earlier onset of the flexor inhibition with increasing age. The maturational changes in the Mu-oscillations might sustain the development of APAs. A possible role of the Mu-oscillation in the generation of postural command is discussed. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Across development, our study showed a progressive shift forward of the parameters of the mu-rhythm desynchronization. These changes occurred along with an alteration of the timing parameters of the electromyographic response. as shown by an earlier onset of the flexor inhibition with increasing age. The progressive development of APAs during childhood and adolescence might therefore be sustained by maturational electrophysiological changes that include mu-rhythm oscillation modifications in the postural sensorimotor cortex.

Shortest path based network analysis to characterize cognitive load states of human brain using EEG based functional brain networks	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; functional brain networks; cognition; graph theory; shortest paths; brain's electrical activity	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CONNECTIVITY; TREES	Understanding and analyzing the dynamic interactions among millions of spatially distributed and functionally connected regions in the human brain constituting a massively parallel communication system is one of the major challenges in computational neuroscience. Many studies in the recent past have employed graph theory to efficiently model, quantitatively analyze, and understand the brain's electrical activity. Since, the human brain is believed to broadcast information with reduced material and metabolic costs, identifying various brain regions in the shortest pathways of information dissemination becomes essential to understand the intricacies of brain function. This paper proposes a graph theoretic approach using the concept of shortest communication paths between various brain regions (electrode sites) to identify the significant communication pathways of information exchange between various nodes in the functional brain networks constructed from multi-channel electroencephalograph data. A special weighted network called the Shortest Path Network is constructed from a functional brain network where the edge weight is computed as the sum of frequency of occurrence of that edge in all possible shortest paths between every pair of electrodes. The weighted Shortest Path Networks thus constructed portray information on the number of times the edges are used in information propagation during different cognitive states. This network is further analyzed by computing the influential communication paths to characterize the information dissemination among brain regions during different cognitive load conditions. The experimental results presented demonstrate the efficacy of this novel graph theoretic approach in identifying, quantifying, and comparing the significant shortest pathways of information exchange during mild and heavy cognitive load conditions. Analysis also suggests that future research should consider the biological inferences of the ability of the human brain to use reduced material and metabolic cost during the instantaneous transmission of information.

The singular value decomposition and the K-medoids clustering algorithm are employed to extract effective features from the redundant matrix of wavelet coefficients. A distinctive feature is to use the singular values to detect HFOs with the consideration that the singular values of HFOs are generally significantly higher than those of normal case. Based on the half-maximum method, the localization of SOZs are achieved by using the characteristics of HFOs. Comparisons show that our method provides a higher sensitivity and specificity than two existing methods do.

Previous studies assert that the slow-oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10 -12 Hz) and followed by fast spindles (12-16 Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (n = 10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (n = 3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TBs) centered at 5-8 Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high-frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of elect rophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep.

Cortical dynamics of emotional autobiographical memory retrieval differ between women and men	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Autobiographical memory; Oscillations; Alpha; Narratives; Coherence; Gender	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CHILDRENS MEMORY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SELF; THETA	Retrieval of autobiographical memories entails periods of search, access, and elaboration. Women's reports of their memories feature more detail and emotional content relative to men's. A key question is how these gender differences relate to unfolding changes in cortical activity during retrieval. We recorded EEG activity from 32 scalp electrodes as women and men were cued to retrieve positive, negative, and neutral autobiographical memories. Alpha (9-12 Hz) oscillations were prominent at all EEG channels. Alpha coherence between channels was calculated as a measure of ms-level cortical synchrony. Across participants and memory types, a frontal cluster showed pronounced decreases in coherence with other channels during the first second of autobiographical retrieval. In the following second, a left parietal-centered cluster showed increased coherence with other channels. This effect strengthened and spread in the third second of retrieval, perhaps reflecting trace elaboration and/or evaluation of the memory. Although women and men gave similar subjective ratings of their memories, the second-by-second pattern of alpha coherence during autobiographical retrieval differed by gender and memory type. Specifically, women sustained the increased pattern of left-parietal coherence throughout the trial, whereas for men, alpha coherence in this cluster returned to baseline by second two for neutral memories and by second three for emotional memories. Examination of the temporal dynamics of cortical oscillations provides novel insight into autobiographical memory retrieval processes and to gendered retrieval in particular, suggesting that women may persist with elaboration and/or evaluation to a greater extent than men.

Voice-selective prediction alterations in nonclinical voice hearers	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; POTENTIAL COMPONENT; N1 WAVE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SPEECH; HALLUCINATIONS; MODELS; MISATTRIBUTION; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION	Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a cardinal symptom of psychosis but also occur in 6-13% of the general population. Voice perception is thought to engage an internal forward model that generates predictions, preparing the auditory cortex for upcoming sensory feedback. Impaired processing of sensory feedback in vocalization seems to underlie the experience of AVH in psychosis, but whether this is the case in nonclinical voice hearers remains unclear. The current study used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether and how hallucination predisposition (HP) modulates the internal forward model in response to self-initiated tones and self-voices. Participants varying in HP (based on the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale) listened to self-generated and externally generated tones or self-voices. HP did not affect responses to self vs. externally generated tones. However, HP altered the processing of the self-generated voice: increased HP was associated with increased pre-stimulus alpha power and increased N1 response to the self-generated voice. HP did not affect the P2 response to voices. These findings confirm that both prediction and comparison of predicted and perceived feedback to a self-generated voice are altered in individuals with AVH predisposition. Specific alterations in the processing of self-generated vocalizations may establish a core feature of the psychosis continuum.

Visuomotor Prediction Errors Modulate EEG Activity Over Parietal Cortex	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; SENSORY PREDICTION; MOTOR CONTROL; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; EXPLICIT STRATEGY; CEREBELLAR INPUTS; PRISM ADAPTATION	The parietal cortex is thought to be involved in visuomotor adaptation, yet it remains unclear whether it is specifically modulated by visuomotor prediction errors (i.e. PEs; mismatch between the predicted and actual visual consequences of the movement). One reason for this is that PEs tend to be associated with task errors, as well as changes in motor output and visual input, making them difficult to isolate. Here this issue is addressed using electroencephalography. A strategy (STR) condition, in which participants were instructed on how to counter a 45 degrees visuomotor rotation, was compared to a condition in which participants had adapted to the rotation (POST). Both conditions were matched for task errors and movement kinematics, with the only difference being the presence of PEs in STR. Results revealed strong parietal modulations in current source density and low theta (2-4 Hz) power shortly after movement onset in STR vs. POST, followed by increased alpha/low beta (8-18 Hz) power during much of the post-movement period. Given recent evidence showing that feedforward and feedback information is respectively carried by theta and alpha/beta oscillations, the observed power modulations may reflect the bottom-up propagation of PEs and the top-down revision of predictions.

Behavioural, neuroimaging and physiological investigations alternatively support either the RHH or the VH, but connectivity analyses have been hardly exploited in this field. In the present study, unilateral and bilateral presentations of positive (happy) and negative (angry) emotional faces were used during electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and estimation of effective connectivity was performed using the Directed Transfer Function, to estimate causal influences between brain regions (Granger causality approach). The results show a strong pattern of connectivity among different frontal areas (orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), attentional network (frontal eye field, intraparietal sulcus), visual occipital areas and temporal sites, mainly lateralized in the right hemisphere for all emotions, in accordance with the RHH. Moreover, a stronger pattern of connectivity is evident when stimuli are presented in accordance with the VH (positive/negative emotions to the left/right hemisphere, respectively). Finally, the results suggest a crucial role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a top-down regulation toward different areas involved in emotional processing. We conclude that the RHH and the VH are not mutually exclusive, but they seem to coexist during affective perception.

J	Das, P; Babadi, B				Das, Proloy; Babadi, Behtash			Dynamic Bayesian Multitaper Spectral Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Spectrogram analysis; non-stationary spectral analysis; multitaper analysis; state-space models; Bayesian filtering	NONSTATIONARY RANDOM-PROCESSES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; TIME-SERIES; DECOMPOSITION; SIGNALS; MODELS	Spectral analysis using overlapping sliding windows is among the most widely used techniques in analyzing non-stationary time series. Although sliding window analysis is convenient to implement, the resulting estimates are sensitive to the window length and overlap size. In addition, it undermines the dynamics of the time series as the estimate associated to each window uses only the data within. Finally, the overlap between consecutive windows hinders a precise statistical assessment. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by explicitly modeling the spectral dynamics through integrating the multitaper method with state-space models in a Bayesian estimation framework. The underlying states pertaining to the eigenspectral quantities arising in multitaper analysis are estimated using instances of the expectation-maximization algorithm, and are used to construct spectrograms and their respective confidence intervals. We propose two spectral estimators that are robust to noise and are able to capture spectral dynamics at high spectrotemporal resolution. We provide theoretical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off, which establishes performance gains over the standard overlapping multitaper method. We apply our algorithms to synthetic data as well as real data from human EEG and electric network frequency recordings, the results of which validate our theoretical analysis.

Amongst other functions, SWS plays a crucial role in the restorative capacity of sleep. Rhythmic acoustic stimulation (RAS) during SWS has been shown a cost-effective method to enhance slow wave activity. Slow wave activity can be expressed in a region-specific manner as a function of previous waking activity. However, it is unclear whether slow waves can be enhanced in a region-specific manner using RAS. We investigated the effects of unilaterally presented rhythmic acoustic sound patterns on sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations. Thirty-five participants received during SWS 12-second long rhythmic bursts of pink noise (at a rate of 1 Hz) that alternated with non-stimulated, silent periods, unilaterally delivered into one of the ears of the participants. As expected, RAS enhanced delta power, especially in its low-frequency components between 0.75 and 2.25 Hz. However, increased slow oscillatory activity was apparent in both hemispheres regardless of the side of the stimulation. The most robust increases in slow oscillatory activity appeared during the first 3-4 seconds of the stimulation period. Furthermore, a short-lasting increase in theta and sigma power was evidenced immediately after the first pulse of the stimulation sequences. Our findings indicate that lateralized RAS has a strong potential to globally enhance slow waves during daytime naps. The lack of localized effects suggests that slow waves are triggered by the ascending reticular system and not directly by specific auditory pathways.

Evoked Alpha Power is Reduced in Disconnected Consciousness During Sleep and Anesthesia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CORTICAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NORADRENALINE RELEASE; REM-SLEEP; KETAMINE; BRAIN; ACETYLCHOLINE; OSCILLATIONS; AREAS; STATE	Sleep and anesthesia entail alterations in conscious experience. Conscious experience may be absent (unconsciousness) or take the form of dreaming, a state in which sensory stimuli are not incorporated into conscious experience (disconnected consciousness). Recent work has identified features of cortical activity that distinguish conscious from unconscious states; however, less is known about how cortical activity differs between disconnected states and normal wakefulness. We employed transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) over parietal regions across states of anesthesia and sleep to assess whether evoked oscillatory activity differed in disconnected states. We hypothesized that alpha activity, which may regulate perception of sensory stimuli, is altered in the disconnected states of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and ketamine anesthesia. Compared to wakefulness, evoked alpha power (8-12 Hz) was decreased during disconnected consciousness. In contrast, in unconscious states of propofol anesthesia and non-REM (NREM) sleep, evoked low-gamma power (30-40 Hz) was decreased compared to wakefulness or states of disconnected consciousness. These findings were confirmed in subjects in which dream reports were obtained following serial awakenings from NREM sleep. By examining signatures of evoked cortical activity across conscious states, we identified novel evidence that suppression of evoked alpha activity may represent a promising marker of sensory disconnection.

In the resting state the brain shows clear signs of spatiotemporal organization, i.e. its activity is patterned in space and time. The spatial (topographical) aspect of such organization reveals itself in the presence of resting state networks while temporal aspect is given by specific dynamic patterns of electrical activity. In this paper it is discussed how studying spatiotemporal organization of the brain activity at rest contributes into our understanding of the relationship between the structural organization of the brain and its neuronal activity.

J	Miyauchi, E; Kawasaki, M				Miyauchi, Eri; Kawasaki, Masahiro			Electroencephalogram oscillations support the involvement of task-unrelated thoughts in the mechanism of boredom: A pilot study	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Boredom; EEG; Task-unrelated thought; Attentional failure; Theta; Alpha	SELF-REPORT SCALE; HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER ADHD; ADULT ADHD; ATTENTION; ALPHA; THETA	Boredom is a universal experience; however, the neural mechanisms underlying the phenomenon remain unclear. Previous research suggests that boredom is related to attentional failure and derives a possible explanation for the cognitive processes of boredom as a product of appraisals made about task-unrelated thoughts. There are little published data regarding proposed processes from neuroscientific perspectives. Therefore, the authors aimed to examine whether cognitive processes of boredom with task-unrelated thoughts followed by appraisals of them can be explained by examining oscillatory correlates. Electroencephalography was used to measure changes in neural oscillatory activity during subjective experiences of boredom or dislike in healthy subjects. Using this approach, temporal information of brain activity particular to the boredom experience was acquired. Additionally, the Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale was used to evaluate the effects of attentional deficits in the neural processing of boredom. Tonic increase in theta and transient increases in alpha activity were exhibited before the key press response for experiencing boredom; however, only tonic increases in theta amplitudes were boredom specific. The results of this pilot study suggest that the boredom experience is possibly associated with cognitive processes involved in task-unrelated thoughts, followed by their appraisals to be bored, mediated by alpha and theta activity.

Their role in regulation of attentional bias for stimuli of different threat-levels is unknown. Objectives: To provide the first relations between frontal TBR, trait anxiety and attentional bias to mildly and highly threatening stimuli at different processing-stages. Methods: Seventy-four healthy volunteers completed spontaneous EEG measurement, a self-report trait anxiety questionnaire and a dot-probe task with stimuli of different threat-level and 200 and 500 ms cue-target delays. Results: Participants with high TBR directed attention towards mildly threatening and avoided highly threatening pictures. Moreover, the most resilient participants, (low TBR and low trait anxiety) showed attention towards highly threatening stimuli. There were no effects of delay. Conclusions: These data confirm that executive control is crucial for the study of threat-related attentional bias and further support the notion that TBR is a marker of cognitive control over emotional information.

They have been regarded as one of the most promising biometric signals for person identification and verification. Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs), as EEG responses to visual stimulations at specific frequencies, could provide biometric information. However, current methods on SSVEP biometrics with hand-crafted power spectrum features and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) present only a limited range of individual distinctions and suffer relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we propose convolution neural networks (CNNs) with raw SSVEPs for person identification and verification without the need for any hand-crafted features. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between the performance of CNN with raw signals and a number of classical methods on two SSVEP datasets consisting of four and ten subjects, respectively. The proposed method achieved an averaged identification accuracy of 96.8% +/- 0.01, which outperformed the other methods by an average of 45.5% (p-value < 0.05). In addition, it achieved an averaged False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 1.53% +/- 0.01 and True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 97.09% +/- 0.02 for person verification. The averaged verification accuracy is 98.34% +/- 0.01, which outperformed the other methods by an average of 11.8% (p-value < 0.05). The proposed method based on deep learning offers opportunities to design a general-purpose EEG-based biometric system without the need for complex pre-processing and feature extraction techniques, making it feasible for real-time embedded systems.

Although, the animal literature has demonstrated robust improvement in cognitive functions, phase 1 trial results in humans have not been as clear-cut. We hypothesize that this may reflect differences in electrode location within the NBM, type and timing of stimulation, and the lack of a biomarker for determining the stimulation's effectiveness in real time. In this article, we propose a methodology to address these issues in an effort to effectively interface with this powerful cognitive nucleus for the treatment of dementia. Specifically, we propose the use of diffusion tensor imaging to identify the nucleus and its tracts, quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) to identify the physiologic response to stimulation during programming, and investigation of stimulation parameters that incorporate the phase locking and cross frequency coupling of gamma and slower oscillations characteristic of the NBM's innate physiology. We propose that modulating the baseline gamma burst stimulation frequency, specifically with a slower rhythm such as theta or delta will pose more effective coupling between NBM and different cortical regions involved in many learning processes.

Relevant Feature Selection from a Combination of Spectral-Temporal and Spatial Features for Classification of Motor Imagery EEG	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Stationary common spatial patterns; Motor imagery; Support vector machine; Linear discriminant analysis; Feature extraction; Feature selection	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MUTUAL INFORMATION; FILTER; COMMUNICATION; MOVEMENT; PATTERN; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE	This paper presents a novel algorithm (CVSTSCSP) for determining discriminative features from an optimal combination of temporal, spectral and spatial information for motor imagery brain computer interfaces. The proposed method involves four phases. In the first phase, EEG signal is segmented into overlapping time segments and bandpass filtered through frequency filter bank of variable size subbands. In the next phase, features are extracted from the segmented and filtered data using stationary common spatial pattern technique (SCSP) that can handle the non-stationarity and artifacts of EEG signal. The univariate feature selection method is used to obtain a relevant subset of features in the third phase. In the final phase, the classifier is used to build adecision model. In this paper, four univariate feature selection methods such as Euclidean distance, correlation, mutual information and Fisher discriminant ratio and two well-known classifiers (LDA and SVM) are investigated. The proposed method has been validated using the publicly available BCI competition IV dataset Ia and BCI Competition III dataset IVa. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of classification error. A reduction of 76.98%, 75.65%, 73.90% and 72.21% in classification error over both datasets and both classifiers can be observed using the proposed CVSTSCSP method in comparison to CSP, SBCSP, FBCSP and CVSCSP respectively.

This study addresses this issue by using imputation methods whereby whole data sets of a trial, or distinct electrodes, are not removed from the analysis of the EEG data but are replaced. We present different imputation strategies but use only two which are optimal for this particular study; predictive mean matching and data augmentation. The study addresses the as of yet unresolved question if the quality of derived brain functional networks is improved by imputation methods compared to traditional exclusion techniques which drop data, and will finally assesses the differences between the two imputation methods themselves used here. In this study, EEG data from a study evaluating dyslexia-specific therapy on a neurophysiological level were used to investigate imputation strategies in research of cortical interaction. Several recorded values were artificially declared as 'missing'. This enables the comparison of networks based on the complete data set without any missing values (pseudo ground truth) and those derived from imputation approaches in a realistic situation of disturbed data. Functional connectivity was quantified by time-variant partial directed coherence, providing a directed, temporally varying and frequency-selective connectivity measure. Based on the comparison between pseudo ground truth and networks of data with excluded missing values and data with imputed values, we found that any imputation strategy is preferable to the entire exclusion of data. The study also showed that the choice of the applied imputation algorithm impacts the resulting networks only marginally.

This may become an issue when complex tasks have to be performed like driving a car in a demanding traffic situation. On the other hand, older people are able to compensate for age-related deficits, e.g., by deploying extra mental effort and other compensatory strategies. The present study investigated the interplay of age, task workload, and mental effort using EEG measures and a proactive driving task, in which 16 younger and 16 older participants had to keep a virtual car on track on a curvy road. Total oscillatory power and relative power in Theta and Alpha bands were analyzed, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) to task-irrelevant regular and irregular sound stimuli. Steering variability and Theta power increased with increasing task load (i.e., with shaper bends of the road), while Alpha power decreased. This pattern of workload and mental effort was found in both age groups. However, only in the older group a relationship between steering variability and Theta power occurred: better steering performance was associated with higher Theta power, reflecting higher mental effort. Higher Theta power while driving was also associated with a stronger increase in reported subjective fatigue in the older group. In the younger group, lower steering variability came along with lower ERP responses to deviant sound stimuli, reflecting reduced processing of task-irrelevant environmental stimuli. In sum, better performance in proactive driving (i.e., more alert steering behavior) was associated with increased mental effort in the older group, and higher attentional focus on the task in the younger group, indicating age-specific strategies in the way younger and older drivers manage demanding (driving) tasks.

J	Suefusa, K; Tanaka, T				Suefusa, Kaori; Tanaka, Toshihisa			Asynchronous Brain-Computer Interfacing Based on Mixed-Coded Visual Stimuli	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces; asynchronous BCIs; steady-state visual evoked potentials; mixed frequency and phase coding	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; SSVEP; COMMUNICATION; SYSTEM; P300; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; COMPONENTS; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES	Objective: One of the challenges in the area of brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is to develop an asynchronous BCI or a self-paced BCI that detects whether a user intends to pass messages. This paper proposes a novel asynchronous BCI that uses mixed frequency and phase-coded visual stimuli, which can provide high-speed and accurate command entries. Methods: The mixed-coded visual stimuli were presented as flickers with a following blank interval to synchronize the recorder of electroencephalogram (EEG) with the stimuli, which was aimed to detect the phase in an asynchronous situation. For decoding from the measured EEG, multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) was efficiently exploited for recognizing the intentional state and the intending command. The proposed asynchronous BCI was tested on 11 healthy subjects. Results: The proposed decoder was capable of discriminating between the intentional control/noncontrol state and determining the command faster and more accurately than the contrast methods, achieving area under the curve of 0.9191 +/- 0.1206 and command recognition accuracy of 91.08 +/- 13.97% with data lengths of 3.0 s. Conclusion: The BCI based on mixed-coded visual stimuli was able to be implemented in an asynchronous manner, and the MCCAbased decoder outperformed the conventional ones in terms of discriminability of intentional states and command recognition accuracy. Significance: The present study showed that an asynchronous BCI can be implemented with mixed-coded visual stimuli for the first time, which enables a large increase in the number of choices/commands.

SPECTRAL COHERENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EEG THETA-1 AND THETA-2 ACTIVITY DURING COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN HUMANS	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						cognitive activity; EEG; theta-1 and theta-2 bands	OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; TASK	Changes in the power and coherence of the EEG theta-1 (4-6 Hz) and theta-2 (6-8 Hz) activity were studied in subjects (31 males, 18-21 years old) with different performance levels in logical tasks. EEG was recorded to the International 10-20 System from the occipital (02, 01), parietal (P4, P3), central (C4, C3), frontal (F4, F3), and temporal (T4, T3) leads. The achievement of better performance during the tests based on logical reasoning positively correlated with higher spectral power of theta-1 band potentials in the left cortical areas. The theta-1 band potential power increased during testing and compared to the previous period in the left occipital, parietal, central and temporal cortical areas. The simultaneous increasing in intrahemispheric coherence of theta-1 band potentials was observed in the left frontal and central areas, as well as in the left frontal and parietal cortical areas. The spectral power of theta-2 band potentials decreased during testing and compared to the previous period in the right central frontal and temporal cortical areas. The inter- and intrahemispheric coherence of the EEG theta-2 band potentials decreased during testing in the system of relationships with the focus in the left and right occipital and right parietal cortical areas. The desynchronization in the EEG theta 2 band in all cortical areas was observed at transition from a state of quiet wakefulness with eyes closed to a state with eyes open. The conclusion is made about the different functional significance of the electrical activity of the low and high frequency theta EEG bands under cognitive activity.	[Dzhebrailova, T.

Absence of Alpha-tACS Aftereffects in Darkness Reveals Importance of Taking Derivations of Stimulation Frequency and Individual Alpha Variability Into Account	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); EEG; aftereffect; alpha oscillations; replication; tES reliability	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL BRAIN-STIMULATION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; INCREASE	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has found widespread use as a basic tool in the exploration of the role of brain oscillations. Many studies have shown that frequency-specific tACS is able to not only alter cognitive processes during stimulation, but also cause specific physiological aftereffects visible in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The relationship between the emergence of these aftereffects and the necessary duration of stimulation is inconclusive. Our goal in this study was to narrow down the crucial length of tACS-blocks, by which aftereffects can be elicited. We stimulated participants with alpha-tACS in four blocks of 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-min length, once in increasing and once in decreasing order. After each block, we measured the resting EEG for 10 min during a visual vigilance task. We could not find lasting enhancement of alpha-power following any stimulation block, when comparing the stimulated groups to the sham group. These findings offer no information regarding the crucial stimulation duration. In addition, this conflicts with previous findings, showing a power increase following 10 min of tACS in the alpha range. We performed additional explorative analyses, based on known confounds of (1) mismatches between stimulation frequency and individual alpha frequency and (2) abnormalities in baseline alpha-activity. The results of an ANCOVA suggested that both factor explain variance, but could not resolve how exactly both factors interfere with the stimulation effect. Employing a linear mixed model, we found a significant effect of stimulation following 10 min of alpha-tACS in the increasing sequence and a significant effect of the mismatch between stimulated frequency and individual alpha frequency. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

TOWARD RAPID AND PREDICTIVE NEURODYNAMIC FEEDBACK AND SCAFFOLDING FOR TEAMS	BUILDING INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS FOR TEAMS: WHAT MATTERS	Research on Managing Groups and Teams		English	Article; Book Chapter						Teamwork; EEG; social coordination; information theory; entropy; healthcare	ORGANIZATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; GAMMA	This chapter describes a neurodynamic modeling approach which may be useful for dynamically assessing teamwork in healthcare and military situations. It begins with a description of electroencephalographic (EEG) signal acquisition and the transformation of the physical units of EEG signals into quantities of information. This transformation provides quantitative, dynamic, and generalizable neurodynamic models that are directly comparable across teams, tasks, training protocols, and team experience levels using the same measurement scale, bits of information. These bits of information can be further used to dynamically guide team performance or to provide after-action feedback that is linked to task events and team actions. These ideas are instantiated and expanded in the second section of the chapter by showing how these data abstractions, compressions, and transformations take advantage of the natural information redundancy in biologic signals to substantially reduce the number of data dimensions, making the incorporation of neurodynamic feedback into Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) achievable.

Effect of Gabapentin on Sleep and Event-Related Oscillations (EROs) in Rats Exposed to Chronic Intermittent Ethanol Vapor and Protracted Withdrawal	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Alcohol; EEG; Event-Related Oscillations; Gabapentin; Slow-Wave Sleep	GATED CALCIUM-CHANNELS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINE; ADULT WISTAR RATS; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; ALPHA(2)DELTA SUBUNIT; CHRONIC INSOMNIA; PHASE-LOCKING; EEG; ADOLESCENT; FREQUENCY	BackgroundDisturbances in sleep architecture, especially reductions in slow-wave sleep (SWS), are symptoms commonly observed in individuals with alcohol use disorders. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that the anticonvulsant and analgesic drug gabapentin may have therapeutic value in normalizing sleep quality in recovering alcoholics. However, the brain mechanisms underlying this improvement in sleep following gabapentin treatment remain unknown. MethodsIn this study, adult Wistar rats were exposed to 8weeks of chronic intermittent ethanol [EtOH] vapor (blood EtOH concentrations averaged 128.217.4mg/dl) or control conditions and then withdrawn. Sleep electroencephalograms [EEGs] and event-related oscillations (EROs) were evaluated at baseline prior to EtOH exposure and 24hours following EtOH withdrawal. Four weeks following EtOH withdrawal the effects of saline and 2 doses of gabapentin (30, 120mg/kg), on EROs and sleep EEGs, were evaluated. ResultsAs compared to baseline, 24hours following alcohol withdrawal SWS became fragmented as indexed by a significant increase in the number and a decrease in the duration of SWS episodes. Compared to controls, the EtOH-exposed group had more ERO energy in the beta frequency band in the parietal cortex. Gabapentin induced a dose-dependent decrease in the latency to the first SWS episode, and a reduction in sleep fragmentation. Gabapentin also produced a dose-dependent increase in ERO energy in the control group that was significantly attenuated in the EtOH-exposed group in the theta, and beta frequency bands. ConclusionsTaken together, these studies suggest that gabapentin can reverse some of the alcohol-induced sleep and EEG deficits but does not eliminate all of the enduring brain effects of EtOH exposure.

Since the voltage recorded by LFP electrodes reflects the summed electrical field of a large volume of brain tissue, extracting information about local activity is challenging. Studying neuronal microcircuits, however, requires a reliable distinction between truly local events and volume-conducted signals originating in distant brain areas. Current source density (CSD) analysis offers a solution for this problem by providing information about current sinks and sources in the vicinity of the electrodes. In brain areas with laminar cytoarchitecture such as the hippocampus, one-dimensional CSD can be obtained by estimating the second spatial derivative of the LFP. Here, we describe a method to record multilaminar LFPs using linear silicon probes implanted into the dorsal hippocampus. CSD traces are computed along individual shanks of the probe. This protocol thus describes a procedure to resolve spatially restricted neuronal network oscillations in the hippocampus of freely moving mice.

Neural activity in the high-gamma frequency band (HGB) closely reflects such local cortical processing, but little is known about its role in error processing, particularly in the healthy human brain. Here we characterize the error-related response of the human brain based on data obtained with noninvasive EEG optimized for HGB mapping in 31 healthy subjects (15 females, 16 males), and additional intracranial EEG data from 9 epilepsy patients (4 females, 5 males). Our findings reveal a multiscale picture of the global and local dynamics of error-related HGB activity in the human brain. On the global level as reflected in the noninvasive EEG, the error-related response started with an early component dominated by anterior brain regions, followed by a shift to parietal regions, and a subsequent phase characterized by sustained parietal HGB activity. This phase lasted for more than 1 s after the error onset. On the local level reflected in the intracranial EEG, a cascade of both transient and sustained error-related responses involved an even more extended network, spanning beyond frontal and parietal regions to the insula and the hippocampus. HGB mapping appeared especially well suited to investigate late, sustained components of the error response, possibly linked to downstream functional stages such as error-related learning and behavioral adaptation. Our findings establish the basic spatio-temporal properties of HGB activity as a neural correlate of error processing, complementing traditional error-related potential studies.

Brain oscillatory EEG activity offers insight into a drivers' mental state and has therefore attracted much attention in the past. However, EEG measures do not only vary with internal factors like attentional engagement and vigilance but might also interact with external factors like time on task, task demands, or the degree to which a traffic situation is predictable. In order to identify EEG parameters for cognitive mechanisms involved in tasks of high and low controllability, the present study investigated the interaction of time on task, task load, and cognitive controllability in simulated driving scenarios, using an either re-active or pro-active driving task. Participants performed a lane-keeping task, half of them compensating varying levels of crosswind (re-active task), and the other half driving along a winding road (pro-active task). Both driving tasks were adjusted with respect to difficulty. The analysis of oscillatory EEG parameters showed an increase in total power (1-30 Hz) with time on task, with decreasing task load, and in the re-active compared to the pro-active task. Furthermore, the relative power in Alpha band increased with decreasing task load and time on task, while relative Theta power showed the opposite pattern. Moreover, relative Alpha power was also higher in the re-active, than pro-active, driving situation, an effect that even increased with time on task. The results demonstrate that the controllability of a driving situation has a similar effect on oscillatory EEG activity like time on task and task load.

However, there is a lack of investigation of the relationship between sensory thalamic oscillations and pain relief in patients with neuropathic pain. This study aims to identify the oscillatory neural characteristics correlated with pain relief induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS), and develop a quantitative model to predict pain relief by integrating characteristic measures of the neural oscillations. Approach: Measures of sensory thalamic local field potentials (LFPs) in thirteen patients with neuropathic pain were screened in three dimensional feature space according to the rhythm, balancing, and coupling neural behaviours, and correlated with pain relief. An integrated approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis is proposed to integrate the multiple measures and provide a predictive model. Main results: This study reveals distinct thalamic rhythms of theta, alpha, high beta and high gamma oscillations correlating with pain relief. The balancing and coupling measures between these neural oscillations were also significantly correlated with pain relief. Significance: The study enriches the series research on the function of thalamic neural oscillations in neuropathic pain and relief, and provides a quantitative approach for predicting pain relief by DBS using thalamic neural oscillations.

J	Nawaz, R; Nisar, H; Voon, YV				Nawaz, Rab; Nisar, Humaira; Voon, Yap Vooi			The Effect of Music on Human Brain; Frequency Domain and Time Series Analysis Using Electroencephalogram	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); power spectral density (PSD); approximate entropy; sample entropy; music; binaural beats	FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; ALPHA; DEPRESSION; DYNAMICS; EMOTION; MODEL	The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of music stimuli on human brain using electroencephalogram (EEG). The study comprises of two experiments, a short term and a long term experiment referred to as experiment 1 and experiment 2, respectively. Two types of music stimuli; favorite music (preferred music of the subjects) and relaxing music (composed of alpha binaural beats) are used in experiment 1. Experiment 2 is conducted using relaxing music. Assessment of soothing effects of the music on human brain is done by analyzing different features; absolute power in alpha band, approximate entropy, sample entropy, and frontal asymmetry using EEG recordings. The ANOVA measures for the extracted features indicated no significant change in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the features are evaluated for the music listening group and control group separately. From ANOVA results, no significant change is observed in the control group after both conditions (1st week and 2nd week) with respect to the baseline. On the other hand, significant change was observed in the music listening group, for all features investigated; (a) absolute alpha power: condition (baseline and 1st week) F = 4.59, P < 0.05, condition (baseline and 2nd week) F = 18.87, P < 0.05 (b) approximate entropy: condition (baseline and 2nd week) F = 30.62, P < 0.05 (c) sample entropy: condition (baseline and 1st week) F = 4.75, P < 0.05, condition (baseline and 2nd week) F = 38.37, P < 0.05. For inter-hemispheric alpha asymmetry index measured from the frontal region of the brain; no significant change is observed in both experiments. Hence, the main contribution of this study is to investigate the EEG dynamics under different music stimuli. The results indicate that relaxing music has better soothing effects as compared to the favorite music. It is also observed that the effect of relaxation is significant when the relaxing music is listened for a longer period of time (2 weeks).

The alpha rhythmic activity is known to dominate neural oscillations at the awake, restful state, while attenuated resting-state alpha activity has been implicated in anxious mood. Administering repeated alpha-frequency tACS (alpha-tACS; at individual peak alpha frequency; 8-12 Hz) over four consecutive days (in the experiment group, sham stimulation in the control group), we demonstrated immediate and lasting (>24 h) increases in resting-state posterior -> frontal connectivity in the alpha frequency, quantified by Granger causality. Critically, this connectivity enhancement was accompanied by sustained reductions in both anxious arousal and negative perception of sensory stimuli. Resting-state alpha power also increased, albeit only transiently, reversing to the baseline level within 24 h after tACS. Therefore, the lasting enhancement of long-range alpha connectivity due to alpha-tACS differs from local alpha activity that is nonetheless conserved, highlighting the adaptability of alpha oscillatory networks. In light of increasing recognition of large-scale network dysfunctions as a transdiagnostic pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, this enduring connectivity plasticity, along with the behavioral improvements, paves the way for tACS applications in clinical interventions of psychiatric 'oscillopathies'.

The respiratory system is a non-linear system. However, the relationship between neural and respiratory dynamics is usually estimated through linear correlation measures, completely neglecting possible underlying nonlinear interactions. This study evaluate the linear and nonlinear coupling between electroencephalographic (EEG) signal and variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) signal related to different breathing task. During a free breathing and a voluntary breath hold tasks, the coupling between EEG power in nine different brain regions in delta (1-3 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) bands and end-tidal CO2 (PET CO2) was evaluated. Specifically, the generic associations (i.e. linear and nonlinear correlations) and a "pure" nonlinear correlations were evaluated using the maximum information coefficient (MIC) and MIC-rho(2) between the two signals, respectively (where rho(2) represents the Pearson's correlation coefficient). Our results show that in delta band, MIC indexes discriminate the two tasks in several regions, while in alpha band the same behaviour is observed for MIC-rho(2), suggesting a generic coupling between delta EEG power and PETCO2 and a pure nonlinear interaction between alpha EEG power and PETCO2. Moreover, higher indexes values were found for breath hold task respect to free breathing.

The study will examine human computer interaction (HCI) trying to understand the characteristics and effects of VR by comparing the brainwave patterns of receivers when exposed to 2D and VR contents. The main purpose of this study is to grasp the differences in the human factors that affect the cognition of stereoscopic and flat images regarding their dimensional distinction by gathering concrete empirical data and comparing the alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) wave patterns observed when watching VR and 2D videos. The study adopts a 2 x 3 experimental research design, statistically processed from 20 subjects. The 2D and VR materials used in this study is divided into three categories: sports, news, and advertisements. The participants viewed the videos in random order and the differences in brainwaves according to the genre and dimension were recorded. The results showed that beta-wave vibrations observed when subjects were exposed to VR videos were statistically significant compared to when subjects watched 2D videos. The study also tested HCI factors on subjects that showed stronger in the frontal lobe when watching images with higher degree of VR stereoscopic effect and dynamic feeling. Electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations indicated that beta-waves when watching VR were statistically significant compared to the brainwaves of viewing 2D videos. It was found that there were differences in beta-waves according to program genre. Videos that were fast pace and more dynamic were more likely to show stronger beta-waves. There was especially high beta-wave activity in the frontal lobe for the sports VR category.

Complexity of brain activity and connectivity in functional neuroimaging	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						complexity; dominant coupling modes; dynamic functional connectivity; flexibility index; multiplexity; reliability; symbolic dynamics	LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; RESTING-STATE MEG; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; COUPLING MODES; EEG; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECONFIGURATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Understanding the complexity of human brain dynamics and brain connectivity across the repertoire of functional neuroimaging and various conditions, is of paramount importance. Novel measures should be designed tailored to the input focusing on multichannel activity and dynamic functional brain connectivity (DFBC). Here, we defined a novel complexity index (CI) from the field of symbolic dynamics that quantifies patterns of different words up to a length from a symbolic sequence. The CI characterizes the complexity of the brain activity. We analysed DFBC by adopting the sliding window approach using imaginary part of phase locking value (iPLV) for EEG/ECoG/MEG and wavelet coherence (WC) for fMRI. Both intra and cross-frequency couplings (CFC) namely phase-to-amplitude were estimated using iPLV/WC at every snapshot of the DFBC. Using proper surrogate analysis, we defined the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DICM) per pair of regions-of-interest (ROI). The spatiotemporal probability distribution of DICM were reported to reveal the most prominent coupling modes per condition and modality. Finally, a novel flexibility index is defined that quantifies the transition of DICM per pair of ROIs between consecutive time windows. The whole methodology was demonstrated using four neuroimaging datasets (EEG/ECoG/MEG/fMRI). Finally, we succeeded to totally discriminate healthy controls from schizophrenic using FI and dynamic reconfiguration of DICM.

Acute effect of Ethanol and Taurine on frontal cortex absolute beta power before and after exercise	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFERIOR PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; PROLONGED EXERCISE; BAND OSCILLATIONS; CYCLE ERGOMETER; ALCOHOL; EEG; ACTIVATION; INHIBITION; BRAIN	Ethanol (ET) is a substance that modulates the Central Nervous System (CNS). Frequently, ET intake occurs combined with energy drinks, which contain taurine (TA), an important amino acid found in the body (i. e brain and muscles). Although TA administration has been used in the improvement of physical performance, the impact of TA, ET and exercise remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the acute effect of 6g of Taurine (TA), 0.6 mL similar to kg -1 of Ethanol (ET), and Taurine combined with Ethanol (TA+ ET) ingestion on the electrocortical activity before and after a moderate intensity exercise in 9 subjects, 5 women (counterbalanced experimental design). In each of the 4 treatments (Placebo D PL, TA, ET and TA+ ET), electroencephalography (EEG) tests were conducted in order to analyze changes in absolute beta power (ABP) in the frontal lobe in 3 moments: baseline (before ingestion), peak (before exercise) and post-exercise. In the PL treatment, the frontal areas showed decrease in ABP after exercise. However, in the ET+ TA treatment, ABP values were greater after exercise, except for Fp1. The ET treatment had no effect on the Superior Frontal Gyrus area (F3, Fz and F4) and ABP decreased after exercise in Fp1 and Fp2. In the TA treatment, ABP increased after exercise, while it decreased at the peak moment in most of the frontal regions, except for Fp1, F3 and Fz. We concluded that after a moderate intensity exercise, a decrease in cortical activity occurs in placebo treatment. Moreover, we found a inhibitory effect of TA on cortical activity before exercise and a increased in cortical activity after exercise. A small ET dose is not enough to alter ABP in all regions of the frontal cortex and, in combination with TA, it showed an increase in the frontal cortex activity at the post-exercise moment.

J	Chai, YH; Sheng, JW; Bandettini, PA; Gao, JH				Chai, Yuhui; Sheng, Jingwei; Bandettini, Peter A.; Gao, Jia-Hong			Frequency-dependent tACS modulation of BOLD signal during rhythmic visual stimulation	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						brain oscillation; fMRI; tACS	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CORTEX; FMRI; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; RESONANCE; SYSTEM; BRAIN	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has emerged as a promising tool for modulating cortical oscillations. In previous electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, tACS has been found to modulate brain oscillatory activity in a frequency-specific manner. However, the spatial distribution and hemodynamic response for this modulation remains poorly understood. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the advantage of measuring neuronal activity in regions not only below the tACS electrodes but also across the whole brain with high spatial resolution. Here, we measured fMRI signal while applying tACS to modulate rhythmic visual activity. During fMRI acquisition, tACS at different frequencies (4, 8, 16, and 32 Hz) was applied along with visual flicker stimulation at 8 and 16 Hz. We analyzed the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal difference between tACS-ON vs tACS-OFF, and different frequency combinations (e.g., 4Hz tACS, 8Hz flicker vs 8Hz tACS, 8Hz flicker). We observed significant tACS modulation effects on BOLD responses when the tACS frequency matched the visual flicker frequency or the second harmonic frequency. The main effects were predominantly seen in regions that were activated by the visual task and targeted by the tACS current distribution. These findings bridge different scientific domains of tACS research and demonstrate that fMRI could localize the tACS effect on stimulus-induced brain rhythms, which could lead to a new approach for understanding the high-level cognitive process shaped by the ongoing oscillatory signal.

Moment-to-Moment Fluctuations in Neuronal Excitability Bias Subjective Perception Rather than Strategic Decision-Making	ENEURO			English	Article						Perceptual decision-making; signal detection theory; awareness; prestimulus; alpha; beta; oscillations	ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG; DISCRIMINATION; PERFORMANCE; PHASE; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; MODULATION; INHIBITION; CRITERION	Perceiving an external stimulus depends not only on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8-30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual precision, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers' subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task independent. We found that correct detection wasmore likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e., 8-17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.

Impaired neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex in depression indexed through paired associative stimulation	DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY			English	Article						depression; electrophysiology; EEG; evoked potentials; neurostimulation; neuroimaging	HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL NETWORK; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; MAJOR DEPRESSION	Background: Dysfunctional neuroplasticity may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying major depression. We have previously established methods to assess neuroplasticity from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using a paired associative stimulation (PAS) paradigm, which pairs a preceding peripheral nerve stimulation with subsequent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG). We aimed to investigate neuroplasticity through the PAS paradigm in the DLPFC in patients with depression compared to healthy subjects. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with depression and 28 healthy controls participated in this study. There were no significant age or sex differences between the two groups. All participants received PAS paradigm in the DLPFC. We analyzed PAS induced potentiation from the DLPFC in both groups calculating the power of TMS-evoked potentials (TEP). A two-way ANOVA with PAS effect as a within-subject factor and diagnostic group as a between-subject factor was performed to examine the group differences in the PAS paradigm. Results: DLPFC-PAS induced a significant potentiation at the stimulation site in both patients and healthy subjects (meanSD: 1.24 +/- 0.33 [mu V] vs. 1.48 +/- 0.28 [mu V]). However, when we compared PAS potentiation between patients and healthy subjects, there were significant main effects of PAS (F-1,F-53 = 68.63, p < 0.0001) and PAS-by-diagnostic group interaction (F-1,F-53 = 25.05, p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis demonstrated that patients had a significantly lower PAS potentiation compared to healthy subjects (t(55) = 3.128, p = 0.003). Conclustions: Our findings provide evidence for impaired neuroplasticity in DLPFC in patients with depression compared to healthy subjects. Such findings may ultimately help us understand the pathophysiology of MDD and mechanisms involved in its treatment.

Consistent with this view, both the locus of attention and positions stored in working memory can be decoded based on the topography of oscillatory alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity on the scalp. Thus far, however, alpha modulation has been studied in isolation for covert attention and working memory tasks. Here, we applied an inverted spatial encoding model in combination with EEG to study the temporal dynamics of spatially specific alpha activity during a task that required observers to visually select a target location while maintaining another independently varying location in working memory. During the memory delay period, alpha-based spatial tuning functions shifted from the position stored in working memory to the covertly attended position and back again after the attention task was completed. The findings provide further evidence for a common oscillatory mechanism in both the selection and the maintenance of relevant spatial visual information and demonstrate the dynamic trade-off in prioritization between two spatial tasks.

How do brain networks dynamically reorganize to allow broad communication between many different brain regions in order to integrate information? We record neural activity from 12 epileptic patients using intracranial EEG while performing three cognitive tasks. We assess how the functional connectivity between different brain areas changes to facilitate communication across them. At the topological level, this facilitation is characterized by measures of integration and segregation. Across all patients, we found significant increases in integration and decreases in segregation during cognitive processing, especially in the gamma band (50-90 Hz). We also found higher levels of global synchronization and functional connectivity during task execution, again particularly in the gamma band. More importantly, functional connectivity modulations were not caused by changes in the level of the underlying oscillations. Instead, these modulations were caused by a rearrangement of the mutual synchronization between the different nodes as proposed by the "Communication Through Coherence" Theory.

J	Su, KM; Hairston, WD; Robbins, K				Su, Kyung-min; Hairston, W. David; Robbins, Kay			EEG-Annotate: Automated identification and labeling of events in continuous signals with applications to EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Single-trial ERP; Time-locked; Event identification; Stimulus-response	ADAPTATION REGULARIZATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ERP; POTENTIALS; CLASSIFICATION; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; PATTERN; ALPHA	Background: In controlled laboratory EEG experiments, researchers carefully mark events and analyze subject responses time-locked to these events. Unfortunately, such markers may not be available or may come with poor timing resolution for experiments conducted in less-controlled naturalistic environments. New method: We present an integrated event-identification method for identifying particular responses that occur in unlabeled continuously recorded EEG signals based on information from recordings of other subjects potentially performing related tasks. We introduce the idea of timing slack and timing tolerant performance measures to deal with jitter inherent in such non-time-locked systems. We have developed an implementation available as an open-source MATLAB toolbox (http://github.com/VisLab/EEG-Annotate) and have made test data available in a separate data note. Results: We applied the method to identify visual presentation events (both target and non-target) in data from an unlabeled subject using labeled data from other subjects with good sensitivity and specificity. The method also identified actual visual presentation events in the data that were not previously marked in the experiment. Comparison with existing methods: Although the method uses traditional classifiers for initial stages, the problem of identifying events based on the presence of stereotypical EEG responses is the converse of the traditional stimulus-response paradigm and has not been addressed in its current form. Conclusions: In addition to identifying potential events in unlabeled or incompletely labeled EEG, these methods also allow researchers to investigate whether particular stereotypical neural responses are present in other circumstances. Timing-tolerance has the added benefit of accommodating inter- and intra-subject timing variations. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

We applied this approach to study correlations between thalamic BOLD activity and alpha EEG rhythm. Healthy volunteers in the experimental group (EG, n = 15) learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the target region consisting of the mediodorsal (MD) and anterior (AN) thalamic nuclei using rtfMRI-nf during retrieval of happy autobiographical memories. Healthy subjects in the control group (CG, n = 14) were provided with a sham feedback. The EG participants were able to significantly increase BOLD activities of the MD and AN. Functional connectivity between the MD and the inferior precuneus was significantly enhanced during the rtfMRI-nf task. Average individual changes in the occipital alpha EEG power significantly correlated with the average MD BOLD activity levels for the EG. Temporal correlations between the occipital alpha EEG power and BOLD activities of the MD and AN were significantly enhanced, during the rtfMRI-nf task, for the EG compared to the CG. Temporal correlations with the alpha power were also significantly enhanced for the posterior nodes of the default mode network, including the precuneus/posterior cingulate, and for the dorsal striatum. Our findings suggest that the temporal correlation between the MD BOLD activity and posterior alpha EEG power is modulated by the interaction between the MD and the inferior precuneus, reflected in their functional connectivity. Our results demonstrate the potential of the rtfMRI-nf with simultaneous EEG for noninvasive neuromodulation studies of human brain function.

Multiple lines of converging evidence now point to the infraslow oscillation (ISO) as a mediator of brain sub-states, with impacts ranging from the creation of resting state networks (RSNs) in awake subjects to interruptions in neural activity during sleep. This review will explore first the basic characteristics of the ISO in human subjects before reviewing findings in sleep and in animals. Networks of consistently correlated brain regions known as RSNs seen in human functional neuroimaging studies oscillate together at infraslow frequencies. The infraslow rhythm subdivides nonREM in a manner that may correlate with plasticity. The mechanism of this oscillation may be found in the thalamus and may ultimately come from glial cells. Finally, I review the functional impacts of ISOs on brain phenomena ranging from higher frequency oscillations, to brain networks, to information representation and cognitive performance. ISOs represent a relatively understudied phenomenon with wide effects on the brain and behavior.

Our proposed approach employed phase space analysis of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) generated by MEMD based decomposition of the six channels EEG signals. The combination of two powerful signal processing techniques i.e. MEMD with phase space reconstruction (PSR) enabled us to characterize the nonlinear and non-stationary nature of the dynamics underlying a particular cognitive task more accurately. Our proposed approach consists of three stages, in the first stage; the application of MEMD to multichannel EEG data gave rise to adaptive i.e. data driven decomposition of the multivariate time series data into a set of IMF groups. All the member IMFs within a group have common oscillatory frequency but different amplitude and cortical origin. In the second stage, a small subset of IMF groups was selected according to their task correlation factor and subsequently represented in the two dimensional phase space through their trajectory matrices. In the third stage, largest singular values of the trajectory matrices corresponding to a subset of sensitive IMFs were employed for forming the feature vectors. Finally, the extracted feature vectors were fed to a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier for binary i.e. pair wise classification of these mental task EEG signals. With the new feature vectors, it is shown that LS-SVM with RBF kernel provides accuracy of 83.33% in classifying between mental arithmetic and mental letter composing. The performance of this classifier was evaluated on various parameters such as accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. The classification results show the potential of the proposed approach for classifying any non-linear a non-stationary signal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, they mostly appear around the mid-line of the brain on both centro-parietal (for early spindles) and frontal (for late spindles) zones of the brain. In this paper for the first time a cooperative adaptive line enhancer is introduced in order to exploit the distributed and periodic nature of the spindle sources. In the proposed system the cooperation parameters are estimated based on evaluation of brain connectivity through S-transform. The outcome shows how the proposed approach can capture the entire duration of sleep spindles compared to all previous techniques based on single-channel spindle detection.

Electric field encephalography for brain activity monitoring	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; EFEG; brain monitoring; SSVEP; VEP; wireless biosensor; BCI	EEG; QUALITY	Objective. We describe an early-stage prototype of a new wireless electrophysiological sensor system, called NeuroDot, which can measure neuroelectric potentials and fields at the scalp in a new modality called Electric Field Encephalography (EFEG). We aim to establish the physical validity of the EFEG modality, and examine some of its properties and relative merits compared to EEG. Approach. We designed a wireless neuroelectric measurement device based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 Analog Front End platform and a sensor montage, using custom electrodes, to simultaneously measure EFEG and spatially averaged EEG over a localized patch of the scalp (2 cm x 2 cm). The signal properties of each modality were compared across tests of noise floor, Berger effect, steady-state visually evoked potential (ssVEP), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and others. In order to compare EFEG to EEG modalities in the frequency domain, we use a novel technique to compute spectral power densities and derive narrow-band SNR estimates for ssVEP signals. A simple binary choice brain-computer-interface (BCI) concept based on ssVEP is evaluated. Also, we present examples of high quality recording of transient Visually Evoked Potentials and Fields (tVEPF) that could be used for neurological studies. Main results. We demonstrate the capability of the NeuroDot system to record high quality EEG signals comparable to some recent clinical and research grade systems on the market. We show that the locally-referenced EFEG metric is resistant to certain types of movement artifacts. In some ssVEP based measurements, the EFEG modality shows promising results, demonstrating superior signal to noise ratios than the same recording processed as an analogous EEG signal. We show that by using EFEG based ssVEP SNR estimates to perform a binary classification in a model BCI, the optimal information transfer rate (ITR) can be raised from 15 to 30 bits per minute-though these preliminary results are likely sensitive to inter-subject variations and choice of scalp locations, so require further investigation. Significance. Enhancement of ssVEP SNR using EFEG has the potential to improve visually based BCIs and diagnostic paradigms. The time domain analysis of tVEPF signals shows robust features in the electric field components that might have clinical relevance beyond classical VEP approaches.

Integration of stationary wavelet transform on a dynamic partial reconfiguration for recognition of pre-ictal gamma oscillations	HELIYON			English	Article						Biomedical engineering; Neurology	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; SIGNALS; EEG; HZ	To define the neural networks responsible of an epileptic seizure, it is useful to perform advanced signal processing techniques. In this context, electrophysiological signals present three types of waves: oscillations, spikes, and a mixture of both. Recent studies show that spikes and oscillations should be separated properly in order to define the accurate neural connectivity during the pre-ictal, seizure and inter-ictal states. Retrieving oscillatory activity is a sensitive task due to the frequency overlap between oscillations and transient activities. Advanced filtering techniques have been proposed to ensure a good separation between oscillations and spikes. It would be interesting to apply them in real time for instantaneous monitoring, seizure warning or neurofeedback systems. This requires improving execution time. This constraint can be overcome using embedded systems that combine hardware and software in an optimized architecture. We propose here to implement a stationary wavelet transform (SWT) as an adaptive filtering technique retaining only pre-ictal gamma oscillations, as validated in previous work, on a partial dynamic configuration. Then, the same architecture is used with further modifications to integrate spatio temporal mapping for an early recognition of seizure build-up. Data that contains transient, pre-ictal gamma oscillations and a seizure was simulated. the method on real intracerebral signals was also tested. The SWT was integrated on an embedded architecture. This architecture permits a spatio temporal mapping to detect the accurate time and localization of seizure buildup, while reducing computation time by a factor of around 40. Embedded systems are a promising venue for real-time applications in clinical systems for epilepsy.

These predictions are grounded in recent work examining the effect of sleep on the consolidation of linguistic information, which demonstrate that sleep-dependent neurophysiological activity consolidates the meaning of novel words and simple grammatical rules. However, the sleep-dependent consolidation of sentence-level combinatorics has not been studied to date. Here, we propose that dissociable aspects of sleep neurophysiology consolidate two different types of combinatory mechanisms in human language: sequence-based (order-sensitive) and dependency-based (order-insensitive) combinatorics. The distinction between the two types of combinatorics is motivated both by cross-linguistic considerations and the neurobiological underpinnings of human language. Unifying this perspective with principles of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, we posit that a function of sleep is to optimize the consolidation of sequence-based knowledge (the when) and the establishment of semantic schemas of unordered items (the what) that underpin cross-linguistic variations in sentence comprehension. This hypothesis builds on the proposal that sleep is involved in the construction of predictive codes, a unified principle of brain function that supports incremental sentence comprehension. Finally, we discuss neurophysiological measures (EEG/ MEG) that could be used to test these claims, such as the quantification of neuronal oscillations, which reflect basic mechanisms of information processing in the brain.

While iEEG signals are believed to be highly informative, making online or real-time functional mapping possible, the utilization of corresponding behavioral information in traditional trial-based paradigms is typically low. This imbalance has limited the efficiency and effectiveness in current iEEG-based functional mapping approaches. Objective. In the current study, we were to investigate whether using more dedicate behavioral information can improve iEEG-based functional mapping. Approach. We continuously monitored behavioral outputs of patients during iEEG recording, transformed them into regressors, and assessed their correlations with iEEG signals. Main results. Functional cortical sites identified in preliminary test using the proposed method showed considerable consistency with the results from electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) as well as a trial-based method. Continuous behavioral tracing yielded more dependency to neural signals than sole event markers-derived regressor. Based on this, we successfully performed online functional brain mapping during five neurosurgery operations, which yielded satisfactory results. Significance. In the present study, we showed the utilization of continuous behavioral tracing can improve the efficiency of iEEG-based functional brain mapping. We then demonstrated this approach is adequate for multi-session intraoperative functional assessment within short time span, which is of considerable clinical value.

This occupation of cerebral resources may limit the potential to quickly adapt movements to unforeseen external stimuli in the athletic environment. To date, studies investigating such neural alterations during movement focused on simple, anticipated tasks with low ecological validity. This trial, therefore, aims to investigate the cortical and biomechanical processes associated with more sport-related and injury-related movements in ACL-reconstructed individuals. Methods and analysis ACL-reconstructed participants and uninjured controls will perform repetitive countermovement jumps with single leg landings. Two different conditions are to be completed: anticipated (n=35) versus unanticipated (n=35) successful landings. Under the anticipated condition, participants receive the visual information depicting the requested landing leg prior to the jump. In the unanticipated condition, this information will be provided only about 400 msec prior to landing. Neural correlates of motor planning will be measured using electroencephalography. In detail, movement-related cortical potentials, frequency spectral power and functional connectivity will be assessed. Biomechanical landing quality will be captured via a capacitive force plate. Calculated parameters encompass time to stabilisation, vertical peak ground reaction force, and centre of pressure path length. Potential systematic differences between ACL-reconstructed individuals and controls will be identified in dependence of jumping condition (anticipated/ unanticipated, injured/uninjured leg and controls) by using interference statistics. Potential associations between the cortical and biomechanical measures will be calculated by means of correlation analysis. In case of statistical significance (<0.05.) further confounders (cofactors) will be considered. Ethics and dissemination The independent Ethics Committee of the University of Frankfurt (Faculty of Psychology and Sports Sciences) approved the study. Publications in peer-reviewed journals are planned. The findings will be presented at scientific conferences. Trial status At the time of submission of this manuscript, recruitment is ongoing.

Music familiarity is another factor that affects cortical entrainment, and electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have shown that stronger entrainment occurs while listening to unfamiliar music than while listening to familiar music. In the present study, we hypothesized that not only the level of familiarity but also the level of attention affects the level of entrainment. We simultaneously presented music and a silent movie to participants and we recorded an EEG while participants paid attention to either the music or the movie in order to investigate whether cortical entrainment is related to attention and music familiarity. The average cross-correlation function across channels, trials, and participants exhibited a pronounced positive peak at time lags around 130 ms and a negative peak at time lags around 260 ms. The statistical analysis of the two peaks revealed that the level of attention did not affect the level of entrainment, and, moreover, that in both the auditory-active and visual-active conditions, the entrainment level is stronger when listening to unfamiliar music than when listening to familiar music. This may indicate that the familiarity with music affects cortical activities when attention is not fully devoted to listening to music.

Previous work has demonstrated that endogenous oscillations and subsequent behavior can be modulated by oscillating transcranial current stimulation (otCS). The purpose of the current study is to establish the efficacy of cathodal otCS for modulation of the ongoing alpha brain oscillations, allowing for modulation of individual's visual perception. Thirty-six participants performed a target detection with sham and 10-Hz cathodal otCS. Each participant had two practice and two experimental sets composed of three blocks of 128 trials per block. Stimulating electrodes were placed on the participant's head with the anode electrode at Cz and the cathode electrode at Oz. A 0.5 mA current was applied every 100 ms (10 Hz frequency) during the otCS condition. The same current and frequency was applied for the first 10-20 s of the sham condition, after which the current was turned off. Target detection rates were compared between the sham and otCS experimental conditions in order to test for effects of otCS phase on target detection. We found no significant difference in target detection rates between the sham and otCS conditions, and discuss potential reasons for the apparent inability of cathodal otCS to effectively modulate visual perception.

Here, we tested this hypothesis in twenty-six healthy older adults and thirty-four MCI patients, of which sixteen were APOE4 carriers. Compared to controls, MCI showed hippocampal volume reduction, cortical thinning in frontal, temporal and parietal regions, and dysfunctional EEG oscillations across frontotemporal networks. But importantly, APOE4 status was the critical factor in determining the impact of temporal lobe degeneration on memory in MCI individuals. Specifically, path analyses revealed that hippocampal damage in MCI was responsible for memory deterioration in APOE4 carriers, a relationship mediated by the serial intervention of three related factors in noncarriers. Temporal cortical thickness (first mediator) accounted for activation of functional networks through synchronized theta activity across temporal regions (second mediator), which, in turn, coordinated memory reactivation through desynchronized alpha/beta activity across sensorimotor areas (third mediator). Results revealed that, contrary to APOE4-carrier patients, noncarriers are successful in recruiting secondary cortical networks to improve memory performance as long as the integrity and functionality of the temporal lobe is preserved, a fact primarily dependent on hippocampal degeneration.

Current experimental studies and models highlight proactive and reactive mechanisms and claim several cortical and subcortical structures to be involved in response inhibition. However, the involved structures, network mechanisms and the behavioral relevance of the underlying neural activity remain debated. We report cortical EEG and invasive subthalamic local field potential recordings from a fully implanted sensing neurostimulator in Parkinson's patients during a stimulus- and response conflict task with and without deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS made reaction times faster overall while leaving the effects of conflict intact: this lack of any effect on conflict may have been inherent to our task encouraging a high level of proactive inhibition. Drift diffusion modelling hints that DBS influences decision thresholds and drift rates are modulated by stimulus conflict. Both cortical EEG and subthalamic (STN) LFP oscillations reflected reaction times (RT). With these results, we provide a different interpretation of previously conflict-related oscillations in the STN and suggest that the STN implements a general task-specific decision threshold. The timecourse and topography of subthalamic-cortical oscillatory connectivity suggest the involvement of motor, frontal midline and posterior regions in a larger network with complementary functionality, oscillatory mechanisms and structures. While beta oscillations are functionally associated with motor cortical-subthalamic connectivity, low frequency oscillations reveal a subthalamic-frontal-posterior network. With our results, we suggest that proactive as well as reactive mechanisms and structures are involved in implementing a task-related dynamic inhibitory signal. We propose that motor and executive control networks with complementary oscillatory mechanisms are tonically active, react to stimuli and release inhibition at the response when uncertainty is resolved and return to their default state afterwards.

Combining human data, mathematical and computational analysis of both spiking and mean-field models, we investigated the spectral dynamics of encephalographic (EEG) beta-alpha oscillations, observed in human patients undergoing general anaesthesia. The effect of anaesthetics can be modelled as a reduction of neural fluctuation intensity, and/or an increase in inhibitory synaptic gain in the thalamo-cortical circuit. Unlike previous work, which suggested the primary importance of gamma-amino-butryic-acid (GABA) augmentation in causing a shift to low EEG frequencies, our analysis demonstrates that a non-linear transition, triggered by a simple decrease in neural fluctuation intensity, is sufficient to explain the clinically-observed appearance - and subsequent slowing - of the beta-alpha narrowband EEG peak. In our model, increased synaptic inhibition alone, did not correlate with the clinically-observed encephalographic spectral changes, but did cause the anaesthetic induced decrease in neuronal firing rate. Taken together, our results show that such a non-linear transition results in functional fragmentation of cortical and thalamic populations; highly correlated intra-population dynamics triggered by anaesthesia decouple and isolate neural populations. Our results are able to parsimoniously unify and replicate the observed anaesthetic effects on both the EEG spectra and inter-regional connectivity, and further highlight the importance of neural activity fluctuations in the genesis of altered brain states.

This study applied the concept of a high-frequency systematic monitoring of psychological states and tested patients' compliance in order to evaluate if its integration in the EMU is feasible and if patients benefit from the graphically underpinned discussion of their EMU stay-related cognitions and emotions. Methods: The process-monitoring is technically realized by an internet-based device for data collection and data analysis, the Synergetic Navigation System (SNS). A convenient sample was enrolled: All eligible patients who were admitted to the EMU of the Department of Neurology, Christian Doppler Medical Center, Salzburg, Austria, between November 6th 2017 and January 26th 2018 were approached and recruited upon consent. After a short resource-oriented interview, each enrolled patient was provided with a tablet. The daily questionnaire included eight standardized and up to three personalized items. Self-assessments were collected every 5 h prior to meal times (6:30 am, 11:30 am, and 4:30 pm) and at 9:30 pm. The detailed visualizations of the patients' replies were discussed with the participants during a feedback session at the end of the EMU stay. Results: Twenty-one patients (12 women/9 men, median age 29 years [range 18-74 years]) were consecutively recruited (72% of all eligible patients). Compliance rates were high (median: 82%, range 60%-100%) among the respondents. Mood correlated strongly with hopefulness (r = 0.71) and moderately with energy (r = 0.63) in all patients. When correlating the intraindividual medians of the process questionnaire time series with the pretest total scores, energy correlated moderately and negatively with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (r = -0.45), while self-efficacy correlated moderately and negatively with the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) total scores in all patients (r = -0.5). Nine patients (43%) reported that they learned something meaningful about themselves after the feedback discussion of their individual time series. Conclusion: The results support the feasibility of high-frequency monitoring of psychological states and processes in routine EMU settings. Repeated daily collections four times per day of psychological surveys allow for the assessment of highly resolved, equidistant time series data, which gives insight into psychological states and processes during EMU admission.

This work utilized PAC and support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify the epileptic seizures from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The entropy based modulation index (MI) matrixes are used to express the strength of PAC, from which we extracted features as the input for classifier. Based on the Bonn database, which contains five datasets of EEG segments obtained from healthy volunteers and epileptic subjects, a 100% classification accuracy is achieved for identifying seizure ictal from healthy data, and an accuracy of 97.67% is reached in the classification of ictal EEG signals from inter-ictal EEGs. Based on the CHB-MIT database which is a group of continuously recorded epileptic EEGs by scalp electrodes, a 97.50% classification accuracy is obtained and a raising sign of MI value is found at 6 s before seizure onset. The classification performance in this work is effective, and PAC can be considered as a useful tool for detecting and predicting the epileptic seizures and providing reference for clinical diagnosis.

The theta-nested operations that organize hippocampal spiking could either occur regularly from one cycle to the next or be tuned on a cycle-by-cycle basis. To resolve this, we identified spectral components nested in individual theta cycles recorded from the mouse CA1 hippocampus. Our single-cycle profiling revealed theta spectral components associated with different firing modulations and distinguishable ensembles of principal cells. Moreover, novel co-firing patterns of principal cells in theta cycles nesting mid-gamma oscillations were the most strongly reactivated in subsequent offline sharp-wave/ripple events. Finally, theta-nested spectral components were differentially altered by behavioral stages of a memory task; the 80-Hz mid-gamma component was strengthened during learning, whereas the 22-Hz beta, 35-Hz slow gamma, and 54-Hz mid-gamma components increased during retrieval. We conclude that cycle-to-cycle variability of theta-nested spectral components allows parsing of theta oscillations into transient operating modes with complementary mnemonic roles.

Advancing cognitive decline is accompanied by progressive impairment of cognition-relevant EEG patterns such as gamma oscillations. The endocannabinoid anandamide, a TrpV1-receptor agonist, reverses hippocampal damage and memory impairment in rodents and protects neurons from A beta-induced cytotoxic effects. Here, we investigate a restorative role of TrpV1-receptor activation against A beta-induced degradation of hippocampal neuron function and gamma oscillations. We found that the TrpV1-receptor agonist capsaicin rescues A beta-induced degradation of hippocampal gamma oscillations by reversing both the desynchronization of AP firing in CA3 pyramidal cells and the shift in excitatory/inhibitory current balance. This rescue effect is TrpV1-receptor-dependent since it was absent in TrpV1 knockout mice or in the presence of the TrpV1-receptor antagonist capsazepine. Our findings provide novel insight into the network mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in AD and suggest TrpV1 activation as a novel therapeutic target.

Previous studies demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is capable of entraining ongoing oscillatory activity while also modulating motor control. However, the modulatory effects of tACS on both motor control and its underlying electro- and neurophysiological mechanisms remain ambiguous. Thus, the purpose of this study was to contribute to gathering neurophysiological knowledge regarding tACS effects by investigating the after-effects of 10 Hz tACS and 20 Hz tACS at parietal brain areas on bimanual coordination and its concurrent oscillatory and hemodynamic activity. Twenty-four right-handed healthy volunteers (12 females) aged between 18 and 30 (M = 22.35 +/- 3.62) participated in the study and performed a coordination task requiring bimanual movements. Concurrent to bimanual motor training, participants received either 10 Hz tACS, 20 Hz tACS or a sham stimulation over the parietal cortex (at P3/P4 electrode positions) for 20 min via small gel electrodes (3,14 cm(2) Ag/AgCl, amperage = 1 mA). Before and three time-points after tACS (immediately, 30 min and 1 day), bimanual coordination performance was assessed. Oscillatory activities were measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and hemodynamic changes were examined using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Improvements of bimanual coordination performance were not differently between groups, thus, no tACS-specific effect on bimanual coordination performance emerged. However, physiological measures during the task revealed significant increases in parietal alpha activity immediately following 10 Hz tACS and 20 Hz tACS which were accompanied by significant decreases of Hboxy concentration in the right hemispheric motor cortex compared to the sham group. Based on the physiological responses, we conclude that tACS applied at parietal brain areas provoked electrophysiological and hemodynamic changes at brain regions of the motor network which are relevant for bimanual motor behavior. The existence of neurophysiological alterations immediately following tACS, especially in the absence of behavioral effects, are elementary for a profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying tACS. The lack of behavioral modifications strengthens the need for further research on tACS effects on neurophysiology and behavior using combined electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods.

Manual staging is resource intensive and time consuming, and thus considerable effort must be spent to ensure inter-rater reliability. As a result, there is a great interest in techniques based on signal processing and machine learning for a completely Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC). Methods: In this paper, we present a single-EEG-sensor ASSC technique based on the dynamic reconfiguration of different aspects of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) estimated between predefined frequency pairs over 5 s epoch lengths. The proposed analytic scheme is demonstrated using the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database with repeat recordings from 20 healthy young adults. We validate our methodology in a second sleep dataset. Results: We achieved very high classification sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 96.2 +/- 2.2%, 94.2 +/- 2.3%, and 94.4 +/- 2.2% across 20 folds, respectively, and also a high mean F1 score (92%, range 90-94%) when a multi-class Naive Bayes classifier was applied. High classification performance has been achieved also in the second sleep dataset. Conclusions: Our method outperformed the accuracy of previous studies not only on different datasets but also on the same database. Significance: Single-sensor ASSC makes the entire methodology appropriate for longitudinal monitoring using wearable EEG in real-world and laboratory-oriented environments.

Wronger than wrong: Graded mapping of the errors of an avatar in the performance monitoring system of the onlooker	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Error observation; ERN; Theta oscillations; Error magnitude; Virtual reality	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; ACTION ANTICIPATION; BASKETBALL PLAYERS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTISACCADE TASK; EXECUTION ERRORS; RESPONSE ERRORS	EEG studies show that observing errors in one's own or others' actions triggers specific electro-cortical signatures in the onlooker's brain, but whether the brain error-monitoring system operates according to graded or discrete rules is still largely unknown. To explore this issue, we combined immersive virtual reality with EEG recording in participants who observed an avatar reaching-to-grasp a glass from a first-person perspective. The avatar could perform correct or erroneous actions. Erroneous grasps were defined as small or large depending on the magnitude of the trajectory deviation from the to-be-grasped glass. Results show that electro-cortical indices of error detection (indexed by ERN and mid-frontal theta oscillations), but not those of error awareness (indexed by error-Positivity), were gradually modulated by the magnitude of the observed errors. Moreover, the phase connectivity analysis revealed that enhancement of mid-frontal theta phase synchronization paralleled the magnitude of the observed error. Thus, theta oscillations represent an electro-cortical index of the degree of control exerted by mid-frontal regions whose activation depends on how much an observed action outcome results maladaptive for the onlooker.

While for the analysis of rhythmic brain activity, source directions are commonly chosen to maximize power, we suggest to maximize bicoherence instead. The resulting nonlinear cost function can be minimized effectively using a gradient approach. We argue, that bicoherence is also a generally useful tool to analyze phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), by deriving formal relations between PAC and bispectra. This is illustrated in simulated and empirical LFP data. The localization method is applied to EEG resting state data, where the most prominent bicoherence signatures originate from the occipital alpha rhythm and the mu rhythm. While the latter is hardly visible using power analysis, we observe clear bicoherence peaks in the high alpha range of sensorymotor areas. We additionally apply our method to resting-state data of subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls and observe significant bicoherence differences in motor areas which could not be found from analyzing power differences.

To further elucidate the properties of the hippocampal theta oscillations that can be used in BMI, we investigated hippocampal theta oscillations during a two-lever choice task. During the task body-restrained rats were trained with a food reward to move an e-puck robot towards them by pressing the correct lever, ipsilateral to the robot several times, using the ipsilateral forelimb. The robot carried food and moved along a semicircle track set in front of the rat. We demonstrated that the power of hippocampal theta oscillations gradually increased during a 6-s preparatory period before the start of multiple lever pressing, irrespective of whether the correct lever choice or forelimb side were used. In addition, there was a significant difference in the theta power after the first choice, between correct and incorrect trials. During the correct trials the theta power was highest during the first lever-releasing period, whereas in the incorrect trials it occurred during the second correct lever-pressing period. We also analyzed the hippocampal theta oscillations at the termination of multiple lever pressing during the correct trials. Irrespective of whether the correct forelimb side was used, the power of hippocampal theta oscillations gradually decreased with the termination of multiple lever pressing. The frequency of theta oscillation also demonstrated an increase and decrease, before and after multiple lever pressing, respectively. There was a transient increase in frequency after the first lever press during the incorrect trials, while no such increase was observed during the correct trials. These results suggested that hippocampal theta oscillations reflect some aspects of preparatory and cognitive neural activities during the robot controlling task, which could be used for BMI.

Beta oscillatory power modulation reflects the predictability of pitch change	CORTEX			English	Article						Sensory prediction; Predictive coding; Beta oscillation; P3a; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Auditory cortex	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; BAND OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION ERRORS; PHRASE BOUNDARIES; PREMOTOR CORTEX; MOTOR AREAS; BEAT	Humans process highly dynamic auditory information in real time, and regularities in stimuli such as speech and music can aid such processing by allowing sensory predictions for upcoming events. Auditory sequences contain information about both the identity of sounds (what) and their timing (when they occur). Temporal prediction in isochronous sequences is reflected in neural oscillatory power modulation in the beta band (similar to 20 Hz). Specifically, power decreases (desynchronization) after tone onset and then increases (resynchronization) to reach a maximum around the expected time of the next tone. The current study investigates whether the predictability of the pitch of a tone (what) is also reflected in beta power modulation. We presented two isochronous auditory oddball sequences, each with 20% of tones at a deviant pitch. In one sequence the deviant tones occurred regularly every fifth tone (predictably), but in the other sequence they occurred pseudorandomly (unpredictably). We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened passively to these sequences. The results showed that auditory beta power desynchronization was larger prior to a predictable than an unpredictable pitch change. A single-trial correlation analysis using linear mixed-effect (LME) models further showed that the deeper the pre-deviant beta desynchronization depth, the smaller the event-related P3a amplitude following the deviant, and this effect only occurred when the pitch change was predictable. Given that P3a is associated with attentional response to prediction error, larger beta desynchronization depth indicates better prediction of an upcoming deviant pitch. Thus, these findings suggest that beta oscillations reflect predictions for what in additional to when during dynamic auditory information processing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Event related potential analysis techniques for autism spectrum disorders: A review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Electroencephalogram; Event-related potential; Coherence; Spectrogram; Phase synchrony; Classifier	YOUNG-CHILDREN; MIRROR NEURONS; EEG COMPLEXITY; ATYPICAL FACE; CONNECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES; INDEX; AGE	Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) comprise all pervasive neurodevelopmental diseases marked by deficits in social and communication skills, delayed cognitive development, restricted and repetitive behaviors. The core symptoms begin in early childhood, may continue life-long resulting in poor performance in adult stage. Event related potential (ERP) is basically a time-locked electroencephalogram signal elicited by various stimuli, related to sensory and cognitive processes. The various ERP based techniques used for the study of ASD are considered in this review. ERP based study offers the advantage of being a non-invasive technique to measure the brain activity precisely. The techniques are categorized into three based on the processing domain: time, frequency and time frequency. Power spectral density, coherence, phase synchrony, multiscale entropy, modified multiscale entropy, sum of signed differences, synchrostates and variance are some of the measures that have been widely used to study the abnormalities in frequency bands and brain connectivity. Various signal processing techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, Short-Time Fourier Transform, Principal Component Analysis, Wavelet Transform, Directed Transfer Function etc. have been used to analyze the recorded signals so as to unravel the distinctive event-related potential patterns in individuals with ASD. The review concludes that ERP proves to be an efficient tool in detecting the brain abnormalities and connectivity issues, indicating the heterogeneity of ASD. Many advanced techniques are utilized to decipher the underlying neural circuitry so as to aid in therapeutic interventions for improving the core areas of deficits.

However, how these inputs contribute to learning and execution of voluntary sequential motor behaviors remains elusive. Here, we analyzed the independent components extracted from the local field potential (LFP) activity recorded at multiple depths of rat motor cortex during reward-motivated movement to study their roles in motor learning. Because slow gamma (30-50Hz), fast gamma (60-120Hz), and theta (4-10Hz) oscillations temporally coordinate task-relevant motor cortical activities, we first explored the behavioral state-and layer-dependent coordination of motor behavior in these frequency ranges. Consistent with previous findings, oscillations in the slow and fast gamma bands dominated during distinct movement states, i.e., preparation and execution states, respectively. However, we identified a novel independent component that dominantly appeared in deep cortical layers and exhibited enhanced slow gamma activity during the execution state. Then, we used the four major independent components to train a recurrent network model for the same lever movements as the rats performed. We show that the independent components differently contribute to the formation of various task-related activities, but they also play overlapping roles in motor learning.

In a first experiment, young and elderly human participants of both genders performed an established WM paradigm probing inhibitory abilities by means of valid, invalid, and neutral retro-cues. Elderly participants showed an overall cost, especially in performing invalid trials, whereas younger participants' general performance was comparatively higher, as expected. Inhibitory abilities have been linked to alpha brain oscillations but it is yet unknown whether in aging these oscillations (also typically impoverished) and inhibitory abilities are causally linked. To probe this possible causal link in aging, we compared in a second experiment parietal alpha-transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with either no stimulation (Sham) or with two control stimulation frequencies (theta-and gamma-tACS) in the elderly group while performing the same WM paradigm. Alpha-(but not theta-or gamma-) tACS selectively and significantly improved performance (now comparable to younger adults' performance in the first experiment), particularly for invalid cues where initially elderly showed the highest costs. Alpha oscillations are therefore causally linked to inhibitory abilities and frequency-tuned alpha-tACS interventions can selectively change these abilities in the elderly.

We report a study that addressed this question by examining the effects of oscillatory tDCS (otDCS) on subsequent episodic memory performance and concomitant recordings of neural oscillations. Neural oscillations in the theta band (4-7 Hz) have been shown to be important for episodic memory and especially for source memory retrieval. Here, we tested the effects of anodal otDCS at theta (5.5 Hz) over the left DLPFC on theta oscillations and memory performance. In two sessions, participants completed an item and source recognition paradigm with word stimuli. Between study and test, participants received otDCS in one session and sham stimulation in the other. Surprisingly, behavioral results showed that, relative to the sham stimulation, otDCS impaired source memory performance. Analyses of EEG data during memory retrieval revealed that otDCS changed pre-stimulus theta power and in particular reduced the specificity of theta activity during source memory retrieval. Our results suggest that non-invasive brain stimulation can impact memory and oscillatory activity in counterintuitive ways, and that direct neural activity measures can facilitate meaningful interpretation of behavioral effects of stimulation.

Classification of motor imagery electroencephalography signals using spiking neurons with different input encoding strategies	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Brain-computer Interfaces; Wavelet; Particle swarm optimization; Pattern classification	EXECUTION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; MODEL	Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces decode users' intentions from the electroencephalogram; however, poor spatial resolution makes automatic recognition of these intentions a challenging task. New classification approaches with low computational costs and high classification performances need to be developed in order to increase the number of users benefitted by these systems. On the other hand, spiking neuron models, which are mathematical abstractions of real neurons, have shown good performances in several classification tasks, making these models suitable for motor imagery classification. In this work, two different encoding strategies for spiking neuron models, applied to the classification of motor imagery time-frequency features of stroke patients and healthy subjects, were evaluated. Classification performances and computational costs of spiking neuron models were compared against those of linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines and artificial neural networks. Results showed that a time-varying encoding strategy is more suitable for motor imagery classification, and its implementation computational cost is low. Therefore, a spiking neuron model with a time-varying encoding strategy could increase the number of potential users of brain-computer interfaces.

Meditation practice is associated with improvement in concentration and reduction of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, different forms of meditation training are now being used as interventions for a variety of psychological and somatic illnesses. These benefits are thought to occur as a result of neurophysiologic changes. Themost commonly studied specificmeditation practices are focused attention (FA), open-monitoring (OM), as well as transcendental meditation (TM), and loving-kindness (LK) meditation. In this review, we compare the neural oscillatory patterns during these forms of meditation. Method: We performed a systematic review of neural oscillations during FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation practices, comparing meditators to meditation-naive adults. Results: FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation are associated with global increases in oscillatory activity inmeditators compared tomeditation-naive adults, with larger changes occurring as the length of meditation training increases. While FA and OM are related to increases in anterior theta activity, only FA is associated with changes in posterior theta oscillations. Alpha activity increases in posterior brain regions during both FA and OM. In anterior regions, FA shows a bilateral increase in alpha power, while OM shows a decrease only in left-sided power. Gamma activity in these meditation practices is similar in frontal regions, but increases are variable in parietal and occipital regions. Conclusions: The current literature suggests distinct differences in neural oscillatory activity among FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation practices. Further characterizing these oscillatory changes may better elucidate the cognitive and therapeutic effects of specific meditation practices, and potentially lead to the development of novel neuromodulation targets to take advantage of their benefits.

Recent work using time frequency measures has proved promising in understanding the neurophysiology behind auditory change detection. These measures, unfortunately, have not been fully studied in children. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the spectro-temporal characteristics of the MMN response using words in healthy Mexicans preschool children. Method: 20 children (10 boys and 10 girls) of preschool age participated a neuropsychological evaluation and an auditory discrimination task during EEG recording. Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) and Inter-Trial Coherence (ITC) was obtained for frequent and infrequent trials. Results: The ERP showed a typical MMN and LDN response. ERSP increases in the theta band corresponded to the auditory change detection, though no differences between boys and girls was found. Conclusions: In Mexican preschool children, the MMN is like what has been previously reported in adults. However, in contrast to similar studies, sex did not influence the neurophysiological measures. Significance: We established parameters for future research in children using the MMN.

How this is realized remains an open question. We evaluate the hypothesis that learning success is associated with a specific phenomenology. To address this proposal, we combined quantitative and qualitative analyses of a short neurofeedback training (NFT) session during which participants enhanced mid-frontal alpha power and were then subsequently interviewed about their experiences. We analyzed the electrophysiological data to determine learning success and classify trainees as learners and non-learners. The subjective experiences differed between the two groups and are best described along a trying-sensing continuum, with non-learners engaging effortfully with the task (e.g., "I will it [the bar] to move") whereas learners reported more sensing of their inner (e.g., "Something inside my stomach") and outer environment (e.g., "I was aware of the sound of the beeps"). In the process of piloting this mixed-method approach, we developed a classification system for the verbal reports. This system provides an explicit analytic framework which might guide future studies that aim to investigate the association between subjective experiences and NFT protocols.

Low-Frequency Oscillatory Correlates of Auditory Predictive Processing in Cortical-Subcortical Networks: A MEG-Study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GRANGER CAUSALITY ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG-DATA; HIPPOCAMPAL; NOVELTY	Emerging evidence supports the role of neural oscillations as a mechanism for predictive information processing across large-scale networks. However, the oscillatory signatures underlying auditory mismatch detection and information flow between brain regions remain unclear. To address this issue, we examined the contribution of oscillatory activity at theta/alpha-bands (4-8/8-13 Hz) and assessed directed connectivity in magnetoencephalographic data while 17 human participants were presented with sound sequences containing predictable repetitions and order manipulations that elicited prediction-error responses. We characterized the spectro-temporal properties of neural generators using a minimum-norm approach and assessed directed connectivity using Granger Causality analysis. Mismatching sequences elicited increased theta power and phase-locking in auditory, hippocampal and prefrontal cortices, suggesting that theta-band oscillations underlie prediction-error generation in cortical-subcortical networks. Furthermore, enhanced feedforward theta/alpha-band connectivity was observed in auditory-prefrontal networks during mismatching sequences, while increased feedback connectivity in the alpha-band was observed between hippocampus and auditory regions during predictable sounds. Our findings highlight the involvement of hippocampal theta/alpha-band oscillations towards auditory prediction-error generation and suggest a spectral dissociation between inter-areal feedforward vs. feedback signalling, thus providing novel insights into the oscillatory mechanisms underlying auditory predictive processing.

Current models posit that perceptual resilience to accelerated speech is limited by the brain's ability to parse speech into syllabic units using delta/theta oscillations. Here, we investigated whether the involvement of neuronal oscillations in processing accelerated speech also relates to their scale-free amplitude modulation as indexed by the strength of long-range temporal correlations (LRTC). We recorded MEG while 24 human subjects (12 females) listened to radio news uttered at different comprehensible rates, at a mostly unintelligible rate and at this same speed interleaved with silence gaps. delta, theta, and low-gamma oscillations followed the nonlinear variation of comprehension, with LRTC rising only at the highest speed. In contrast, increasing the rate was associated with a monotonic increase in LRTC in high-gamma activity. When intelligibility was restored with the insertion of silence gaps, LRTC in the delta, theta, and low-gamma oscillations resumed the low levels observed for intelligible speech. Remarkably, the lower the individual subject scaling exponents of delta/theta oscillations, the greater the comprehension of the fastest speech rate. Moreover, the strength of LRTC of the speech envelope decreased at the maximal rate, suggesting an inverse relationship with the LRTC of brain dynamics when comprehension halts. Our findings show that scale-free amplitude modulation of cortical oscillations and speech signals are tightly coupled to speech uptake capacity.

The lifespan trajectory of neural oscillatory activity in the motor system	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Motor control; Precentral gyrus; Movement; Beta ERD	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SEPARATION METHOD; HUMAN BRAIN; MOVEMENT; MEG; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	Numerous studies connect beta oscillations in the motor cortices to volitional movement, and beta is known to be aberrant in multiple movement disorders. However, the dynamic interplay between these beta oscillations, motor performance, and spontaneous beta power (e.g., during rest) in the motor cortices remains unknown. This study utilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate these three parameters and their lifespan trajectory in 57 healthy participants aged 9-75 years old. Movement-related beta activity was imaged using a beamforming approach, and voxel time series data were extracted from the peak voxels in the primary motor cortices. Our results indicated that spontaneous beta power during rest followed a quadratic lifespan trajectory, while movement-related beta oscillations linearly increased with age. Follow-on analyses showed that spontaneous beta power and the beta minima during movement, together, significantly predicted task performance above and beyond the effects of age. These data are the first to show lifespan trajectories among measures of beta activity in the motor cortices, and suggest that the healthy brain compensates for age-related increases in spontaneous beta activity by increasing the strength of beta oscillations within the motor cortices which, when successful, enables normal motor performance into later life.

Time and frequency dependent changes in resting state EEG functional connectivity following lipopolysaccharide challenge in rats	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTERLEUKIN-1-BETA MESSENGER-RNA; DEPRESSIVE-LIKE BEHAVIOR; KYNURENIC ACID; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC RHYTHMS; INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE; PERIPHERAL INJECTION; CORTICAL SOURCES; RECEPTOR 1; BRAIN; EXPRESSION	Research has shown that inflammatory processes affect brain function and behavior through several neuroimmune pathways. However, high order brain functions affected by inflammation largely remain to be defined. Resting state functional connectivity of synchronized oscillatory activity is a valid approach to understand network processing and high order brain function under different experimental conditions. In the present study multi-electrode EEG recording in awake, freely moving rats was used to study resting state connectivity after administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Male Wistar rats were implanted with 10 cortical surface electrodes and administered with LPS (2 mg/kg) and monitored for symptoms of sickness at 3, 6 and 24 h. Resting state connectivity and power were computed at baseline, 6 and 24 h. Three prominent connectivity bands were identified using a method resistant to spurious correlation: alpha (5-15 Hz), beta-gamma (20-80 Hz), and high frequency oscillation (150-200 Hz). The most prominent connectivity band, alpha, was strongly reduced 6 h after LPS administration, and returned to baseline at 24 h. Betagamma connectivity was also reduced at 6 h and remained reduced at 24 h. Interestingly, high frequency oscillation connectivity remained unchanged at 6 h and was impaired 24 h after LPS challenge. Expected elevations in delta and theta power were observed at 6 h after LPS administration, when behavioral symptoms of sickness were maximal. Notably, gamma and high frequency power were reduced 6 h after LPS and returned to baseline by 24 h, when the effects on connectivity were more evident. Finally, increases in cross-frequency coupling elicited by LPS were detected at 6 h for theta-gamma and at 24 h for theta-high frequency oscillations. These studies show that LPS challenge profoundly affects EEG connectivity across all identified bands in a time-dependent manner indicating that inflammatory processes disrupt both bottom-up and top-down communication across the cortex during the peak and resolution of inflammation.

J	Zhang, X; Xu, GH; Zhang, X; Wu, QQ				Zhang, Xin; Xu, Guanghua; Zhang, Xun; Wu, Qingqiang			A Light Spot Humanoid Motion Paradigm Modulated by the Change of Brightness to Recognize the Stride Motion Frequency	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; steady-state visual evoked potential; motion modulated by the change of brightness; same frequency stimulation; stride motion frequency	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SSVEP BCI; STIMULATION	The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) usually has the advantages of high information transfer rate (ITR) and no need for training. However, low frequencies, such as the human stride motion frequency, cannot easily induce SSVEP. To solve this problem, a light spot humanoid motion paradigm modulated by the change of brightness was designed in this study. The characteristics of the brain response to the motion paradigm modulated by the change of brightness were analyzed for the first time. The results showed that the designed paradigm could induce not only the high flicker frequency but also the modulation frequencies between the change of brightness and the motion in the primary visual cortex. Thus, the stride motion frequency can be recognized through the modulation frequencies by using the designed paradigm. Also, in an online experiment, this paradigm was employed to control a lower limb robot to achieve same frequency stimulation, which meant that the visual stimulation frequency was the same as the motion frequency of the robot. Also, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to distinguish three different stride motion frequencies. The average accuracies of the classification in three walking speeds using the designed paradigm with the same and different high frequencies reached 87 and 95% respectively. Furthermore, the angles of the knee joint of the robot were obtained to demonstrate the feasibility of the electroencephalograph (EEG)-driven robot with same stimulation.

Facilitated Event-Related Power Modulations during Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) Revealed by Concurrent tACS-MEG	ENEURO			English	Article						Cognitive performance; event-related oscillations; MEG; online effects; transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; MENTAL ROTATION; EEG ALPHA; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; SIGNALS	Non-invasive approaches to modulate oscillatory activity in the brain are increasingly popular in the scientific community. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations in a frequency-specific manner. However, due to a massive stimulation artifact at the targeted frequency, little is known about effects of tACS during stimulation. It remains unclear how the continuous application of tACS affects event-related oscillations during cognitive tasks. Depending on whether tACS influences pre-or post-stimulus oscillations, or both, the endogenous, event-related oscillatory dynamics could be pushed in various directions or not at all. A better understanding of these effects is crucial to plan, predict, and understand outcomes of solely behavioral tACS experiments. In the present study, a recently proposed procedure to suppress tACS artifacts by projecting MEG data into source-space using spatial filtering was utilized to recover event-related power modulations in the alpha-band during a mental rotation task. MEG data of 25 human subjects was continuously recorded. After 10-minute baseline measurement, participants received either 20 minutes of tACS at their individual alpha frequency or sham stimulation. Another 40 minutes of MEG data were acquired thereafter. Data were projected into source-space and carefully examined for residual artifacts. Results revealed strong facilitation of event-related power modulations in the alpha-band during tACS application. These results provide first direct evidence that tACS does not counteract top-down suppression of intrinsic oscillations, but rather enhances pre-existent power modulations within the range of the individual alpha (similar to stimulation) frequency.

The spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) is among the physiological techniques making it possible to formulate a direct estimation of specific features of the activity of the human brain during manual movements. Purpose: This study is devoted to an investigation of brain processes in men with a high or a low individual alpha-frequency determined during manual movements executed by the subdominant hand. Methods: A test group consisting of 104 right-handed healthy men from the ages of 19 to 21 was divided into 2 groups in terms of the average magnitude of their individual alpha-frequency (I alpha F)-groups with high (n = 53, I alpha F >= 10.04 Hz) and low (n = 51, I alpha F <= 10.04 Hz) values of IaF. The power and coherence of the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex as well as the differences between the groups were evaluated by the testees during manual movements executed by the subdominant hand. Results: Manual movements executed by the subdominant hand in response to the sensory signals are generally accompanied by the increased coherence of the EEG frequency components, especially, in the frontal, anterior temporal and central brain regions in men with different alpha-activity characteristics. Under these conditions, it has been found some electrogenesis power lowering in the cortical areas responsible for the sensory analysis, motor programming, sensory and motor information integration. Such changes have been combined with the local power increase of theta-, alpha 1-oscillations in the frontal leads. Additionally, men with a low IaF were characterized by the local growth of alpha 3-activity in the frontal areas of their cortex. Men from both groups also had the generalized increase in the capacity of the high-frequency beta 2-and gamma-oscillations. Some higher power and coherence of the EEG frequency components have been registered in men with the low I alpha F in comparison with men having some high alpha-frequency. Conclusion: The functional content of the established differences may generally reflect some relatively lower tone of the cortex activation in men with a low I alpha F and can be specifically compensated by some increased "intensity" and the redundancy of brain processes.

Methods: Twenty adult Wistar rats underwent polygraphic recordings of EEG, EMG, and eye movements during the transition periods. The studied EEG variables included the time of occurrence of the last sleep spindle and the evolution of the amplitudes of delta (1-5 Hz), theta (6-9 Hz), and high-frequency (110-160 Hz) oscillations (HFO). Motor variables included the development of atonia in the acromiotrapezius muscle and the occurrence of the first REM. The phase-amplitude coupling between theta and HFO was also analyzed. Results: The transition periods started with the onset of., followed by HFO onset and the decline of delta activities. From onset, HFO amplitude was coupled to the phase of theta. The first REM and the last sleep spindle coincided with the complete extinction of delta. At that point, the muscle tonus started to decrease, reaching its atonia when HFO achieved maximum amplitude. Conclusions: As the development of HFO delimited the duration of all transitional changes with precision, it can be considered a good delimiter for the transition period. Furthermore, as transitional changes occurred in a precise sequence, alterations in their temporal dynamics could be of interest in the study of sleep disorders and pathologies.

The absence of visual input to the retina can also induce changes in entrainment of the circadian rhythm, as light is the primary zeitgeber of the master biological clock found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In addition, a greater number of sleep disturbances is often reported in blind individuals. Here, we examined various electroencephalographic microstructural components of sleep, both during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep, between blind individuals, including both of early and late onset, and normal-sighted controls. During wakefulness, occipital alpha oscillations were lower, or absent in blind individuals. During sleep, differences were observed across electrode derivations between the early and late blind samples, which may reflect altered cortical networking in early blindness. Despite these differences in power spectra density, the electroencephalography microstructure of sleep, including sleep spindles, slow wave activity, and sawtooth waves, remained present in the absence of vision.

Here, we investigated the effects of radiofrequency (RF) fields emitted by new-generation mobile technologies, specifically, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE), on intrinsic scalp EEG activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) and cognitive performance in the Stroop test. The study involved 60 healthy, young-adult university students (34 for UMTS and 26 for LTE) with double-blind administration of Real and Sham exposure in separate sessions. EEG was recorded before, during and after RF exposure, and Stroop performance was assessed before and after EEG recording. Both RF exposure types caused a notable decrease in the alpha power over the whole scalp that persisted even after the cessation of the exposure, whereas no effects were found on any aspects of performance in the Stroop test. The results imply that the brain networks underlying global alpha oscillations might require minor reconfiguration to adapt to the local biophysical changes caused by focal RF exposure mimicking MP use.

J	Roy, A				Roy, Arnab			Examining dynamic functional relationships in a pathological brain using evolutionary computation	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Dynamic functional connectivity; Time-frequency analysis; Evolutionary computation; EEG; Alcoholism; Feature subset selection; Graph simulation	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; SMALL-WORLD; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; FEATURE-SELECTION; NEURAL RECRUITMENT; CONNECTIVITY; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; MRI; RECONFIGURATION	Neuropathological conditions often result in abnormal functional relationship between different regions in the brain and are specific to certain spectral bands that are not known in advance. Typically, these abnormalities are spatially and temporally very localized in nature, and detecting these changes can be clinically very useful. In this article, a novel evolutionary computation-based procedure is introduced to discover such localized changes in a data-driven manner. Given a predefined set of regions of interest (ROIs), the procedure automatically detects a subset of ROIs, a time window, and a frequency band, such that the functional relationship among the ROIs significantly differ between controls and neuropathological cases; the procedure makes no prior assumptions regarding the spectral characteristics of the data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure, a publicly available EEG dataset of 46 alcoholics and 31 controls is used. In all, 100 cross-validation runs are performed. Using the procedure, many weakened inter-hemispheric functional connections, primarily between the left and the right parietal lobe sensors, are detected in chronic alcoholics. For these functional connections, gamma band (35-50 Hz) activity in 200-400 ms window was found to be significantly different between alcoholics and controls. These results are consistent with the existing literature and helps to validate the procedure. In addition, the procedure is also tested via simulation using a graph generation model with known characteristics, and its general utility to brain imaging literature is discussed.

Non-linear transfer characteristics of stimulation and recording hardware account for spurious low-frequency artifacts during amplitude modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS)	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Amplitude modulated transcranial alternating; current stimulation (AM-tACS); MEG; EEG; Artifact; tACS; Stimulation hardware	BRAIN-STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; EEG; DISORDERS; SIGNALS	Amplitude modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS) has been recently proposed as a possible solution to overcome the pronounced stimulation artifact encountered when recording brain activity during tACS. In theory, AM-tACS does not entail power at its modulating frequency, thus avoiding the problem of spectral overlap between brain signal of interest and stimulation artifact. However, the current study demonstrates how weak non-linear transfer characteristics inherent to stimulation and recording hardware can reintroduce spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency. The input-output transfer functions (TFs) of different stimulation setups were measured. Setups included recordings of signal-generator and stimulator outputs and M/EEG phantom measurements. 6th-degree polynomial regression models were fitted to model the input-output TFs of each setup. The resulting TF models were applied to digitally generated AM-tACS signals to predict the frequency of spurious artifacts in the spectrum. All four setups measured for the study exhibited low-frequency artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics when recording AM-tACS. Fitted TF models showed non-linear contributions significantly different from zero (all p < .05) and successfully predicted the frequency of artifacts observed in AM-signal recordings. Results suggest that even weak non-linearities of stimulation and recording hardware can lead to spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics. These artifacts were substantially larger than alpha-oscillations of a human subject in the MEG. Findings emphasize the need for more linear stimulation devices for AM-tACS and careful analysis procedures, taking into account low-frequency artifacts to avoid confusion with effects of AM-tACS on the brain.

Bilateral cortical representation of tactile roughness	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Touch; Bilateral; Somatosensory cortex; Roughness; EEG	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; HUMAN BRAIN; STIMULATION; RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; VIBRATION	Roughness is the most important feature for texture discrimination. Here we investigate how the bilateral cortical representation of touch is modulated by tactile roughness by analyzing the neural responses elicited by stimuli with various coarseness levels ranging from fine to medium. A prolonged stimulation was delivered to 10 healthy subjects by passively sliding tactile stimuli under the fingertip while recording the EEG to study the modulation of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) as well as activity in the theta and alpha bands. Elicited long-latency SEPs, namely bilateral P100-N140 and frontal P240 were consistent across stimuli. On the contrary, the temporal lag N140 - P240 was non linearly modulated both in contralateral and ipsilateral sides, in agreement with literature. Using a time-frequency analysis approach, we identified a theta band power increase in the [0 0.5]s interval and a partially overlapped power decrease in the alpha band which lasted throughout the stimulation. The estimated time these two phenomena were overlapped was comparable across stimuli, whereas a linear decrease in alpha band amplitude was reported when increasing the stimulus roughness in both contralateral and ipsilateral sides. This study showed that the selected tactile stimuli generated physiological bilateral responses that were modulated in a diversified way according to the stimulus roughness and side. Specifically, we identified sensory processing features (i.e., theta and alpha time overlap) invariant to the stimulus roughness (i.e., associated to a basic cortical mechanism of touch) and roughness-dependent cortical outputs comparable in the contralateral and ipsilateral sides that confirm a bilateral processing of tactile information.

The revised Cerebral Recovery Index improves predictions of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Quantitative EEG; Cardiac arrest; Post anoxic Coma; Machine learning; Medical informatics	BISPECTRAL INDEX; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; SUPPRESSION RATIO; ENTROPY MEASURES; EEG; PROGNOSTICATION; RESUSCITATION; BRAIN; PATTERNS	Objective: Analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) background pattern helps predicting neurological outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest (CA). Visual analysis may not extract all discriminative information. We present predictive values of the revised Cerebral Recovery Index (rCRI), based on continuous extraction and combination of a large set of evolving quantitative EEG (qEEG) features and machine learning techniques. Methods: We included 551 subsequent patients from a prospective cohort study on continuous EEG after CA in two hospitals. Outcome at six months was classified as good (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2) or poor (CPC 3-5). Forty-four qEEG features (from time, frequency and entropy domain) were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and used in a Random Forests classification system. We trained and evaluated the system with 10-fold cross validation. For poor outcome prediction, the sensitivity at 100% specificity (Se-100) and the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) were used as performance of the prediction model. For good outcome, we used the sensitivity at 95% specificity (Se-95). Results: Two hundred fifty-six (47%) patients had a good outcome. The rCRI predicted poor outcome with AUC = 0.94 (95% CI: 0.83-0.91), Se-100 = 0.66 (0.65-0.78), and AUC = 0.88 (0.78-0.93), Se-100 = 0.60 (0.510.75) at 12 and 24 h after CA, respectively. The rCRI predicted good outcome with Se-95 = 0.72 (0.61-0.85) and 0.40 (0.30-0.51) at 12 and 24 h after CA, respectively. Conclusions: Results obtained in this study suggest that with machine learning algorithms and large set of qEEG features, it is possible to efficiently monitor patient outcome after CA. We also demonstrate the importance of selection of optimal performance metric to train a classifier model for outcome prediction. Significance: The rCRI is a sensitive, reliable predictor of neurological outcome of comatose patients after CA. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Neural Signatures of the Processing of Temporal Patterns in Sound	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; entrainment; neural synchronization; stimulus statistics; sustained activity; temporal regularity	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SUSTAINED POTENTIALS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; AGING AFFECTS; ENTRAINMENT; MODULATION; ATTENTION; REPETITION	The ability to detect regularities in sound (i.e., recurring structure) is critical for effective perception, enabling, for example, change detection and prediction. Two seemingly unconnected lines of research concern the neural operations involved in processing regularities: one investigates how neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularities (e.g., frequency modulation; FM) in sounds, whereas the other focuses on increases in sustained activity during stimulation with repeating tone-frequency patterns. In three electroencephalography studies with male and female human participants, we investigated whether neural synchronization and sustained neural activity are dissociable, or whether they are functionally interdependent. Experiment I demonstrated that neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularity (FM) in sounds, and that sustained activity increases concomitantly. In Experiment II, phase coherence of FM in sounds was parametrically varied. Although neural synchronization was more sensitive to changes in FM coherence, such changes led to a systematic modulation of both neural synchronization and sustained activity, with magnitude increasing as coherence increased. In Experiment III, participants either performed a duration categorization task on the sounds, or a visual object tracking task to distract attention. Neural synchronization was observed regardless of task, whereas the sustained response was observed only when attention was on the auditory task, not under (visual) distraction. The results suggest that neural synchronization and sustained activity levels are functionally linked: both are sensitive to regularities in soun(d)s. However, neural synchronization might reflect a more sensory-driven response to regularity, compared with sustained activity which may be influenced by attentional, contextual, or other experiential factors.

The goal of this study was to characterise the subjective experiences and accompanying EEG changes with subanaesthetic doses of ketamine. Methods: High-density EEG was recorded in 15 human volunteers before, during, and after subanaesthetic ketamine infusion (0.5 mg kg(-1) over 40 min), with self-reported measures of altered states of consciousness obtained after ketamine exposure. Sensor- and source-level EEG changes were analysed with a focus on spectral power and regional changes. Results: Ketamine-induced altered states were characterised predominantly by dissociative experiences such as disembodiment and ego transcendence; sensory disturbances were also common. Ketamine broadly decreased low-frequency power, with mean reductions largest at alpha (8-12 Hz) in parietal ( 0.94 dB, P<0.001) and occipital ( 1.8 dB, P<0.001) channel clusters. Significant decreases in alpha were identified in the precuneus and temporal-parietal junction. Conclusions: Ketamine induces altered states of consciousness during periods of reduced alpha power in the precuneus and temporal-parietal junction. Modulation of these temporal-parietal loci are candidate mechanisms of the psychoactive effects of ketamine, given that this region is involved in multisensory integration, body representation, and consciousness.

Robust and Gaussian spatial functional regression models for analysis of event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Bayesian methods; Event-related potential; Functional data analysis; Functional mixed models; Functional regression; Correlated normal-exponential-gamma	MIXED MODELS; EEG; INFERENCE; BRAIN	Event-related potentials (ERPs) summarize electrophysiological brain response to specific stimuli. They can be considered as correlated functions of time with both spatial correlation across electrodes and nested correlations within subjects. Commonly used analytical methods for ERPs often focus on pre-determined extracted components and/or ignore the correlation among electrodes or subjects, which can miss important insights, and tend to be sensitive to outlying subjects, time points or electrodes. Motivated by ERP data in a smoking cessation study, we introduce a Bayesian spatial functional regression framework that models the entire ERPs as spatially correlated functional responses and the stimulus types as covariates. This novel framework relies on mixed models to characterize the effects of stimuli while simultaneously accounting for the multilevel correlation structure. The spatial correlation among the ERP profiles is captured through basis-space Matern assumptions that allow either separable or nonseparable spatial correlations over time. We induce both adaptive regularization over time and spatial smoothness across electrodes via a correlated normal-exponential-gamma (CNEG) prior on the fixed effect coefficient functions. Our proposed framework includes both Gaussian models as well as robust models using heavier-tailed distributions to make the regression automatically robust to outliers. We introduce predictive methods to select among Gaussian vs. robust models and models with separable vs. non-separable spatiotemporal correlation structures. Our proposed analysis produces global tests for stimuli effects across entire time (or time-frequency) and electrode domains, plus multiplicity-adjusted pointwise inference based on experiment-wise error rate or false discovery rate to flag spatiotemporal (or spatio-temporal-frequency) regions that characterize stimuli differences, and can also produce inference for any prespecified waveform components. Our analysis of the smoking cessation ERP data set reveals numerous effects across different types of visual stimuli.

Spectral EEG Characteristics in Patients with Neurological Spinal Cervical-Level Disorders: Dependence on the Temperament	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ongoing EEG; spectral composition; human constitution (constitution of the person); temperament; vertebroneurology; cervical spine; neck pain; cervicalgia; cervicocranialgia		Effects of temperament as a constitutional feature of higher nervous activity on the spectral characteristics of ongoing EEG activity were examined in 54 patients with neurological spinal cervical-level disorders (cervicocranialgies, cervicalgies, and cervicobrachialgies). Four types of temperaments were classified in the examined patients, choleric (group ChT, n = 22), sanguine (ST, n = 10), melancholic (MT, n = 19), and phlegmatic (PhT, n = 3). Spectral analysis of EEGs showed that normalized powers of the rhythm in some cortical areas of patients of the PhT group were lower than those in patients of groups ChT, MT, and ST (P < 0.05). The most significant intergroup specificity of the EEG patterns was found in the normalized power of the 1 and 2 subrhythms. In patients of the MT and PhT groups, these indices were noticeably greater than those in ST and ChT subjects (P< 0.05 and P< 0.01, respectively). As was found, the power of oscillations correlated with the temperament-related indices, negatively with the estimates of extra/introversion and positively with the neuroticism level (P < 0.05). Thus, temperament-related specificities are in a certain way reflected in the characteristics of mostly activity and, therefore, are dependent on the level of activity of the cerebral reticular formation.

Focused attention (FA) meditation is associated with greater control over this process, yet the neuronal mechanisms underlying this ability are not entirely understood. Here, we hypothesize that the capacity of attention to transiently focus and swiftly change relates to the critical dynamics emerging when neuronal systems balance at a point of instability between order and disorder. In FA meditation, however, the ability to stay focused is trained, which may be associated with a more homogeneous brain state. To test this hypothesis, we applied analytical tools from criticality theory to EEG in meditation practitioners and meditation-naive participants from two independent labs. We show that in practitioners but not in controls FA meditation strongly suppressed long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of neuronal oscillations relative to eyes-closed rest with remarkable consistency across frequency bands and scalp locations. The ability to reduce LRTC during meditation increased after one year of additional training and was associated with the subjective experience of fully engaging one's attentional resources, also known as absorption. Sustained practice also affected normal waking brain dynamics as reflected in increased LRTC during an eyes-closed rest state, indicating that brain dynamics are altered beyond the meditative state. Taken together, our findings suggest that the framework of critical brain dynamics is promising for understanding neuronal mechanisms of meditative states and, specifically, we have identified a clear electrophysiological correlate of the FA meditation state.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of acute and subchronic chocolate intake on electrical brain oscillations. A study with 20 healthy subjects (mean age of 24.15 years) and a control group with five subjects (mean age of 23.2 years) was carried out. In the acute effect study, the subjects' intake was dark chocolate (103.72 mg/kg of body weight) rich in flavonoids and low in calories as in fasting. In the control group, the subjects intake was only low-calorie milk. For the subchronic effect, a daily dose of dark chocolate was given for eight days. The baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded before dark chocolate intake; at 30 min, the second EEG was carried out; on the eighth day, the third and fourth EEGs were performed before and after the last intake. In acute and subchronic intake, Delta Absolute Power (AP) decrease was observed in most brain regions (p < 0.05), except in the right fronto-centro-temporal regions. In the Theta band, there was a generalized decrease of the AP of predominance in the left fronto-centro-temporal regions. In contrast, an increase in AP was observed in the temporo-occipital regions in the Alpha band, and in the right temporal and parieto-occipital regions in the Beta band. The control group did not have significant changes in brain oscillations (p > 0.05). We concluded that acute and subchronic chocolate intake decreased the Delta and Theta AP and increased Alpha and Beta AP in most brain regions.

However, collecting the template (or calibration) data for each individual can be time-consuming and laborious. This issue can be alleviated by employing phase-coded visual stimuli because phase information could be discriminated by using templates synthesized from the template induced by a visual stimulus. Minimizing phase intervals between two adjacent visual stimuli could increase the number of stimuli without increasing the calibration cost. Nonetheless, no study has investigated the effects of the phase interval on the classification performance. This study compared the classification accuracy of SSVEPs with five different phase intervals (0.1 pi, 0.2 pi, 0.3 pi, 0.4 pi, and 0.5 pi) using synthesized individual templates with task-related component analysis (TRCA)-based spatial filtering. From a public 12-class SSVEP dataset, phase-adjusted SSVEP data were created by adding time shifts according to the five phase intervals. The classification results showed that the accuracy was sufficiently high when the phase intervals were over 0.3 pi, suggesting the use of up to six phase-shifted visual stimuli at a given frequency.

In rat pups across the first two postnatal weeks, active sleep promotes the expression of synchronized oscillatory activity within and between cortical and subcortical sensorimotor structures. Sensory feedback from self-generated myoclonic twitches-which are produced exclusively during active sleep-also triggers neural oscillations in those structures. We have proposed that one of the functions of active sleep in early infancy is to provide a context for synchronizing developing structures. Specifically, neural oscillations contribute to a variety of neurodevelopmental processes, including synapse formation, neuronal differentiation and migration, apoptosis, and the refinement of topographic maps. In addition, synchronized oscillations promote functional connectivity between distant brain areas. Consequently, any condition or manipulation that restricts active sleep can, in turn, deprive the infant animal of substantial sensory experience, resulting in atypical developmental trajectories.

Examining different subgroups of patients based on their symptomatology is thus very informative in understanding the role of neural oscillation patterns in schizophrenia. In the present study we examined whether neural oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands correlate with positive and negative symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) during rest. Resting-state brain activity of 39 SZ and 25 neurotypical controls was recorded using magnetoencephalography. Patients were categorized based on the severity of their positive and negative symptoms. Spectral analyses of beamformer data revealed that patients high in positive symptoms showed widespread low alpha power, and alpha power was negatively correlated with positive symptoms. In contrast, patients high in negative symptoms showed greater beta power in left hemisphere regions than those low in negative symptoms, and beta power was positively correlated with negative symptoms. We further discuss these findings and suggest that different neural mechanisms may underlie positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

Dynamic frontotemporal systems process space and time in working memory	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG-DATA; PHASE; SYNCHRONY; NETWORKS; TOOLBOX; SUPPORT; CONTEXT	How do we rapidly process incoming streams of information in working memory, a cognitive mechanism central to human behavior? Dominant views of working memory focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but human hippocampal recordings provide a neurophysiological signature distinct from the PFC. Are these regions independent, or do they interact in the service of working memory? We addressed this core issue in behavior by recording directly from frontotemporal sites in humans performing a visuospatial working memory task that operationalizes the types of identity and spatiotemporal information we encounter every day. Theta band oscillations drove bidirectional interactions between the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL; including the hippocampus). MTL theta oscillations directed the PFC preferentially during the processing of spatiotemporal information, while PFC theta oscillations directed the MTL for all types of information being processed in working memory. These findings reveal an MTL theta mechanism for processing space and time and a domain-general PFC theta mechanism, providing evidence that rapid, dynamic MTL - PFC interactions underlie working memory for everyday experiences.

Evidence concerning verbal and nonverbal coordination as predictors of therapeutic alliance and outcome in psychotherapy has been cumulating. These, along with others results in the field of social neuroscience, suggest that behavioural coordination may have neurophysiological correlates, which play a role in the regulatory process in psychotherapy. Here we introduce an observational paradigm and analytic method to assess the joint neurodynamic activity of patient and therapist. Additionally we report results from ongoing psychotherapy sessions. Our work highlights the involvement of brain activity in the psychotherapeutic process and provides novel insights on how psychotherapy works, in order to further the understanding of the embodied characteristic of the therapeutic interaction.

We made this exploration during the execution of the mental visualization of a motor task consisting of performing a self-invented ordered sequence of body movements. The sample consisted in the EEG of 9 professional dancers recorded during the process of imagining the sequence of movements. To study the variation of the order/chaos activity and the synchronic relationship of this balance between different regions of the cerebral cortex, we estimated the Hurst exponent and used linear Spearman correlations to evaluate order/chaos fluctuations synchronicity. The results showed H>0.5 values in all the electrodes, showing a strong self-similar and persistent brain activity during the imagination process. In addition, high order/chaos fluctuation synchrony indexes were found for the inter-hemispheric frontal and occipital areas in all the subjects, but poor order/chaos synchrony between temporal areas.

An ability to map seizure-generating brain tissue, i.e. the seizure onset zone (SOZ), without recording actual seizures could reduce the duration of invasive EEG monitoring for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A widely-adopted practice in the literature is to compare the incidence (events/time) of putative pathological electrophysiological biomarkers associated with epileptic brain tissue with the SOZ determined from spontaneous seizures recorded with intracranial EEG, primarily using a single biomarker. Clinical translation of the previous efforts suffers from their inability to generalize across multiple patients because of (a) the inter-patient variability and (b) the temporal variability in the epileptogenic activity. Approach. Here, we report an artificial intelligence-based approach for combining multiple interictal electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics as a way of accounting for the above barriers and show that it can reliably identify seizure onset zones in a study cohort of 82 patients who underwent evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy. Main results. Our investigation provides evidence that utilizing the complementary information provided by multiple electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics can significantly improve the localization potential compared to previously published singlebiomarker incidence-based approaches, resulting in an average area under ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.73 in a cohort of 82 patients. Our results also suggest that recording durations between 90 min and 2 h are sufficient to localize SOZs with accuracies that may prove clinically relevant. Significance. The successful validation of our approach on a large cohort of 82 patients warrants future investigation on the feasibility of utilizing intra-operative EEG monitoring and artificial intelligence to localize epileptogenic brain tissue. Broadly, our study demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence coupled with careful feature engineering in augmenting clinical decision making.

After presenting the detailed procedure for the FCA, we described various methods for quantifying functional connectivity. The problem of volume conduction and the means to diminish its confounding effects on the FCA was thoroughly reviewed. As a useful preprocessing for the FCA, spatial filtering of the time-series measured on the scalp or transformation to current densities on cortical surface were described. We also reviewed ongoing efforts toward developing FC measures which are inherently robust to the volume conduction problem. Finally, we illustrated the procedures for determining significance of the FC among specific pair of regions, which exploit surrogate data generation or the characteristics of event-related data.

Specifically, alpha oscillations are associated with pulses of inhibition repeating every approximate to 100 msec. Whether alpha phase, similar to alpha power, is under top-down control remains unclear. Moreover, the sources of such putative top-down phase control are unknown. We designed a cross-modal (visual/auditory) attention study in which we used magnetoencephalography to record the brain activity from 34 healthy participants. In each trial, a somatosensory cue indicated whether to attend to either the visual or auditory domain. The timing of the stimulus onset was predictable across trials. We found that, when visual information was attended, anticipatory alpha power was reduced in visual areas, whereas the phase adjusted just before the stimulus onset. Performance in each modality was predicted by the phase of the alpha oscillations previous to stimulus onset. Alpha oscillations in the left pFC appeared to lead the adjustment of alpha phase in visual areas. Finally, alpha phase modulated stimulus-induced gamma activity. Our results confirm that alpha phase can be top-down adjusted in anticipation of predictable stimuli and improve performance. Phase adjustment of the alpha rhythm might serve as a neurophysiological resource for optimizing visual processing when temporal predictions are possible and there is considerable competition between target and distracting stimuli.

Recent evidence suggests a specific role for the theta rhythm (4-8 Hz) in mnemonic processes and the coupling between the theta and the gamma rhythm (40-120 Hz) in ordering and binding perceptual features during encoding. Furthermore, decreases in the alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) are assumed to gate perceptual information processes in semantic networks. In the present study, we used an associative memory task (object-color combinations) with pictures versus words as stimuli (high versus low visual information) to separate associative memory from visual perceptual processes during memory formation. We found increased theta power for later remembered versus later forgotten items (independent of the color judgement) and an increase in phase-amplitude coupling between frontal theta and fronto-temporal gamma oscillations, specific for the formation of picture-color associations. Furthermore, parietal alpha suppression and gamma power were higher for pictures compared to words. These findings support the idea of a theta-gamma code in binding visual perceptual features during encoding. Furthermore, alpha suppression likely reflects perceptual gating processes in semantic networks and is insensitive to mnemonic and associative binding processes. Gamma oscillations may promote visual perceptual information in visual cortical networks, which is integrated into existing representations by prefrontal control processes, working at a theta pace.

Here, we established a mouse model of drowsiness, where mice are fasted for 1 day and then allowed to overeat high-fat food (to promote sleep) while positioned in an open-field box (to promote vigilance). They fall into a long-lasting drowsy state, as reflected by repeated and open-eyed nodding of the head while in a standing position. Simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and neck electromyogram (EMG) readouts revealed that this drowsy state including nodding state had multiple stages in terms of the relationship between the level of vigilance and head movement: delta oscillations decreased in power prior to the head-nodding period and increased during the non-nodding period. Cav3.1-knockout mice, which have reduced delta oscillations, showed frequent head nodding with reduced duration of nodding episodes compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that the balance of drive is tilted in favor of wakefulness, likely due to their previously proposed decrease in sleep-promoting functions. Our findings indicate that delta oscillations play a dominant role in controlling vigilance dynamics during sleep/wake competition and that our novel mouse model may be useful for studying drowsiness and related neurological disorders.

Resting state EEG was collected from 19 scalp locations during a 3 min, eyes-closed condition. Current densities were localized using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were administered to all participants. Independent t-tests and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate group differences in current densities, followed by statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM) correction procedures. Significant differences were found in the delta (1-3 Hz) and beta-2 (19-21 Hz) frequency bands. Delta sources were found predominately in the frontal lobe, while beta-2 sources were found in the medial and superior parietal lobe.

However, the investigation of functional connectivity by electroencephalographic (EEG) is usually limited to within certain frequency bands. In this study, we reconstruct the functional brain network of AD patients with both within and between band connectivity using resting-state EEG. Through the cross-frequency phase synchronization technique, we find that the cross-frequency connectivity is different between groups and among brain regions. Especially, the connectivity strength is significantly declined between delta and other bands for patients. In addition to these differences, a negative correlation can be found between within and cross frequency synchronization in AD. We further calculate the graph metrics of functional brain networks to investigate the alteration of network dynamics in AD. Compared to the controls, the patients exhibit elevated small world properties in the cross-frequency networks, indicating an impaired balance between within and cross frequency interaction. These findings suggest that they may provide new insights into the underlying brain dynamics in AD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Measurement of attentional reserve and mental effort for cognitive workload assessment under various task demands during dual-task walking	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Attentional reserve; Mental effort and workload; Event-related potentials; Spectral power; Locomotion; Ecologically valid human performance	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; HEALTHY OLDER; EEG; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE	Previous work focused on cognitive workload assessment suggests EEG spectral content and component amplitudes of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform may index mental effort and attentional reserve, respectively. Although few studies have assessed attentional reserve and mental effort during upper-extremity performance, none have employed a combined approach to measure cognitive workload during locomotion. Therefore, by systematically considering ERPs, spectral content and importantly their combination, this study aimed to examine whether concurrent changes in spectral content and ERPs could collectively serve as an index of cognitive workload during locomotion. Specifically, ERP and EEG biomarkers were assessed as participants performed a cognitive task under two levels of difficulty (easy or hard) and two conditions (seated or walking). Changes in attentional reserve and mental effort appeared to collectively index cognitive workload under varying demands due to changes in task difficulty or performance conditions. This work can inform cognitive workload assessment in patient populations with gait deficiencies for future applications.

Owing to its superior characteristics, the SSVEP has been widely used in neural engineering and cognitive neuroscience studies. However, the underlying mechanisms of the SSVEP are not well understood. In this study, we introduced a brain reconfiguration methodology to explore the possible mechanisms of the SSVEP. The EEG data from five periodic stimuli consistently indicated that the periodic visual stimulation could induce resting-state brain network reconfiguration and that the responses evoked by the stimuli were correlated to the network reconfiguration indexes. For each stimulus frequency, larger response amplitudes corresponded to higher reconfiguration indexes from the resting-state network to a stimulus-evoked network. These findings demonstrate that an external periodic visual stimulation can induce the modification of intrinsic oscillatory activities by reconfiguring resting state activity at a network level, which could facilitate the responses evoked by the stimulus. These findings provide new insights into the response mechanisms of periodic visual stimulation.

The role of alpha oscillations in distractor inhibition during memory retention	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						distractor suppression; neural oscillations; vision; visual attention; working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; INTERNALLY DIRECTED ATTENTION; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; POWER INCREASES; NEURAL MEASURES; EEG; MODULATION	Only small amounts of visual information, as determined by the capacity of working memory, can be held in an active and accessible state. Thus, it is important to select and maintain information that is relevant while ignoring irrelevant information. However, the underlying neural mechanism of these processes has yet to be identified. One potential candidate are alpha oscillations (8-14Hz), which have been shown to inhibit stimulus processing in perceptual tasks. During memory maintenance, alpha power increases with set size suggesting that alpha oscillations are involved either in memory maintenance or in the inhibition of task-irrelevant information to protect relevant information from interference. The need for such a protection should increase with the amount of distracting information, but most previous studies did not show any distractors. Therefore, we directly tested whether alpha oscillations are involved in inhibition of distractors during memory maintenance. Participants memorized the orientation of one or two target lines embedded among irrelevant distractors. Distractors were either strong or weak and were present during the retention interval after which participants reported the orientation of probed targets. Computational modeling showed that performance decreased with increasing set size and stronger distraction. Alpha power in the retention interval generally increased with set size, replicating previous studies. However, here stronger distractors reduced alpha power. This finding is in clear contradistinction to previous suggestions, as alpha power decrease indicates higher neuronal excitability. Thus, our data do not support the suggested role of alpha oscillations in inhibition of distraction in working memory.	[Schroeder, Svea C.

In the current study, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of electroencephalography to examine the relevance of spontaneously engaged visual processing during encoding for later retrieval. Human participants encoded word-picture associations, where the picture could be a famous face, a landmark, or an object. At test, we manipulated the retrieval demands by asking participants to retrieve either visual or verbal information about the pictures. MVPA revealed classification between picture categories during early perceptual stages of encoding (similar to 170 ms). Importantly, these visual category-specific neural patterns were predictive of later episodic remembering, but the direction of the relationship was contingent on the particular retrieval demand of the memory task: a benefit for the visual and a cost for the verbal. A reinstatement of the category-specific neural patterns established during encoding was observed during retrieval, and again the relationship with behavior varied with retrieval demands. Reactivation of visual representations during retrieval was associated with better memory in the visual task, but with lower performance in the verbal task. Our findings support and extend the TAP account by demonstrating that processing of particular aspects during memory formation can also have detrimental effects on later episodic remembering when other aspects of the event are called-for and shed new light on encoding and retrieval interactions in episodic memory.

Such biomarkers can be used for developing open or closed loop approaches for seizure prediction or prevention. This study aims to quantitatively evaluate antiepileptogenic effects of low frequency stimulation (LFS) applied immediately before or after kindling stimulations using spectral power analysis of extracellular EEG in rat. Methods: Nineteen adult rats were used: seven for kindle, six for LFS C Kindle (LFSK) and six for Kindle C LFS (KLFS). Four packages of LFS (1Hz) were applied immediately before or after rapid kindling stimulations. The power spectral densities of afterdischarge (AD) sections of EEG corresponding to different stages of kindling for delta (0-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-28 Hz), gamma (28-40 Hz) sub-bands, and theta/alpha ratio were comparatively investigated. Moreover, correlation between AD duration (ADD) and its different frequency components was calculated. Results: Both LFSK and KLFS significantly increased delta and reduced beta and gamma oscillations, compared with kindle group. However, just the reduction in LFSK group was significant. Both protocols increased theta/alpha ratio, but just LFSK showed significant increase (p < 0.05). Although LFSK enhanced theta/alpha ratio more than KLFS, the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, strong correlation between each frequency sub band and ADD was not observed in kindle and LFS treated groups (both LFSK and KLFS). Conclusion: Although behavioral assessments showed relatively the same level of antiepileptogenic effects for KLFS and LFSK, quantitative assessments showed more significant differences in the quantitative measures between the two protocols. Developing more quantitative EEG based measures correlated with LFS-induced effects can facilitate developing open or closed loop seizure prevention modalities.

Parsing a mental program: Fixation-related brain signatures of unitary operations and routines in natural visual search	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual search; EEG; Eye movements; Attention; Natural scenes; Oscillations	SACCADE TARGET SELECTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; WORKING-MEMORY; OBJECT RECOGNITION; PARIETAL CORTEX; SINGLE-TRIAL; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ATTENTIONAL BLINK; EVOKED-POTENTIALS	Visual search involves a sequence or routine of unitary operations (i.e. fixations) embedded in a larger mental global program. The process can indeed be seen as a program based on a while loop (while the target is not found), a conditional construct (whether the target is matched or not based on specific recognition algorithms) and a decision making step to determine the position of the next searched location based on existent evidence. Recent developments in our ability to co-register brain scalp potentials (EEG) during free eye movements has allowed investigating brain responses related to fixations (fixation-Related Potentials; fERPs), including the identification of sensory and cognitive local EEG components linked to individual fixations. However, the way in which the mental program guiding the search unfolds has not yet been investigated. We performed an EEG and eye tracking co-registration experiment in which participants searched for a target face in natural images of crowds. Here we show how unitary steps of the program are encoded by specific local target detection signatures and how the positioning of each unitary operation within the global search program can be pinpointed by changes in the EEG signal amplitude as well as the signal power in different frequency bands. By simultaneously studying brain signatures of unitary operations and those occurring during the sequence of fixations, our study sheds light into how local and global properties are combined in implementing visual routines in natural tasks.

Sleep slow oscillation is believed to play critical role in consolidation of recent memories. Past computational studies, based on the Hodgkin-Huxley type neuronal models, revealed possible intracellular and network mechanisms of the neuronal activity during sleep, however, they failed to explore the large-scale cortical network dynamics depending on collective behavior in the large populations of neurons. In this new study, we developed a novel class of reduced discrete time spiking neuron models for large-scale network simulations of wake and sleep dynamics. In addition to the spiking mechanism, the new model implemented nonlinearities capturing effects of the leak current, the Ca2+ dependent K+ current and the persistent Na+ current that were found to be critical for transitions between Up and Down states of the slow oscillation. We applied the new model to study large-scale two-dimensional cortical network activity during slow-wave sleep. Our study explained traveling wave dynamics and characteristic synchronization properties of transitions between Up and Down states of the slow oscillation as observed in vivo in recordings from cats. We further predict a critical role of synaptic noise and slow adaptive currents for spike sequence replay as found during sleep related memory consolidation.

The brain is a complex network consisting of spatially distributed networks dedicated to different functions including cognitive domains where dynamic interactions of several brain areas play a pivotal role. Brain connectome could be a useful approach not only to mechanisms underlying brain cognitive functions, but also to those supporting different mental states. This goal was approached via a learning task providing the possibility to predict performance and learning along physiological and pathological brain aging. Eighty-six subjects (22 healthy, 47 amnesic mild cognitive impairment, 17 Alzheimer's disease) were recruited reflecting the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal brain connectivity scenarios. EEG recordings were performed at rest, with closed eyes, both before and after the task (Sensory Motor Learning task consisting of a visual rotation paradigm). Brain network properties were described by Small World index (SW), representing a combination of segregation and integration properties. Correlation analyses showed that alpha 2 SW in pre-task significantly predict learning (r = -0.2592, p < 0.0342): lower alpha 2 SW (higher possibility to increase during task and better the learning of this task), higher the learning as measured by the number of reached targets. These results suggest that, by means of an innovative analysis applied to a low-cost and widely available techniques (SW applied to EEG), the functional connectome approach as well as conventional biomarkers would be effective methods for monitoring learning progress during training both in normal and abnormal conditions.

However, it is unclear whether they also lead to altered low-frequency (<= 60 Hz) neural oscillatory activities similar to those associated with schizophrenia during working memory processes. Here, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit activity from the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of three male rhesus macaque monkeys while they performed a rule-based prosaccade and antisaccade working memory task both before and after systemic injections of a subanesthetic dose (<= 0.7 mg/kg) of ketamine. Accompanying working-memory impairment, ketamine enhanced the low-gamma-band (30-60 Hz) and dampened the beta-band (13-30 Hz) oscillatory activities in the LPFC during both delay periods and intertrial intervals. It also increased task-related alpha-band activities, likely reflecting compromised attention. Beta-band oscillations may be especially relevant to working memory processes because stronger beta power weakly but significantly predicted shorter saccadic reaction time. Also in beta band, ketamine reduced the performance-related oscillation as well as the rule information encoded in the spectral power. Ketamine also reduced rule information in the spike field phase consistency in almost all frequencies up to 60 Hz. Our findings support NMDAR antagonists in nonhuman primates as a meaningful model for altered neural oscillations and synchrony, which reflect a disorganized network underlying the working memory deficits in schizophrenia.

In aging, the decrease in EEG alpha activity (8-12 Hz) in the parieto-occipital and mu rhythm in the motor cortex are correlated with the decline in cognitive and motor functions, respectively. Increasing alpha activity using tACS might therefore improve cognitive and motor function in the elderly. The present study explored the influence of tACS on cortical excitability in young and old healthy adults. We applied tACS at individual alpha peak frequency for 10 min (1.5 mA) to the left motor cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the changes in cortical excitability as measured by motor-evoked potentials at rest, before and after stimulation. TACS increased cortical excitability in both groups. However, our results also suggest that the mechanism behind the effects was different, as we observed an increase and decrease in intracortical inhibition in the old group and young group, respectively. Our results indicate that both groups profited similarly from the stimulation. There was no indication that tACS was more effective in conditions of low alpha power, that is, in the elderly.

EEG Dynamics and Neural Generators in Implicit Navigational Image Processing in Adults with ADHD	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ADHD; EEG dynamics; ERP Generator; oddball paradigm	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; MEMORY; NETWORK; THETA; ADOLESCENTS; POTENTIALS	In contrast to childhood ADHD that is characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, most adults with ADHD predominantly exhibit inattention. We used a new oddball paradigm using implicit navigational images and analyzed EEG dynamics with swLORETA inverse modeling of the evoked potential generators to study cortical processing in adults with ADHD and age-matched controls. In passive observation, we demonstrated that P350 amplitude, alpha-beta oscillation event-related synchronization (ERS) anticipation, and beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) were significantly smaller in ADHD. In the active condition, P100 duration was reduced and N140 amplitude increased for both deviant and frequent conditions in the ADHD. Alpha ERS and delta-theta ERS were reduced in the ADHD in the deviant condition. The left somatosensory area (BA2) and the right parietal lobe (BA31, BA40) contributed more to the P100 generators in the control than in the ADHD group, while the left frontal lobe (BA10) contributed more to the P100 generators in the ADHD. The left inferior parietal lobe (BA40) contributed more to the N140 generators in the control than the ADHD group while the right posterior cingulate (BA30) contributed more to the N140 generators in the ADHD. These findings reinforce the notion that earlier cortical stages of visual processing are compromised in adult ADHD by inducing the emergence of different even-related potential generators and EEG dynamics in ADHD. Considering that classical approaches for ADHD diagnosis are based on qualitative clinical investigation possibly biased by subjectivity, EEG analysis is another objective tool that might contribute to diagnosis, future neurofeedback or brain stimulation therapies.

Template-based prediction of vigilance fluctuations in resting-state fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state fMRI; Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Vigilance; Global signal; Eyes-open; Eyes-closed; Caffeine	INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; GLOBAL SIGNAL; SLEEP; WAKEFULNESS; CAFFEINE; BRAIN; ALERTNESS	Changes in vigilance or alertness during a typical resting state fMRI scan are inevitable and have been found to affect measures of functional brain connectivity. Since it is not often feasible to monitor vigilance with EEG during fMRI scans, it would be of great value to have methods for estimating vigilance levels from fMRI data alone. A recent study, conducted in macaque monkeys, proposed a template-based approach for fMRI-based estimation of vigilance fluctuations. Here, we use simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI data to investigate whether the same template-based approach can be employed to estimate vigilance fluctuations of awake humans across different resting-state conditions. We first demonstrate that the spatial pattern of correlations between EEG-defined vigilance and fMRI in our data is consistent with the previous literature. Notably, however, we observed a significant difference between the eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions, finding stronger negative correlations with vigilance in regions forming the default mode network and higher positive correlations in thalamus and insula in the EC condition when compared to the EO condition. Taking these correlation maps as "templates" for vigilance estimation, we found that the template-based approach produced fMRI-based vigilance estimates that were significantly correlated with EEG-based vigilance measures, indicating its generalizability from macaques to humans. We also demonstrate that the performance of this method was related to the overall amount of variability in a subject's vigilance state, and that the template-based approach outperformed the use of the global signal as a vigilance estimator. In addition, we show that the template-based approach can be used to estimate the variability across scans in the amplitude of the vigilance fluctuations. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of using the template-based approach in future fMRI studies.

Despite its application in a range of brain disorders, it remains unclear how stimulation of discrete brain areas affects memory performance and the underlying electrophysiological activities. Here, we investigated the effect of direct electrical stimulation in four brain regions known to support declarative memory: hippocampus (HP), parahippocampal region (PH) neocortex, prefrontal cortex (PF), and lateral temporal cortex (TC). Intracranial EEG recordings with stimulation were collected from 22 patients during performance of verbal memory tasks. We found that high gamma (62-118 Hz) activity induced by word presentation was modulated by electrical stimulation. This modulatory effect was greatest for trials with "poor" memory encoding. The high gamma modulation correlated with the behavioral effect of stimulation in a given brain region: it was negative, i.e., the induced high gamma activity was decreased, in the regions where stimulation decreased memory performance, and positive in the lateral TC where memory enhancement was observed. Our results suggest that the effect of electrical stimulation on high gamma activity induced by word presentation may be a useful biomarker for mapping memory networks and guiding therapeutic brain stimulation.

However, it remains unclear if these measures reflect similar neurofunctional mechanisms at the individual level. In the present study, a within-subject experiment was designed to assess these two neurophysiological indexes and to quantify their mutual correlation. Participants observed reach-to-grasp actions directed towards a small (precision grip) or a large object (power grip). We focused on two specific time points for both EEG and TMS. The first time point (t1) coincided with the maximum hand aperture, i.e. the moment at which a significant modulation of corticospinal excitability is expected. The second (t2), coincided with the EEG resynchronization occurring at the end of the action, i.e. the moment at which a hypothetic minimum for action observation effect is expected. Results showed a Mu rhythm bilateral desynchronization at t1 with differential resynchronization at t2 in the two hemispheres. Beta rhythm was more desynchronized in the left hemisphere at both time points. These EEG differences, however, were not influenced by grip type. Conversely, motor potentials evoked by TMS in an intrinsic hand muscle revealed an interaction effect of grip and time. No significant correlations between Mu/Beta rhythms and motor evoked potentials were found. These findings are discussed considering the spatial and temporal resolution of the two investigated techniques and argue over two alternative explanations: i. each technique provides different measures of the same process or ii. they describe complementary features of the action observation network in humans.

Using this method, it was recently shown that increasing alpha (10 Hz) oscillations improved creative ideation with figural material and that increasing gamma (40 Hz) oscillations speeded up performance in a figural matrices intelligence task. The aim of the present study was to examine whether these findings generalize to verbal creativity and intelligence tasks. In addition, we explored whether the stimulation effects are moderated by individual differences in creative potential and intelligence. Twenty-two adults received 10 Hz, 40 Hz and sham tACS while they worked on a verbal creativity (alternate uses) task and a verbal intelligence (anagram) task. Analyses revealed that 10 Hz stimulation had a marginally significant effect on ideational fluency in the alternate uses task, whereas originality was unaffected. The beneficial effect of stimulation on fluency tended to emerge mainly in the individuals with higher creative potential. In the verbal intelligence task, in contrast, 40 Hz stimulation did neither impact on performance nor interacted with individual differences in intelligence. These findings provide first tentative evidence that enhancing alpha oscillations through tACS may improve creative thinking not only in the figural but also in the verbal domain. The previously reported beneficial effect of gamma tACS on figural intelligence, however, could not be observed in a verbal task. In sum, the present study further corroborates the causal link between alpha oscillations and creative thinking and suggests that tACS may be a Cpromising tool to enhance cognitive processes.

State-Dependent Modulation of Visual Evoked Potentials in a Rodent Genetic Model of Electroencephalographic Instability	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EGR3; quiet wakefulness; beta frequency; electroencephalogram; sleep; arousal; 5HT2A; visual evoked potential (VEP)	SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; EGR3-DEFICIENT MICE; OCULAR DOMINANCE; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RECOVERY SLEEP; SEROTONIN; RESPONSES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS	Despite normal sleep timing and duration, Egr3-deficient (Egr3-/-) mice exhibit electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics of reduced arousal, including elevated slow wave (1-4 Hz) activity during wakefulness. Here we show that these mice exhibit state-dependent instability in the EEG. Intermittent surges in EEG power were found in Egr3-/- mice during wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep, most prominently in the beta (15-35 Hz) range compared to wild type (Egr3+/+) mice. Such surges did not coincide with sleep onset, as the surges were not associated with cessation of electromyographic tone. Cortical processing of sensory information by visual evoked responses (VEP) were found to vary as a function of vigilance state, being of higher magnitude during slow wave sleep (SWS) than wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep. VEP responses were significantly larger during quiet wakefulness than active wakefulness, in both Egr3-/- mice and Egr3+/+ mice. EEG synchronization in the beta range, previously linked to the accumulation of sleep need over time, predicted VEP magnitude. Egr3-/- mice not only displayed elevated beta activity, but in quiet wake, this elevated beta activity coincides with an elevated evoked response similar to that of animals in SWS. These data confirm that (a) VEPs vary as a function of vigilance state, and (b) beta activity in the EEG is a predictor of state-dependent modulation of visual information processing. The phenotype of Egr3-/- mice indicates that Egr3 is a genetic regulator of these phenomena.

Previous approaches implemented methods of classical physics to reconstruct the mass potential in terms of explicit physical models of participating cells and the volume conductor. However, the multiplicity of cellular processes with extremely intricate mixtures of deterministic and random factors prevents the creation of consistent biophysical parameter sets. To avoid the uncertainty inherent in physical attributes of cell ensembles, we undertake here a radical departure from deterministic equations of classical physics, instead applying the probabilistic reasoning of quantum mechanics. Crucial steps include: (1) the relocation of the elementary bioelectric sources from a cellular to a molecular level; (2) the creation of microscale particle models in terms of a non-homogenous birth-and-death process. To link the microscale processes with macroscale potentials, time-frequency analysis was applied for estimation of the empirical characteristic functions for component waveforms of electroencephalogram (EEG), eye-blink electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). We describe universal models for the amplitude spectra and phase functions of functional components of mass potentials. The corresponding time domain relationships disclose the dynamics of mass potential components as limit distribution functions produced by specific microscale transients. The probabilistic laws governing the microscale machinery, founded on an empirical basis, are presented. Computer simulations of particle populations with time dependent transition probabilities reveal that hidden deterministic chaos underlies development of the components of mass potentials. We label this kind of behaviour "transient deterministic chaos".

We investigated eye-movement evoked patterns in free-viewing conditions. Participants viewed photographs of natural scenes in anticipation of a memory test. From 200 ms intervals following saccades, we estimated the EEG phase gradient over the entire scalp, and the wave activity, i.e. the goodness of fit of a wave model involving a phase gradient assumed to be smooth over the scalp. In frequencies centered at 6.5 Hz, large-scale phase organization occurred, peaking around 70 ms after fixation onset and taking the form of a traveling wave. According to the wave gradient, most of the times the wave spreads from the posterior-inferior to anterior-superior direction. In these directions, the gradients depended on the size and direction of the saccade. Wave propagation velocity decreased in the course of the fixation, particularly in the interval from 50 to 150 ms after fixation onset. This interval corresponds to the fixation-related lambda activity, which reflects early perceptual processes following fixation onset. We conclude that lambda activity has a prominent traveling wave component. This component consists of a short-term whole-head phase pattern of specific direction and velocity, which may reflect feedforward propagation of visual information at fixation.

Breathing above the brain stem: volitional control and attentional modulation in humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						intracranial EEG; interoceptive attention to breathing; cortical control of breathing; mind-body; oscillations	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; RESPIRATORY CORRELATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; UNIT DISCHARGE; ALPHA BAND; HIPPOCAMPAL; EEG; REGISTRATION; ACTIVATION	Whereas the neurophysiology of respiration has traditionally focused on automatic brain stem processes, higher brain mechanisms underlying the cognitive aspects of breathing are gaining increasing interest. Therapeutic techniques have used conscious control and awareness of breathing for millennia with little understanding of the mechanisms underlying their efficacy. Using direct intracranial recordings in humans, we correlated cortical and limbic neuronal activity as measured by the intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) with the breathing cycle. We show this to be the direct result of neuronal activity, as demonstrated by both the specificity of the finding to the cortical gray matter and the tracking of breath by the gamma-band (40-150 Hz) envelope in these structures. We extend prior observations by showing the iEEG signal to track the breathing cycle across a widespread network of cortical and limbic structures. We further demonstrate a sensitivity of this tracking to cognitive factors by using tasks adapted from cognitive behavioral therapy and meditative practice. Specifically, volitional control and awareness of breathing engage distinct but overlapping brain circuits. During volitionally paced breathing, iEEG-breath coherence increases in a frontotemporal-insular network, and during attention to breathing, we demonstrate increased coherence in the anterior cingulate, premotor, insular, and hippocampal cortices. Our findings suggest that breathing can act as an organizing hierarchical principle for neuronal oscillations throughout the brain and detail mechanisms of how cognitive factors impact otherwise automatic neuronal processes during interoceptive attention. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Whereas the link between breathing and brain activity has a long history of application to therapy, its neurophysiology remains unexplored. Using intracranial recordings in humans, we show neuronal activity to track the breathing cycle throughout widespread cortical/limbic sites.

Closed-Loop Targeted Memory Reactivation during Sleep Improves Spatial Navigation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep; targeted memory reactivation; closed-loop; spatial memory; navigation; spindles; slow oscillation; slow wave sleep	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; SPINDLES; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; RIPPLES	Sounds associated with newly learned information that are replayed during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep can improve recall in simple tasks. The mechanism for this improvement is presumed to be reactivation of the newly learned memory during sleep when consolidation takes place. We have developed an EEG-based closed-loop system to precisely deliver sensory stimulation at the time of down-state to up-state transitions during NREM sleep. Here, we demonstrate that applying this technology to participants performing a realistic navigation task in virtual reality results in a significant improvement in navigation efficiency after sleep that is accompanied by increases in the spectral power especially in the fast (12-15 Hz) sleep spindle band. Our results show promise for the application of sleep-based interventions to drive improvement in real-world tasks.

Seeking reproducibility: Assessing a multimodal study of the testing effect	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING			English	Article						EEG; multimodal data; reproducibility; testing effect	WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE LOAD; OSCILLATIONS; FEEDBACK; BUILDUP; POWER	Low-cost devices have widened the use of multimodal data in experiments providing a more complete picture of behavioural effects. However, the accurate collection and combination of multimodal and behavioural data in a manner that enables reproducibility is challenging and often requires researchers to refine their approaches. This paper presents a direct replication of a multimodal wordlist experiment. Specifically, we use a low-cost Emotiv EPOC (R) to acquire electrophysiological measures of brain activity to investigate whether retrieval during learning facilitates the encoding of subsequent learning as measured by performance on recall tests and reflected by changes in alpha wave oscillations. Behavioural results of the wordlist experiment were replicated, but physiological results were not. We conclude the paper by highlighting the challenges faced in terms of replicating the previous work and in attempting to facilitate the reproducibility of our own experiment.

At present, only few studies investigated the effects of tDCS on the modulation of functional connectivity between remote cortical areas. The aim of this study was to investigate-through graph theory analysis-how bipolar tDCS modulate cortical networks high-density EEG recordings were acquired before and after bipolar cathodal, anodal and sham tDCS involving the primary motor and pre-motor cortices of the dominant hemispherein 14 healthy subjects. Results showed that, after bipolar anodal tDCS stimulation, brain networks presented a less evident "small world" organization with a global tendency to be more random in its functional connections with respect to prestimulus condition in both hemispheres. Results suggest that tDCS globally modulates the cortical connectivity of the brain, modifying the underlying functional organization of the stimulated networks, which might be related to changes in synaptic efficiency of the motor network and related brain areas. This study demonstrated that graph analysis approach to EEG recordings is able to intercept changes in cortical functions mediated by bipolar anodal tDCS mainly involving the dominant M1 and related motor areas. Concluding, tDCS could be an useful technique to help understanding brain rhythms and their topographic functional organization and specificity.

Here, we examined children's neural activation while viewing own parent-child interactions and asked whether similar networks activate when children are exposed to attachment stimuli. Sixty-five 11-year-old children underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) while observing own vs unfamiliar mother-child interaction. Own mother-child interactions elicited a greater neural response across distributed brain areas including alpha suppression in posterior regions, theta enhancement in the fusiform gyrus and beta-and gamma-band oscillations across a wide cluster in the right temporal cortex, comprising the superior temporal sulcus/superior temporal gyrus and insula. Theta and gamma activations were associated with the degree of mother-child social synchrony in the home ecology. Findings from this exploratory study are the first to show activations in children that are similar to previous findings in parents and comparable associations between social synchrony and gamma oscillations in temporal regions. Results indicate that attachment stimuli elicit a strong neural response in children that spreads across a wide range of oscillations, underscoring the considerable neural resources allocated to this fundamental, survival-related cue.

The P3a event-related potential, considered as the neurophysiological hallmark of novelty detection, has been shown to be reduced in Parkinson's disease (PD) and proposed as a sensitive measure for illness duration and severity. Our aim for this study was to explore for the first time whether impaired novelty detection could be observed through phase-and time-locked brain oscillatory activity at early PD. Twenty-seven patients with idiopathic PD at early stages (disease duration < 5 years and Hoehn and Yahr stage < 3) were included. A healthy control group (n = 24) was included as well. All participants performed an auditory involuntary attention task including frequent and deviant tones while a digital EEG was obtained. A neuropsychological battery was administered as well. Time-frequency representations of power and phase-locked oscillations and P3a amplitudes were compared between groups. We found a significant reduction of power and phase locking of slow oscillations (3-7 Hz) for deviant tones in the PD group compared to controls in the P3a time range (300-550 ms). Also, reduced modulation of late induced (not phase locked) alpha-beta oscillations (400-650 ms, 8-25 Hz) was observed in the PD group after deviant tones onset. The P3a amplitude was predicted by years of evolution in the PD group. Finally, while phase-locked slow oscillations were associated with task behavioral distraction effects, induced alpha-beta activity was related to cognitive flexibility performance. Our results show that novelty detection impairment can be identified in neurophysiological terms from very early stages of PD, and such impairment increases linearly as the disease progresses. Also, induced alpha-beta oscillations underlying novelty detection are related to executive functioning.

Mid-frontal theta activity is diminished during cognitive control in Parkinson's disease	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Theta; Cognitive control; Parkinson's disease; Error	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ALPHA; DOPAMINE; PERFORMANCE; OSCILLATIONS; HABITUATION; HUMANS; ONLINE	Mid-frontal theta activity underlies cognitive control. These 4-8 Hz rhythms are modulated by cortical dopamine and can be abnormal in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated mid-frontal theta deficits in PD patients during a task explicitly involving cognitive control. We collected scalp EEG from high-performing PD patients and demographically matched controls during performance of a modified Simon reaction-time task. This task involves cognitive control to adjudicate response conflict and error-related adjustments. Task performance of PD patients was indistinguishable from controls, but PD patients had less mid-frontal theta modulations around cues and responses. Critically, PD patients had attenuated mid-frontal theta activity specifically associated with response conflict and post-error processing. These signals were unaffected by medication or motor scores. Post-error mid-frontal theta activity was correlated with disease duration. Classification of control vs. PD from these data resulted in a specificity of 69% and a sensitivity of 72%. These findings help define the scope of mid-frontal theta aberrations during cognitive control in PD, and may provide insight into the nature of PD related cognitive dysfunction.

Self-perception of social ranking, personality trait (Behavioral Activation System (BAS) and locus of control (LoC)) and alpha brain oscillations were considered. Subjects were required to match their cognitive performance in terms of accuracy (error rate) and response time. A positive feedback condition of a better joint-performance was provided and compared to absence of feedback. It was found that higher BAS participants and higher internal LoC responded in greater measure to post-feedback condition with better real performance probably based on their sensitivity to rewarding for high-BAS and the increased sense of self-efficacy. Moreover, higher-BAS showed an increased frontal left activity when they perceived increased cooperative efficacy. The present results confirmed the tendency to modulate both self-perceived social position and real performance based on the personal attitudes and the frontal.

Altered circadian rhythms and oscillation of clock genes and sirtuin 1 in a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						circadian rhythms; clock genes; epilepsy; Kcna1-null; Sirtuin	SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; KETOGENIC DIET; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; ACTIVITY STATE; SLEEP; MOUSE; EXPRESSION; SEIZURES; MICE; DISORDERS	Objectives: Circadian rhythms arc affected in many neurological disorders. Although sleep disturbances are known in epilepsy, data on circadian rhythm disturbances in epilepsy are sparse. Here, we examined diurnal and circadian restactivity and sleep-wake patterns in Kcna1-null mice, which exhibit spontaneous recurrent seizures and are a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether seizures or aberrant oscillation of core clock genes and a regulator, sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), is associated with disrupted rhythms. Methods: We used passive infrared actigraphy to assess rest-activity patterns, electroencephalography for seizure and sleep analysis, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to evaluate expression of clock genes and Sirt1 in Kcna1-null and wild-type mice. Results: Epileptic Kcna1-null animals have disrupted diurnal and circadian restactivity patterns, tending to exhibit prolonged circadian periods. Electroencephalographic analysis confirmed disturbances in sleep architecture, with more time spent awake and less asleep. Although all epileptic mice manifested disrupted diurnal and circadian rest-activity patterns, we found no correlation between actual seizure burden and degree of sleep disruption. However, we found attenuated oscillations of several clock genes (ie, Clock Bmal1, Per1, and Per2) and diurnal Sirt1 mRNA in the anterior hypothalamus. Significance: Attenuated oscillation of several core clock genes correlates with, and may underlie, aberrant diurnal and circadian rest-activity and sleep-wake patterns observed in Kcna1-null mice. This could contribute to late complications in epilepsy, such as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Sirt1 may represent a useful therapeutic target for rescuing circadian clock gene rhythmicity and sleep patterns in epilepsy.

Twenty-three older adults and 13 younger controls were tested with an adaptive auditory test battery to measure not only traditional pure-tone thresholds, but also above individual thresholds of temporal and spectral processing. The participants' speech recognition in noise (SiN) was evaluated, and a T1-weighted MRI image obtained for each participant. We then determined the cortical thickness (CT) and mean cortical surface area (CSA) of auditory and higher speech-relevant regions of interest (ROIs) with FreeSurfer. Further, we obtained resting state EEG from all participants as well as data on the intrinsic theta and gamma power lateralization, the latter in accordance with predictions of the Asymmetric Sampling in Time hypothesis regarding speech processing (Poeppel, Speech Commun 41:245-255, 2003). Methodological steps involved the calculation of age-related differences in behavior, anatomy and EEG power lateralization, followed by multiple regressions with anatomical ROIs as predictors for auditory performance. We then determined anatomical regressors for theta and gamma lateralization, and further constructed all regressions to investigate age as a moderator variable. Behavioral results indicated that older adults performed worse in temporal and spectral auditory tasks, and in SiN, despite having normal peripheral hearing as signaled by the audiogram. These behavioral age-related distinctions were accompanied by lower CT in all ROIs, while CSA was not different between the two age groups. Age modulated the regressions specifically in right auditory areas, where a thicker cortex was associated with better auditory performance in older adults. Moreover, a thicker right supratemporal sulcus predicted more rightward theta lateralization, indicating the functional relevance of the right auditory areas in older adults. The question how age-related cortical thinning and intrinsic EEG architecture relates to central hearing loss has so far not been addressed. Here, we provide the first neuroanatomical and neurofunctional evidence that cortical thinning and lateralization of speech-relevant frequency band power relates to the extent of age-related central hearing loss in older adults. The results are discussed within the current frameworks of speech processing and aging.

One of the most viable assessments of such treatment is the evaluation of brain activity in addition to patient response and clinical assessment. This study focuses on sound therapy and evaluation of patients' electroencephalogram (EEG) in order to verify the potency of this approach. Broadband sound therapy was applied to nineteen participants aging from 25 to 64 and suffering from chronic subjective tinnitus to study the difference of brain activity, a) before fake treatment, b) after fake treatment and c) after the main treatment, using EEG and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for evaluating Residual Inhibition (RI). Four features were extracted using 4-level wavelet decomposition with Symlet 8 as its mother wavelet. For the "After the main treatment" stage, the mean value of wavelet coefficients for the last wavelet level, which corresponded to delta band of EEG, was lower in the FC3 channel based on Two-Sample T-Test with significance level of 0.01, as compared to the same channel of the "before the treatment" stage, for cases in which decreased tinnitus loudness were reported.

Studies show that specific EEG signattu"es underpin the monitoring of observed erroneous actions (error-related negativity, error positivity, mid-frontal theta oscillations). However, the majority of studies on action observation used sequences of trials where erroneous actions were less frequent than correct actions. Therefore, it was not possible to disentangle whether the activation of the performance monitoring system was due to an error, as a violation of the intended goal, or to a surprise/novelty effect, associated with a rare and unexpected event. Combining EEG and immersive virtual reality (IVR-CAVE system), we recorded the neural signal of 25 young adults who observed, in first-person perspective, simple reach-to grasp actions performed by an avatar aiming for a glass. Importantly, the proportion of erroneous actions was higher than correct actions. Results showed that the observation of erroneous actions elicits the typical electrocortical signatures of error monitoring, and therefore the violation of the action goal is still perceived as a salient event. The observation of correct actions elicited stronger alpha suppression. This confirmed the role of the alpha-frequency band in the general orienting response to novel and infrequent stimuli. Our data provide novel evidence that an observed goal error (the action slip) triggers the activity of the performance-monitoring system even when erroneous actions, which are, typically, relevant events, occur more often than correct actions and thus are not salient because of their rarity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Activation of the performance-monitoring system (PMS) is typically investigated when errors in a sequence are comparatively rare. However, whether the PMS is activated by errors per se or by their infrequency is not known. Combining EEG-virtual reality techniques, we found that observing frequent (70%) action errors performed by avatars elicits electrocortical error signatures suggesting that deviation from the prediction of how learned actions should correctly deploy, rather than its frequency, is coded in the PMS.

We applied time-resolved, multivariate decoding analysis to the pattern of rhythmic EEG activity that was registered while participants planned and executed individual elements from pre-learned, structured sequences. Across three experiments, the theta and alpha-band activity coded basic elements and abstract control representations, in particular, the ordinal position of basic elements, but also the identity and position of chunks. Further, a robust representation of higher level, chunk identity information was only found in individuals with above-median working memory capacity, potentially providing a neural-level explanation for working-memory differences in sequential performance. Our results suggest that by decoding oscillatory activity we can track how the cognitive system traverses through the states of a hierarchical control structure.

Bifurcation analysis of two coupled Jansen-Rit neural mass models	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SYNCHRONIZATION; WILSON; EEG; GENERATION; EPILEPSY; NETWORK	We investigate how changes in network structure can lead to pathological oscillations similar to those observed in epileptic brain. Specifically, we conduct a bifurcation analysis of a network of two Jansen-Rit neural mass models, representing two cortical regions, to investigate different aspects of its behavior with respect to changes in the input and interconnection gains. The bifurcation diagrams, along with simulated EEG time series, exhibit diverse behaviors when varying the input, coupling strength, and network structure. We show that this simple network of neural mass models can generate various oscillatory activities, including delta wave activity, which has not been previously reported through analysis of a single Jansen-Rit neural mass model. Our analysis shows that spike-wave discharges can occur in a cortical region as a result of input changes in the other region, which may have important implications for epilepsy treatment. The bifurcation analysis is related to clinical data in two case studies.

Reliability of Static and Dynamic Network Metrics in the Resting-State: A MEG-Beamformed Connectivity Analysis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MEG; resting-state; time-varying network analysis; chronnectomics; functional connectivity microstates; symbolic analysis; reproducibility	FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORKS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PHASE SYNCHRONY; COUPLING MODES; TIME; EEG; FMRI; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECONFIGURATION; QUANTIZATION	The resting activity of the brain can be described by so-called intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), which consist of spatially and temporally distributed, but functionally connected, nodes. The coordinated activity of the resting state can be explored via magnetoencephalography (MEG) by studying frequency-dependent functional brain networks at the source level. Although many algorithms for the analysis of brain connectivity have been proposed, the reliability of network metrics derived from both static and dynamic functional connectivity is still unknown. This is a particular problem for studies of associations between ICN metrics and personality variables or other traits, and for studies of differences between patient and control groups, which both depend critically on the reliability of the metrics used. A detailed investigation of the reliability of metrics derived from resting-state MEG repeat scans is therefore a prerequisite for the development of connectomic biomarkers. Here, we first estimated both static (SFC) and dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) after beamforming source reconstruction using the imaginary part of the phase locking index (iPLV) and the correlation of the amplitude envelope (CorEnv). Using our approach, functional network microstates (FC mu states) were derived from the DFC and chronnectomics were computed from the evolution of FC mu states across experimental time. In both temporal scales, the reliability of network metrics (SFC), the FC mu states and the related chronnectomics were evaluated for every frequency band. Chronnectomic statistics and FC mu states were generally more reliable than node-wise static network metrics. CorEnv-based network metrics were more reproducible at the static approach. The reliability of chronnectomics have been evaluated also in a second dataset. This study encourages the analysis of MEG resting-state via DFC.

Performance of an Ambulatory Dry-EEG Device for Auditory Closed- Loop Stimulation of Sleep Slow Oscillations in the Home Environment	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ambulatory sleep device; automatic sleep-staging; closed-loop stimulation; EEG wearable; sleep monitoring; sleep device; N3 sleep; slow-wave sleep	WAVE SLEEP; VALIDATION; CLASSIFICATION; CONSOLIDATION; RECHTSCHAFFEN; RELIABILITY; HEADBAND; BRAIN; KALES	Recent research has shown that auditory closed-loop stimulation can enhance sleep slow oscillations (SO) to improve N3 sleep quality and cognition. Previous studies have been conducted in lab environments. The present study aimed to validate and assess the performance of a novel ambulatory wireless dry-EEG device (WDD), for auditory closed-loop stimulation of SO during N3 sleep at home. The performance of the WDD to detect N3 sleep automatically and to send auditory closed-loop stimulation on SO were tested on 20 young healthy subjects who slept with both the WDD and a miniaturized polysomnography (part 1) in both stimulated and sham nights within a double blind, randomized and crossover design. The effects of auditory closed-loop stimulation on delta power increase were assessed after one and 10 nights of stimulation on an observational pilot study in the home environment including 90 middle-aged subjects (part 2). The first part, aimed at assessing the quality of the WDD as compared to a polysomnograph, showed that the sensitivity and specificity to automatically detect N3 sleep in real-time were 0.70 and 0.90, respectively. The stimulation accuracy of the SO ascending-phase targeting was 45 +/- 52 degrees. The second part of the study, conducted in the home environment, showed that the stimulation protocol induced an increase of 43.9% of delta power in the 4 s window following the first stimulation (including evoked potentials and SO entrainment effect). The increase of SO response to auditory stimulation remained at the same level after 10 consecutive nights. The WDD shows good performances to automatically detect in real-time N3 sleep and to send auditory closed-loop stimulation on SO accurately. These stimulation increased the SO amplitude during N3 sleep without any adaptation effect after 10 consecutive nights. This tool provides new perspectives to figure out novel sleep EEG biomarkers in longitudinal studies and can be interesting to conduct broad studies on the effects of auditory stimulation during sleep.

Electroencephalographic biomarkers as predictors of methylphenidate response in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Biomarker; ADHD; QEEG; Theta; Alpha peak frequency	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; POSTERIOR ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; POOR RESPONDERS; EEG DIFFERENCES; CHILDREN; RELIABILITY; BEHAVIOR; ADHD; FREQUENCY; SYMPTOMS	EEG biomarkers have shown promise in predicting non-response to stimulant medication in ADHD and could serve as translational biomarkers. This study aimed to replicate and extend previous EEG biomarkers. The international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment for ADHD (iSPOT-A), a multi-center, international, prospective open-label trial, enrolled 336 children and adolescents with ADHD (11.9 yrs; 245 males; prescribed methylphenidate) and 158 healthy children. Treatment response was established after six weeks using the clinician rated ADHD-Rating Scale-IV. Theta/Beta ratio (TBR) and alpha peak frequency (APF) were assessed at baseline as predictors for treatment outcome. No differences between ADHD and controls were found for TBR and APF. 62% of the ADHD group was classified as a responder. Responders did not differ from non-responders in age, medication dosage, and baseline severity of ADHD symptoms. Male-adolescent non-responders exhibited a low frontal APF (Fz: R = 9.2 Hz vs. NR = 8.1 Hz; ES = 0.83), whereas no effects were found for TBR. A low APF in male adolescents was associated with non-response to methylphenidate, replicating earlier work. Our data suggest that the typical maturational EEG changes observed in ADHD responders and controls are absent in non-responders to methylphenidate and these typical changes start emerging in adolescence.

It has been suggested that working memory (WM) is affected during gestation as a result of functional changes among cortical areas, such as the prefrontal and parietal cortices. This study examined cortical electroencephalographic correlations (rEEG) during performance of WM tasks in each trimester of pregnancy. Forty women were divided into 4 groups: first (T1), second (T2), and third (T3) trimester of pregnancy, and a control group of non-pregnant women. Electroencephalographic activity (EEG) was recorded from the frontopolar, dorsolateral and parietal cortices during performance of one verbal and one visuospatial working memory task. Only groups T2 and T3 showed increased onset latency in the visuospatial WM. During the verbal WM task, the T1 group showed a higher correlation between dorsolateral areas in the theta and alpha bands, as well as a lower left prefrontal-parietal correlation in the gamma band. During the visuospatial WM task, the T1 and T3 groups showed a higher left EEG correlation in the delta and alphal bands, whereas T2 presented a higher right prefrontal-parietal correlation in the gamma band. Although pregnancy had only a subtle effect on the visuospatial WM task, these different patterns of cortical synchronization in each trimester of pregnancy could represent adaptive mechanisms that enabled the pregnant women to focus their attention and use more cognitive resources and so adequately solve the WM tasks.

A critical node in this functional circuit impacted by PD is the primary motor cortex (M1), which plays a key role in generating neural impulses that regulate movements. The past several decades have lay witness to numerous in vivo neuroimaging techniques that provide a window into the function and structure of M1. A consistent observation from numerous studies is that during voluntary movement, but also at rest, the functional activity of M1 is altered in PD relative to healthy individuals, and it relates to many of the motor signs. Although this abnormal functional activity can be partially restored with acute dopaminergic medication, it continues to deteriorate with disease progression and may predate structural degeneration of M1. The current review discusses the evidence that M1 is fundamental to the pathophysiology of PD, as measured by neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and functional and structural MRI. Although novel treatments that target the cortex will not cure PD, they could significantly slow down and alter the progressive course of the disease and thus improve clinical care for this degenerative disease.

Surprisingly, little is known of the contributions of episodic memory, segmented into temporal memory (recollection proxy) and item recognition (familiarity proxy), to academic achievement. This is the first study to observe these associations in typically developing 6-year old children. Overlap in neural correlates exists between working memory, episodic memory, and math and reading achievement. We attempted to tease apart the neural contributions of working memory, temporal memory, and item recognition to math and reading achievement. Results suggest that working memory and temporal memory, but not item recognition, are important contributors to both math and reading achievement, and that EEG power during a working memory task contributes to performance on tests of academic achievement.

These periods differ in awakening and arousal thresholds, sensory processing, and spontaneous cortical oscillations. Previous studies indicate that although in phasic REM, cortical activity is independent of the external environment, attentional functions and sensory processing are partially maintained during tonic periods. Large-scale synchronization of oscillatory activity, especially in the alpha- and beta-frequency ranges, can accurately distinguish different states of vigilance and cognitive processes of enhanced alertness and attention. Therefore, we examined long-range inter- and intrahemispheric as well as short-range electroencephalographic synchronization during phasic and tonic REM periods quantified by the weighted phase lag index. Based on the nocturnal polysomnographic data of 19 healthy adult participants, we showed that long-range inter- and intrahemispheric alpha and beta synchrony was enhanced in tonic REM states in contrast to phasic ones, and resembled alpha and beta synchronization of resting wakefulness. On the other hand, short-range synchronization within the gamma-frequency range was higher in phasic compared with tonic periods. Increased short-range synchrony might reflect local and inwardly driven sensorimotor activity during phasic REM periods, whereas enhanced long-range synchrony might index frontoparietal activity that reinstates environmental alertness after phasic REM periods.

Therefore, this study investigated the link between the pre-stimulus oscillatory alpha phase and neural correlates of early visual perception. In 64 subjects a 64-channel EEG system was used to examine the phase dependence of pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP) in a visual perception experiment. The pre-stimulus oscillatory phase over the primary visual cortex was determined for the individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) as well as the frequency of maximal phase locking (PLFfmax). The phase dependence of VEP latency was determined using single-trial phase sorting. The results indicate a significantly shorter latency for the N75 and P100 components of the VEP between 40 degrees-100 degrees (p < 0.05) and 90 degrees-120 degrees (p < 0.05), respectively when trials were phase-sorted based on the iAPF. In contrast, the PLFfmax phase did not affect the N75 or P100 latency. The study indicates a link between the pre-stimulus alpha phase and neural correlates of early visual perception. These results extend previous behavioral findings to the neurophysiological level and support current models suggesting visual perception is modulated by ongoing alpha oscillations.

Cannabidiol (CBD) has been suggested as a potential treatment for refractory epilepsies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of add-on therapy with CBD for the treatment of refractory childhood epilepsies. Method: Patients with childhood-onset refractory epilepsy, treated at the tertiary epilepsy center of the University Children's Hospital Ljubljana, Slovenia, were included in the study. Add-on therapy with CBD was initiated once the child's epilepsy was categorized as pharmacoresistant to other antiepileptic drugs/therapies. The dosage of CBD was gradually increased to at least 8 mg/kg/day. The effect of CBD treatment was evaluated by the reduction in seizure burden and presence of side effects (positive and negative). Serial electroencephalography was performed in some children. Results: Sixty-six patients were included in the analysis. Thirty-two (48.5%) patients had a more than 50% improvement regarding seizure burden, 14 of whom (21.2%) became seizure-free. None of the patients reported worsening of seizure frequency, but CBD had no effect in 15 (22.7%) patients. Some patients reported less vigorous seizures, shorter duration of seizures, shorter time to recovery, and other positive side effects of CBD treatment. Adverse effects were reported in 5/66 children. Conclusions: In our cohort of patients, CBD was found to have potential benefits as add-on therapy for refractory childhood epilepsies, mainly by reducing seizure burden. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra-and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.

In subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at major risk to develop Alzheimer' Disease (AD) an impairment of subtle visuomotor or praxic abilities is a well-known clinical feature. Enhance of the ratio of EEG alpha3/alpha2 frequency power was detected in subjects with MCI who will transform in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: We explored of the association of alpha3/alpha2 power ratio with cortical size of IPL in patients with MCI. 74 subjects with MCI undergone EEG recording and MRI scans. Alpha3/alpha2 power ratio in addition to cortical size had been computed for each patient. Three MCI groups had been acquired in keeping with growing tertile values of alpha3/alpha2 ratio. Huge difference of cortical thickness among the groups was calculated. Higher alpha3/alpha2 power ratio group had broader cortical loss compared to other teams on the IPL, particularly in the Supramarginal Gyrus, and Precuneus on both hemispheres. Results: Our results unveil the possible part that the IPL could play in determining the classic alterations of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conclusion: Finally, the rise of alpha3/alpha2 power ratio detected a focused anatomo-functional association that could be a reliable marker of incipient AD.

Impaired Midline Theta Power and Connectivity During Proactive Cognitive Control in Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						AX-CPT; Electroencephalography; Functional outcomes; Proactive cognitive control; Schizophrenia; Theta	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY PERFORMANCE; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; ERROR-DETECTION; EEG DYNAMICS; GAMMA; SYNCHRONY; RESPONSES; DYSFUNCTION	BACKGROUND: Disrupted proactive cognitive control, a form of early selection and active goal maintenance, is hypothesized to underlie the broad cognitive deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia (SPs). Current research suggests that the disrupted activation within and connectivity between regions of the cognitive control network contribute to disrupted proactive cognitive control; however, no study has examined these mechanisms using an AX Continuous Performance Test task in schizophrenia. METHODS: Twenty-six SPs (17 male subjects; mean age 34.46 +/- 8.77 years) and 28 healthy control participants (HCs; 16 male subjects; mean age 31.43 +/- 7.23 years) underwent an electroencephalogram while performing the AX Continuous Performance Test. To examine the extent of activation and level of connectivity within the cognitive control network, power, intertrial phase clustering, and intersite phase clustering metrics were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: SPs exhibited expected general decrements in behavioral performance relative to HCs and a more selective deficit in conditions requiring proactive cognitive control. Additionally, SPs exhibited deficits in midline theta power and connectivity during proactive cognitive control trials. Specifically, HCs exhibited significantly greater theta power for B cues relative to A cues, whereas SPs exhibited no significant differences between A- and B-cue theta power. Additionally, differential theta connectivity patterns were observed in SPs and HCs. Behavioral measures of proactive cognitive control predicted functional outcomes in SPs. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that low-frequency midline theta activity is selectively disrupted during proactive cognitive control in SPs. The disrupted midline theta activity may reflect a failure of SPs to proactively recruit cognitive control processes.

Yet, the neurophysiological and functional neuroanatomical structures associated with adverse effects of cognitive control are poorly understood. We used an extreme group approach to compare individuals who exhibit adverse effects of cognitive control to individuals who do not by combining event-related potentials (ERPs), source localization, time-frequency analysis and network analysis methods. While neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control (i.e. N2, N450, theta power and theta-mediated neuronal network efficiency) and task-set updating (P3) both reflect control demands and implicit information processing, differences in the degree of adverse cognitive control effects are associated with two independent neural mechanisms: Individuals, who show adverse behavioral effects of cognitive control, show reduced small-world properties and thus reduced efficiency in theta-modulated networks when they fail to effectively process implicit information. In contrast to this, individuals who do not display adverse control effects show enhanced task-set updating mechanism when effectively processing implicit information, which is reflected by the P3 ERP component and associated with the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ, BA 40) and medial frontal gyrus (MFG; BA 8). These findings suggest that implicit S-R contingencies, which benefit response selection without cognitive control, are always picked up', but may fail to be integrated with task representations to guide response selection. This provides evidence for a neurophysiological and functional neuroanatomical dual-process account of adverse cognitive control effects.

Because gamma-band responses (GBRs) can be used to measure cognitive processing, they may also be useful for elucidating the mechanisms underlying cognitive reactivity. Identifying these mechanisms may permit the development of an index for predicting and preempting MDD recurrence. Here, to identify the neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive reactivity, we examined the characteristics of the GBRs evoked/induced by emotional words in participants with and without rMDD after inducing a negative mood. Methods: Thirty-three healthy control participants and 18 participants with rMDD completed a lexical emotion identification task during electroencephalography along with assessments of cognitive reactivity after negative mood induction. Results: No between-group differences were identified for the task reaction times; however, the rMDD group had significantly higher cognitive reactivity scores than did the control group. Furthermore, the power of late GBRs to positive words was significantly greater in the rMDD group, with the greater power of late GBRs being related to higher cognitive reactivity. Limitations: Considering the population studied, our findings cannot be completely generalized to populations other than adolescents, people with rMDD, and those without a history of co-morbid disorders and early life stress. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the dysfunction of neural circuits related to higher-order processes like memory and attention might underlie cognitive reactivity. Altered late GBRs to positive information may be persistent biomarkers of the depression recurrence risk.

However, these responses are not preferential for nociception, as they are also elicited by transient non-nociceptive vibrotactile, auditory, and visual stimuli. Here, we investigated whether another feature of insular activity, namely gamma-band oscillations (GBOs), is preferentially observed in response to nociceptive stimuli. Although nociception-evoked GBOs have never been explored in the insula, previous scalp electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography studies suggest that nociceptive stimuli elicit GBOs in other areas such as the primary somatosensory and prefrontal cortices, and that this activity could be closely related to pain perception. Furthermore, tracing studies showed that the insula is a primary target of spinothalamic input. Using depth electrodes implanted in 9 patients investigated for epilepsy, we acquired insular responses to brief thermonociceptive stimuli and similarly arousing non-nociceptive vibrotactile, auditory, and visual stimuli (59 insular sites). As compared with non-nociceptive stimuli, nociceptive stimuli elicited a markedly stronger enhancement of GBOs (150-300 ms poststimulus) at all insular sites, suggesting that this feature of insular activity is preferential for thermonociception. Although this activity was also present in temporal and frontal regions, its magnitude was significantly greater in the insula as compared with these other regions.

Overlapping Brain Network and Alpha Power Changes Suggest Visuospatial Attention Effects on Driving Performance	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; functional connectivity; heading error; prestimulus alpha; visuospatial	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; VISUAL AWARENESS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; BAND; SYSTEM; BIAS	When humans perform prolonged, continuous tasks, their performance fluctuates. The etiology of these fluctuations is multifactorial, but they are influenced by changes in attention reflected in underlying neural dynamics. Previous work with electroencephalography has suggested that prestimulus alpha power is a neural signature of attention allocation with higher power portending relatively poorer performance. The functional mechanisms subserving these changes in alpha power and behavior are postulated to be the result of networked neural activity that permits flexibility in the allocation of attention. Here, we directly examine the similarity between prestimulus alpha connectivity and power in relation to performance fluctuations in a continuous driving task. Participants were asked to maintain their vehicle in the center of a simulated highway, and we evaluated their performance by randomly perturbing the vehicle and assessing their steering correction. We then used the 3 seconds of neural activity before the unexpected event to derive alpha functional connectivity in the first analysis and alpha power in the second analysis, and we employed linear regression to separately investigate their relationship to 3 metrics of driving performance ( lane deviation, reaction time (RT), and heading error). We find that the locations involved in our network analysis also show the strongest modulation of alpha activity. Interestingly, the network pattern suggests a posterior to anterior directionality, consistent with bottom-up theories of attention, and these results may reflect a gain control model of attention in which ongoing attention is modulated through coordinated, network activity.

Excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance related to disturbed N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) functioning has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying altered connectivity and AVH in schizophrenia. The current study examined the effects of ketamine, a NMDAR antagonist, on glutamate-related mechanisms underlying interhemispheric gamma-band connectivity, conscious auditory perception during dichotic listening (DL), and the emergence of auditory verbal distortions and hallucinations (AVD/AVH) in healthy volunteers. In a single-blind, pseudo-randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, nineteen male, right-handed volunteers were measured using 64 channel electroencephalography (EEG). Psychopathology was assessed with the PANSS interview and the 5D-ASC questionnaire, including a subscale to detect auditory alterations with regard to AVD/AVH (AUA-AVD/AVH). Interhemispheric connectivity analysis was performed using eLORETA source estimation and lagged phase synchronization (LPS) in the gamma-band range (30-100 Hz). Ketamine induced positive symptoms such as hallucinations in a subgroup of healthy subjects. In addition, interhemispheric gamma-band connectivity was found to be altered under ketamine compared to placebo, and subjects with AUAAVD/AVH under ketamine showed significantly higher interhemispheric gamma-band connectivity than subjects without AUAAVD/AVH. These findings demonstrate a relationship between NMDAR functioning, interhemispheric connectivity in the gammaband frequency range between bilateral auditory cortices and the emergence of AVD/AVH in healthy subjects. The result is in accordance with the interhemispheric miscommunication hypothesis of AVH and argues for a possible role of glutamate in AVH in schizophrenia.

Alpha-gamma phase amplitude coupling subserves information transfer during perceptual sequence learning	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Phase amplitude coupling; Sequence learning; Alpha power	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; CORTICAL NETWORKS; GENERIC METHOD; BAND ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Cross-frequency coupling is suggested to serve transfer of information between wide-spread neuronal assemblies and has been shown to underlie many cognitive functions including learning and memory. In previous work, we found that alpha (8-13 Hz) - gamma (30-48 Hz) phase amplitude coupling (alpha gamma PAC) is decreased during sequence learning in bilateral frontal cortex and right parietal cortex. We interpreted this to reflect decreased demands for visuo-motor mapping once the sequence has been encoded. In the present study, we put this hypothesis to the test by adding a "simple" condition to the standard serial reaction time task (SRTT) with minimal needs for visuo-motor mapping. The standard SRTT in our paradigm entailed a perceptual sequence allowing for implicit learning of a sequence of colors with randomly assigned motor responses. Sequence learning in this case was thus not associated with reduced demands for visuo-motor mapping. Analysis of oscillatory power revealed a learning-related alpha decrease pointing to a stronger recruitment of occipito-parietal areas when encoding the perceptual sequence. Replicating our previous findings but in contrast to our hypothesis, alpha gamma PAC was decreased in sequence compared to random trials over right frontal and parietal cortex. It also tended to be smaller compared to trials requiring a simple motor sequence. We additionally analyzed alpha gamma PAC in resting-state data of a separate cohort. PAC in electrodes over right parietal cortex was significantly stronger compared to sequence trials and tended to be higher compared to simple and random trials of the SRTT data. We suggest that alpha gamma PAC in right parietal cortex reflects a "default-mode" brain state, which gets perturbed to allow for encoding of visual regularities into memory.

Imbalance of Functional Connectivity and Temporal Entropy in Resting-State Networks in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Machine Learning Approach	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						complexity; resting-state; fMRI; connectivity; dynamics; Autism Spectrum Disorders	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; INHIBITORY CONTROL; BRAIN; COMPLEXITY; CHILDREN; EXCITATION/INHIBITION; NEUROPATHOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX	Background: Two approaches to understanding the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involve network level functional connectivity (FC) and the dynamics of neuronal signaling. The former approach has revealed both increased and decreased FC in individuals with ASD. The latter approach has found high frequency EEG oscillations and higher levels of epilepsy in children with ASD. Together, these findings have led to the hypothesis that atypical excitatory-inhibitory neural signaling may lead to imbalanced association pathways. However, simultaneously reconciling local temporal dynamics with network scale spatial connectivity remains a difficult task and thus empirical support for this hypothesis is lacking. Methods: We seek to fill this gap by combining two powerful resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) methods-functional connectivity (FC) and wavelet-based regularity analysis. Wavelet-based regularity analysis is an entropy measure of the local rs-fMRI time series signal. We examined the relationship between the RSN entropy and integrity in individuals with ASD and controls from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) cohort using a putative set of 264 functional brain regions-of-interest (ROI). Results: We observed that an imbalance in intra-and inter-network FC across 11 RSNs in ASD individuals (p = 0.002) corresponds to a weakened relationship with RSN temporal entropy (p = 0.02). Further, we observed that an estimated RSN entropy model significantly distinguished ASD from controls (p = 0.01) and was associated with level of ASD symptom severity (p = 0.003). Conclusions: Imbalanced brain connectivity and dynamics at the network level coincides with their decoupling in ASD. The association with ASD symptom severity presents entropy as a potential biomarker.	[Smith, Robert X.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, NeuroImaging Labs, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Jann, Kay; Wang, Danny J.

Slow frequency oscillations (4-10 Hz) have been shown to support cognitive control processes, especially within prefrontal regions. However, it is unclear how neural oscillations contribute to functional brain network development and improvements in cognitive control during adolescence. To bridge this gap, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to explore changes in oscillatory power and phase coupling across cortical networks in a sample of 68 adolescents and young adults. We found a redistribution of power from lower to higher frequencies throughout adolescence, such that delta band (1-3 Hz) power decreased, whereas beta band power (14-16 and 22-26 Hz) increased. Delta band power decreased with age most strongly in association networks within the frontal lobe and operculum. Conversely, beta band power increased throughout development, most strongly in processing networks and the posterior cingulate cortex, a hub of the default mode (DM) network. In terms of phase, theta band (5-9 Hz) phase-locking robustly decreased with development, following an anterior-to-posterior gradient, with the greatest decoupling occurring between association networks. Additionally, decreased slow frequency phase-locking between frontolimbic regions was related to decreased impulsivity with age. Thus, greater decoupling of slow frequency oscillations may afford functional networks greater flexibility during the resting state to instantiate control when required.

Scalp and intracranial EEG studies have shown that oscillations in the theta frequency band are enhanced during processing of contextually unexpected information. Some theories suggest that the hippocampus and PFC interact during processing of unexpected events, and it is possible that theta oscillations may mediate these interactions. Here, we had the rare opportunity to conduct simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the human hippocampus and PFC from two patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Recordings were conducted during a task that involved encoding of contextually expected and unexpected visual stimuli. Across both patients, hippocampal-prefrontal theta phase synchronization was significantly higher during encoding of contextually unexpected study items, relative to contextually expected study items. Furthermore, the hippocampal-prefrontal theta phase synchronization was larger for contextually unexpected items that were later remembered compared with later forgotten items. Moreover, we did not find increased theta synchronization between the PFC and rhinal cortex, suggesting that the observed effects were specific to prefrontal-hippocampal interactions. Our findings are consistent with the idea that theta oscillations orchestrate communication between the hippocampus and PFC in support of enhanced encoding of contextually deviant information.

Grid cells provide animals [1, 2] and humans [3, 4] with a spatial map of the environment by exhibiting multiple firing fields arranged in a regular grid of equilateral triangles. This unique firing pattern presumably constitutes the neural basis for path integration [5-8] and may also enable navigation in visual and conceptual spaces [9-12]. Theta frequency oscillations are a prominent mesoscopic network phenomenon during navigation in both rodents and humans [13, 14] and encode movement speed [15-17], distance traveled [18], and proximity to spatial boundaries [19]. Whether theta oscillations may also carry a grid-like signal remains elusive, however. Capitalizing on previous fMRI studies revealing a macroscopic proxy of sum grid cell activity in human entorhinal cortex (EC) [20-22], we examined intracranial EEG recordings from the EC of epilepsy patients (n = 9) performing a virtual navigation task. We found that the power of theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) exhibits 6-fold rotational modulation by movement direction, reminiscent of grid cell-like representations detected using fMRI. Modulation of theta power was specific to 6-fold rotational symmetry and to the EC. Hexadirectional modulation of theta power by movement direction only emerged during fast movements, stabilized over the course of the experiment, and showed sensitivity to the environmental boundary. Our results suggest that oscillatory power in the theta frequency range carries an imprint of sum grid cell activity potentially enabled by a common grid orientation of neighboring grid cells [23].

However, conventional sinusoidal tACS limits the ability to record neuronal activity during stimulation and lacks spatial focality. One particularly promising new tACS stimulation paradigm uses amplitude-modulated (AM) high-frequency waveforms (AM-tACS) with a slow signal envelope that may overcome the limitations. Moreover. AM-tACS using high-frequency carrier signals is more tolerable than conventional tACS, e.g. in terms of skin irritation and occurrence of phosphenes, when applied at the same current intensities (e.g. 1-2 mA). Yet, the fundamental mechanism of neuronal target-engagement by AM-tACS waveforms has remained unknown. We used a computational model of cortex to investigate how AM-tACS modulates endogenous oscillations and compared the target engagement mechanism to the case of conventional (unmodulated) low-frequency tACS. Analysis of stimulation amplitude and frequency indicated that cortical oscillations were phase-locked to the envelope of the AM stimulation signal, which thus exhibits the same target engagement mechanism as conventional (unmodulated) low frequency tACS. However, in the computational model substantially higher current intensities were needed for AM-tACS than for low-frequency (unmodulated) tACS waveforms to achieve pronounced phase synchronization. Our analysis of the carrier frequency suggests that there might be a trade-off between the use of high-frequency carriers and the stimulation amplitude required for successful entrainment. Together, our computational simulations support the use of slow-envelope high frequency carrier AM waveforms as a tool for noninvasive modulation of brain oscillations. More empirical data will be needed to identify the optimal stimulation parameters and to evaluate tolerability and safety of both, AM-and conventional tACS.

One central question is how oscillatory brain activity relates to cognitive processes. Up to now, most of the evidence supporting this relationship was correlative in nature. This situation changed dramatically with the recent development of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, which open up new vistas for neuroscience by allowing researchers for the first time to validate their correlational theories by manipulating brain functioning directly. In this review, we focus on transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), an electrical brain stimulation method that applies sinusoidal currents to the intact scalp of human individuals to directly interfere with ongoing brain oscillations. We outline how tACS can impact human brain oscillations by employing different levels of observation from non-invasive tACS application in healthy volunteers and intracranial recordings in patients to animal studies demonstrating the effectiveness of alternating electric fields on neurons in vitro and in vivo. These findings likely translate to humans as comparable effects can be observed in human and animal studies. Neural entrainment and plasticity are suggested to mediate the behavioral effects of tACS. Furthermore, we focus on mechanistic theories about the relationship between certain cognitive functions and specific parameters of brain oscillaitons such as its amplitude, frequency, phase and phase coherence. For each of these parameters we present the current state of testing its functional relevance by means of tACS. Recent developments in the field of tACS are outlined which include the stimulation with physiologically inspired non-sinusoidal waveforms, stimulation protocols which allow for the observation of online-effects, and closed loop applications of tACS.

Amnesic-MCI (aMCI) subjects progress to dementia (typically to Alzheimer-Dementia=AD) at an annual rate which is 20 times higher than that of cognitively intact elderly. The present study aims to investigate whether EEG network Small World properties (SW) combined with Apo-E genotyping, could reliably discriminate aMCI subjects who will convert to AD after approximately a year. Methods145 aMCI subjects were divided into two sub-groups and, according to the clinical follow-up, were classified as Converted to AD (C-MCI, 71) or Stable (S-MCI, 74). ResultsResults showed significant differences in SW in delta, alpha1, alpha2, beta2, gamma bands, with C-MCI in the baseline similar to AD. Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve, based on a first-order polynomial regression of SW, showed 57% sensitivity, 66% specificity and 61% accuracy(area under the curve: AUC=0.64). In 97 out of 145 MCI, Apo-E allele testing was also available. Combining this genetic risk factor with Small Word EEG, results showed: 96.7% sensitivity, 86% specificity and 91.7% accuracy(AUC=0.97). Moreover, using only the Small World values in these 97 subjects, the ROC showed an AUC of 0.63; the resulting classifier presented 50% sensitivity, 69% specificity and 59.6% accuracy. When different types of EEG analysis (power density spectrum) were tested, the accuracy levels were lower (68.86%). InterpretationConcluding, this innovative EEG analysis, in combination with a genetic test (both low-cost and widely available), could evaluate on an individual basis with great precision the risk of MCI progression. This evaluation could then be used to screen large populations and quickly identify aMCI in a prodromal stage of dementia.

Additionally, in numerous studies theta-related neurons were identified in the PHa according to the classification of Bland and Colom (Progress in Neurobiology, 41, 157-208, 1993). It is currently widely accepted that the PHa contributes to the process of HPC theta frequency programming at least in certain behavioral states. The postnatal development of the HPC and its ability to generate theta has also been a subject of studies. Specifically, it was found that theta oscillations are present in the HPC of 8-10 days old rat pups and turn into a well-synchronized and high-amplitude activity in the following few days. In our current study, we therefore focused on the postnatal development of cholinergically-induced theta rhythm and theta-related neuronal activity in PHa slices obtained from 8 to 24 days old rat pups. Theta activity was observed in the PHa preparations at the age of 8-10 days and then progressively increased its probability of occurrence, amplitude and synchrony up to the age of 22-24 days when it reached a plateau phase. A steady increase in the number of recorded neurons correlated with local theta oscillations was also observed. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Classification of Pre-Clinical Seizure States Using Scalp EEG Cross-Frequency Coupling Features	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Epilepsy; clinical seizure onset; early detection; cross-frequency coupling features; machine learning; EEG; random forest; multi-stage state classification	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; PHASE; PATIENT; OSCILLATIONS; ONSET; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; DEVICES; SURGERY	Objective: This work proposes a machine-learning based system for a scalp EEG that flags an alarm in advance of a clinical seizure onset. Methods: EEG recordings from 12 patients with drug resistant epilepsy were marked by an expert neurologist for clinical seizure onset. Scalp EEG recordings consisted of 56 seizures and 9.67 h of interictal periods. Data from six patients were reserved for testing, and the rest was split into training and testing sets. A global spatial average of a cross-frequency coupling (CFC) index, (I) over bar (c)(fc), was extracted in 2 s windows, and used as the feature for the machine learning. A multistage state classifier (MSC) based on random forest algorithms was trained and tested on these data. Training was conducted to classify three states: interictal baseline, and segments prior to and following EG onset. Classifier performance was assessed using a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: The MSC produced an alarm 45 +/- 16 s in advance of a clinical seizure onset across seizures from the 12 patients. It performed with a sensitivity of 87.9%, a specificity of 82.4%, and an area-under-the-ROC of 93.4%. On patients for whom it received training, performance metrics increased. Performance metrics did not change when the MSC used reduced electrode ring configurations. Conclusion: Using the scalp (I) over bar (c)(fc), the MSC produced an alarm in advance of a clinical seizure onset for all 12 patients. Patient-specific training improved the specificity of classification. Significance: The MSC is noninvasive, and demonstrates that CFC features may be suitable for use in a home-based seizure monitoring system.

Spectral Properties of Brain Activity Under Two Anesthetics and Their Potential for Inducing Natural Sleep in Birds	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; pigeon; isoflurane; urethane; slow wave sleep; burst suppression; unihemispheric; coherence	INTERHEMISPHERIC EEG COHERENCE; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; SLOW; OSCILLATION; NEURONS; AWAKE; NREM; REM	Both mammals and birds exhibit two sleep states, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Studying certain aspects of sleep-related electrophysiology in freely behaving animals can present numerous methodological constraints, particularly when even fine body movements interfere with electrophysiological signals. Interestingly, under light general anesthesia, mammals and birds also exhibit slow waves similar to those observed during natural SWS. For these reasons, slow waves occurring under general anesthesia are commonly used in the investigation of sleep-related neurophysiology. However, how spectral properties of slow waves induced by anesthesia correspond to those occurring during natural SWS in birds has yet to be investigated systematically. In this study, we systematically analyzed spectral properties of electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns of pigeons (Columba livia) occurring under two commonly used anesthetics, isoflurane and urethane. These data were compared with EEG patterns during natural sleep. Slow waves occurring during spontaneous SWS, and those induced with isoflurane and urethane all showed greatest absolute power in the slowest frequencies (<3 Hz). Isoflurane and urethane-induced slow waves had near-identical power spectra, and both had higher mean power than that observed during SWS for all frequencies examined (0-25 Hz). Interestingly, burst suppression EEG activity observed under deeper planes of isoflurane anesthesia could occur bihemispherically or unihemispherically. Electrophysiological patterns while under isoflurane and urethane share phenomenological and spectral similarities to those occurring during SWS, notably the generation of high amplitude, slow waves, and peak low-frequency power. These results build upon other studies which suggest that some anesthetics exert their effects by acting on natural sleep pathways. As such, anesthesia-induced slow waves appear to provide an acceptable model for researchers interested in investigating sleep-related slow waves utilizing electrophysiological methods not suitable for use in freely behaving birds.

J	Haaf, M; Leicht, G; Curic, S; Mulert, C				Haaf, Moritz; Leicht, Gregor; Curic, Stjepan; Mulert, Christoph			Glutamatergic Schizophrenia - Biomarkers and Pharmacological Interventions within the Ketamine Model	CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review						EEG; fMRI; ketamine; MEG; NMDA-receptor; schizophrenia	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; RESTING-STATE FMRI; NMDA ANTAGONIST MODEL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INDUCED DISRUPTION; BRAIN-FUNCTION; NEURAL BASIS; SYMPTOMS; NICOTINE	Background: The observation that N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine transiently induce schizophrenia-like positive, negative and cognitive symptoms has led to a paradigm shift from dopaminergic to glutamatergic dysfunction in pharmacological models of schizophrenia. NMDAR hypofunction can explain many schizophrenia symptoms directly due to excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance, but also dopaminergic dysfunction itself. However, so far no new drug targeting the NMDAR has been successfully approved. In the search for possible biomarkers it is interesting that ketamine-induced psychopathological changes in healthy participants were accompanied by altered electro-(EEG), magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed/Medline and Web of Knowledge databases (January 2006 to July 2017) to identify EEG/MEG and fMRI studies of the ketamine model of schizophrenia with human subjects. The search strategy identified 209 citations of which 46 articles met specified eligibility criteria. Results: In EEG/MEG studies, ketamine induced changes of event-related potentials, such as the P300 potential and the mismatch negativity, similar to alterations observed in schizophrenia patients. In fMRI studies, alterations of activation were observed in different brain regions, most prominently within the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic structures as well as task-relevant brain regions. These alterations were accompanied by changes in functional connectivity, indicating a balance shift of the underlying brain networks. Pharmacological treatments did alter ketamine-induced changes in EEG/MEG and fMRI studies to different extents. Conclusion: This review highlights the potential applicability of the ketamine model for schizophrenia drug development by offering the possibility to assess the effect of pharmacological agents on schizophrenia-like symptoms and to find relevant neurophysiological and neuroimaging biomarkers.

The availability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows to directly probe virtually any cortical areas, thus providing a unique way to assess the neurophysiological properties of cortical neurons. This article presents a review of studies employing TMS in combination with Motor Evoked Potentials (TMS/MEPs) and high density Electroencephalogram (TMS/hd-EEG) in schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Studies were identified by conducting a PubMed search using the following search item: "transcranial magnetic stimulation and (Schizophrenia or OCD or MDD or ADHD)". Studies that utilized TMS/MEP and/or TMS/hd-EEG measures to characterize cortical excitability, inhibition, oscillatory activity, and/or connectivity in psychiatric patients were selected. Across disorders, patients displayed a pattern of reduced cortical inhibition, and to a lesser extent increased excitability, in the motor cortex, which was most consistently established in Schizophrenia. Furthermore, psychiatric patients showed abnormalities in a number of TMS-evoked EEG oscillations, which was most prominent in the prefrontal cortex of Schizophrenia relative to healthy comparison subjects. Overall, results from this review point to significant impairments in cortical excitability, inhibition, and oscillatory activity, especially in frontal areas, in several major psychiatric disorders. Building on these findings, future studies employing TMS-based experimental paradigms may help elucidating the neurobiology of these psychiatric disorders, and may assess the contribution of TMS-related measures in monitoring and possibly maximizing the effectiveness of treatment interventions in psychiatric populations.

After decades of research our understanding of REMS still is precluded by the difficulty to observe its spontaneous dynamics and the lack of multimodal recording approaches to build comprehensive datasets. We used functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging concurrently with extracellular recordings of local field potentials (LFP) to reveal brain-wide spatiotemporal hemodynamics of single REMS episodes. We demonstrate for the first time the close association between global hyperemic events-largely outmatching wake levels in most brain regions - and local hippocampal theta (6-10 Hz) and fast gamma (80-110 Hz) events in the CA1 region. In particular, the power of fast gamma oscillations strongly correlated with the amplitude of subsequent vascular events. Our findings challenge our current understanding of neurovascular coupling and question the evolutionary benefit of such energy-demanding patterns in REMS function.

Recent theoretical work suggests such a framework can emerge during embryogenesis by selection of neuron ensembles and synaptic connections that maximize the magnitude of synchrony while approaching ultra-small-world connectivity. The emergent structures correspond to those of both columnar and non-columnar cortex. With initial connections thus organized, spatio-temporal information in sensory inputs can generate systematic and specific patterns of synchronous oscillation, with consequent synaptic storage. The theoretical assemblies of connections resemble experimentally observed lego sets', while facilitation and interference among synchronous patterns, particularly when executed by fast synapses under metabolic entanglement, imply powerful parallel computation.

Here we show that an operant conditioning paradigm which provides neurofeedback of the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), enables participants to self-modulate their own brain state. Following training, participants were able to robustly increase (by 83.8%) and decrease (by 30.6%) their MEP amplitudes. This volitional up-versus down-regulation of corticomotor excitability caused an increase of late-cortical disinhibition (LCD), a TMS derived read-out of presynaptic GABA(B) disinhibition, which was accompanied by an increase of gamma and a decrease of alpha oscillations in the trained hemisphere. This approach paves the way for future investigations into how altered brain state influences motor neurophysiology and recovery of function in a neurorehabilitation context.

Based on prior evidence for a dependence of auditory task performance on delta-band oscillatory phase, we hypothesized that the synchronization of electrophysiological responses at delta-band frequency to the speech stimulus serves to implicitly align neural excitability with syntactic information. The experimental paradigm of our auditory EEG study uniformly distributed morphosyntactic violations across syntactic phrases of natural sentences, such that violations would occur at points differing in linguistic information content. In support of our hypothesis, we found behavioral responses to morphosyntactic violations to increase with decreasing syntactic information contentin significant correlation with delta-band phase, which had synchronized to our speech stimuli. Our findings indicate that rhythmic electrophysiological synchronization to the speech stream is a functional mechanism that may align neural excitability with linguistic information content, optimizing language comprehension.

J	Valadez, EA; Simons, RF				Valadez, Emilio A.; Simons, Robert F.			The power of frontal midline theta and post-error slowing to predict performance recovery: Evidence for compensatory mechanisms	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive control; EEG; frontal midline theta; orienting; post-error slowing; time-frequency power	BRAIN ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; RELIABILITY; ERN; COMPONENT; ANXIETY; SEARCH	Past studies utilizing cognitive control tasks have noted that trials following errors are characterized by slowed reaction time. Despite the assumption long held by researchers that this slowing is compensatory (in the service of post-error performance recovery), studies consistently show that post-error trials are no more accurate than post-correct trials. As a result, it has recently been proposed that post-error slowing (PES) is merely part of an orienting response that serves no task-relevant cognitive control purpose. Frontal midline theta (FM) oscillations represent another potential compensatory mechanism serving cognitive control processes, yet past studies relying on ERPs have failed to find an association between FM and post-error accuracy. The present study investigated the potentially adaptive role of PES and FM oscillations during a flanker task using trial-by-trial comparisons. Results indicated that error-related FM oscillations signal the need for enhanced top-down cognitive control and that PES supports cognitive control by providing the added time needed to achieve greater confidence in judgment. Overall, findings provide convergent evidence that both error-related FM and PES predict performance recovery following errors.

Correct detection of HFOs in the MEG signals is crucial for the accurate and timely clinical evaluation. Since the visual examination of HFOs is time-consuming, error-prone, and with poor inter-reviewer reliability, an automatic HFOs detector is highly desirable in clinical practice. However, the existing approaches for HFOs detection may not be applicable for MEG signals with noisy background activity. Therefore, we employ the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) and propose an SSAE-based MEG HFOs (SMO) detector to facilitate the clinical detection of HFOs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to conduct HFOs detection in MEG using deep learning methods. After configuration optimization, our proposed SMO detector is outperformed other classic peermodels by achieving 89.9% in accuracy, 88.2% in sensitivity, and 91.6% in specificity. Furthermore, we have tested the performance consistency of ourmodel using various validation schemes. The distribution of performance metrics demonstrates that our model can achieve steady performance.

Recent findings have shown that temporal orienting operates relatively early across development, suggesting that this attentional mechanism plays a core role for human cognition. However, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms allowing children to attune their attention over time are not well understood. In this study, we presented 8- to 12-year-old children with a temporal cueing task designed to test (1) whether anticipatory oscillatory dynamics predict children's behavioral performance on a trial-by-trial basis and (2) whether anticipatory oscillatory neural activity may be supported by cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling as previously shown in adults. Crucially, we found that, similar to what has been reported in adults, children's ongoing beta rhythm was strongly coupled with their theta rhythm and that the strength of this coupling distinguished validly cued temporal intervals, relative to neutral cued trials. In addition, in long trials, there was an inverse correlation between oscillatory beta power and children's trial-by-trial reaction, consistent with oscillatory beta power reflecting better response preparation. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that temporal attention in children operates by exploiting oscillatory mechanism.

In the preoperative localization of epileptic seizures, the traditional manual observation of 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz cpileptiform discharge to determine the onset of epilepsy is very time-consuming and prones to great errors, It not only increases the risk of patient treatment, but also causes misdiagnosis. At present, SOZ auto-location algorithms mostly adopt a single feature extraction algorithm Although these methods have high sensitivity, but have low specificity, false positives still exist. In this paper, we propose a SOZ location algorithm based on multivariate feature extraction of HFOs and wavelet time-frequency map. The Wavelet Entropy (WE), Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Teager Energy Operator (TEO) are used to extract the suspected channel of epileptic SOZ. Then according to the wavelet time-frequency map to further determine the results. The effectiveness of this algorithm is verified by the results of 5 clinical cases,	[Du, Yuxiao; Sun, Bo] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Automat, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China		Du, YX (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Automat, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.	yuxiaodu@gdut.edu.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of China [17ZK0029]; Guangdong Provincial Science Foundation of China [2013B010401027]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Provincial Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)	This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 17ZK0029, and the Guangdong Provincial Science Foundation of China under Grant 2013B010401027.		19	2	2	0	3	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2161-2927		978-9-8815-6395-8	CHIN CONTR CONF			2018							4283	4288						6	Automation & Control Systems	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Automation & Control Systems	BM7ZN					2022-08-02	WOS:000468622104039

Recent studies indicate that at the very early stage of this disease, increased phosphorylation in Tau's MDr domain correlates with reduced levels of neuronal excitability. Mechanistically, we show that pyramidal neurons and some parvalbumin-positive interneurons in 1-month-old triple-transgenic AD mice accumulate hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and that this accumulation correlates with changes in theta oscillations in hippocampal neurons. Pyramidal neurons from young triple-transgenic AD mice exhibited less spike accommodation and power increase in subthreshold membrane oscillations. Furthermore, triple-transgenic AD mice challenged with the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine had reduced theta amplitude compared with 4-aminopyridine-treated control mice and, unlike these controls, displayed no seizure-like activity after this challenge. Collectively, our results provide new insights into AD pathogenesis and suggest that increases in Tau phosphorylation at the initial stages of the disease represent neuronal responses that compensate for brain circuit overexcitation.

To address this question, we examined 14 drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients implanted with stereotactic electrodes in the insular cortex. All participants performed a delayed match-to-sample task. Event-related potentials and spectrograms from each insular subarea were analyzed when the participants were exposed to identical (match condition) and different (mismatch condition) stimuli. Each of the insular subareas had a significantly different event-related potential within the investigated interval of recognition memory under both match and mismatch conditions. Moreover, we observed that most of contacts in the left anterior insula had a stronger high-gamma response under the mismatch condition than the match condition, whereas most of contacts in the right insula had a stronger high-gamma response under the match condition than the mismatch condition. Thus, distinct roles for each insular subarea in recognition memory were found in this study. The right insula appears to subserve recognition memory by focusing on processing identical information, whereas the left anterior insula seems to subserve conflict monitoring by focusing on processing different information.

Recent research suggested a facilitated transition from wake to sleep and a boosting of slow oscillations and sleep spindles due to lateral rocking movements during an afternoon nap. This study aimed at investigating the effect of vestibular stimulation on sleep onset, nocturnal sleep and its potential to increase sleep spindles and slow waves, which could influence memory performance. Polysomnography was recorded in 18 males (age: 20-28 years) during three nights: movement until sleep onset (C1), movement for 2 hours (C2), and one baseline (B) without motion. Sleep dependent changes in memory performance were assessed with a word-pair learning task. Although subjects preferred nights with vestibular stimulation, a facilitated sleep onset or a boost in slow oscillations was not observed. N2 sleep and the total number of sleep spindles increased during the 2 h with vestibular stimulation (C2) but not over the entire night. Memory performance increased over night but did not differ between conditions. The lack of an effect might be due to the already high sleep efficiency (96%) and sleep quality of our subjects during baseline. Nocturnal sleep in good sleepers might not benefit from the potential facilitating effects of vestibular stimulation.

Electroencephalographic activity (EEG: alpha and theta power) was obtained in 10 hyperthermic participants in HOT (50 degrees C, 50% RH) conditions and in a normothermic state in CON (25 degrees C, 50% RH) conditions in counterbalanced order. In each trial, EEG was measured over the frontal lobe prior to task engagement (PRE) in each condition and during simple (One Touch Stockings of Cambridge, OTS-4) and complex (OTS-6) cognitive tasks. Core (39.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 36.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C) and mean skin (39.06 +/- 0.3 vs. 31.6 +/- 0.6 degrees C) temperatures were significantly higher in HOT than CON (p < 0.005). Theta power significantly increased with task demand (p = 0.017, eta(2) = 0.36) and was significantly higher in HOT than CON (p = 0.041, eta(2) = 0.39). The difference between HOT and CON was large (eta(2) = 0.40) and significant (p = 0.036) PRE, large (eta(2) = 0.20) but not significant (p = 0.17) during OTS-4, and disappeared during OTS-6 (p = 0.87, eta(2) = 0.00). Those changes in theta power suggest that hyperthermia may act as an additional cognitive load. However, this load disappeared during OTS-6 together with an impaired performance, suggesting a potential saturation of the available resources.

J	Kosmyna, N; Lindgren, JT; Lecuyer, A				Kosmyna, Nataliya; Lindgren, Jussi T.; Lecuyer, Anatole			Attending to Visual Stimuli versus Performing Visual Imagery as a Control Strategy for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ALPHA-BAND; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION; OBJECT; CLASSIFIERS; ATTENTION; BCI	Currently the most common imagery task used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) is motor imagery, asking a user to imagine moving a part of the body. This study investigates the possibility to build BCIs based on another kind of mental imagery, namely "visual imagery". We study to what extent can we distinguish alternative mental processes of observing visual stimuli and imagining it to obtain EEG-based BCIs. Per trial, we instructed each of 26 users who participated in the study to observe a visual cue of one of two predefined images (a flower or a hammer) and then imagine the same cue, followed by rest. We investigated if we can differentiate between the different subtrial types from the EEG alone, as well as detect which image was shown in the trial. We obtained the following classifier performances: (i) visual imagery vs. visual observation task (71% of classification accuracy), (ii) visual observation task towards different visual stimuli (classifying one observation cue versus another observation cue with an accuracy of 61%) and (iii) resting vs. observation/imagery (77% of accuracy between imagery task versus resting state, and the accuracy of 75% between observation task versus resting state). Our results show that the presence of visual imagery and specifically related alpha power changes are useful to broaden the range of BCI control strategies.

However, there is no firm conclusion on acute neuroelectrophysiological changes among methadone-treated subjects as well as the effectiveness of methadone in restoring brain electrical abnormalities among heroin addicts. This study aims to investigate the acute and short-term effects of methadone administration on the brain's electrophysiological properties before and after daily methadone intake over 10weeks of treatment among heroin addicts. EEG spectral analysis and single-trial event-related potential (ERP) measurements were used to investigate possible alterations in the brain's electrical activities, as well as the cognitive attributes associated with MMN and P3. The results confirmed abnormal brain activities predominantly in the beta band and diminished information processing ability including lower amplitude and prolonged latency of cognitive responses among heroin addicts compared to healthy controls. In addition, the alteration of EEG activities in the frontal and central regions was found to be associated with the withdrawal symptoms of drug users. Certain brain regions were found to be influenced significantly by methadone intake; acute effects of methadone induction appeared to be associative to its dosage. The findings suggest that methadone administration affects cognitive performance and activates the cortical neuronal networks, resulting in cognitive responses enhancement which may be influential in reorganizing cognitive dysfunctions among heroin addicts. This study also supports the notion that the brain's oscillation powers and ERPs can be utilized as neurophysiological indices for assessing the addiction treatment traits.

Over the past 50 years, observational methods have provided a large amount of insight regarding the neural mechanisms that underpin the mental capacity that we refer to as "working memory." More than 20 years ago, a neural coding scheme was proposed for working memory. As a result of technological developments, we can now not only observe but can also influence brain rhythms in humans. Building on these novel developments, we have begun to externally control brain oscillations in order to extend the limits of working memory.

Eight emotional features, computed as hemispheric asymmetry between eight electrode pairs (Fp1 - Fp2, F7 - F8, F3 - F4, C3 - C4, T7 - T8, P7 - P8, P3 - P4, and O1 - O2), have been classified by using data mining methods. Results show that inter-hemispheric emotional functions are mostly mediated by gamma. The best classification is provided by a neural network classifier, while the best features are provided by CWC in time-scale domain due to non-stationary nature of electroencephalographic (EEG) series. The highest asymmetry levels are provided by pleasant pictures at mostly anterio-frontal (F3 - F4) and central (C3 - C4) electrode pairs in gamma. Inter-hemispheric asymmetry levels are changed by each emotional state at all lobes. In conclusion, we can state the followings: (1) Nonlinear and wavelet transform-based methods are more suitable for characterization of EEG; (2) The highest difference in hemispheric asymmetry was observed among emotional states in gamma; (3) Cortical emotional functions are not region-specific, since all lobes are effected by emotional stimuli at different levels; and (4) Pleasant stimuli can strongly mediate the brain in comparison to unpleasant and neutral stimuli.

Methods: rsEEG data had been collected in ADMCI, PDMCI, and Nold subjects (N = 75 for any group). eLORETA freeware estimated functional lagged linear connectivity (LLC) from rsEEG cortical sources. Area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve indexed the accuracy in the classification of Nold and MCI individuals. Results: Posterior interhemispheric and widespread intrahemispheric alpha LLC solutions were abnormally lower in both MCI groups compared to the Nold group. At the individual level, AUROC curves of LLC solutions in posterior alpha sources exhibited moderate accuracies (0.70-0.72) in the discrimination of Nold vs. ADMCI-PDMCI individuals. No differences in the LLC solutions were found between the two MCI groups. Conclusions: These findings unveil similar abnormalities in functional cortical connectivity estimated in widespread alpha sources in ADMCI and PDMCI. This was true at both group and individual levels. Significance: The similar abnormality of alpha source connectivity in ADMCI and PDMCI subjects might reflect common cholinergic impairment.

Speech perception is surprisingly robust to interference by interruption, however speech that is replaced by gaps of silence is difficult to understand. When those silences are filled with noise, the speech is once again perceived as continuous even when the underlying speech sounds are removed completely. This is a phenomenon known as phonemic restoration. Perception of normal speech is accompanied by robust phase-locking of EEG signals to acoustic and linguistic features of speech. In this study we test the theory that interrupting speech with silence impairs perception by interfering with neural speech tracking. Further, we test the theory that we can restore perception and phase-tracking of the original acoustics by inserting noise in the interruptions. We find that disruptions of the acoustic envelope reduce the tracking of both acoustic and phonemic features. By inserting amplitude modulated noise such that the original broadband envelope is restored, we improved perception of the degraded speech and restored the magnitude of the speech tracking response; however, topographic analysis suggests that the neural response to noise-interrupted speech may recruit systematically different brain areas. The acoustic envelope seems to be an important physical component of speech that facilitates the dynamic neural mechanisms for perception of spoken language, particularly in adverse listening conditions.

However, this task has recently been associated with poor reliability and conflicting results. To resolve these discrepancies, we tested the underlying assumption of the dot-probe taskthat fast probe responses index heightened cue selectionusing an electrophysiological measure of selective attention. Specifically, we used a reverse correlation approach in combination with frequency-tagged steady-state visual potentials (ssVEPs). Twenty-one participants completed a modified dot-probe task in which each member of a pair of lateralized face cues, varying in emotional expression (angry-angry, neutral-angry, neutral-neutral), flickered at one of two frequencies (15 or 20 Hz), to evoke ssVEPs. One cue was then replaced by a response probe, and participants indicated the probe orientation (0 degrees or 90 degrees). We analyzed the ssVEP evoked by the cues as a function of response speed to the subsequent probe (i.e., a reverse correlation analysis). Electrophysiological measures of cue processing varied with probe hemifield location: Faster responses to left probes were associated with weak amplification of the preceding left cue, apparent only in a median split analysis. By contrast, faster responses to right probes were systematically and parametrically predicted by diminished visuocortical selection of the preceding right cue. Together, these findings highlight the poor validity of the dot-probe task, in terms of quantifying intrinsic, nondirected attentive selection irrespective of probe/cue location.

SEP recordings have also been used to investigate adaptive plasticity changes in somatosensory processing related to active and observational motor learning tasks. Combining noninvasive brain stimulation with SEP recordings and intracranial SEP depth recordings, including recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes, has been critical in identifying neural areas involved in specific temporal stages of somatosensory processing. Consequently, this fundamental information has furthered our understanding of the maladaptive plasticity changes related to pathophysiology of diseases characterized by abnormal movements, such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and functional movement disorders.

We have recently examined cryosurgery for epilepsy in animal models, and found that penicillin G (PG)-induced epileptiform discharges (EDs) mostly vanished after freezing. However, EDs were provoked again after insufficient freezing. Inadequate freezing is not visually detectable during and just after freezing and is not predictable beforehand. To manage this problem, we examined whether intraoperative monitoring of electrocorticograms (ECoGs) can predict recurrence of EDs after cryosurgery. Methods: A palm-sized cryoprobe system was applied to focal seizures in a Wistar rat model in which EDs were induced in advance by intracerebral injection of PG. During stable induction of EDs, the cryoprobe was carefully inserted into the epileptic region and this region was immediately frozen. After the series of prefreezing, freezing, and postfreezing, rats in which PG-induced EDs relapsed within 3h were defined as the ED-relapsed (EDR) group, and other rats were defined as the ED-vanished (EDV) group. Time-frequency analysis was conducted on the ECoGs in each group through each freezing series. Results: Relapse of PG-induced EDs on ECoG after the freezing series was associated with the remaining power of the delta band in the freezing period more strongly in the EDR group than in the EDV group. Conclusions: Success or failure of the freezing procedure can be predicted by the specificity of the delta band of the ECoG obtained intraoperatively.

In digitalized advanced main control rooms, human operators conduct highly cognitive work rather than physical work compared to the case of the original control rooms in NPPs. Various operating support systems (OSSs) have been developed to reduce an operator's workload. Most representative techniques to evaluate the workload are based on subjective ratings. However, there are some limitations including the possibility of skewed results due to self-assessment of the worldoad and the impossibility of continuously measuring the workload due to freezing simulation for workload assessment. As opposed to subjective ratings techniques, physiological techniques can be used for objective and continuous measurements of a human operator's mental status by sensing the physiological changes of the autonomic or central nervous system. In this study, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to measure the operator's mental workload because it had been proven to be sensitive to variations of mental workload in other studies, and it allows various types of analysis. Based on various research reviews on the characteristics of brainwaves, EEG based Workload Index (EWI) was suggested and validated through experiments. As a result, EWI is concluded to be valid for measuring an operator's mental workload and preferable to subjective techniques. Furthermore, EWI was applied to evaluate the effects of OSSs on human operators through experiments. Finally, it is expected that the results of this study can be used to measure the operator's workload in NPPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(2) Classifying tissue under individual electrodes as epileptogenic (3) Reproducing results across laboratories. MethodsWe recorded HFOs using intracranial EEG (iEEG) in 90 patients with focal epilepsy and 11 patients without epilepsy. In nine patients with epilepsy putative physHFOs were induced by cognitive or motor tasks. HFOs were identified using validated detectors. A support vector machine (SVM) using HFO features was developed to classify tissue under individual electrodes as normal or epileptogenic. ResultsThere was significant overlap in the amplitude, frequency, and duration distributions for spontaneous physHFO, task induced physHFO, and pathHFO, but the amplitudes of the pathHFO were higher (P<0.0001). High gamma pathHFO had the strongest association with seizure onset zone (SOZ), and were elevated on SOZ electrodes in 70% of epilepsy patients (P<0.0001). Failure to resect tissue generating high gamma pathHFO was associated with poor outcomes (P<0.0001). A SVM classified individual electrodes as epileptogenic with 63.9% sensitivity and 73.7% specificity using SOZ as the target. InterpretationA broader range of interictal pathHFO (65-600Hz) than previously recognized are biomarkers of epileptogenic brain, and are associated with SOZ and surgical outcome. Classification of HFOs into physiological or pathological remains challenging. Classification of tissue under individual electrodes was demonstrated to be feasible. The open source data and algorithms provide a resource for future studies.

However, experimental results are variable and often difficult to reconcile. Some of these inconsistencies arise from the use of hypothesis-driven analysis approaches that (1) do not assess the consistency of the observed responses within and across individuals, and (2) do not fully exploit information sampled across the entire cortex. Here, we address these issues by recording the electrocorticogram directly from the brain surface of 12 freely moving rats. Using a hypothesis-free approach, we isolated brain oscillations induced by graded nociceptive stimuli and characterized their relation to pain-related behavior. We isolated 4 responses, one phase-locked event-related potential, 2 non-phase-locked event-related synchronizations, and one non-phase-locked event-related desynchronization (ERD), in different frequency bands (delta/theta-ERD, theta/alpha-event-related synchronization, and gamma-band event-related synchronization). All responses except the delta/theta-ERD correlated with pain-related behavior at within-subject level. Notably, the gamma-band event-related synchronization was the only response that reliably correlated with pain-related behavior between subjects. These results comprehensively characterize the physiological properties of the brain oscillations elicited by nociceptive stimuli in freely moving rodents and provide a foundational work to improve the translation of experimental animal findings to human physiology and pathophysiology.

Comparison of Neuroplastic Responses to Cathodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation in Subacute Stroke	ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Cathodal Stimulation tDCS; Electroencephalography; Rehabilitation; Stroke; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Repetitive	NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; CORTICAL FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; UPPER-EXTREMITY; DOUBLE-BLIND; ADULT NORMS; EEG DATA; RECOVERY; VARIABILITY	Objective: To investigate the effects of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) on neural network connectivity and motor recovery in individuals with subacute stroke. Design: Double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Setting: University hospital rehabilitation unit. Participants: Inpatients with stroke (N = 41; mean age, 65y; range, 28-85y; mean weeks poststroke, 5; range, 2-10) with resultant paresis in the upper extremity (mean Fugl-Meyer score, 14; range, 3-48). Interventions: Subjects with stroke were randomly assigned to neuronavigated cTBS (n = 14), cathodal tDCS (n = 14), or sham transcranial magnetic stimulation/sham tDCS (n = 13) over the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1). Each subject completed 9 stimulation sessions over 3 weeks, combined with physical therapy. Main Outcome Measures: Brain function was assessed with directed and nondirected functional connectivity based on high-density electroen-cephalography before and after stimulation sessions. Primary clinical end point was the change in slope of the multifaceted motor score composed of the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment score, Box and Block test score, 9-Hole Peg Test score, and Jamar dynamometer results between the baseline period and the treatment time. Results: Neither stimulation treatment enhanced clinical motor gains. Cathodal tDCS and cTBS induced different neural effects. Only cTBS was able to reduce transcallosal influences from the contralesional to the ipsilesional M1 during rest. Conversely, tDCS enhanced perilesional beta band oscillation coherence compared with cTBS and sham groups. Correlation analyses indicated that the modulation of interhemispheric driving and perilesional beta-band connectivity were not independent mediators for functional recovery across all patients. However, exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that the enhancement of perilesional beta-band connectivity through tDCS might have more robust clinical gains if started within the first 4 weeks after stroke. Conclusions: The inhibition of the contralesional M1 or the reduction of interhemispheric interactions was not clinically useful in the heterogeneous group of subjects with subacute stroke. An early modulation of perilesional oscillation coherence seems to be a more promising strategy for brain stimulation interventions.

J	Singer, W				Singer, Wolf			Neuronal oscillations: unavoidable and useful?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cerebral cortex; non-linear dynamics; oscillations; recurrent networks; synchrony	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; LIMIT-CYCLE OSCILLATORS; WORKING-MEMORY; COUPLED OSCILLATORS; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS; SYNAPTIC MODIFICATIONS; STIMULUS PROPERTIES; INTRACRANIAL EEG; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	Neuronal systems have a high propensity to engage in oscillatory activity because both the properties of individual neurons and canonical circuit motifs favour rhythmic activity. In addition, coupled oscillators can engage in a large variety of dynamical regimes, ranging from synchronization with different phase offsets to chaotic behaviour. Which regime prevails depends on differences between preferred oscillation frequencies, coupling strength and coupling delays. The ability of delay coupled oscillator networks to generate a rich repertoire of temporally structured activation sequences is exploited by central pattern generator networks for the control of movements. However, it is less clear whether temporal patterning of neuronal discharges also plays a role in cognitive processes. Here, it will be argued that the temporal patterning of neuronal discharges emerging from delay coupled oscillator networks plays a pivotal role in all instances in which selective relations have to be established between the responses of distributed assemblies of neurons. Examples are the dynamic formation of functional networks, the selective routing of activity in densely interconnected networks, the attention-dependent selection of sensory signals, the fast and context-dependent binding of responses for further joint processing in pattern recognition and the formation of associations by learning. Special consideration is given to arguments that challenge a functional role of oscillations and synchrony in cognition because of the volatile nature of these phenomena and recent evidence will be reviewed suggesting that this volatility is functionally advantageous.

Alterations of Coherent Theta and Gamma Network Oscillations as an Early Biomarker of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Alzheimer's disease; temporal lobe epilepsy; memory; electroencephalography; oscillatory activity; coherent analysis; early diagnostics	FIELD POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MULTIITEM WORKING-MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; MOUSE MODEL; BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; EPISODIC MEMORY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS	Alzheimer's disease (AD) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are the most common forms of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the loss of cells and progressive irreversible alteration of cognitive functions, such as attention and memory. AD may be an important cause of epilepsy in the elderly. Early diagnosis of diseases is very important for their successful treatment. Many efforts have been done for defining new biomarkers of these diseases. Significant advances have been made in the searching of some AD and TLE reliable biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid and plasma measurements and glucose positron emission tomography. However, there is a great need for the biomarkers that would reflect changes of brain activity within few milliseconds to obtain information about cognitive disturbances. Successful early detection of AD and TLE requires specific biomarkers capable of distinguishing individuals with the progressing disease from ones with other pathologies that affect cognition. In this article, we review recent evidence suggesting that magnetoencephalographic recordings and coherent analysis coupled with behavioral evaluation can be a promising approach to an early detection of AD and TLE. Highlights - Data reviewed include the results of clinical and experimental studies. - Theta and gamma rhythms are disturbed in epilepsy and AD. - Common and different behavioral and oscillatory features of pathologies are compared. - Coherent analysis can be useful for an early diagnostics of diseases.

A method for decomposing multivariate time series into a causal hierarchy within specific frequency bands	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Autoregression; Granger causality; Electroencephalogram; Hierarchical decomposition	3/S ICTAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; FEEDBACK; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; FEEDFORWARD; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; EEG	We propose a method - Frequency extracted hierarchical decomposition (FEHD) - for studying multivariate time series that identifies linear combinations of its components that possess a causally hierarchical structure - the method orders the components so that those at the top of the hierarchy drive those below. The method shares many of the features of the hierarchical decomposition method of Repucci et al. (Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 29, 1135-1149, 2001) but makes a crucial advance - the proposed method is capable of determining this causal hierarchy over arbitrarily specified frequency bands. Additionally, a novel minimization strategy is used to generate the decomposition resulting in an increase in stability, reliability, and an improvement in the sensitivity to model parameters. We demonstrate the utility of the method by applying it to both artificial time series constructed to have specific causal graphs, and to the EEG of healthy volunteers and patient subjects who are recovering from a severe brain injury.

This study explored the possibility of determining a person's recognition of other individuals by analyzing the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) triggered by visual oscillations of familiar and unfamiliar faces. In our study, 23 adult (10 men) participants gave subjective familiarity ratings (in a 7-point Likert scale) of > 300 celebrities' and strangers' faces. For each participant, ten familiar and ten unfamiliar faces were selected based on his/her ratings. The selected faces were presented at 6 Hz while the participants performed a 'color change detection task orthogonal to the attributes of faces. The task was designed to maintain participants' visual attention towards the faces throughout the stimulus oscillations. Any difference between conditions would indicate modulation of visual attention by face familiarity. Results showed that the 12-Hz event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs in decibel) at parietal-occipital electrodes were significantly lower when viewing familiar faces compared to unfamiliar faces. In individual level analysis, 18 out of 23 (78%) participants had significantly lower 12-Hz ERSPs at left parietal-occipital ROI in familiar face than unfamiliar face trials. This is the first study to demonstrate that SSVEPs triggered by stimulus oscillations can reveal people's recognition of faces with only 20 trials per condition and 10-s for each trial.

Eleven college-aged participants performed the TTE test on a cycle-ergometer with simultaneous EEG and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) monitoring. EEG data from 32 electrodes were divided into five effort level periods based on RPE values (Baseline, RPE 0-4, RPE 5-8, RPE 9-MAX, and Recovery). Within subjects RM-ANOVA was conducted to examine time to task completion across Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 performance trials. RM-ANOVA (3 performance types x 5 effort levels) was also performed to compare the EEG coherence matrices in the alpha and beta bands for 13 pairs of electrodes (F3-F4, F3-P3, F4-P4, T7-T8, T7-P3, C3-C4, C3-P3, C4-P4, T8-P4, P3-P4, P3-O1, P4-O2, O2-O1). Significant differences were observed on TTE performance outcomes between Type 1 and Type 3, and between Type 2 and Type 3 performance states (p < 0.05), whereas Type 1 and Type 2 performance states did not differ. No significant main effects were observed on performance type (p > 0.05) for all frequency bands in any pair of electrodes of the coherence matrices. Higher EEG coherence values were observed at rest (Baseline) than during cycling (RPE 0-4, 5-8, 9-MAX) for all pairs of electrodes and EEG frequency bands irrespective of the type of performance (main effect of effort, p < 0.05). Interestingly, we observed a performance x effort interaction in C3-C4 in beta 3 band [F ((4,77)) = 2.62, p = 0.038] during RPE 9-MAX for Type 3 performance as compared to Type 1 and Type 2 performances. These findings may have practical implications in the development of performance optimization strategies in cycling, as we found that focusing attention on a core component of the action could stimulate functional connectivity among specific brain areas and lead to enhanced performance.

A survey on training of feature extraction methods for SSVEP-based BCIs	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						brain-computer interface; steady-state visually evoked potential; electroencephalography; training-less; calibration; review; feature extraction	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; STEADY-STATE; FREQUENCY-RECOGNITION; ENHANCING DETECTION; SPATIAL FILTERS; IMPLEMENTATION	Objective. Despite the vast research aimed at improving the performance of steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), several limitations exist that restrict the use of such applications for long-term users in the real-world. One of the main challenges has been to reduce training time while maintaining good BCI performance. In view of this challenge, this survey identifies and compares the different training requirements of feature extraction methods for SSVEP-based BCIs. Approach. This paper reviews the various state-of-the-art SSVEP feature extraction methods that have been developed and are most widely used in the literature. Main results. The main contributions compared to existing reviews are the following: (i) a detailed summary, including a brief mathematical description of each feature extraction algorithm, providing a guide to the basic concepts of the state-of-theart techniques for SSVEP-based BCIs found in literature; (ii) a categorisation of the training requirements of SSVEP-based methods into three categories, defined as training-free methods, subject-specific and subject-independent training methods; (iii) a comparative review of the training requirements of SSVEP feature extraction methods, providing a reference for future work on SSVEP-based BCIs. Significance. This review highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the three categories of SSVEP training methods. Training-free systems are more practical but their performance is limited due to inter-subject variability resulting from the complex EEG activity. Feature extraction methods that incorporate some training data address this issue and in fact have outperformed training-free methods: subject-specific BCIs are tuned to the individual yielding the best performance at the cost of long, tiring training sessions making these methods unsuitable for everyday use; subject-independent BCIs that make use of training data from various subjects offer a good trade-off between training effort and performance, making these BCIs better suited for practical use.

Specifically, the role of the theta band in these tasks is unclear, with task-related theta enhancements improving performance in some studies, and hindering it in others. In this study, 30 participants performed the Pong videogame as a dynamic visuospatial task to analyze the influence of theta and alpha amplitude as well as alpha asymmetry on performance. The theta band increased significantly at central-parietal regions and correlated negatively with performance, especially at anterior regions. The alpha band showed a significant decrease, greater at right over left parietal regions, but neither the amplitude nor the asymmetry ratio correlated with performance. With theta being an indicator of top-down cognitive control, it may be concluded that proficient performance in dynamic visuospatial tasks depends on a bottom-up guidance of attention with little top-down intervention.

The test included four stages: resting state, the maintenance of the fingers in the maximally extended fingers and those squeezed into a fist, and repetitive flexions/extensions of the fingers. Values of the spectral power of the and EEG rhythms and levels of coherence of oscillations in different leads were measured. As was found, repetitive movements of the fingers are accompanied by significant increases in values of the hyperbolic coherence spectrum between a number of the central and frontal leads of the neocortex. The patterns of the respective changes for the and rhythms significantly differed from each other. It is concluded that the control of repetitive finger movements is not based on a mechanism of the central pattern generators; such finger movements should be more adequately interpreted as a consequence of the discrete voluntary movements.

Furthermore, diverse data sets, e.g., recorded from various subjects or tasks, can even exhibit distinct feature spaces. The fact that data that have to be classified are often only available in small amounts reinforces the need for techniques to generalize learned information, as performances of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are enhanced by increasing quantity of available data. In this paper, we apply transfer learning to a framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) to prove the transferability of learned patterns in error-related brain signals across different tasks. The experiments described in this paper demonstrate the usefulness of transfer learning, especially improving performances when only little data can be used to distinguish between erroneous and correct realization of a task. This effect could be delimited from a transfer of merely general brain signal characteristics, underlining the transfer of error-specific information. Furthermore, we could extract similar patterns in time-frequency analyses in identical channels, leading to selective high signal correlations between the two different paradigms. Classification on the intracranial data yields in median accuracies up to (81.50 +/- 9.49) %. Decoding on only 10% of the data without pre-training reaches performances of (54.76 +/- 3.56) %, compared to (64.95 +/- 0.79) % with pre-training.

Measuring Brain Complexity During Neural Motor Resonance	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor resonance; complexity; network connectivity; EEG; mu suppression	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MU-SUPPRESSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA EVIDENCE; MIRROR NEURONS; EEG; EMPATHY; SYSTEM; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; ENTROPY	Background: EEG mu-desynchronization is an index of motor resonance (MR) and is used to study social interaction deficiencies, but finding differences in mu-desynchronization does not reveal how nonlinear brain dynamics are affected during MR. The current study explores how nonlinear brain dynamics change during MR. We hypothesized that the complexity of the mu frequency band (8-13 Hz) changes during MR, and that this change would be frequency specific. Additionally, we sought to determine whether complexity at baseline and changes in complexity during action observation would predict MR and changes in network dynamics. Methods: EEG was recorded from healthy participants (n = 45) during rest and during an action observation task. Baseline brain activity was measured followed by participants observing videos of hands squeezing stress balls. We used multiscale entropy (MSE) to quantify the complexity of the mu rhythm during MR. We then performed post-hoc graph theory analysis to explore whether nonlinear dynamics during MR affect brain network topology. Results: We found significant mu-desynchronization during the action observation task and that mu entropy was significantly increased during the task compared to rest, while gamma, beta, theta, and delta bands showed decreased entropy. Moreover, resting-state entropy was significantly predictive of the degree of mu desynchronization. We also observed a decrease in the clustering coefficient in the mu band only and a significant decrease in global alpha efficiency during action observation. MSE during action observation was strongly correlated with alpha network efficiency. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that the desynchronization of the mu wave during MR results in a local increase of mu entropy in sensorimotor areas, potentially reflecting a release from alpha inhibition. This release from inhibition may be mediated by the baseline MSE in the mu band. The dynamical complexity and network analysis of EEG may provide a useful addition for future studies of MR by incorporating measures of nonlinearity.

Human EEG reveals distinct neural correlates of power and precision grasping types	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain-machine interfaces; Grasping; Neural correlates; EEG	BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL CONTROL; BRAIN; ALPHA; NETWORKS; RHYTHMS; MEG	Hand grasping is a sophisticated motor task that has received much attention by the neuroscientific community, which demonstrated how grasping activates a network involving parietal, pre-motor and motor cortices using fMRI, ECoG, LFPs and spiking activity. Yet, there is a need for a more precise spatio-temporal analysis as it is still unclear how these brain activations over large cortical areas evolve at the sub-second level. In this study, we recorded ten human participants (1 female) performing visually-guided, self-paced reaching and grasping with precision or power grips. Following the results, we demonstrate the existence of neural correlates of grasping from broadband EEG in self-paced conditions and show how neural correlates of precision and power grasps differentially evolve as grasps unfold. 100 ms before the grasp is secured, bilateral parietal regions showed increasingly differential patterns. Afterwards, sustained differences between both grasps occurred over the bilateral motor and parietal regions, and medial pre-frontal cortex. Furthermore, these differences were sufficiently discriminable to allow single-trial decoding with 70% decoding performance. Functional connectivity revealed differences at the network level between grasps in fronto-parietal networks, in terms of upper-alpha cortical oscillatory power with a strong involvement of ipsilateral hemisphere. Our results supported the existence of fronto-parietal recurrent feedback loops, with stronger interactions for precision grips due to the finer motor control required for this grasping type.

The resting EEG spectrum of alpha (8-13 Hz) rhythm was measured in 22 healthy subjects who have used the Internet for recreational purpose. The vulnerability of Internet addiction was assessed using Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and Assessment for Computer and Internet Addiction-Screener (AICA-S) respectively. Depression and impulsivity were also measured with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11(BIS-11) respectively. The IAT was positively correlated with alpha power obtained during eyes closed (EC, r = 0.50, p = 0.02) but not during eyes open (EO). This was further supported by a negative correlation (r = 0.48, p = 0.02) between IAT scores and alpha desynchronization (EO-EC). These relationships remained significant following correction for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, The BDI score showed positive correlation with alpha asymmetry at mid-lateral (r = 0.54, p = 0.01) and mid frontal (r = 0.46, p = 0.03) regions during EC, and at mid-frontal (r = 0.53, p = 0.01) region during EO. The current findings suggest that there are associations between neural activity and the vulnerability of problematic Internet use. Understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying problematic Internet use would contribute to improved early intervention and treatment.

Maturation of the frontal cortex and its integration into widely distributed brain networks may result in diminishing distractibility with the transition into young adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate maturational changes of brain activity during novelty processing. We hypothesized that during adolescence, timing and task-relevant modulation of frontal cortex network activity elicited by novelty processing improves, concurrently with increasing cognitive control abilities. A visual novelty oddball task was utilized in combination with EEG measurements to investigate brain maturation between 8-28 years of age (n = 84). Developmental changes of the frontal N2-P3a complex and concurrent theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) elicited by rare and unexpected novel stimuli were analyzed using regression models. N2 amplitude decreased, P3a amplitude increased, and latency of both components decreased with age. Pre-stimulus amplitude of theta oscillations decreased, while inter-trial consistency, task-related amplitude modulation and inter-site connectivity of frontal theta oscillations increased with age. Targets, intertwined in a stimulus train with regular non-targets and novels, were detected faster with increasing age. These results indicate that neural processing of novel stimuli became faster and the neural activation pattern more precise in timing and amplitude modulation. Better inter-site connectivity further implicates that frontal brain maturation leads to global neural reorganization and better integration of frontal brain activity within widely distributed brain networks. Faster target detection indicated that these maturational changes in neural activation during novelty processing may result in diminished distractibility and increased cognitive control to pursue the task.

Multivariate analysis of the electroencephalographic signals (EEG) over time is conceptually most promising in unveiling the global dynamics of dynamical brain disorders such as epilepsy. We employed a novel methodology to study the global complexity of the epileptic brain en route to seizures. The developed measures of complexity were based on Multivariate Matching Pursuit (MMP) decomposition of signals in terms of time-frequency Gabor functions (atoms) and Shannon entropy. The measures were first validated on simulation data (Lorenz system) and then applied to EEGs from preictal (before seizure onsets) periods, recorded by intracranial electrodes from eight patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and a total of 42 seizures, in search of global trends of complexity before seizures onset. Out of five Gabor measures of complexity we tested, we found that our newly defined measure, the normalized Gabor entropy (NGE), was able to detect statistically significant (p < 0.05) nonlinear trends of the mean global complexity across all patients over 1 h periods prior to seizures' onset. These trends pointed to a slow decrease of the epileptic brain's global complexity over time accompanied by an increase of the variance of complexity closer to seizure onsets. These results show that the global complexity of the epileptic brain decreases at least 1 h prior to seizures and imply that the employed methodology and measures could be useful in identifying different brain states, monitoring of seizure susceptibility over time, and potentially in seizure prediction.

EEG coherence in a mental arithmetic task performance in first episode schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG coherence; First psychotic episode; Schizophrenia; Schizoaffective disorder; Resting state; Mental arithmetic task	ABERRANT FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; BIPOLAR DISORDER; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; ACTIVATION TASKS; WORKING-MEMORY; NAIVE PATIENTS; CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY	Objectives: To evaluate the coherence values of the cortical bands in patients with first episode schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder during the performance of a mental arithmetic task. Method: We analysed EEG coherence in the resting state and subsequently while counting down from 200 in steps of 7 in 32 first episode schizophrenia patients (SZ), 32 patients with first episode schizoaffective disorder (SA) and 40 healthy controls (HC). Results: Task performance in HC is characterised by decreased coherence in the alpha bands and increased coherence in the beta 2 and gamma bands in frontal sites. In SZ, coherence decreases in the alpha band, whereas in SA it substantially increases in the alpha, betal, beta 2 and gamma bands. Conclusions: Despite no differences in performance on a behavioural level, SA patients demonstrate a paradoxical increase in both low and fast frequency bands during the performance of a mental arithmetic task, while, patients with SZ show a decreased coherence in the alpha band, presumably alluding to the excessive excitatory (in SA) and inhibitory (in SZ) mechanisms in cognitive processing. Significance: The current study provides evidence for the distinction of neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive processing between SZ and SA.

However, across the areas, this alignment varies and the role of this spike-phase coupling (SPC) in cognitive functions is not well understood. Results: Here, we propose a role in the coordination of neural activity by selective attention. After refining previous analytical methods for measuring SPC, we show that first, SPC is present along the dorsal processing pathway in macaque visual cortex (area MT); second, spikes occur in falling phases of the low-frequency LFP independent of the location of spatial attention; third, switching spatial attention into the receptive field (RF) of MT neurons decreases this coupling; and finally, the LFP phase causally influences the spikes. Conclusions: Here, we show that spikes are coupled to the phase of low-frequency LFP along the dorsal visual pathway. Our data suggest that attention harnesses this spike-LFP coupling to de-synchronize neurons and thereby enhance the neural representation of the attended stimuli.

A time series can be modeled as the trajectory of a particle moving in a force field with one degree of freedom. The force acting on the particle shapes the trajectory of its motion, which is made up of elementary shapes of infinitesimal neighborhoods of points in the trajectory. It has been proved that an infinitesimal neighborhood of a point in a continuous time series can have at least 29 different shapes or configurations. So information can be encoded in it in at least 29 different ways. A 3-point neighborhood (the smallest) in a discrete time series can have precisely 13 different shapes or configurations. In other words, a discrete time series can be expressed as a string of 13 symbols. Across diverse real as well as simulated data sets it has been observed that 6 of them occur more frequently and the remaining 7 occur less frequently. Based on frequency distribution of 13 configurations or 13 different ways of information encoding a novel entropy measure, called semantic entropy (E), has been defined. Following notion of power in Newtonian mechanics of the moving particle whose trajectory is the time series, a notion of information power (P) has been introduced for time series. E/P turned out to be an important indicator of synchronous behavior of time series as observed in epileptic EEG signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive decline in language. We investigated if subtle anomalies in EEG activity of MCI patients during a word comprehension task could provide insight into the likelihood of conversion to AD. We studied 25 amnestic MCI patients, a subset of whom developed AD within 3-years, and 11 elderly controls. In the task, auditory category descriptions (e.g., 'a type of wood') were followed by a single visual target word either semantically congruent (i.e., oak) or incongruent with the preceding category. We found that the MCI convertors group (i.e. patients that would go on to convert to AD in 3-years) had a diminished early posterior-parietal theta (3-5 Hz) activity induced by first presentation of the target word (i.e., access to lexico-syntactic properties of the word), compared to MCI non-convertors and controls. Moreover, MCI convertors exhibited oscillatory signatures for processing the semantically congruent words that were different from non-convertors and controls. MCI convertors thus showed basic anomalies for lexical and meaning processing. In addition, both MCI groups showed anomalous oscillatory signatures for the verbal learning/memory of repeated words: later alpha suppression (9-11 Hz), which followed first presentation of the target word, was attenuated for the second and third repetition in controls, but not in either MCI group. Our findings suggest that a subtle breakdown in the brain network subserving language comprehension can be foretelling of conversion to AD.

The superior frontal cortex (SFC) is known to control alpha activity. Based on this relationship between SFC and alpha, we hypothesized that SFC controlled alpha mediates proactive control over interference. In this study, we examined the relationship between SFC and alpha in the flanker task by simultaneously recording EEG and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Forty participants performed a flanker task with occasional (compatible 75%, incompatible 25%) and successive (incompatible 100%) conditions. In the occasional condition, larger SFC activity was related to pre-stimulus alpha enhancement under occipital electrodes. This is consistent with a model in which SFC enhances pre-stimulus alpha activity, leading to proactive control over interference. However, we could not detect a correlation between SFC activity and alpha activity in the successive condition. Active inhibition may have been reduced by a need to continuously inhibit brain regions associated with the irrelevant information. This may have reduced the role of the SFC in controlling alpha activity. Based on these findings, we postulate that there are two cerebral mechanisms of proactive control over interference.

In the visual system, the extrastriate body area (EBA), an occipito-temporal region, responds to full body and body part images under the organizational principle of their functional/semantic meaning. Although frequency-specific modulations of neural activity associated with perceptive and cognitive functions are increasingly attracting the interest of neurophysiologists and cognitive neuroscientists, perceiving single body parts with different functional meaning and full body images induces time-frequency modulations over occipito-temporal electrodes are yet to be described. Here, we studied this issue by measuring EEG in participants who passively observed fingers, hands, arms and faceless full body images with four control plant stimuli, each bearing hierarchical analogy with the body stimuli. We confirmed that occipito-temporal electrodes (compatible with the location of EBA) show a larger event-related potential (ERP, N190) for body-related images. Furthermore, we identified a body part-specific (i.e. selective for hands and arms) theta event-related synchronization increase under the same electrodes. This frequency modulation associated with the perception of body effectors over occipitotemporal cortices is in line with recent findings of categorical organization of neural responses to human effectors in the visual system.

J	Poikonen, H; Toiviainen, P; Tervaniemi, M				Poikonen, Hanna; Toiviainen, Petri; Tervaniemi, Mari			Dance on cortex: enhanced theta synchrony in experts when watching a dance piece	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dance; EEG; expertise; music; phase synchrony	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT THERAPY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; MIRROR NEURONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; MEMORY	When watching performing arts, a wide and complex network of brain processes emerge. These processes can be shaped by professional expertise. When compared to laymen, dancers have enhanced processes in observation of short dance movement and listening to music. But how do the cortical processes differ in musicians and dancers when watching an audio-visual dance performance? In our study, we presented the participants long excerpts from the contemporary dance choreography of Carmen. During multimodal movement of a dancer, theta phase synchrony over the fronto-central electrodes was stronger in dancers when compared to musicians and laymen. In addition, alpha synchrony was decreased in all groups during large rapid movement when compared to nearly motionless parts of the choreography. Our results suggest an enhanced cortical communication in dancers when watching dance and, further, that this enhancement is rather related to multimodal, cognitive and emotional processes than to simple observation of dance movement.
