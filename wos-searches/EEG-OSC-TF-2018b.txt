Since schizophrenia is associated with a reduced cortical gamma response to auditory stimulation at 40 Hz, we hypothesized that the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) may be attenuated in nonpsychotic individuals with a 22q11.2 deletion. Methods: Eighteen young nonpsychotic 22q11.2 deletion carriers and a control group of 27 noncarriers with comparable age range (12-25 years) and sex ratio underwent 128-channel EEG. We recorded the cortical ASSR to a 40 Hz train of clicks, given either at a regular inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms or at irregular intervals jittered between 11 and 37 ms. Results: Healthy noncarriers expressed a stable ASSR to regular but not in the irregular 40 Hz click stimulation. Both gamma power and inter-trial phase coherence of the ASSR were markedly reduced in the 22q11.2 deletion group. The ability to phase lock cortical gamma activity to regular auditory 40 Hz stimulation correlated with the individual expression of negative symptoms in deletion carriers (rho = -0.487, P = .041). Conclusions: Nonpsychotic 22q11.2 deletion carriers lack efficient phase locking of evoked gamma activity to regular 40 Hz auditory stimulation. This abnormality indicates a dysfunction of fast intracortical oscillatory processing in the gamma-band. Since ASSR was attenuated in nonpsychotic deletion carriers, ASSR deficiency may constitute a premorbid risk marker of schizophrenia.

Using EEG, we investigated how previous interactions with, and evaluations of, an avatar in virtual reality subsequently influenced attentional allocation to the face of that avatar. We focused on changes in the alpha activity as an index of attentional allocation. We found that the onset of an avatar's face whom the participant had developed a rapport with induced greater alpha suppression. This suggests greater attentional resources are allocated to the interacted-with avatars. The evaluative ratings of the avatar induced a U-shaped change in alpha suppression, such that participants paid most attention when the avatar was rated as average. These results suggest that attentional allocation is an important element of how behaviour is altered in the presence of a secondary individual and is modulated by our opinion of that individual.

According to the idea of a psychosis continuum, high schizotypal traits in the general population may be associated to higher proneness to multisensory illusions, akin to schizophrenia. We directly tested this hypothesis by means of the double-flash illusion in participants with low and high schizotypal scores. We confirmed the higher proneness to illusions in the high-schizotypal group. Crucially, such higher proneness was fully explained by a significantly reduced temporal sensitivity to integrate sensory information. We conclude that reduced temporal sensitivity accounts for enhanced proneness to illusions in people at higher risk and represents an early marker of psychosis.

To that end, paradigms have used high-intensity strictly-periodic visual stimulation that created strong predictions about future stimulus occurrences and repeatedly demonstrated perceptual consequences in line with an entrainment of parieto-occipital alpha. Our study, in turn, examined the case of alpha entrainment by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation within theta- (4-7Hz), alpha- (8-13Hz), and beta (14-20Hz) frequency bands, i.e., a class of stimuli that resemble the temporal characteristics of naturally occurring visual input more closely. We have previously reported substantial neural phase-locking in EEG recording during all three stimulation conditions. Here, we studied to what extent this phase-locking reflected an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms in the same dataset. Specifically, we tested whether quasi-periodic visual stimulation affected several properties of parieto-occipital alpha generators. Speaking against an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation, we found none of these properties to show differences between stimulation frequency bands. In particular, alpha band generators did not show increased sensitivity to alpha band stimulation and Bayesian inference corroborated evidence against an influence of stimulation frequency. Our results set boundary conditions for when and how to expect effects of entrainment of alpha generators and suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm may be more inert to external influences than previously thought.

Brain functional connectivity can be characterized by the temporal evolution of correlation between signals recorded from spatially-distributed regions. Numerous techniques were introduced for assessing this connectivity. Among nonlinear regression analysis methods, we chose a method introduced in the field of EEG analysis by Pijn, Lopes da Silva and colleagues, based on the fitting of a nonlinear curve by piecewise linear approximation, and more recently evaluated in a model of coupled neuronal populations. This method has some major advantages over other signal analysis methods such as coherence and cross-correlation functions because it can be applied independently of whether the type of relationship between the two signals is linear or nonlinear. In the capacity of bistable image we used a set of images based on a well-known bistable object, the Necker cube, as a visual stimulus. This is a cube with transparent faces and visible ribs. Bistability in perception consists in the interpretation of this 3D-object as to be oriented in two different ways, in particular, if the different ribs of the Necker cube are drawn with different intensity. It was shown that the structure of connections in the brain is different for cases without visual stimulation and with stimulation with the help of the Necker cube.

Ketamine independently modulated power and phase-coupling of theta oscillations in Sp4 hypomorphic mice	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NMDA-RECEPTOR ENCEPHALITIS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR SP4; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; PREFRONTAL SYNCHRONY; BIPOLAR DISORDER; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MEMORY; EEG; MODEL; EXPRESSION	Reduced expression of Sp4, the murine homolog of human SP4, a risk gene of multiple psychiatric disorders, led to N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) hypofunction in mice, producing behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of schizophrenia, including hypersensitivity to ketamine. As accumulating evidence on molecular mechanisms and behavioral phenotypes established Sp4 hypomorphism as a promising animal model, systems-level neural circuit mechanisms of Sp4 hypomorphism, especially network dynamics underlying cognitive functions, remain poorly understood. We attempted to close this gap in knowledge in the present study by recording multi-channel epidural electroencephalogram ( EEG) from awake behaving wildtype and Sp4 hypomorphic mice. We characterized cortical theta-band power and phase-coupling phenotypes, a known neural circuit substrate underlying cognitive functions, and further studied the effects of a subanesthetic dosage of ketamine on theta abnormalities unique to Sp4 hypomorphism. Sp4 hypomorphic mice had markedly elevated theta power localized frontally and parietally, a more pronounced theta phase progression along the neuraxis, and a stronger frontal-parietal theta coupling. Acute subanesthetic ketamine did not affect theta power in wildtype animals but significantly reduced it in Sp4 hypomorphic mice, nearly completely neutralizing their excessive frontal/parietal theta power. Ketamine did not significantly alter cortical theta phase progression in either wildtype or Sp4 hypomorphic animals, but significantly strengthened cortical theta phase-coupling in wildtype, but not in Sp4 hypomorphic animals. Our results suggested that the resting-state phenotypes of cortical theta oscillations unique to Sp4 hypomorphic mice closely mimicked a schizophrenic endophenotype. Further, ketamine independently modulated Sp4 hypomorphic anomalies in theta power and phase-coupling, suggesting separate underlying neural circuit mechanisms.

However, predictions and prediction errors are simultaneous and interdependent processes, making it difficult to disentangle their constituent neural network organization. Here, we test the theory by using high-density electrocortico-graphy (ECoG) in monkeys during an auditory "localglobal'' paradigm in which the temporal regularities of the stimuli were controlled at two hierarchical levels. We decomposed the broadband data and identified lower-and higher-level prediction-error signals in early auditory cortex and anterior temporal cortex, respectively, and a prediction-update signal sent from prefrontal cortex back to temporal cortex. The prediction-error and prediction-update signals were transmitted via gamma (>40 Hz) and alpha/beta (<30 Hz) oscillations, respectively. Our findings provide strong support for hierarchical predictive coding and outline how it is dynamically implemented using distinct cortical areas and frequencies.

We examined these dynamics in relation to readout and control mechanisms of WM. Monkeys held sequences of two objects in WM to match to subsequent sequences. Changes in beta and gamma bursting suggested their distinct roles. In anticipation of having to use an object for the match decision, there was an increase in gamma and spiking information about that object and reduced beta bursting. This readout signal was only seen before relevant test objects, and was related to premotor activity. When the objects were no longer needed, beta increased and gamma decreased together with object spiking information. Deviations from these dynamics predicted behavioral errors. Thus, beta could regulate gamma and the information in WM.

It is unclear whether these loops differ anatomically or functionally in different types of tremor. We compared age-and sex-matched groups of patients with Parkinson's disease or essential tremor and healthy controls (n = 34 per group). High-density 256-channel EEG and multi-channel EMG from extensor and flexor muscles of both wrists were recorded simultaneously while extending the hands against gravity with the forearms supported. Tremor was thereby recorded from patients, and voluntarily mimicked tremor was recorded from healthy controls. Tomographic maps of EEG-EMG coherence were constructed using a beamformer algorithm coherent source analysis. The direction and strength of information flow between different coherent sources were estimated using timeresolved partial-directed coherence analyses. Tremor severity and motor performance measures were correlated with connection strengths between coherent sources. The topography of oscillatory coherent sources in the cerebellum differed significantly among the three groups, but the cortical sources in the primary sensorimotor region and premotor cortex were not significantly different. The cerebellar and cortical source combinations matched well with known cerebello-thalamo-cortical connections derived from functional MRI resting state analyses according to the Buckner-atlas. The cerebellar sources for Parkinson's tremor and essential tremor mapped primarily to primary sensorimotor cortex, but the cerebellar source for mimicked tremor mapped primarily to premotor cortex. Time-resolved partial-directed coherence analyses revealed activity flow mainly from cerebellum to sensorimotor cortex in Parkinson's tremor and essential tremor and mainly from cerebral cortex to cerebellum in mimicked tremor. EMG oscillation flowed mainly to the cerebellum in mimicked tremor, but oscillation flowed mainly from the cerebellum to EMG in Parkinson's and essential tremor. The topography of cerebellar involvement differed among Parkinson's, essential and mimicked tremors, suggesting different cerebellar mechanisms in tremorogenesis. Indistinguishable areas of sensorimotor cortex and premotor cerebral cortex were involved in all three tremors. Information flow analyses suggest that sensory feedback and cortical efferent copy input to cerebellum are needed to produce mimicked tremor, but tremor in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor do not depend on these mechanisms. Despite the subtle differences in cerebellar source topography, we found no evidence that the cerebellum is the source of oscillation in essential tremor or that the cortico-bulbo-cerebello-thalamocortical loop plays different tremorogenic roles in Parkinson's and essential tremor. Additional studies are needed to decipher the seemingly subtle differences in cerebellocortical function in Parkinson's and essential tremors.

These retroactive processes are particularly inherent to the processing of auditory information that is especially transient over time and thus, requires us to continuously maintain, attend to, and integrate information in working memory. Using EEG recordings, the present study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying selective spatial attention in a retroactive as opposed to a perceptual auditory search task. Two kinds of sound stimuli were employed: a horizontal sound array consisting of two natural sounds presented simultaneously in the left and right hemispace and a central single target sound. The target sound was provided either after (retroactive search) or before the presentation of the sound array (perceptual search). In both search conditions, participants completed a sound localization and a sound detection task, indicating the position (left or right) or the presence versus absence (yes or no) of a particular target sound. Analyses revealed a lateralization of alpha power oscillations (8-12 Hz) over parieto-occipital scalp in both perceptual and retroactive sound localization tasks, but not in respective sound detection tasks, suggesting auditory alpha lateralization to be restricted to spatially specific task demands. The observed asymmetric modulations of alpha power in sound localization are consistent with analogous findings from the visual domain, supporting the supramodal role of alpha oscillations in the deployment of spatial attention. Hence, we conclude that auditory alpha lateralization is a higher-order attention mechanism that operates in perceptual and mnemonic space reflecting the access to a spatially-specific, supramodal response template.

Sleep spindles (SS) are non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep oscillations implicated in sleep-dependent learning. Their generation imply a complex activation of the thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop. Since SS require neuronal synchrony, the integrity of the white matter (WM) underlying these connections is of major importance. During aging, both SS and WM undergo important changes. The goal of this study was to investigate whether WM integrity could predict the age-related reductions in SS characteristics. Methods: Thirty young and 31 older participants underwent a night of polysomnographic recording and a 3T magnetic resonance imaging acquisition including a diffusion sequence. SS were detected in NREM sleep and EEG spectral analysis was performed for the sigma frequency band. WM diffusion metrics were computed in a voxelwise design of analysis. Results: Compared to young participants, older individuals showed lower SS density, amplitude, and sigma power. Diffusion metrics were correlated with SS amplitude and sigma power in tracts connecting the thalamus to the frontal cortex for the young but not for the older group, suggesting a moderation effect. Moderation analyses showed that diffusion metrics explained between 14% and 39% of SS amplitude and sigma power variance in the young participants only. Conclusion: Our results indicate that WM underlying the thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop predicts SS characteristics in young individuals, but does not explain age-related changes in SS. Other neurophysiological factors could better explain the effect of age on SS characteristics.

Spatial variation in high-frequency oscillation rates and amplitudes in intracranial EEG	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; TEMPORAL-LOBE; SURGERY; OUTCOMES; CORTEX; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; VARIABILITY; RECORDINGS; MECHANISMS	ObjectiveTo assess the variation in baseline and seizure onset zone interictal high-frequency oscillation (HFO) rates and amplitudes across different anatomic brain regions in a large cohort of patients.MethodsSeventy patients who had wide-bandwidth (5 kHz) intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings during surgical evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy between 2005 and 2014 who had high-resolution MRI and CT imaging were identified. Discrete HFOs were identified in 2-hour segments of high-quality interictal iEEG data with an automated detector. Electrode locations were determined by coregistering the patient's preoperative MRI with an X-ray CT scan acquired immediately after electrode implantation and correcting electrode locations for postimplant brain shift. The anatomic locations of electrodes were determined using the Desikan-Killiany brain atlas via FreeSurfer. HFO rates and mean amplitudes were measured in seizure onset zone (SOZ) and non-SOZ electrodes, as determined by the clinical iEEG seizure recordings. To promote reproducible research, imaging and iEEG data are made freely available (msel.mayo.edu).ResultsBaseline (non-SOZ) HFO rates and amplitudes vary significantly in different brain structures, and between homologous structures in left and right hemispheres. While HFO rates and amplitudes were significantly higher in SOZ than non-SOZ electrodes when analyzed regardless of contact location, SOZ and non-SOZ HFO rates and amplitudes were not separable in some lobes and structures (e.g., frontal and temporal neocortex).ConclusionsThe anatomic variation in SOZ and non-SOZ HFO rates and amplitudes suggests the need to assess interictal HFO activity relative to anatomically accurate normative standards when using HFOs for presurgical planning.

However, results on attentional modulation of ASSRs are inconclusive. The evaluation of large-scale effects of task-related modulation on ASSRs might give better estimation of the induced changes. The aim of the study was to test global field synchronization a reference-independent evaluation of the amount of phase-locking among all active regions at a given frequency during tasks differing in attentional demands to 40 Hz auditory stimulation. Twenty seven healthy young males participated in the EEG study with concurrent 40 Hz binaural click stimulation and three experimental tasks: 1) to count presented stimuli (focused attention); 2) to silently read a text (distraction); 3) to stay awake with closed eyes (resting). We showed that during auditory 40 Hz stimulation, the global field synchronization of the EEG increased as compared to the silent baseline period and the largest increase was observed when subjects counted stimuli or rested with closed eyes. Our results provide insights that depending on the method of assessment, the 40 Hz ASSR might be an indicator of both local and complex synchronization processes that are affected by the state (task performed or psychopathology) of the participants.

Scoring by visual inspection is time-consuming and heavily depends on the experience of experts. Thus, there is an urgent need for an automatic sleep stage classification system. This paper proposes a novel compact convolutional neural network (C-CNN) using only single-channel EEG signal. Compared with traditional machine learning approaches based on hand-engineered features, our approach provides an end-to-end solution that requires almost no prior knowledge and preprocessing while achieving better performance. Experiments on the expanded Sleep-EDF database verified its effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, we notice the issue of class imbalance in sleep stages, and a class-imbalance metric, the balanced classification accuracy (BCA), is introduced. At the cost of a little drop in accuracy, which is still higher than existing classification methods, the introduction of class-imbalance weights can significantly increase the BCA metric and result in a higher recall for each sleep stage.

In contrast, invasive methods-microelectrode recordings and electrocorticography (ECoG)-have recently measured broadband power elevation in field potentials (similar to 50-200 Hz) as a proxy for locally averaged spike rates. Here, we sought to detect and quantify stimulus-related broadband responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Extracranial measurements like MEG and EEG have multiple global noise sources and relatively low signal-to-noise ratios; moreover high frequency artifacts from eye movements can be confounded with stimulus design and mistaken for signals originating from brain activity. For these reasons, we developed an automated denoising technique that helps reveal the broadband signal of interest. Subjects viewed 12-Hz contrast-reversing patterns in the left, right, or bilateral visual field. Sensor time series were separated into evoked (12-Hz amplitude) and broadband components (60-150 Hz). In all subjects, denoised broadband responses were reliably measured in sensors over occipital cortex, even in trials without microsaccades. The broadband pattern was stimulus-dependent, with greater power contralateral to the stimulus. Because we obtain reliable broadband estimates with short experiments (similar to 20 minutes), and with sufficient signal-to-noise to distinguish responses to different stimuli, we conclude that MEG broadband signals, denoised with our method, offer a practical, non-invasive means for characterizing spike-rate-dependent neural activity for addressing scientific questions about human brain function.

The 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which reflects neural synchrony in the gamma band (30-100 Hz), is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). The present study used the ASSR at multiple frequencies to examine (1) gamma dysfunction in patients with SZ, schizoaffective (SA), and bipolar disorder (BD) compared with controls, (2) the relationship between ASSR measures and clinical symptom severity, and (3) the relationship between ASSR measures and real-life community functioning. Methods: EEG was recorded from 75 controls, 52 SZ, 55 SA, and 89 BD patients during 20-30-40-Hz binaural click trains. ANCOVA was used to compare ASSR measures between groups controlling for age, sex, and education. Associations between ASSR measures, symptom severity, and community functioning were examined using linear regression and Pearson partial correlations. Results: ASSR deficits at gamma frequency were observed in all patient groups. SA patients showed additional specific deficit in the 20 Hz ASSR. Severity of manic, depressive, and anxiety symptoms mediated ASSR deficits. Severity of hallucinatory symptom and community functioning, particularly independent living/meaningful activity, were significantly and independently associated with the 40 Hz ASSR. Conclusions: SZ, SA and BD patients are likely to share the same abnormalities in neural processes that generate gamma oscillations. 40 Hz ASSR are associated with community functioning across patients and may serve as a biomarker for predicting functional outcome.

Its occurrence and maintenance have a clear neuroscientific tie and one aspect are differences in the neuronal oscillatory pattern, especially in auditory cortical areas. As studies in this field come to different results, the aim of this study was to analyze a large number of participants to achieve more stable results. Furthermore, we expanded our analysis to two variables of potential influence, namely being a novice to neuroscientific measurements and the exclusion of psychological comorbidities. Oscillatory brain activity of 88 subjects (46 with a chronic tinnitus percept, 42 without) measured in resting state by MEG was investigated. In the analysis based on the whole group, in sensor space increased activity in the delta frequency band was found in tinnitus patients. Analyzing the subgroup of novices, a significant difference in the theta band emerged additionally to the delta band difference (sensor space). Localizing the origin of the activity, we found a difference in theta and gamma band for the auditory regions for the whole group and the same significant difference in the subgroup of novices. However, no differences in oscillatory activity were observed between tinnitus and control groups once subjects with mental health comorbidity were excluded. Against the background of previous studies, the study at hand underlines the fragility of the results in the field of neuronal cortical oscillations in tinnitus. It supports the body of research arguing for low frequency oscillations and gamma band activity as markers associated with tinnitus.

For instance, we can store memories of a recent concert with visual and auditory impressions being integrated in one episode. Theta oscillations have recently been implicated in playing a causal role synchronizing and effectively binding the different modalities together in memory. However, an open question is whether momentary fluctuations in theta synchronization predict the likelihood of associative memory formation for multisensory events. To address this question we entrained the visual and auditory cortex at theta frequency (4 Hz) and in a synchronous or asynchronous manner by modulating the luminance and volume of movies and sounds at 4 Hz, with a phase offset at 0 degrees or 180 degrees. EEG activity from human subjects (both sexes) was recorded while they memorized the association between a movie and a sound. Associative memory performance was significantly enhanced in the 0 degrees compared with the 180 degrees condition. Source-level analysis demonstrated that the physical stimuli effectively entrained their respective cortical areas with a corresponding phase offset. The findings suggested a successful replication of a previous study (Clouter et al., 2017). Importantly, the strength of entrainment during encoding correlated with the efficacy of associative memory such that small phase differences between visual and auditory cortex predicted a high likelihood of correct retrieval in a later recall test. These findings suggest that theta oscillations serve a specific function in the episodic memory system: binding the contents of different modalities into coherent memory episodes.

Spatial attention modulates visual gamma oscillations across the human ventral stream	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual gamma oscillations; Visuospatial attention; Ventral visual stream; Gamma peak frequency; Magnetoencephalography	MACAQUE AREA V4; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; PEAK FREQUENCY; CORTEX; MEG; BRAIN; COHERENCE; ALPHA; EEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Oscillatory synchronization in the gamma frequency range has been proposed as a neuronal mechanism to prioritize processing of relevant stimuli over competing ones. Recent studies in animals found that selective spatial attention enhanced gamma-band synchronization in high-order visual areas (V4) and increased the gamma peak frequency in V1. The existence of such mechanisms in the human visual system is yet to be fully demonstrated. In this study, we used MEG, in combination with an optimised stimulus design, to record visual gamma oscillations from human early visual cortex, while participants performed a visuospatial attention cueing task. First, we reconstructed virtual sensors in V1/V2, where gamma oscillations were strongly induced by visual stimulation alone. Second, following the results of a statistical comparison between conditions of attention, we reconstructed cortical activity also in inferior occipital-temporal regions (V4). The results indicated that gamma amplitude was modulated by spatial attention across the cortical hierarchy, both in the early visual cortex and in higher-order regions of the ventral visual pathway. In contrast, we found no evidence for an increase in the gamma peak frequency in V1/V2 with attention. The gamma response tended to peak earlier in V1/V2 than in V4 by approximately 70 ms, consistent with a feed-forward role of gamma-band activity in propagating sensory representations across the visual cortical hierarchy. Together, these findings suggest that differences in experimental design or methodology can account for the inconsistencies in previous animal and human studies. Furthermore, our results are in line with the hypothesis of enhanced gamma-band synchronization as an attentional mechanism in the human visual cortex.

The impact of sleep characteristics and epilepsy variables on memory performance in patients with focal seizures	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Discharges; Hippocampal lesion; Slow-wave sleep; EEG; Retention	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; OSCILLATIONS; RETENTION; SPINDLES; RIPPLES; STIMULATION; HOMEOSTASIS; DISTURBANCE	Disturbed sleep can negatively affect overnight memory retention as well as new learning the subsequent day. In healthy participants, positive associations between memory performance and sleep characteristics (e.g., time spent in slow-wave sleep [SWS]) have been detected. In a previous study, we found that SWS was much reduced in patients with focal seizures, but when correlations between memory complaints and various sleep characteristics were considered, the only significant relationship was with the time to onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (i.e., REM latency). In this study, we investigated the relationships between sleep, epilepsy, and objective memory performance variables. Twenty-five patients with focal seizures had their memory tested while undergoing a two-day ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG). The sleep variables of interest were the percentage of time spent in SWS (%SWS) and REM latency. Epilepsy variables included the presence of (1) seizures, (2) interictal epileptiform discharges, and/or (3) hippocampal lesions as well as site of seizure origin (temporal vs extratemporal). Overnight retention (of autobiographical events, a story, and a complex geometric figure) and the ability to learn a word list on day 2 were the measures of memory. A significant positive correlation was found between word-list learning and %SWS during the previous night. A significant negative correlation was observed between REM latency and overnight retention of autobiographical events. Overnight retention scores for the story and geometric figure were not related to sleep characteristics but were negatively affected by the presence of epileptiform activity. Story retention was also worse for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) than for patients with extratemporal epilepsy (ETE). Those with hippocampal lesions were more impaired than those without lesions on word-list learning, autobiographical events retention, and story retention. When multiple contributing factors were entered into regression analyses, %SWS was found to be the best predictor of subsequent word-list learning, whereas the presence of a hippocampal lesion was the best predictor of overnight retention of autobiographical events and a story. These findings provide further evidence of the ways in which particular sleep characteristics are associated with memory and suggest that treatment of sleep disturbances in patients with epilepsy might be helpful for improving their performance.

J	Wang, LH; Gan, JQ; Zhang, L; Wang, HX				Wang, Lihan; Gan, John Q.; Zhang, Li; Wang, Haixian			Differential recruitment of brain networks in single-digit addition and multiplication: Evidence from EEG oscillations in theta and lower alpha bands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Numerical cognition; Dissociation between simple mental arithmetic; operations; EEG analysis; Brain functional networks	WORKING-MEMORY TASK; CENTRAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; MENTAL NUMBER LINE; NUMERICAL COGNITION; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; DISSOCIATION	Previous neuroimaging research investigating dissociation between single-digit addition and multiplication has suggested that the former placed more reliance on the visuo-spatial processing whereas the latter on the verbal processing. However, there has been little exploration into the disassociation in spatio-temporal dynamics of the oscillatory brain activity in specific frequency bands during the two arithmetic operations. To address this issue, the electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded from 19 participants engaged in a delayed verification arithmetic task. By analyzing oscillatory EEG activity in theta (5-7 Hz) and lower alpha frequency (9-10 Hz) bands, we found different patterns of oscillatory brain activity between single-digit addition and multiplication during the early processing stage (0-400 ms post-operand onset). Experiment results in this study showed a larger phasic increase of theta-band power for addition than for multiplication in the midline and the right frontal and central regions during the operator and operands presentation intervals, which was extended to the right parietal and the right occipito-temporal regions during the interval immediately after the operands presentation. In contrast, during multiplication higher phase-locking in lower alpha band was evident in the centro-parietal regions during the operator presentation, which was extended to the left fronto-central and anterior regions during the operands presentation. Besides, we found stronger theta phase synchrony between the parietal areas and the right occipital areas for single-digit addition than for multiplication during operands encoding.

J	Bartur, G; Pratt, H; Frenkel-Toledo, S; Soroker, N				Bartur, Gadi; Pratt, Hillel; Frenkel-Toledo, Silvi; Soroker, Nachum			Neurophysiological effects of mirror visual feedback in stroke patients with unilateral hemispheric damage	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Event related de-synchronization; Mirror visual feedback; Stroke rehabilitation; Inter-hemispheric dynamics	INTERHEMISPHERIC INTERACTIONS; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; MOTOR FUNCTION; THERAPY; CONNECTIVITY; MOVEMENTS; CORTEX; RECRUITMENT; REFLECTION; EXPERIENCE	Background and Objective: Mirror visual feedback (MVF; the illusory perception of movement in one hand upon viewing the moving opposite hand in a midsagittal mirror) is thought to facilitate restoration of mal-adaptive neurophysiological processes underlying conditions like complex regional pain syndrome and phantom limb pain, and to have a positive effect on brain plasticity processes underlying motor recovery after stroke. However, its exact mode of action remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to explore the immediate neurophysiological effects of MVF in patients with stroke-related hemiparesis. We also investigated how these effects relate to lesion location and extent. Method: EEG and EMG data were obtained from 14 first-event sub-acute stroke patients (8 with right-, 6 with left-hemiparesis) during repeated wrist extension movements of the Non-paretic Upper-Limb (NUL), without (NUL/M-) and with (NUL/M+) a midsagittal mirror, as well as during bilateral movements with a mirror (Bil/M +). EEG data was correlated with normalized lesion data obtained from follow-up CT scans. Results: NUL movement was accompanied by an asymmetric event-related de-synchronization (ERD) of low-beta EEG oscillations, with a more conspicuous ERD in the non-affected hemisphere. In the mirror condition, ERD magnitude was attenuated in both hemispheres. Stronger attenuation in the non-affected hemisphere abolished the hemispheric asymmetry. ERD attenuation by the mirror was affected by lesion side, the severity of hemiparesis and by lesion location and extent. Conclusion: Following hemispheric stroke, the magnitude of low-beta ERD accompanying unilateral movement of the non-involved upper limb, and its hemispheric asymmetry, are both reduced by MVF. Low-beta ERD dynamics may serve as a marker of neurophysiological response to MVF in research aimed to elucidate the factors influencing patients' clinical gain from this treatment.

Sleep State Dependence of Optogenetically evoked Responses in Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase-positive Cells of the Cerebral Cortex	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						evoked potential; electroencephalogram; mice; optogenetic; slow-wave activity	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; SUBSTANCE-P; CORTICAL INTERNEURONS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; MOUSE; EEG; STIMULATION; DEPRIVATION; ACTIVATION; SEROTONIN	Slow-wave activity (SWA) in the electroencephalogram during slow-wave sleep (SWS) varies as a function of sleep-wake history. A putative sleep-active population of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-containing interneurons in the cerebral cortex, defined as such by the expression of Fos in animals euthanized after protracted deep sleep, may be a local regulator of SWA. We investigated whether electrophysiological responses to activation of these cells are consistent with their role of a local regulator of SWA. Using a Cre/loxP strategy, we targeted the population of nNOS interneurons to express the light-activated cation channel Channel-rhodopsin2 and the histological marker tdTomato in mice. We then performed histochemical and optogenetic studies in these transgenic mice. Our studies provided histochemical evidence of transgene expression and electrophysiological evidence that the cerebral cortex was responsive to optogenetic manipulation of these cells in both anesthetized and behaving mice. Optogenetic stimulation of the cerebral cortex of animals expressing Channel-rhodopsin2 in nNOS interneurons triggered an acute positive deflection of the local field potential that was followed by protracted oscillatory events only during quiet wake and slow wave sleep. The response during wake was maximal when the electroencephalogram (EEG) was in a negative polarization state and abolished when the EEG was in a positive polarization state. Since the polarization state of the EEG is a manifestation of slow-wave oscillations in the activity of underlying pyramidal neurons between the depolarized (LFP negative) and hyperpolarized (LFP positive) states, these data indicate that sleep-active cortical neurons expressing nNOS function in sleep slow-wave physiology.

Here, we investigate the earliest brain specialization induced by it. Following previous research, we hypothesize that bilingual native language discrimination is a complex process involving specific processing of the prosodic properties of the speech signal. We recorded the brain activity of monolingual and bilingual 4.5-month-old infants using EEG, while listening to their native/dominant language and two foreign languages. We defined two different windows of analysis to separate discrimination and identification effects. In the early window of analysis (150-280 ms) we measured the P200 component, and in the later window of analysis we measured Theta (400-1800 ms) and Gamma (300-2800 ms) oscillations. The results point in the direction of different language discrimination strategies for bilingual and monolingual infants. While only monolingual infants show early discrimination of their native language based on familiarity, bilinguals perform a later processing which is compatible with an increase in attention to the speech signal. This is the earliest evidence found for brain specialization induced by bilingualism.

This limits their utility as epilepsy biomarkers for surgery. We assessed the spatiotemporal propagation of interictal ripples on intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in children with MRE, compared it with the propagation of spikes, identified ripples that initiated propagation (onset-ripples), and evaluated their clinical value as epilepsy biomarkers. MethodsTwenty-seven children who underwent epilepsy surgery were studied. We identified propagation sequences of ripples and spikes across multiple iEEG contacts and calculated each ripple or spike latency from the propagation onset. We classified ripples and spikes into categories (ie, onset, spread, and isolated) based on their spatiotemporal characteristics and correlated their mean rate inside and outside resection with outcome (good outcome, Engel 1 versus poor outcome, Engel2). We determined, as onset-zone, spread-zone, and isolated-zone, the areas generating the corresponding ripple or spike category and evaluated the predictive value of their resection. ResultsWe observed ripple propagation in all patients and spike propagation in 25 patients. Mean rate of onset-ripples inside resection predicted the outcome (odds ratio = 5.37; p = 0.02) and correlated with Engel class (rho = -0.55; p = 0.003). Resection of the onset-ripple-zone was associated with good outcome (p = 0.047). No association was found for the spread-ripple-zone, isolated-ripple-zone, or any spike-zone. InterpretationInterictal ripples propagate across iEEG contacts in children with MRE. The association between the onset-ripple-zone resection and good outcome indicates that onset-ripples are promising epilepsy biomarkers, which estimate the epileptogenic tissue better than spread-ripples or onset-spikes.

The application of a sophisticated computerized version of the TTCT facilitating the online assessment and digitalizing of participant's drawings allowed to separate two central stages of the creative ideation process (i.e., idea generation and idea elaboration). During idea generation, the participants' task was to generate an initial draft of an original and creative completion of the presented abstract lines and figures of the TTCT. During idea elaboration, the participants were required to mentally improve the originality of the initially generated idea/draft. Creative ideation in this figural task was generally associated with comparatively strong desynchronization of upper alpha power over parietal and occipital sites, indicating high visual/figural processing demands. Interestingly, the stage of idea elaboration was accompanied by a relative increase of upper alpha power at parietal and occipital sites compared to the stage of idea generation, indicating heightened top-down processing demands. Furthermore, task performance was associated with relative increases of upper alpha power at frontal sites and relative decreases at centro-temporal sites from the stage of idea generation to idea elaboration. This association suggests the importance of increased inhibitory control over stimulus-based bottom-up information and motor imagery in order to achieve more creative outputs. Taken together these findings add to the relevant literature in that they a) extend research on the relationship between EEG alpha activity and creativity to the figural domain, and b) support a multistage view of creative ideation, involving cognitive control and mental imagery as important components of creativity.

Due to non-stationary nature of EEG series in addition to the assumption that the high-frequency band is possibly associated with emotional activation, WC has been applied to five distinct frequency band activities (fba) (Delta: , Theta: , Alpha: , Beta: , Gamma: ) embedded in non-averaged single-trial EEG series mediated by convenient affective pictures from International Affective Picture System. Experimental data were collected from both healthy controls and patients, diagnosed with first-episode psychosis, through a 16-channel EEG cap. WC estimations, which are computed for eight electrode pairs (pre-frontal, anterio-frontal, central, parietal, occipital, posterio-frontal, anterio-temporal, posterio-temporal), in accordance with each specified fba and emotional state (pleasant, un-pleasant, neutral) have been classified by using Least Squares Support Vector Machines with tenfold cross-validation to distinguish controls from patients. Results show that the highest classification accuracies of 88.06, 86.39, 83.89% are obtained in Gamma with respect to neutral, un-pleasant, and pleasant stimuli, respectively. In each group (controls and patients), the largest WCs are observed at anterio-frontal and central lobes; however, controls generate the high WC in response to pleasant stimuli, whereas the patients generate the high WC in response to neutral stimuli in Gamma. In conclusion, fronto-central lobes are the most activated brain regions during emotional stimulation by means of inter-hemispheric correlation. Gamma is the most sensitive fba to visual affective pictures. Emotional dysfunctions are found to be characterized by decreased WC in pleasant state, increased WC in neutral state in Gamma.

In the current study, we measured rsEEG spectral power measures (relative power, between-band ratios and asymmetry) in one hundred sixty five young adults who were also tested on a battery of executive function (EF). We specifically focused on upper Alpha, Theta and Beta frequency bands given their putative role in EF. Our indices enabled finding correlations since they had decent-to-excellent internal and retest reliability and very little range restriction relative to a nation-wide representative large sample. Nonetheless, Bayesian statistical inference indicated support for the null hypothesis concerning lack of monotonic correlation between EF and rsEEG spectral power measures. Therefore, we conclude that, contrary to the quite common interpretation, these rsEEG spectral power measures do not indicate individual differences in the measured EF abilities.

For this purpose, both embedding and probabilistic as well as wavelet entropy methods are compared to each other with respect to classification performance criteria in tests where two groups (5 musicians and 5 non-musicians) are classified by using 10-fold cross validated Support Vector Machine Classifiers for both target and non-target records. An embedding entropy so called Permutation Entropy provided the highest classification accuracies (99.96% for target records, 99.29% for non-target records) with respect to specified features extracted from 22 electrode locations near to auditory cortex (P7, TP7, T7, FT7, F7, AF7, AF8, F8, FT8, T8, TP8, P8, P5, CP5, C5, FC5, F5, F6, FC6, C6, CP6, P6). In conclusion, musical training enhances the neural encoding of sound and this performance can be quantified in terms of entropy values. In detail, the degree of EEG complexity increases depending on the existing of musical experience in auditory tasks.

Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver distraction system, which can monitor the driver's distraction and alert the driver before there is a chance of disasters on the road continuously an ubiquitously. Therefore, early detection of driver distraction can help decrease the cost of roadway disasters. Physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) have been extensively used for driver state monitoring at the physiological level. More recently, galvanic skin response (GSR) analysis, which is a minimally intrusive technology, has been investigated to develop monitoring systems which alerts divers early. In this paper, we propose a novel detection system that characterizes the impact of secondary tasks of calling and texting on the driver based on the spectrogram and MEL Cepstrum representation of the GSR signals and convolutional neural networks (CNN) modeling. The proposed detection system decomposes the GSR signals in 2D time-frequency representation to decode spectro-temporal patterns. We further isolate the spectral envelope and then extract Mel frequency filter bank coefficients in time and frequency. Our proposed deep CNN structure is designed to automatically learn reliable discriminative visual patterns in the 2D spectrogram and Mel cepstrum space. Passing the layers of the CNN, the low level features transform to high level features representing the impact of the secondary tasks. The aforementioned process replaces the traditional ad hoc hand-crafted feature extraction when working with a high dimensional time-series dataset. The classification accuracy of the proposed prediction algorithm is evaluated based on a set of recorded GSR signals from 7 driver subjects during a naturalistic driving. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a high accuracy of detecting the state of inattention, 93.28%.

In cerebral palsy (CP) learning of any new task is an extremely slow process due to damage in sensory and motor areas of brain affecting the cognitive ability of the child and putting constraints in achieving timely developmental milestones. For such patients the electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most cost effective diagnostic tools used that minimizes hospital stay. Its analysis helps to identify various neurological disorders determining the role of brain waves outlining the present status of mind. Materials and Methods: This study evaluated the EEG power spectrum density (PSD) of CP children both pre and post rTMS intervention to identify significance changes in signal patterns arising from different brain regions. thirty CP children participated in this study. Fifteen individuals underwent repetitive TMS (rTMS) therapy for 20 session comprising of 10 Hz frequency for 5 days a week for 4 weeks and another fifteen individual participated in activities of daily living for 20 sessions where they were administered mandatory standard therapy only. pre- EEG versus post EEG data recorded and analyzed employing the standard montage configuration. PSD was extracted employing fast fourier transform post acquisition of artifact free signal to undermine changes in signal pattern. Discussion and Conclusion: The results revealed that rTMS improves learning ability in CP children and it shows higher power peak at frequency of 50 Hz and lower power peak frequency at 100 Hz. The power intensity in gamma wave region shows significant reduction post-rTMS therapy between 38-24 power peak frequency and 7-4 range in 100 Hz power peak frequency. In future, it will be used as effective tool as memory enhancers, especially for children with neurological disorders.

Although there are oscillator-based models of brain dynamics, their universal computational properties have not been explored much unlike in the case of rate-coded and spiking neuron network models. Use of oscillator-based models is often limited to special phenomena like locomotor rhythms and oscillatory attractor-based memories. If neuronal ensembles are taken to be the basic functional units of brain dynamics, it is desirable to develop oscillator-based models that can explain a wide variety of neural phenomena. Autoencoders are a special type of feed forward networks that have been used for construction of large-scale deep networks. Although autoencoders based on rate-coded and spiking neuron networks have been proposed, there are no autoencoders based on oscillators. We propose here an oscillatory neural network model that performs the function of an autoencoder. The model is a hybrid of rate-coded neurons and neural oscillators. Input signals modulate the frequency of the neural encoder oscillators. These signals are then multiplexed using a network of rate-code neurons that has afferent Hebbian and lateral anti-Hebbian connectivity, termed as Lateral Anti Hebbian Network (LAHN). Finally the LAHN output is de-multiplexed using an output neural layer which is a combination of adaptive Hopf and Kuramoto oscillators for the signal reconstruction. The Kuramoto-Hopf combination performing demodulation is a novel way of describing a neural phase-locked loop. The proposed model is tested using both synthetic signals and real world EEG signals. The proposed model arises out of the general motivation to construct biologically inspired, oscillatory versions of some of the standard neural network models, and presents itself as an autoencoder network based on oscillatory neurons applicable to time series signals. As a demonstration, the model is applied to compression of EEG signals.	[Soman, Karthik; Chakravarthy, V.

Diagnostic evaluation and surgical management of pediatric insular epilepsy utilizing magnetoencephalography and invasive EEG monitoring	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Insular epilepsy; MEG; Drug resistant epilepsy; Invasive monitoring	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; INTRACRANIAL EEG; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; EPILEPTOGENIC ZONE; DEPTH ELECTRODES; SURGERY; MEG	Introduction: The diagnosis and surgical management of pediatric patients with insular epilepsy is challenging due to variable and indistinct seizure semiology arising within the insular cortex. In addition, surgical approaches are associated with potential morbidity given the regional neurosurgical and vascular anatomy. Our institutional experience in evaluation and surgical management of insular epilepsy patients is presented. Diagnostic evaluation, surgical treatment and seizures outcomes are highlighted. Methods: The institutional database for all pediatric surgical epilepsy patients was reviewed over a period of 15 years (2000-2015). Study subjects were defined as patients who had undergone surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone involving the insular cortex. Diagnostic imaging, electrophysiological studies and surgical records were assessed. Results: Six (n = 6) patients with insular epilepsy were identified with a mean follow up of 2.8 years (range: 0.8-6.8 years). Mean age at surgical resection was 9.5 +/- 2.5 years (range: 2.5-16 years). Majority of patients (n = 4/6, 67%) underwent more than 1 surgical procedure. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) identified insular cortex involvement presurgically in all cases. MEG cluster localization was useful in guiding invasive EEG monitoring in 5 patients and was concordant with identification of epileptogenic zone through intracranial monitoring in all 5 patients. Surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone, as delineated through MEG spike sources and invasive EEG monitoring, was associated with favorable seizure outcome in 4 of 6 patients (67%; Engel Class I). Cortical dysgenesis was identified on histopathology in 4 cases. Conclusion: Diagnostic evaluation through invasive and noninvasive electrophysiological studies is critical to identify pediatric patients with insular epilepsy. Our findings suggest that MEG may help with identifying the epileptogenic zone within the insular cortex, which could be confirmed with invasive intracranial monitoring.

Go/no-go training has successfully been applied to reduce such action tendencies. This study investigated the electrophysiological mechanisms that may underlie the beneficial effects of go/no-go training on food consumption. EEG was measured while 19 participants passively observed pictures of food and non-food items, both before and after the go/no-go training. During training, 50% of the food and non-food items were consistently paired with a go/no-go response. After training, food items that had been associated with a response induced larger mu desynchronization at electrodes over sensorimotor regions, whereas food items that had been associated with withholding from responding induced larger increases in theta power at frontal midline electrodes. These findings suggest that the exerted cognitive control during go/no-go training with attractive food stimuli may become associated with these stimuli and signal the required level of control during subsequent encounters.

Neurofeedback is a technique of neuromodulation through operant conditioning paradigm that uses a computer interface to provide real-time information about brain activity to increase individual self-perception and assist in modulation. The sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) training protocol is known to enhance attention and has been applied to improve cognitive performance, primarily for attention and memory gains. The aim of this study is to test if the SMR protocol can improve working memory performance in an aging population and consequently favor cognitive reserve. Seventeen older adults (12 females) took part in a randomized placebo-controlled study. They completed a visual working memory test, Delayed Matching to Sample Task (DMTS), before and after the SMR neurofeedback protocol in order to compare their visual working memory performance. Moreover, a 19-channels EEG was collected while they perform the DMTS pre- and post-training. The experimental group showed an improvement in their working memory performance after the training with similar activation power, mainly in theta and beta frequency band at frontal and alpha at temporal regions. The sham group showed some variations in the score of working memory after the training, but were not statistically significant and their power spectrum demonstrate enhancement in alpha and beta band frontal and temporal. The group that did not receive neurofeedback training did not show a change in their working memory performance, neither in their EEG spectrum. The results suggest that neurofeedback can benefit brain reserve in an aging population because individuals enhanced their working memory performance after training and have their EEG activation changed according to expected in working memory tasks.

Post-ictal Modulation of Baroreflex Sensitivity in Patients With Intractable Epilepsy	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; autonomic nervous system; baroreflex function; baroreflex sensitivity; heart rate variability; SUDEP	SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; BARORECEPTOR REFLEX; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BLOOD-PRESSURE; MECHANISMS; SEIZURES; RATS; TACHYCARDIA	Objective: Seizure-related autonomic dysregulation occurs in epilepsy patients and may contribute to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). We tested how different types of seizures affect baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). We hypothesized that BRS and HRV would be reduced after bilateral convulsive seizures (BCS). Methods: We recorded blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG) and oxygen saturation continuously in patients (n = 18) with intractable epilepsy undergoing video-EEG monitoring. A total of 23 seizures, either focal seizures (FS, n = 14) or BCS (n = 9), were analyzed from these patients. We used 5 different HRV measurements in both the time and frequency domains to study HRV in pre- and post-ictal states. We used the average frequency domain gain, computed as the average of the magnitude ratio between the systolic BP (BPsys) and the RR-interval time series, in the low-frequency (LF) band as frequency domain index of BRS in addition to the instantaneous slope between systolic BP and RR-interval satisfying spontaneous BRS criteria as a time domain index of BRS. Results: Overall, the post-ictal modulation of HRV varied across the subjects but not specifically by the type of seizures. Comparing pre- to post-ictal epochs, the LF power of BRS decreased in 8 of 9 seizures for patients with BCS; whereas following 12 of 14 FS, BRS increased. Similarly, spontaneous BRS decreased following 7 of 9 BCS. The presence or absence of oxygen desaturation was not consistent with the changes in BRS following seizures, and the HRV does not appear to be correlated with the BRS changes. These data suggest that a transient decrease in BRS and temporary loss of cardiovascular homeostatic control can follow BCS but is unlikely following FS. Significance: These findings indicate significant post-ictal autonomic dysregulation in patients with epilepsy following BCS. Further, reduced BRS following BCS, if confirmed in future studies on SUDEP cases, may indicate one quantifiable risk marker of SUDEP.

The present study aimed to develop a noncontact system to measure brain activity based on pupillary rhythms using an infra-red web camera. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and pupil imaging of 70 undergraduate volunteers (35 female, 35 male) were measured in response to sound stimuli designed to evoke arousal, relaxation, happiness, sadness, or neutral responses. This study successfully developed a real-time system that could detect an EEG spectral index (relative power: low beta in FP1; mid beta in FP1; SMR in FP1; beta in F3; high beta in F8; gamma P4; mu in C4) from pupillary rhythms using the synchronization phenomenon in harmonic frequency (1/100 f) between the pupil and brain oscillations. This method was effective in measuring and evaluating brain activity using a simple, low-cost, noncontact system, and may be an alternative to previous methods used to evaluate brain activity.

Disrupted network cross talk, hippocampal dysfunction and hallucinations in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Hallucinations; ALFF; FNC; Resting-state; fMRI	AUDITORY VERBAL HALLUCINATIONS; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SALIENCE NETWORK; VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS; METAANALYSIS; CORTEX; HYPOTHESIS; PSYCHOSIS; SPEECH	Hallucinations characterize schizophrenia, with approximately 59% of patients reporting auditory hallucinations and 27% reporting visual hallucinations. Prior neuroimaging studies suggest that hallucinations are linked to disrupted communication across distributed (sensory, salience-monitoring and subcortical) networks. Yet, our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie auditory and visual hallucinations in schizophrenia remains limited. This study integrates two resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis methods - amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional network connectivity (FNC) - to explore the hypotheses that (1) abnormal FNC between salience and sensory (visual/auditory) networks underlies hallucinations in schizophrenia, and (2) disrupted hippocampal oscillations (as measured by hippocampal ALFF) beget changes in FNC linked to hallucinations. Our first hypothesis was supported by the finding that schizophrenia patients reporting hallucinations have higher FNC between the salience network and an associative auditory network relative to healthy controls. Hippocampal ALFF was negatively associated with FNC between primary auditory cortex and the salience network in healthy subjects, but was positively associated with FNC between these networks in patients reporting hallucinations. These findings provide indirect support favoring our second hypothesis. We suggest future studies integrate fMRI with electroencephalogram (EEG) and/or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) methods to directly probe the temporal relation between altered hippocampal oscillations and changes in cross-network functional communication.

Oscillatory networks of high-level mental alignment: A perspective-taking MEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Perspective taking; Social cognition; MEG; Theta; Oscillations; Synchrony	RIGHT TEMPOROPARIETAL JUNCTION; SOCIAL COGNITION; TOP-DOWN; DISTINCT CONTRIBUTIONS; EXTRASTRIATE BODY; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEURAL BASIS; EEG-DATA; SELF	Mentally imagining another's perspective is a high-level social process, reliant on manipulating internal representations of the self in an embodied manner. Recently Wang et al. (2016) showed that theta-band (3-7 Hz) brain oscillations within the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) and brain regions coding for motor/body schema contribute to the process of perspective-taking. Using a similar paradigm, we set out to unravel the extended functional brain network in detail. Increasing the angle between self and other perspective was accompanied by longer reaction times and increases in theta power within rTPJ, right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Using Granger-causality, we showed that lateral PFC and ACC exert top-down influence over rTPJ, indicative of executive control processes required for managing conflicts between self and other perspectives. Finally, we quantified patterns of whole-brain phase coupling in relation to the rTPJ. Results suggest that rTPJ increases its theta-band phase synchrony with brain regions involved in mentalizing and regions coding for motor/body schema; whilst decreasing synchrony to visual regions. Implications for neurocognitive models are discussed, and it is proposed that rTPJ acts as a 'hub' to route bottom-up visual information to internal representations of the self during perspective-taking, co-ordinated by theta-band oscillations.

Conflict resolution can disrupt movement preparation and lead to "errors" in motor programming. These "errors" are physiologically useful by enabling us to adapt our motor behavior to situations with conflicting information. The objective of the present study was to analyze the patterns of cortical activation associated with motor programming errors and the corresponding error corrections. Incongruent flankers around a target arrow were used to trigger errors in anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) prior to gait initiation; i.e. perturbed motor programming but normal execution. Thirty healthy adults performed a gait initiation task. The event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) after target presentation were analyzed according to the presence or absence of an APA error. The ERP was similar in both conditions, except that the Ne and P300 peak latencies were longer for APA errors. Motor programming errors during gait initiation were characterized by longer, less intense low-beta-band ERD over the sensorimotor cortex and alpha ERS followed by stronger alpha ERD during errors. APA errors were associated with a specific alpha/beta oscillation profile over the sensorimotor cortex; these beta oscillations might be sensitive markers of non-conscious motor error and correction monitoring.

By integrating these two streams of research, the present study assessed the effect of two anaesthetic agents (i.e. propofol and midazolam) on audio-spatial feature binding. We also recorded the electrophysiological activity of the frontal channels. Using pharmacokinetic simulation, we determined the effect-site concentration (Ce) of the anaesthetics at loss of response to verbal command and eyelash reflex. We subsequently adjusted Ce to 75%, 50% and 25% of Ce-LOC to achieve deep, moderate and light sedation, respectively. Behavioural results showed that moderate sedation selectively disrupted feature binding. The frontal channels showed a P3 component (350-600ms peristimulus period) following the presentation of audio-spatial stimuli at baseline and under moderate and light sedations. Critically, the late event-related potential component (600-1000 ms) returned to the pre-activated level (0-350 ms) at baseline and under light sedation but was sustained under moderate sedation. We propose that audio-spatial feature binding may require the presence of a P3 component and its subsequent and sufficient decline, as under anaesthetic-induced moderate sedation the P3 component was sustained and featured binding was impaired.

This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of reflecting the motor function improvement after stroke with the measurement of corticomuscular coherence (CMC) in an individual subject. Method: A stroke patient was recruited to participate in an experiment before and after the function recovery of his paretic upper limb, respectively. An elbow flexion task with a constant muscle contraction level was involved in the experiment. Electromyography and electroencephalography signals were recorded simultaneously to estimate the CMC. The non-parameter statistical analysis was used to test the significance of CMC differences between the first and second times of experiments. Result: The strongest corticomuscular coupling emerged at the motor cortex contralateral to the contracting muscles for both the affected and unaffected limbs. The strength of the corticomuscular coupling between activities from the paretic limb muscles and the contralateral motor cortex for the second time of experiment increased significantly compared with that for the first time. However, the CMC of the unaffected limb had no significant changes between two times of experiments. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the increased corticomuscular coupling strength resulted from the motor function restoration of the paretic limb. The measure of CMC can reflect the recovery of motor function after stroke by quantifying interactions between activities from the motor cortex and controlled muscles.

Impact of alcohol use on EEG dynamics of response inhibition: a cotwin control analysis	ADDICTION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Alcohol; cotwin control; functional connectivity; inhibitory control; sex differences; theta	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; BRAIN; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; TASKS; POWER; RISK; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; DISINHIBITION	Research indicates that alcohol misuse is associated with behavioral disinhibition, but the neurophysiological mechanisms governing this relationship remain largely unknown. Recent work suggests that successful inhibition and cognitive control involve electrophysiological theta-band dynamics, including medial frontal cortex (MFC) power enhancement and functional connectivity between the MFC and dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) regions, which may be disrupted by alcohol misuse. In addition, research suggests that, compared to men, women are at heightened risk of experiencing the negative physical and neurocognitive correlates of drinking. The present study tested the hypothesis that alcohol misuse has a deleterious effect on theta-band response inhibition EEG dynamics in a sample of 300 24-year-old same-sex twins. A cotwin control (CTC) design was used to disentangle premorbid risk for alcohol use from the causal effects of alcohol exposure. Drinking was negatively associated with theta-band MFC power and MFC-dPFC connectivity during response inhibition, and this effect was stronger among women. The CTC analysis suggested that, for women, reduced nogo-related theta-band MFC power and MFC-dPFC connectivity were both consistent with the potential deleterious causal effects of alcohol exposure. These findings suggest that diminished theta-band MFC power and MFC-dPFC connectivity may be neurophysiological mechanisms underlying alcoholrelated disinhibition. Although preliminary, these results suggest that normative levels of alcohol use during emerging adulthood have potential sex-specific causal effects on response inhibition EEG dynamics, and thus have potentially significant public health implications.

Cortical response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease patients with dyskinesias	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical excitability; dyskinesias; electroencephalography; Parkinson's disease; supplementary motor area; transcranial magnetic stimulation	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EXTERNALLY TRIGGERED MOVEMENTS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; FRONTAL-CORTEX; NETWORK; CONNECTIVITY; PLASTICITY; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; ACTIVATION	Levodopa-induced dyskinesias are a common and disabling side effect of dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease, but their neural mechanisms in vivo are still poorly understood. Besides striatal pathology, the importance of cortical dysfunction has been increasingly recognized. The supplementary motor area in particular, may have a relevant role in dyskinesias onset given its involvement in endogenously generated actions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the levodopa-related cortical excitability changes along with the emergence of levodopa-induced peak-of-dose dyskinesias in subjects with Parkinson's disease. Thirteen patients without dyskinesias and ten with dyskinesias received 200/50 mg fast-acting oral levodopa/benserazide following overnight withdrawal (12 hr) from their dopaminergic medication. We targeted transcranial magnetic stimulation to the supplementary motor area, ipsilateral to the most dopamine-depleted striatum defined with single-photon emission computed tomography with [I-123]N-omega-fluoropropyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane, and recorded transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potentials with high-density electroencephalography before and at 30, 60, and 180 min after levodopa/benserazide intake. Clinical improvement from levodopa/benserazide paralleled the increase in cortical excitability in both groups. Subjects with dyskinesias showed higher fluctuation of cortical excitability in comparison to non-dyskinetic patients, possibly reflecting dyskinetic movements. Together with endogenous brain oscillation, levodopa-related dynamics of brain state could influence the therapeutic response of neuromodulatory interventions.

This multicentre study provides an atlas of normal intracranial EEG of the human brain during wakefulness. Here we present the results of power spectra analysis during wakefulness. Intracranial electrodes are placed in or on the brain of epilepsy patients when candidates for surgical treatment and non-invasive approaches failed to sufficiently localize the epileptic focus. Electrode contacts are usually in cortical regions showing epileptic activity, but some are placed in normal regions, at distance from the epileptogenic zone or lesion. Intracranial EEG channels defined using strict criteria as very likely to be in healthy brain regions were selected from three tertiary epilepsy centres. All contacts were localized in a common stereotactic space allowing the accumulation and superposition of results from many subjects. Sixty-second artefact-free sections during wakefulness were selected. Power spectra were calculated for 38 brain regions, and compared to a set of channels with no spectral peaks in order to identify significant peaks in the different regions. A total of 1785 channels with normal brain activity from 106 patients were identified. There were on average 2.7 channels per cm 3 of cortical grey matter. The number of contacts per brain region averaged 47 (range 6-178). We found significant differences in the spectral density distributions across the different brain lobes, with beta activity in the frontal lobe (20-24 Hz), a clear alpha peak in the occipital lobe (9.25-10.25 Hz), intermediate alpha (8.25-9.25 Hz) and beta (17-20 Hz) frequencies in the parietal lobe, and lower alpha (7.75-8.25 Hz) and delta (0.75-2.25 Hz) peaks in the temporal lobe. Some cortical regions showed a specific electrophysiological signature: peaks present in > 60% of channels were found in the precentral gyrus (lateral: peak frequency range, 20-24 Hz; mesial: 24-30 Hz), opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus (20-24 Hz), cuneus (7.75-8.75 Hz), and hippocampus (0.75-1.25 Hz). Eight per cent of all analysed channels had more than one spectral peak; these channels were mostly recording from sensory and motor regions. Alpha activity was not present throughout the occipital lobe, and some cortical regions showed peaks in delta activity during wakefulness. This is the first atlas of normal intracranial EEG activity; it includes dense coverage of all cortical regions in a common stereotactic space, enabling direct comparisons of EEG across subjects. This atlas provides a normative baseline against which clinical EEGs and experimental results can be compared. It is provided as an open web resource (https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca).

Spontaneous sensorimotor cortical activity is suppressed by deep brain stimulation in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Subthalamic nucleus; Advanced Parkinson's disease; Deep brain stimulation; Beta band suppression	SIGNAL SPACE SEPARATION; MUSCULAR COHERENCE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MU-RHYTHM; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; TREMOR; STATE; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; EEG	Advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by an excessive oscillatory beta band activity in the sub thalamic nucleus (STN). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of STN alleviates motor symptoms in PD and suppresses the STN beta band activity. The effect of DBS on cortical sensorimotor activity is more ambiguous; both increases and decreases of beta band activity have been reported. Non-invasive studies with simultaneous DBS are problematic due to DBS-induced artifacts. We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 16 advanced PD patients with and without STN DBS during rest and wrist extension. The strong magnetic artifacts related to stimulation were removed by temporal signal space separation. MEG oscillatory activity at 5-25 Hz was suppressed during DBS in a widespread frontoparietal region, including the sensorimotor cortex identified by the cortico-muscular coherence. The strength of suppression did not correlate with clinical improvement. Our results indicate that alpha and beta band oscillations are suppressed at the frontoparietal cortex by STN DBS in PD.

Sleep spindles are a NREM sleep characteristic associated with both pathophysiology and sleep-dependent memory consolidation, yet they have not been evaluated in frequent nightmare recallers. The morning naps of 38 participants with frequent idiopathic nightmares (mean age: 23.7 +/- 3.78 years) and 25 age- and sex-matched controls (23.9 +/- 3.65 years) were recorded and their sleep evaluated. A custom spindle detector assessed NREM sleep stage 2 (N2) sleep spindles on six electroencephalogram (EEG) derivations (F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, and O2) for density (number spindles/N2 time), mean frequency, and amplitude. Total spindles (10-16 Hertz (Hz) range), slow spindles (10-12.79 Hz), and fast spindles (12.8-16 Hz) were all assessed separately. Compared with the Control group, the Nightmare group had longer N2 sleep latency and a marginally greater %N2 sleep. The Nightmare group also had a lower than normal density of slow spindles in most EEG derivations, a higher density of fast spindles in frontal derivations, and an elevated fast spindle oscillatory frequency-"faster fast" spindles-mainly in central derivations. These differences withstood controls for pre-existing group differences in depression. Correlational analyses demonstrated a further pattern of group differences by which higher pathology scores were associated with higher slow spindle densities and slower spindle frequencies for the Nightmare but not the Control group. A similar pattern was observed for some dream content measures, ie, the Nightmare group showed positive correlations of slow spindle density with dreamed fear and word count and negative correlations with dreamed positive emotion. Conversely, the Control group showed opposite trends. Results thus demonstrate abnormalities in the composition of N2 sleep-and especially in N2 spindles-among frequent nightmare recallers and link these abnormalities to both trait (psychopathology) and state (dream content) factors. Spindle findings for psychopathology resemble, but are not identical with, previous findings for patients with major depression, social anxiety, and schizophrenia and are thus consistent with an explanation implicating spindles as trait markers of psychopathology. Correlational analyses go beyond a trait explanation to suggest several possible state-based explanations involving memory consolidation mechanisms, specifically, the possibility that spindles index either emotional or verbal task-based processes.

We manipulated coordination information by presenting two chasers and one common target performing coordinated or individual (i.e., uncoordinated) chases, and measured mu rhythms (electroencephalogram oscillations within the 8-13 Hz range at sensorimotor regions) related to understanding social interactions. We found that although the participants' task was completely unrelated to processing chasing motion, mu rhythms were more suppressed for coordinated chasing than in the control condition (backward replay for chasing motion), and this effect disappeared for uncoordinated chasing. Moreover, mu suppression increased with higher post-test ratings of social coordination but did not correlate with uncoordinated information. Such effects cannot be explained by general attentional involvement, as there was no difference in attention-related occipital alpha suppression across conditions. These findings are consistent with interpretations of processing coordinated actions, suggesting that our visual system can automatically attribute social coordination information to motion, at least in chasing scenes.

We analyzed the advantage of early surgical management in terms of seizure frequency and development. Method: We retrospectively studied the 15 patients younger than 6 years who underwent resective surgery between 2006 and 2016. Fourteen of them had invasive monitoring while the 15th was operated on under corticography. Results: Epilepsy began before 5 months of age in all patients. Overall 13 patients (86%) had a dramatic improvement of epilepsy after surgery (Engel 1 and 2) including 9 patients (60%) seizure free (Engel 1 A). In the group of 9 patients younger than 20 months at the time of surgery who presented with catastrophic epilepsies, 77% are Engel 1 A and the other 23% Engel 2. In this subpopulation, no one developed autism and four (44%) regained normal development. Conclusions: In early onset epilepsies associated with TSC, surgical treatment is highly effective, in particular when performed early. Invasive monitoring contributes to the successful outcome.

Currently available FTD medications have been used to control behavioral symptoms, even though they are ineffective in some patients, expensive and may induce adverse effects. Alternative therapeutic approaches are worth pursuing, such as non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial direct current (tDCS). tDCS has been demonstrated to influence neuronal excitability and reported to enhance cognitive performance in dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether applying Anodal tDCS (2 mA intensity, 20 min) over the fronto-temporal cortex bilaterally in five consecutive daily sessions would improve cognitive performance and behavior symptoms in FTD patients, also considering the neuromodulatory effect of stimulation on cortical electrical activity measured through EEG. We recruited 13 patients with FTD and we tested the effect of Anodal and Sham (i.e., placebo) tDCS in two separate experimental sessions. In each session, at baseline (TO), after 5 consecutive days (T1), after 1 week (T2), and after 4 weeks (T3) from the end of the treatment, cognitive and behavioral functions were tested. EEG (21 electrodes, 10-20 international system) was recorded for 5 min with eyes closed at the same time points in nine patients. The present findings showed that Anodal tDCS applied bilaterally over the fronto-temporal cortex significantly improves (1) neuropsychiatric symptoms (as measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory, NPI) in FTD patients immediately after tDCS treatment, and (2) simple visual reaction times (sVRTs) up to 1 month after tDCS treatment. These cognitive improvements significantly correlate with the time course of the slow EEG oscillations (delta and theta bands) measured at the same time points. Even though further studies on larger samples are needed, these findings support the effectiveness of Anodal tDCS over the fronto-temporal regions in FTD on attentional processes that might be correlated to a normalized EEG low-frequency pattern.

Wake-sleep transition is a continuous, gradual process of change. Most studies evaluating electroencephalogram spectral power during this transition have used variance analysis (ANOVA). However, using this type of analysis does not allow one to detect specific changes in the statistical properties of a time series. Objective. To determine whether change point analysis (CPA) makes it possible to identify and characterize electroencephalographic, electromyographic, and cardiac changes during the wake-sleep transition through a cross-sectional study. Method. The study included 18 healthy volunteers (12 women and six men), from which polysomnography data were obtained during a two-minute transition. Heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, electroencephalogram spectral power, as well as electromyographic median and mean frequency and electromyographic root mean square were calculated in five-second segments. These segments were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, and CPA focused individually and for the group as a whole. Results. Repeated measures ANOVA and CPA by group found decreased levels of alpha and beta power and beta/delta index during wakefulness, and increased theta and delta power levels during sleep. CPA by individual found that only alpha power changed in all participants and failed to identify a specific moment when all the variables studied changed simultaneously. Discussion and conclusion. We consider that CPA provides additional information to statistical analyses such as ANOVA for the specific location of physiological changes during sleep-wake transition.

The properties of model-predicted ERPs are explored throughout the stability zone of the corticothalamic system, and predicted time series and wavelet spectra are also analyzed. This provides a unified treatment of predicted ERPs for both normal and abnormal states within the brain's stability zone, including likely parameters to represent abnormal states of reduced arousal.

Differential effects of non-dual and focused attention meditations on the formation of automatic perceptual habits in expert practitioners	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Attention; Auditory oddball; EEG; Gamma; Mindfulness; Predictive coding	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY ATTENTION; TERM-MEMORY; EEG; ERP; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; RESPONSES	Non-dual meditation aims to undo maladaptive cognitive and affective patterns by recognizing their constructed and transient nature. We previously found high-amplitude spontaneous gamma (25-40 Hz) oscillatory activity during such practice. Nonetheless, it is unclear how this meditation state differs from other practices, in terms of perceptual information processing. Here, we hypothesized that non-dual meditation can downregulate the automatic formation of perceptual habits. To investigate this hypothesis, we recorded EEG from expert Buddhist meditation practitioners and matched novices to measure two components of the auditory evoked response: the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and the Late Frontal Negativity (LFN), a potential observed at a latency sensitive to attentional engagement to the auditory environment, during the practices of Open Presence (OP) and Focused Attention (FA), as well as during a control state, in the context of a passive oddball paradigm. We found an increase in gamma oscillatory power during both meditation states in expert practitioners and an interaction between states and groups in the amplitude of the MMN. A further investigation identified the specific interplay between the MMN and the LFN as a possible marker to differentiate the two meditation states as a function of expertise. In experts, the MMN increased during FA, compared to OP, while the opposite pattern was observed at the LFN latency. We propose that the state of OP in experts is characterized by increased sensory monitoring and reduced perceptual inferences compared to FA. This study represents a first attempt to describe the impact of non-dual meditation states on the regulation of automatic brain predictive processes.

SWS is characterized by EEG slow waves resulting from the synchronous alternation of neuronal membrane potentials between hyperpolarized down-states with neuronal quiescence and depolarized up-states associated with action potentials. By contrast, studies of non-avian reptiles report the presence of high-voltage sharp waves (HShW) during sleep. How HShW relate to EEG phenomena occurring during mammalian and avian sleep is unclear. We investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of electrophysiological phenomena in Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) anesthetized with isoflurane to determine whether they share similar spatiotemporal patterns to mammalian and avian slow waves. Methods: Recordings of anesthetized crocodiles were made using 64-channel penetrating arrays with electrodes arranged in an 8 x 8 equally spaced grid. The arrays were placed in the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), a region implicated in the genesis of HShW. Various aspects of the spatiotemporal distribution of recorded signals were investigated. Results: Recorded signals revealed the presence of HShW resembling those reported in earlier studies of naturally sleeping reptiles. HShW propagated in complex and variable patterns across the DVR. Conclusions: We demonstrate that HShW within the DVR propagate in complex patterns similar to those observed for avian slow waves recorded from homologous brain regions. Consequently, sleep with HShW may represent an ancestral form of SWS, characterized by up-states occurring less often and for a shorter duration than in mammals and birds.

High-density (128-channel) resting-state EEG were recorded prior to and following treatment sessions and analyzed using a group-level independent component (IC) analysis. IFC between 19 ICs was quantified by inter-IC phase coherence (ICPC) in six frequency bands (delta, theta, low alpha, high alpha, beta, gamma). Correlational analyses between IFCs and symptoms were performed. Symptom improvement after rTMS was significantly correlated with (1) an increase in low alpha band (8-10Hz) IFC but a decrease of IFC in all other bands, and (2) high baseline IFC in the high alpha (11-13Hz) and beta bands (14-30Hz). Most treatment related IFC changes occurred between frontal and parietal regions with a linear association between the degree of symptom improvement and the number of coherent IFC changes. Frequency band and region specific IFC changes correlate with and can predict symptom changes induced by rTMS over DLPFC in MdDS. MdDS symptom response correlates with high baseline IFC in most frequency bands. Treatment induced increase in long-range low alpha IFC and decreases in IFC in other bands as well as the proportion of coherent IFC changes correlate with symptom reduction.

Cortical control of upright stance in elderly	MECHANISMS OF AGEING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Postural control; Aging; EEG; EMG; Cortico-muscular coherence; Perturbation evoked potentials	NONINVASIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; BALANCE; HUMANS; AGE; RESPONSES; MOVEMENT	This study examined differences between young and elderly volunteers in cortical involvement to human posture control during quiet stance with normal and altered sensory stimulation (Experiment-1), and biomechanical perturbations (Experiment-2). The primary focus of the first part was to monitor changes in cortical activity when unexpectedly altering the sensory conditions of upright stance, such as switching from stable (eyes open, fixed support surface) to less-stable (eyes closed, sway-referenced support surface) conditions. Our results demonstrate increased cortical activations in delta (0.2-4 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) oscillations, primarily over central-frontal, central, and central parietal cortices during challenging postural conditions. While increased delta rhythms were observed in both groups during challenging sensory conditions, elderly individuals also showed increased gamma band activity over sensorimotor and parietal cortices, when compared to the younger group. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show age differences in balance related cortical activations during continuous postural tasks with challenging sensory conditions. Preliminary correlations also suggest that increased cerebral activity became more relevant to the control of Center of Mass (COM) dynamics when upright stance is threatened. The results of Experiment-2 also showed for the first time that oscillatory rhythms of the cortex are coherent with muscle firing characteristics suggesting increased corticospinal drive from leg motor cortex to lower limb motoneurons following postural perturbations. Finally, perturbation evoked potential (PEP) analyses suggest that, rather than motor system malfunctioning, impairments in perceptual processing of sensory afference forms the basis of prolonged muscle response delays during perturbed balance in the elderly.

One electroclinical phenomenon specific to the condition consists of lateralized motor spasms, known as faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS). An electrodecremental pattern overriding a "DC shift" has been described as the EEG correlate of these spasms. We sought to further characterize this pre-spasm infraslow activity (ISA). Methods: Continuous video-EEG recordings were acquired in four patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis: each had frequent motor spasms/FBDS as well as frequent subclinical temporal lobe seizures (an independent indicator of anti-LGI1 encephalitis). Results: In artifact-free recordings obtained using clinical amplifiers equipped with a low frequency analog filter of 0.07 Hz, ISA reliably preceded clinical onset of the motor spasms by similar to 1.2 s and preceded the electrodecremental pattern by similar to 700 ms. Pre-spasm ISA was invariably recorded contralateral to FBDS, with a voltage topographic maximum over the mid frontal region. The pre-movement ISA differed from the Bereitschaftspotential in timing and topography and was an order of magnitude higher in amplitude. Sporadic FBDS that occurred in association with temporal lobe seizures were preceded by identical ISA. Conclusions: The motor spasms of anti-LGI1 encephalitis are preceded by frontal ISA. A paucity of data at the microscale level precludes mechanistic explanations at the macroscale level, or even determination of the relative contributions of neurons and glia in the generation of the ISA.

In this two-generation family study we examined delta-beta correlation during a social performance task as candidate endophenotype of SAD. Methods: Nine families with a target participant (diagnosed with SAD), their spouse and children, as well as target's siblings with spouse and children performed a social performance task in which they gave a speech in front of a camera. EEG was measured during resting state, anticipation, and recovery. Our analyses focused on two criteria for endophenotypes: co-segregation within families and heritability. Results: Co-segregation analyses revealed increased negative delta-low beta correlation during anticipation in participants with (sub) clinical SAD compared to participants without (sub) clinical SAD. Heritability analyses revealed that delta-low beta and delta-high beta correlation during anticipation were heritable. Delta-beta correlation did not differ between participants with and without (sub) clinical SAD during resting state or recovery, nor between participants with and without SAD during all phases of the task. Limitations: It should be noted that participants were seen only once, they all performed the EEG tasks in the same order, and some participants were too anxious to give a speech. Conclusions: Delta-low beta correlation during anticipation of giving a speech might be a candidate endophenotype of SAD, possibly reflecting increased crosstalk between cortical and subcortical regions. If validated as endophenotype, delta-beta correlation during anticipation could be useful in studying the genetic basis, as well as improving treatment and early detection of persons at risk for developing SAD.

The present study tested whether the occipital cortex of blind individuals is integrated into a challenged functional network. A working memory (WM) training over four sessions was implemented. Congenitally blind and matched sighted participants were adaptively trained with an n-back task employing either voices (auditory training) or tactile stimuli (tactile training). In addition, a minimally demanding 1-back task served as an active control condition. Power and functional connectivity of EEG activity evolving during the maintenance period of an auditory 2-back task were analyzed, run prior to and after the WM training. Modality-specific (following auditory training) and modality-independent WM training effects (following both auditory and tactile training) were assessed. Improvements in auditory WM were observed in all groups, and blind and sighted individuals did not differ in training gains. Auditory and tactile training of sighted participants led, relative to the active control group, to an increase in fronto-parietal theta-band power, suggesting a training-induced strengthening of the existing modality-independent WM network. No power effects were observed in the blind. Rather, after auditory training the blind showed a decrease in theta-band connectivity between central, parietal, and occipital electrodes compared to the blind tactile training and active control groups. Furthermore, in the blind auditory training increased beta-band connectivity between frontoparietal, central and occipital electrodes. In the congenitally blind, these findings suggest a stronger integration of occipital areas into the auditory WM network.

Resting State Brain Activity During Long-Term Dry Immersion	AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE			English	Article						EEG; weightlessness; support withdrawal; dry immersion	ACUTE STRESS; BED REST; OSCILLATIONS; WEIGHTLESSNESS; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; ASYMMETRY; EMOTION	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this work was to investigate the brain's rhythmic activity during a simulated microgravity condition (namely dry immersion). METHODS: During dry immersion, which lasted for 5 d, nine subjects (healthy men, 20 to 29 yr of age) were individually placed in a tub (2.2 x 1.1 x 0.85 m) filled with water (temperature was kept constant at about 33 degrees C). Subject floated in the tub without bodily support in the supine horizontal position, but isolated from the water by waterproof material. Resting state EEGs were registered at the fourth or fifth day of dry immersion. Under the control conditions, resting state EEGs were registered while subjects laid in a supine position on a couch. RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, EEG power in the alpha range (8-13 Hz) was greater in dry immersion; this effect was distributed across the whole scalp. No effects of dry immersion were found for the beta, delta, or theta frequency bands. CONCLUSION: The results of the study, similar to those obtained in a real spaceflight, indicate that support withdrawal is an important contributor to brain activity alterations in weightlessness.

This study paired electrophysiological with behavioral measures to explore how cumulative stress affects attentional and maintenance processes underpinning working memory retention. We collected electroen-cephalographic recordings from 60 individuals (30 older, 30 younger) reporting high or low levels of cumulative stress during the performance of a spatial Sternberg task. We measured mid-occipital alpha (8-12 Hz) and frontal-midline theta (4-6 Hz) as indicators of attentional and maintenance processes. Older, high-stress participants' behavioral performance lay significantly below than that of younger adults and low-stress older individuals. Impaired task performance coincided with reduced event-related synchronization in alpha and theta frequency ranges during memory maintenance. Electrophysiological findings suggest that older adults' reduced performance results from a stress-related impact on their ability to retain a stimulus in working memory and inhibit extraneous information from interfering with maintenance. Our results demonstrate the wide-ranging impact of cumulative stress on cognitive health and provide insight into the functional mechanisms disrupted by its influence. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Individual spindle detection and analysis in high-density recordings across the night and in thalamic stroke	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FREE CLUSTER-ENHANCEMENT; SLEEP SPINDLES; SLOW WAVES; EEG; COHERENCE	Sleep spindles are thalamocortical oscillations associated with several behavioural and clinical phenomena. In clinical populations, spindle activity has been shown to be reduced in schizophrenia, as well as after thalamic stroke. Automatic spindle detection algorithms present the only feasible way to systematically examine individual spindle characteristics. We took an established algorithm for spindle detection, and adapted it to high-density EEG sleep recordings. To illustrate the detection and analysis procedure, we examined how spindle characteristics changed across the night and introduced a linear mixed model approach applied to individual spindles in adults (n = 9). Next we examined spindle characteristics between a group of paramedian thalamic stroke patients (n = 9) and matched controls. We found a high spindle incidence rate and that, from early to late in the night, individual spindle power increased with the duration and globality of spindles; despite decreases in spindle incidence and peak-to-peak amplitude. In stroke patients, we found that only left-sided damage reduced individual spindle power. Furthermore, reduction was specific to posterior/fast spindles. Altogether, we demonstrate how state-of-the-art spindle detection techniques, applied to high-density recordings, and analysed using advanced statistical approaches can yield novel insights into how both normal and pathological circumstances affect sleep.

Alpha-band functional connectivity during cued versus implicit modality-specific anticipatory attention: EEG-source coherence analysis	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha rhythm; connectivity; cued attention; EEG; implicit learning	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; STIMULUS ANTICIPATION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; MOTOR PREPARATION; PARIETAL CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; DISSOCIATION; MECHANISMS	The anticipation of future events based on a background experience is one of the main components of any goal-directed behavior. Anticipatory attention can be either voluntary (explicit) or involuntary (implicit). We presumed that these two types of anticipatory attention differed in terms of cortical functional organization. We examined this assumption with an experimental model consisting of three experimental sessions (cued attention, implicit learning, and baseline) that were equal in terms of stimuli, motor responses, and cognitive task. Participants were asked to discriminate the temporal order of stimuli within a pair presented in either the visual or auditory sensory modality. Prestimulus functional connectivity was assessed via alpha-band coherence computed in the source space for preselected regions of interests. Functional links between the cortices of the frontoparietal control system increased during the cued attention condition and did not increase during the implicit anticipation condition. The buildup of implicit anticipation was accompanied by the strengthening of functional links between the intraparietal, ventral premotor, and presupplementary motor areas. It was discovered that both cued and implicit types of anticipation were underlain by functional modality-specific cortical links.	[Talalay, I. V.; Kurgansky, A. V.; Machinskaya, R.

Altered task-related modulation of long-range connectivity in children with autism	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						dyspraxia; autism; connectivity; functional connectivity; EEG; task-related	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; IDEOMOTOR APRAXIA; EEG COHERENCE; SPECTRUM; OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR; DYSPRAXIA; ORGANIZATION	Functional connectivity differences between children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing children have been described in multiple datasets. However, few studies examine the task-related changes in connectivity in disorder-relevant behavioral paradigms. In this paper, we examined the task-related changes in functional connectivity using EEG and a movement-based paradigm that has behavioral relevance to ASD. Resting-state studies motivated our hypothesis that children with ASD would show a decreased magnitude of functional connectivity during the performance of a motor-control task. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, however, we observed that task-related modulation of functional connectivity in children with ASD was in the direction opposite to that of TDs. The task-related connectivity changes were correlated with clinical symptom scores. Our results suggest that children with ASD may have differences in cortical segregation/integration during the performance of a task, and that part of the differences in connectivity modulation may serve as a compensatory mechanism. Autism Res2018, 11: 245-257. (c) 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay SummaryDecreased connectivity between brain regions is thought to cause the symptoms of autism. Because most of our knowledge comes from data in which children are at rest, we do not know how connectivity changes directly lead to autistic behaviors, such as impaired gestures. When typically developing children produced complex movements, connectivity decreased between brain regions. In children with autism, connectivity increased. It may be that behavior-related changes in brain connectivity are more important than absolute differences in connectivity in autism.

Part I: Existence and Behavioral Relevance	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SLOW-POTENTIAL SHIFT; TEMPORAL PREPARATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; REACTION-TIME; STIMULUS; CNV; ENTRAINMENT	This letter makes scientific and methodological contributions. Scientifically, it demonstrates a new and behaviorally relevant effect of temporal expectation on the phase coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Methodologically, it introduces novel methods to characterize EEG recordings at the single-trial level. Expecting events in time can lead to more efficient behavior. A remarkable finding in the study of temporal expectation is the foreperiod effect on reaction time, that is, the influence on reaction time of the delay between a warning signal and a succeeding imperative stimulus to which subjects are instructed to respond as quickly as possible. Here we study a new foreperiod effect in an audiovisual attention-shifting oddball task in which attention-shift cues directed the attention of subjects to impendent deviant stimuli of a given modality and therefore acted as warning signals for these deviants. Standard stimuli, to which subjects did not respond, were interspersed between warning signals and deviants. We hypothesized that foreperiod durations modulated intertrial phase coherence (ITPC, the degree of phase alignment across multiple trials) evoked by behaviorally irrelevant standards and that these modulations are behaviorally meaningful. Using averaged data, we first observed that ITPC evoked by standards closer to the warning signal was significantly different from that evoked by standards further away from it, establishing a new foreperiod effect on ITPC evoked by standards. We call this effect the standard foreperiod (SFP) effect on ITPC. We reasoned that if the SFP influences ITPC evoked by standards, it should be possible to decode the former from the latter on a trial-by-trial basis. We were able to do so showing that this effect can be observed in single trials. We demonstrated the behavioral relevance of the SFP effect on ITPC by showing significant correlations between its strength and subjects' behavioral performance.

Hence, this research is aimed at exploring the brain network dynamics during a cognitive task. Specifically, we analyze the predictive capability of the pre-stimulus theta activity to ascertain the functional brain dynamics during cognition in both healthy and schizophrenia subjects. Firstly, EEG recordings were acquired during a three-tone oddball task from fifty-one healthy subjects and thirty-five schizophrenia patients. Secondly, phase-based coupling measures were used to generate the time-varying functional network for each subject. Finally, pre-stimulus network connections were iteratively modified according to different models of network reorganization. This adjustment was applied by minimizing the prediction error through recurrent iterations, following the predictive coding approach. Both controls and schizophrenia patients follow a reinforcement of the secondary neural pathways (i.e., pathways between cortical brain regions weakly connected during pre-stimulus) for most of the subjects, though the ratio of controls that exhibited this behavior was statistically significant higher than for patients. These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with an impaired ability to modify brain network configuration during cognition. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that the changes in phase-based brain network parameters from pre-stimulus to cognitive response in the theta band are closely related to the performance in important cognitive domains. Our findings not only contribute to the understanding of healthy brain dynamics, but also shed light on the altered predictive neuronal substrates in schizophrenia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One of the reasons for this shortcoming may be the lack of sophisticated signal processing methods. Complex cognitive phenomena usually involve various mental subprocesses whose temporal occurrence varies from trial to trial. Mostly, these mental subprocesses require large-scale integration processes between multiple brain areas that are most likely mediated by complex, non-linear phase coupling mechanisms. Consequently, a spatiotemporal analysis of complex, multivariate phase synchronization patterns on a single trial basis is necessary. New method: This paper introduces the HEURECA method (How to Evaluate and Uncover Recurring EEG Coupling Arrangements) that enables the dynamic detection of distinguishable multivariate functional connectivity states in the electroencephalogram. HEURECA adaptively divides a trial into segments of quasi-stable phase coupling topographies and assigns similar topographies to the same synchrostate cluster. Results: HEURECA is evaluated by means of simulated data. The results show that it reliably reconstructs a time series of recurring phase coupling topographies and successfully gathers them into clusters of interpretable neural synchrostates. The advantages and unique features of HEURECA are further illustrated by investigating the popular complex cognitive phenomenon insight. Comparison with existing methods: Unlike existing methods, HEURECA detects complex phase relationships between more than two signals and is applicable to single trials. Conclusions: Since HEURECA is applicable to all kinds of circular data, it not only provides new insights into insight, but also into a variety of other phenomena in neuroscience, physics or other scientific fields.

For example, oscillatory neural activity has been suggested to play a role in binding and in the maintenance of information in working memory. With respect to the latter, the majority of work has focused primarily on oscillations in terms of providing a "code" in working memory. However, oscillations may additionally play a fundamental role by enabling or facilitating essential properties and behaviors that neuronal networks must exhibit in order to produce functional working memory and the processes it supports, such as combining items in memory into bound objects or separating bound objects into distinct items. In the present work, we present a biologically plausible working memory model and demonstrate that specific types of stable oscillatory dynamics that arise may play critical roles in providing mechanisms for working memory and the cognitive functions that it supports. Specifically, these roles include (1) enabling a range of different types of binding, (2) both enabling and limiting capacities of bound and distinct items held active in working memory, and (3) facilitating transitions between active working memory states as required in cognitive function. Several key results arise within the examinations, such as the occurrence of different network capacities for working memory and binding, differences in processing times for transitions in working memory states, and the emergence of a combinatorially rich and complex range of oscillatory states that are sufficient to map onto a wide range of cognitive operations supported by working memory, such as variable binding, reasoning, and language. In particular, we show that these oscillatory states and their transitions can provide a specific instantiation of current established connectionist models in representing these functions. Finally, we further characterize the dependence of the relevant oscillatory solutions on certain critical parameters, including mutual inhibition and synaptic timescales.

Methods: Auditory P1-N2 responses and ITPCs in the theta band (4-7 Hz) for pure tones and words were assessed with EEG data from 15 school-age children with autism and 16 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls. Results: The autism group showed enhanced PI and reduced N2 for both speech and nonspeech stimuli in comparison with the TD group. Group differences were also found with enhanced theta ITPC for PI followed by ITPC reduction for N2 in the autism group. The ITPC values were significant predictors of PI and N2 amplitudes in both groups. Conclusions: Abnormal trial-to-trial phase synchrony plays an important role in AEP atypicalities in children with autism. ITPC-driven enhancement as well as attenuation in different AEP components may coexist, depending on the stage of information processing. Significance: It is necessary to examine the time course of auditory evoked potentials and the corresponding inter-trial coherence of neural oscillatory activities to better understand hyper- and hypo- sensitive responses in autism, which has important implications for sensory based treatment.

Its influence on mediotemporal regions and memory processes has not yet been thoroughly investigated. A recent study suggests that auditory beats are able to alter intracranial EEG (iEEG) power and phase synchronization. 5 Hz binaural beat stimulation increased temporo-lateral phase synchronization, while 5 Hz monaural beat stimulation decreased mediotemporal synchronization. Based on the relevance of phase synchronization for memory operations, we hypothesized that 5 Hz binaural beat stimulation enhances, while 5 Hz monaural beat stimulation decreases longterm memory performance. We analyzed data from presurgical epilepsy patients with implanted depth electrodes in the hippocampus and rhinal cortex. 5 Hz monaural and binaural beat vs. control stimulation was applied while patients performed an associative learning task involving item and source recognition. We evaluated behavioral effects for item (hits minus false alarms) and source memory (correct minus incorrect) and the impact of auditory beats on iEEG power, rhinal-hippocampal phase synchronization and inter-trial phase locking. A three-way repeated measures ANOVA (encoding/retrieval, item/source, monaural/binaural/control) revealed a main effect of stimulation (p = 0.03) and a linear effect in the expected direction: binaural > control > monaural (p = 0.036). Both monaural and binaural stimulation were associated with increased phase locking of 5 Hz oscillations within rhinal cortex. These phase locking increases, however, corresponded to reverse phase shifts. Our data suggest that binaural vs. monaural 5 Hz stimulation increases vs. decreases long-term memory performance. These behavioral effects appear to be related to reverse phase shifts within rhinal cortex.

J	Sasaka, Y; Ogawa, T; Haseyama, M				Sasaka, Yuma; Ogawa, Takahiro; Haseyama, Miki			A Novel Framework for Estimating Viewer Interest by Unsupervised Multimodal Anomaly Detection	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Viewer interest; unsupervised anomaly detection; facial expression; biological signals	VIDEO RECOMMENDATION; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RECOGNITION; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; OUTLIERS; EMOTION	A reliable method to estimate viewer interest is highly sought after for human-centered video information retrieval. A method that estimates viewer interest while users are watching Web videos is presented in this paper. The method uses a framework for anomaly detection based on collaborative use of facial expression and biological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies that have taken into account two actual mechanisms of the behavior of users while they are watching Web videos. First, whereas most Web videos garner very little attention, a small number attract millions of views. Therefore, a framework for anomaly detection is newly applied to facial expression and EEG in order to model the imbalanced distribution of popularity. Second, since the number of Web videos that are labeled by users as interesting/not interesting is generally too small to estimate viewer interest by a supervised approach, the proposed method utilizes parametric techniques for anomaly detection, which estimates viewer interest in an unsupervised way. Unlike some related studies for estimating viewer interest, our method takes into account actual mechanisms of the behavior of users while they are watching Web videos by utilizing parametric techniques for anomaly detection. Then viewer interest can be estimated on the basis of an anomaly score calculated from our proposed method. Consequently, successful estimation of viewer interest based on a framework for anomaly detection, via collaborative use of facial expression and biological signals, becomes feasible.

We compared EEG patterns of professional pianists and non-pianists, who either executed or imagined finger tapping movements of different complexity. Results show that the power in alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) rhythms decreases with the complexity of both performed and imagined movements. Motor expertise influenced alpha rhythm desynchronization in the motor execution task - in the group of pianists there were differences in alpha power decrease depending on the complexity of the performed movement. There was no such relationship among non-pianists. In the imagery task, there was a tendency toward an interaction of motor expertise and low and high alpha rhythm components. In the beta band, there was an interaction of frequency and area of the skull occurring in the movement execution condition - high and low beta rhythm components had different topography.

The semantic information conveyed by iconic gestures (e.g., a drinking gesture) can aid speech comprehension in adverse listening conditions. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we investigated the spatiotemporal neural oscillatory activity associated with gestural enhancement of degraded speech comprehension. Participants watched videos of an actress uttering clear or degraded speech, accompanied by a gesture or not and completed a cued-recall task after watching every video. When gestures semantically disambiguated degraded speech comprehension, an alpha and beta power suppression and a gamma power increase revealed engagement and active processing in the hand-area of the motor cortex, the extended language network (LIFG/pSTS/STG/MTG), medial temporal lobe, and occipital regions. These observed low- and high-frequency oscillatory modulations in these areas support general unification, integration and lexical access processes during online language comprehension, and simulation of and increased visual attention to manual gestures over time. All individual oscillatory power modulations associated with gestural enhancement of degraded speech comprehension predicted a listener's correct disambiguation of the degraded verb after watching the videos. Our results thus go beyond the previously proposed role of oscillatory dynamics in unimodal degraded speech comprehension and provide first evidence for the role of low- and high-frequency oscillations in predicting the integration of auditory and visual information at a semantic level.

At the moment, data on the differential functional significance of specific frontal central cerebral structures for cognitive processes associated with creative thinking have been collected, which provides a need for more precise spatial determination of the effect, possible with employment of sLORETA method. The goal of the present study was to investigate the topography of differences in spatial organization of reactivity of current source density estimates for theta frequency rhythm in young (N = 80, mean age 22.6 +/- 3 years) and elderly adults (N = 80, mean age 63.4 +/- 6.7 years). Time window 400-600 ms after task presentation, which corresponds to the initial forming of associations during divergent problem solving, was considered. Higher current source density estimates of theta rhythm in elderly subjects were shown in comparison with young, the most pronounced in precentral gyrus, posterior part of inferior frontal gyrus, insula in left hemisphere, anterior part of inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus in the right. We assumed that significance of the right fronto-temporal structures may be linked with forming remote semantic associations, while the frontal structures of the left hemisphere are related to the selection of information and the presetting for the actualization of unusual associations.

In particular, Alpha would inhibit irrelevant stimuli, and Theta underlies working memory and processing. The balance between them seems essential for the word recognition, therefore evaluating the listening effort experienced by hearing impaired patients appears worthy, since noise/distortions in a speech signal increase listening effort. Aim of the study was the estimation of the effort during word in noise recognition under different noise conditions, and along the task. Results showed an increase in the frontal Theta and parietal Alpha for a difficult (but not the most difficult) noise condition, and for Theta in correspondence of the stimulus. Additionally, frontal Theta activity increased along the task for the same difficult noise condition during and after the stimulus. This evaluation was preliminary for a neurofeedback application of the effort management by CI users, since it could affect performances and attitudes. Such assessment appears extremely worthy of investigation since the symbiotic interaction between cochlear implant devices and deaf patients for the decoding and processing of the incoming auditory signal.

Preclinical studies on neuronal impairments associated with progressive amyloidosis have demonstrated some A-dependent neuronal dysfunction including modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic signaling. The present work focuses on the early stage of disease progression and uses TgF344-AD rats that recapitulate a broad repertoire of AD-like pathologies to investigate the neuronal network functioning using simultaneous intracranial recordings from the hippocampus (HPC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), followed by pathological analyses of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor subunits alpha 1(,) alpha 5, and delta, and glutamic acid decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67). Concomitant to amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, low-gamma band power was strongly attenuated in the HPC and mPFC of TgF344-AD rats in comparison to those in non-transgenic littermates. In addition, the phase-amplitude coupling of the neuronal networks in both areas was impaired, evidenced by decreased modulation of theta band phase on gamma band amplitude in TgF344-AD animals. Finally, the gamma coherence between HPC and mPFC was attenuated as well. These results demonstrate significant neuronal network dysfunction at an early stage of AD-like pathology. This network dysfunction precedes the onset of cognitive deficits and is likely driven by A beta and tau pathologies.

Reliable automation of HFOs detection is necessary for rapid and objective analysis, and is determined by accurate computation of the baseline. Although most existing automated detectors measure baseline accurately in channels with rare HFOs, they lose accuracy in channels with frequent HFOs. Here, we proposed a novel algorithm using the maximum distributed peak points method to improve baseline determination accuracy in channels with wide HFOs activity ranges and calculate a dynamic baseline. Interictal ripples (80-200 Hz), fast ripples (FRs, 200-500 Hz) and baselines in intracerebral EEGs from seven patients with intractable epilepsy were identified by experienced reviewers and by our computer-automated program, and the results were compared. We also compared the performance of our detector to four well-known detectors integrated in RIPPLELAB. The sensitivity and specificity of our detector were, respectively, 71% and 75% for ripples and 66% and 84% for FRs. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient comparing automated and manual detection was 0.896 +/- 0.080 for ripples and 0.974 +/- 0.030 for FRs (p < 0.01). In comparison to other detectors, our detector had a relatively higher sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, our automated detector is able to accurately calculate a dynamic iEEG baseline in different HFO activity channels using the maximum distributed peak points method, resulting in higher sensitivity and specificity than other available HFO detectors.

Mokammel			Sensor Applications and Physiological Features in Drivers' Drowsiness Detection: A Review	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Review						Drowsiness; ECG; EEG; EOG; fatigue; GSR; sEMG; ST	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; SLOW EYE-MOVEMENTS; HEART-RATE; FATIGUE; SLEEPINESS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; VIGILANCE; ALGORITHM; FUSION	Drowsiness in drivers has become a serious cause of concern due to the occurrences of a large number of fatalities on the road each year. Lives of pedestrians and passengers are put to risk as drivers tend to fall asleep at the steering wheel. In the recent past, many researchers have paid attention to the problem of drowsiness detection since safe roads and safe driving are of paramount concern to all societies. This paper has led to the development of several novel and effective methods in detecting drivers' drowsiness. These include: 1) Vehicle based methods; 2) Behavioral methods; and 3) Physiological methods. Since wake-sleep is an intermediate state between two physiologically dissimilar states, physiological signals can define this transition more accurately when compared with approaches that fall in other categories. This paper focuses on the role of physiological signals in detecting driver's drowsiness level. The proposed methods measure the physiological signals by means of various sensors, which monitor the driver's physiological parameters on a continual basis. Multiple sensors can be embedded on the driver or in the vicinity of the driver to capture vital signs indicating the onset of drowsiness. The aim here is to provide an insightful review of all such key approaches that fall in this category. This paper conducts a detailed study in which key physiological parameters that relate to drowsiness are identified, described, and analyzed. Furthermore, the overall advantages and limitations of these physiological based schemes are also highlighted.

A fundamental property of PSI is that of vanishing for linear mixing of independent neural sources. This property allows PSI to cope with the artificial instantaneous connectivity among MEG sensors or brain sources induced by the field spread. Nevertheless, PSI is limited by being a bivariate estimator of directionality as opposite to the multidimensional nature of brain activity as revealed by MEG. The purpose of this work is to provide a multivariate generalization of PSI. We termed this measure as the multivariate phase slope index (MPSI). In order to test the ability of MPSI in estimating the directionality, and to compare the MPSI results to those obtained by bivariate PSI approaches based on maximizing imaginary part of coherency and on canonical correlation analysis, we used extensive simulations. We proved that MPSI achieves the highest performance and that in a large number of simulated cases, the bivariate methods, as opposed to MPSI, do not detect a statistically significant directionality. Finally, we applied MPSI to assess seed-based directed functional connectivity in the alpha band from resting state MEG data of 61 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The obtained results highlight a directed functional coupling in the alpha band between the primary visual cortex and several key regions of well-known resting state networks, e.g. dorsal attention network and fronto-parietal network.

Growing evidence supports a clinical efficacy of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) in drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). ctDCS effects can be merely attributed to the inhibition of cortical excitability, which is abnormally increased in epilepsy, but its effect on brain network of DRE patients has never been reported. We aimed at exploring the hypothesis that functional connectivity (FC) changes may explain part of ctDCS clinical effects in DRE patients. We assessed the ctDCS-induced changes of electroencephalography-derived brain FC of a group of six temporal lobe DRE patients receiving a seizure reduction after ctDCS. By a single-subject eLORETA analysis, we compared the FC among the EF region and other nine bilateral macro-regions, before and after Real and Sham ctDCS in a double-blind Sham-controlled crossover design. FC changed after Real ctDCS in all patients despite no appreciable changes occurred after Sham. Most of FC changes (73%) involved the EF region. The epileptic seizure reduction correlated with the increase of the EF FC, in the whole frequency band and in the theta band. This small-sample analysis clearly revealed that ctDCS induced FC changes in the brain network of temporal lobe DRE patients. Our data support the hypothesis that FC changes may contribute to explain the effects of ctDCS in epilepsy, offering a new scenario in the personalization of neuromodulation interventions in epileptic people.

Hyperoxia enhances slow-wave forebrain states in urethane-anesthetized an naturally sleeping rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; VENTILATION; MODULATION; HYPOXIA; OXYGEN; CONSEQUENCES; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; ANESTHESIA; AROUSAL	Oxygen (O-2) is a crucial element for physiological functioning in mammals. In particular. brain function is critically dependent on a minimum amount of circulating blood levels of O-2 and both immediate and lasting neural dysfunction can result following anoxic or hypoxic episodes. Although the effects of deficiencies in O-2 levels on the brain have been reasonably well studied. less is known about the influence of elevated levels of O-2 (hyperoxia) in inspired gas under atmospheric pressure. This is of importance due to its typical use in surgical anesthesia, in the treatment of stroke and traumatic brain injury, and even in its recreational or alternative therapeutic use. Using local field potential (EEG) recordings in spontaneously breathing urethane-anesthetized and naturally sleeping rats, we characterized the influence of different levels of O-2 in inspired gases on brain states. While rats were under urethane anesthesia, administration of 100% O-2 elicited a significant and reversible increase in time spent in the deactivated (i.e., slow-wave) state, with concomitant decreases in both heartbeat and respiration rates. Increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide (to 5%) in inspired gas produced the opposite result on EEG states, mainly a decrease in the time spent in the deactivated state. Consistent with this, decreasing concentrations of O-2 (to 15%) in inspired gases decreased time spent in the deactivated state. Further confirmation of the hyperoxic effect was found in naturally sleeping animals where it similarly increased time spent in slow-wave (nonrapid eye movement) states. Thus alterations of O-2 in inspired air appear to directly affect forebrain EEG states, which has implications for brain function, as well as for the regulation of brain states and levels of forebrain arousal during sleep in both normal and pathological conditions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that alterations of oxygen concentration in inspired air biases forebrain EEG state. Hyperoxia increases the prevalence of slow-wave states. Hypoxia and hypercapnia appear to do the opposite. This suggests that oxidative metabolism is an important stimulant for brain state.

This may be due to phenotypic heterogeneity among patients as well as the limited sample sizes utilized. Here we present our results of alpha wave profile analysis based on a sample larger than most of those in the field, performed using a robust processing pipeline. Methods: We compared the alpha waves profiles at rest in children with ASD to those of age-, sex-, and IQ-matched control individuals. We used linear regression and non-parametric normative models using age as covariate forparsing the clinical heterogeneity. We explored the correlation between EEG profiles and the patient's brain volumes, obtained from structural MRI. We automatized the detection of the alpha peak and visually quality controled our MRI measurements. We assessed the robustness of our results by running the EEG preprocessing with two different versions of Matlab as well as Python. Results: A simple linear regression between peak power or frequency of the alpha waves and the status or age of the participants did not allow to identify any statistically significant relationship. The non-parametric normative model (which took account the non-linear effect of age on the alpha profiles) suggested that participants with ASD displayed more variability than control participants for both frequency and amplitude of the alpha peak (p < 0.05). Independent of the status of the individual, we also observed weak associations (uncorrected p < 0.05) between the alpha frequency, and the volumes of several cortical and subcortical structures (in particular the striatum), but which did not survive correction for multiple testing and changed between analysis pelines. Discussions: Our study did not find evidence for abnormal alpha wave profiles in ASD. We propose, however, an analysis pipeline to perform standardized and automatized EEG analyses on large cohorts. These should help the community to address the challenge of clinical heterogeneity of ASD and to tackle the problems of reproducibility.

The research reported in this paper is based on methodological approaches used to quantify the dynamical fluctuations of neurophysiological systems. We use time-frequency representation techniques including spatial coupling and spatial wavelet phase coherence to analyze the dynamics of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in different frequency bands in the form of topographic maps. The distribution of power in different frequency bands is computed. The findings indicated that the power in delta frequency band is mainly distributed in prefrontal and occipital regions, whereas, power in theta band is distributed in fronto-occipital regions. The power in alpha band is distributed in posterior and extended to anterior, power in beta band in posterior and prefrontal regions and gamma band power is dominant in prefrontal and occipital regions. All the frequency bands are involved in different activities in one way or other, however alpha band power revealed dominant anterior-posterior activity where the eye-closed (EC) coherence is higher than eye open (EO) coherence. The phase-phase CFC on multichannel EEG signals with EC and EO during resting state is also computed to investigate which brain regions are affected by phase modulation of low frequency bands. Coupling in different frequency bands is estimated using dynamic Bayesian inference approach. This approach can detect the phase connectivity within a network of time varying coupled oscillator subject to the noise. The self, direct, and common coupling scheme showed strong coupling in delta-alpha to alpha (delta, alpha -> alpha) and theta-alpha to alpha (theta, alpha -> alpha) bands. However, moderate couplings are found in theta-gamma to gamma (theta, gamma -> gamma), alpha-gamma to gamma (alpha, gamma -> gamma), and delta-gamma to gamma delta, gamma -> gamma) bands.

Acute Effects of Instructed and Self-Created Variable Rope Skipping on EEG Brain Activity and Heart Rate Variability	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; learning method; physical activity; acute effects; HRV; recovery; differential learning	FRONTAL-MIDLINE-THETA; ACUTE RESISTANCE EXERCISE; MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS; CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; TASK	The influence of physical activity on brain and heart activity dependent on type and intensity of exercise is meanwhile widely accepted. Mainly cyclic exercises with longer duration formed the basis for showing the influence on either central nervous system or on heart metabolism. Effects of the variability of movement sequences on brain and heart have been studied only sparsely so far. This study investigated effects of three different motor learning approaches combined with a single bout of rope skipping exercises on the spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity, heart rate variability (HRV) and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Participants performed repetitive learning (RL) and two extremely variable rope skipping schedules according to the differential learning approach. Thereby one bout was characterized by instructed variable learning (DLi) and the other by self-created variable learning (DLc) in randomized order each on three consecutive days. The results show higher RPE after DLi and DLc than after RL. HRV analysis demonstrates significant changes in pro post exercise comparison in all training approaches. No statistically significant differences between training schedules were identified. Slightly greater changes in HRV parameters were observed in both DL approaches indicating a higher activation of the sympathetic nervous system. EEG data reveals higher parietal alphal and temporal alpha2 power in RL compared to both DL schedules immediately post exercise. During the recovery of up to 30 min, RL shows higher temporal and occipital theta, temporal, parietal and occipital alpha, temporal and occipital beta and frontal beta3 power. In conclusion, already a single bout of 3 min of rope skipping can lead to brain states that are associated with being advantageous for cognitive learning. Combined with additional, cognitively demanding tasks in form of the DL approach, it seems to lead to an overload of the mental capacity, at least on the short term. Further research should fathom the reciprocal influence of cardiac and central-nervous strain in greater detail.

CAN represents the integrated functioning and interaction between the central nervous system (CNS) and ANS (parasympathetic and sympathetic activity). Objective: This study investigates the central cardiovascular network (CCVN) as a part of the CAN, during which heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SYS) and frontal EEG activity in 21 healthy subjects (CON) will be analysed. The objective of this study is to determine how these couplings (central-cardiovascular) are composed by the different regulatory aspects of the CNS-ANS interaction. Methods: To quantify the short-term instantaneous causal couplings within the CCVN, the normalized short time partial directed coherence (NSTPDC) approach was applied. It is based on an m-dimensional MAR process to determine Granger causality in the frequency domain. Results: We found that CCVN were of bidirectional character, and that the causal influences of central activity towards HR were stronger than those towards systolic blood pressure. This suggests that the central-cardiac closed-loop regulation process in CON focuses mainly on adapting the heart rate via the sinoatrial node rather than focusing on SYS. The CNS-ANS coupling directions with respect to central spectral power bands were characterized as mostly bidirectional, where HR and SYS acted as drivers in nearly every frequency band (unidirectional for alpha, alpha 1 and alpha 2 ). Conclusion: This study provides a more indepth understanding of the interplay of neuronal and autonomic cardiovascular regulatory processes in healthy subjects, as well as a greater insight into the complex CAN.

Functionally separated networks for self-paced and externally-cued motor execution in Parkinson's disease: Evidence from deep brain recordings in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BETA OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; MOVEMENT; CIRCUITS; ORGANIZATION; PARALLEL	Spatially segregated cortico-basal ganglia networks have been proposed for the control of goal-directed and habitual behavior. In Parkinson's disease, selective loss of dopaminergic neurons regulating sensorimotor (habitual) behavior might therefore predominantly cause deficits in habitual motor control, whereas control of goal-directed movement is relatively preserved. Following this hypothesis, we examined the electrophysiology of cortico-basal ganglia networks in Parkinson patients emulating habitual and goal-directed motor control during self-paced and externally-cued finger tapping, respectively, while simultaneously recording local field potentials in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and surface EEG. Only externally-cued movements induced a pro-kinetic event-related beta-desynchronization, whereas beta-oscillations were continuously suppressed during self-paced movements. Connectivity analysis revealed higher synchronicity (phase-locking value) between the STN and central electrodes during self-paced and higher STN to frontal phase-locking during externally-cued movements. Our data provide direct electrophysiological support for the existence of functionally segregated cortico-basal ganglia networks controlling motor behavior in Parkinson patients, and corroborate the assumption of Parkinson patients being shifted from habitual towards goal-directed behavior.

However, its role in language comprehension is currently under debate. In this magnetoencephalography study we aimed to find evidence of word-form phonological pre-activation and to characterize the oscillatory mechanisms supporting this. Participants were presented firstly with a picture of an object, and then, after a delay (fixed or variable), they heard the corresponding word. Target words could contain a phoneme substitution, and participants' task was to detect mispronunciations. Word-initial phonemes were either fricatives or plosives, generating two experimental conditions (expect-fricative and expectplosive). In the pre-word interval, significant differences (alpha = 0.05) emerged between conditions both for fixed and variable delays. Source reconstruction of this effect showed a brain-wide network involving several frequency bands, including bilateral superior temporal areas commonly associated with phonological processing, in a theta range. These results show that phonological representations supported by the theta band may be active before word onset, even under temporal uncertainty. However, in the evoked response just prior to the word, differences between conditions were apparent under variable- but not fixed-delays. This suggests that additional top-down mechanisms sensitive to phonological form may be recruited when there is uncertainty in the signal.

BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Working Memory; Retro-cue; Selective attention; Inhibition; Oscillations; Irrelevant information	MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS; ORIENTING ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; LOAD	Selective attention can enhance Working Memory (WM) performance by selecting relevant information, while preventing distracting items from encoding or from further maintenance. Alpha oscillatory modulations are a correlate of visuospatial attention. Specifically, an enhancement of alpha power is observed in the ipsilateral posterior cortex to the locus of attention, along with a suppression in the contralateral hemisphere. An influential model proposes that the alpha enhancement is functionally related to the suppression of information. However, whether ipsilateral alpha power represents a mechanism through which no longer relevant WM representations are inhibited has yet not been explored. Here we examined whether the amount of distractors to be suppressed during WM maintenance is functionally related to alpha power lateralized activity. We measure EEG activity while participants (N=36) performed a retro-cue task in which the WM load was varied across the relevant/ irrelevant post-cue hemifield. We found that alpha activity was lateralized respect to the locus of attention, but did not track post-cue irrelevant load. Additionally, non-lateralized alpha activity increased with post-cue relevant load. We propose that alpha lateralization associated to retro-cuing might be related to a general orienting mechanism toward relevant representation.

So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we present an IoT-Based e-learning testbed. We carried out some experiments considering meditation parameter with a student of our laboratory. We used Mind Wave Mobile (MWM) to get the data and considered four situations: Playing Game, Watching Movie, Listening Music and Reading Book. The evaluation results show that our testbed can judge the student situation by meditation parameter.

It has been identified as an important factor in the progression of cerebral damage associated with stroke or traumatic brain injury. We analysed local field potential signals during CSD in old and young rats to look for age-related differences. We compared CSDs elicited under physiological conditions (baseline), during ischaemia and during reperfusion. We applied short-time Fourier transform and a windowed implementation of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to follow the electrophysiological signature of CSD. Both in the time-dependent spectral profiles and in the multifractal spectrum width, CSDs appeared as transient dips, which we described on the basis of their duration, depression and recovery slope and degree of drop and rise. The most significant age-related difference we found was in the depression slope, which was significantly more negative in the beta band and less negative in the delta band of old animals. In several parameters, we observed an attenuation-regeneration pattern in reaction to ischaemia and reperfusion, which was absent in the old age group. The age-related deviation from the pattern took two forms: the rise parameter did not show any attenuation in ischaemic conditions for old animals, whilst the depression slope in most frequency bands remained attenuated during reperfusion and did not regenerate in this age group. Though the multifractal spectrum width proved to be a reliable indicator of events like CSDs or ischaemia onset, we failed to find any case where it would add extra detail to the information provided by the Fourier description.

More specifically, we analyze the power-performance behavior of an evolutionary parallel multiobjective electroencephalogram feature selection procedure that evolves subpopulations of solutions with time-demanding fitness evaluation. The procedure has been implemented in OpenMP to dynamically distribute either subpopulations or individuals among devices, and uses OpenCL to evaluate the fitness of the individuals. The development of parallel codes usually implies to maximize the code efficiency, thus optimizing the achieved speedups. To follow the same trend, this article extends and provides a more complete analysis of our previous works about the power-performance characteristics in heterogeneous CPU-GPU platforms considering different operation frequencies and evolutionary parameters, such as distribution of individuals, etc. This way, different experimental configurations of the proposed procedure have been evaluated and compared with respect to a master-worker approach, not only in runtime but also considering energy consumption. The experimental results show that lower operating frequencies does not necessarily mean lower energy consumptions since energy is the product of power and time. Thus, we have observed that parallel processing not only reduces the runtime, but also the energy consumed by the application despite a higher instantaneous power. Particularly, the workload distribution among both CPU and GPU cores provides the best runtime and very low energy consumption compared with the values achieved by the same alternatives executed by only CPU threads.

The authors tested this hypothesis by recording 64-channel electroencephalography while participants synchronized with an auditory metronome. We systematically introduced positive and negative phase-shift perturbations that were either liminal (10%) and subliminal (3%). We used a distributed source modeling approach to evaluate oscillatory activity and connectivity of discrete cortical sources. Three key findings support our hypothesis. First was a theta band response indicative of error detection and top-down control observed in frontomedial presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and anterior cingulate for liminal positive perturbations. Second was an increase in theta band coupling between the SMA and contralateral motor cortex exclusively for positive perturbations suggesting a top-down modulation of motor parameters. Third, when compared with other conditions, liminal positive perturbations result in an increase in postmovement beta rebound within contralateral primary motor cortex. The authors propose that frontomedial motor areas exert a top-down inhibitory influence over the primary motor cortex to effectively lengthen tap intervals in response to lengthening tap-tone asynchronies.

However, sleep scoring cannot currently be performed with brain signals alone, despite the deep neuromodulatory transformations that accompany sleep state changes. Therefore, at heart, the operational distinction between sleep and wake is that of immobility and movement, despite numerous situations in which this one-to-one mapping fails. Here we demonstrate, using local field potential (LFP) recordings in freely moving mice, that gamma (50-70 Hz) power in the olfactory bulb (OB) allows for clear classification of sleep and wake, thus providing a brain-based criterion to distinguish these two vigilance states without relying on motor activity. Coupled with hippocampal theta activity, it allows the elaboration of a sleep scoring algorithm that relies on brain activity alone. This method reaches over 90% homology with classical methods based on muscular activity (electromyography [EMG]) and video tracking. Moreover, contrary to EMG, OB gamma power allows correct discrimination between sleep and immobility in ambiguous situations such as fear-related freezing. We use the instantaneous power of hippocampal theta oscillation and OB gamma oscillation to construct a 2D phase space that is highly robust throughout time, across individual mice and mouse strains, and under classical drug treatment. Dynamic analysis of trajectories within this space yields a novel characterisation of sleep/wake transitions: whereas waking up is a fast and direct transition that can be modelled by a ballistic trajectory, falling asleep is best described as a stochastic and gradual state change. Finally, we demonstrate that OB oscillations also allow us to track other vigilance states. Non-REM (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep can be distinguished with high accuracy based on beta (10-15 Hz) power. More importantly, we show that depth of anaesthesia can be tracked in real time using OB gamma power. Indeed, the gamma power predicts and anticipates the motor response to stimulation both in the steady state under constant anaesthetic and dynamically during the recovery period. Altogether, this methodology opens the avenue for multi-timescale characterisation of brain states and provides an unprecedented window onto levels of vigilance.

While initial results of alpha entrainment are promising, questions remain regarding its translational potential-namely if tACS alpha entrainment is sufficiently robust to context and to what extent it can be upscaled to multi-electrode arrangements needed to direct currents into precise brain loci. We set out to explore these questions by administering alternating current through a multi-electrode montage (mtACS), while varying background task. A multi-electrode analog of previously employed anterior/posterior stimulation failed to replicate the reported alpha entrainment, suggesting that further work is required to understand the scope of applicability of tACS alpha entrainment.

To properly analyze such data and extract clinical knowledge, noise components must be removed or alleviated. In this paper a pre-processing and subsequent sleep staging pipeline for the sleep analysis of electroencephalographic signals is described. Two novel methods of functional connectivity estimation (Synchronization Likelihood/SL and Relative Wavelet Entropy/RWE) are comparatively investigated for automatic sleep staging through manually pre-processed electroencephalographic recordings. A multi-step process that renders signals suitable for further analysis is initially described. Then, two methods that rely on extracting synchronization features from electroencephalographic recordings to achieve computerized sleep staging are proposed, based on bivariate features which provide a functional overview of the brain network, contrary to most proposed methods that rely on extracting univariate time and frequency features. Annotation of sleep epochs is achieved through the presented feature extraction methods by training classifiers, which are in turn able to accurately classify new epochs. Analysis of data from sleep experiments on a randomized, controlled bed-rest study, which was organized by the European Space Agency and was conducted in the "ENVIHAB" facility of the Institute of Aerospace Medicine at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne, Germany attains high accuracy rates, over 90% based on ground truth that resulted from manual sleep staging by two experienced sleep experts. Therefore, it can be concluded that the above feature extraction methods are suitable for semi-automatic sleep staging.

It has not been possible, however, to differentiate physiological from pathological HFOs, and baseline rates of HFO occurrence vary substantially across brain regions. This project establishes region-specific normative values for physiological HFOs and high-frequency activity (HFA). MethodsIntracerebral stereo-encephalographic recordings with channels displaying normal physiological activity from nonlesional tissue were selected from 2 tertiary epilepsy centers. Twenty-minute sections from N2/N3 sleep were selected for automatic detection of ripples (80-250Hz), fast ripples (>250Hz), and HFA defined as long-lasting activity > 80Hz. Normative values are provided for 17 brain regions. ResultsA total of 1,171 bipolar channels with normal physiological activity from 71 patients were analyzed. The highest rates of ripples were recorded in the occipital cortex, medial and basal temporal region, transverse temporal gyrus and planum temporale, pre- and postcentral gyri, and medial parietal lobe. The mean rate of fast ripples was very low (0.038/min). Only 5% of channels had a rate > 0.2/min HFA was observed in the medial occipital lobe, pre- and postcentral gyri, transverse temporal gyri and planum temporale, and lateral occipital lobe. InterpretationThis multicenter atlas is the first to provide region-specific normative values for physiological HFO rates and HFA in common stereotactic space; rates above these can now be considered pathological. Physiological ripples are frequent in eloquent cortex. In contrast, physiological fast ripples are very rare, making fast ripples a good candidate for defining the epileptogenic zone.

J	Gratton, G				Gratton, Gabriele			Brain reflections: A circuit-based framework for understanding information processing and cognitive control	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha; beta; gamma; theta rhythms; cognitive control; ERPs; information processing; oscillatory brain activity	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; VISUAL MEMORY; EEG-ALPHA; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS	Here, I propose a view of the architecture of the human information processing system, and of how it can be adapted to changing task demands (which is the hallmark of cognitive control). This view is informed by an interpretation of brain activity as reflecting the excitability level of neural representations, encoding not only stimuli and temporal contexts, but also action plans and task goals. The proposed cognitive architecture includes three types of circuits: open circuits, involved in feed-forward processing such as that connecting stimuli with responses and characterized by brief, transient brain activity; and two types of closed circuits, positive feedback circuits (characterized by sustained, high-frequency oscillatory activity), which help select and maintain representations, and negative feedback circuits (characterized by brief, low-frequency oscillatory bursts), which are instead associated with changes in representations. Feed-forward activity is primarily responsible for the spread of activation along the information processing system. Oscillatory activity, instead, controls this spread. Sustained oscillatory activity due to both local cortical circuits (gamma) and longer corticothalamic circuits (alpha and beta) allows for the selection of individuated representations. Through the interaction of these circuits, it also allows for the preservation of representations across different temporal spans (sensory and working memory) and their spread across the brain. In contrast, brief bursts of oscillatory activity, generated by novel and/or conflicting information, lead to the interruption of sustained oscillatory activity and promote the generation of new representations. I discuss how this framework can account for a number of psychological and behavioral phenomena.

Ictal and preictal power changes outside of the seizure focus correlate with seizure generalization	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						epileptogenesis; epileptogenic zone; intracranial EEG; partial seizure; temporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; NETWORK ACTIVITY; PREDICTION; TRANSITION; GENERATION; SYNCHRONY; PATTERNS	ObjectiveThe treatment of focal epilepsies is largely predicated on the concept that there is a focus from which the seizure emanates. Yet, the physiological context that determines if and how ictal activity starts and propagates remains poorly understood. To delineate these phenomena more completely, we studied activity outside the seizure-onset zone prior to and during seizure initiation. MethodsStereotactic depth electrodes were implanted in 17 patients with longstanding pharmacoresistant epilepsy for lateralization and localization of the seizure-onset zone. Only seizures with focal onset in mesial temporal structures were used for analysis. Spectral analyses were used to quantify changes in delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high gamma frequency power, in regions inside and outside the area of seizure onset during both preictal and seizure initiation periods. ResultsIn the 78 seizures examined, an average of 9.26% of the electrode contacts outside of the seizure focus demonstrated changes in power at seizure onset. Of interest, seizures that were secondarily generalized, on average, showed power changes in a greater number of extrafocus electrode contacts at seizure onset (16.7%) compared to seizures that remained focal (3.8%). The majority of these extrafocus changes occupied the delta and theta bands in electrodes placed in the ipsilateral, lateral temporal lobe. Preictally, we observed extrafocal high-frequency power decrements, which also correlated with seizure spread. SignificanceThis widespread activity at and prior to the seizure-onset time further extends the notion of the ictogenic focus and its relationship to seizure spread. Further understanding of these extrafocus, periictal changes might help identify the neuronal dynamics underlying the initiation of seizures and how therapies can be devised to control seizure activity.

Theta-band Oscillations in the Middle Temporal Gyrus Reflect Novel Word Consolidation	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SEMANTIC MEMORY NETWORKS; LEXICAL CONSOLIDATION; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; SPOKEN WORDS; BRAIN; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; COMPETITION; LANGUAGE; ACQUISITION	Like many other types of memory formation, novel word learning benefits from an offline consolidation period after the initial encoding phase. A previous EEG study has shown that retrieval of novel words elicited more word-like-induced electrophysiological brain activity in the theta band after consolidation [Bakker, I., Takashima, A., van Hell, J. G., Janzen, G., & McQueen, J. M. Changes in theta and beta oscillations as signatures of novel word consolidation. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 27, 1286-1297, 2015]. This suggests that theta-band oscillations play a role in lexicalization, but it has not been demonstrated that this effect is directly caused by the formation of lexical representations. This study used magnetoencephalography to localize the theta consolidation effect to the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), a region known to be involved in lexical storage. Both untrained novel words and words learned immediately before test elicited lower theta power during retrieval than existing words in this region. After a 24-hr consolidation period, the difference between novel and existing words decreased significantly, most strongly in the left pMTG. The magnitude of the decrease after consolidation correlated with an increase in behavioral competition effects between novel words and existing words with similar spelling, reflecting functional integration into the mental lexicon. These results thus provide new evidence that consolidation aids the development of lexical representations mediated by the left pMTG. Theta synchronization may enable lexical access by facilitating the simultaneous activation of distributed semantic, phonological, and orthographic representations that are bound together in the pMTG.

Previous studies demonstrated that L-DOPA decreases the beta-band (13-30 Hz) oscillations with improvement of motor symptoms. However, it has not been elucidated whether patients with Parkinson's disease are able to control the beta-band oscillation voluntarily. Here, we hypothesized that neurofeedback training to control the beta-band power in the STN induces plastic changes in the STN of individuals with Parkinson's disease. We recorded the signals from STN deep-brain stimulation electrodes during operations to replace implantable pulse generators in eight human patients (3 male) with bilateral electrodes. Four patients were induced to decrease the beta-band power during the feedback training (down-training condition), whereas the other patients were induced to increase (up-training condition). All patients were blinded to their assigned condition. Adjacent contacts that showed the highest beta-band power were selected for the feedback. During the 10 min training, patients were shown a circle whose diameter was controlled by the beta-band power of the selected contacts. Powers in the beta-band during 5 min resting sessions recorded before and after the feedback were compared. In the down-training condition, the beta-band power of the selected contacts decreased significantly after feedback in all four patients (p < 0.05). In contrast, the beta-band power significantly increased after feedback in two of four patients in the up-training condition. Overall, the patients could voluntarily control the beta-band power in STN in the instructed direction (p < 0.05) through neurofeedback.

The aim was to assess whether social anhedonia and spontaneous gamma band oscillations could be used as multivariate/composite endophenotypic measures for SZ. MethodsSixty consented subjects, of which 20 remitted SZ patients, 20 unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia (US) and 20 healthy controls (HC) were recruited for the study. The Revised Social Anhedonia Scale, Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire assessed social anhedonia, temporal experience of pleasure and schizotypal features. All participants underwent awake, resting state 192-channel dense array electroencephalographic recording. Gamma spectral power and coherence were calculated. We performed chi-square test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearsons correlation coefficient and step-by-step linear discriminant functional analysis. ResultsSocial anhedonia was significantly higher and anticipatory aspects of pleasure were significantly lower in both SZ and US compared with HC. US scored significantly higher than HC in the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. Spectral power of high gamma band (>70Hz) was significantly lower over the right temporo-parietal and midline regions in both SZ and US than HC. We accurately classified (85%) three groups when social anhedonia, high gamma band spectral power of midline, right frontal and right fronto-temporal interhemispheric gamma coherence were considered as composite measures rather than each variable representing independently. ConclusionWe propose region-specific high gamma spectral power and coherence' and social anhedonia as composite/multivariate measures could be a useful measure in distinguishing schizophrenia patients and unaffected siblings from healthy controls.

Characterizing synchrony patterns across cognitive task stages of associative recognition memory	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						associative recognition memory; cognitive functions; connectivity; EEG; hidden semi-Markov models; neural oscillations	HUMAN WORKING-MEMORY; RECALL-TO-REJECT; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; PROCESSING STAGES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DATA; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; INTEGRATED THEORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; THETA; OSCILLATIONS	Numerous studies seek to understand the role of oscillatory synchronization in cognition. This problem is particularly challenging in the context of complex cognitive behavior, which consists of a sequence of processing steps with uncertain duration. In this study, we analyzed oscillatory connectivity measures in time windows that previous computational models had associated with a specific sequence of processing steps in an associative memory recognition task (visual encoding, familiarity, memory retrieval, decision making, and motor response). The timing of these processing steps was estimated on a single-trial basis with a novel hidden semi-Markov model multivariate pattern analysis (HSMM-MVPA) method. We show that different processing stages are associated with specific patterns of oscillatory connectivity. Visual encoding is characterized by a dense network connecting frontal, posterior, and temporal areas as well as frontal and occipital phase locking in the 4-9 Hz theta band. Familiarity is associated with frontal phase locking in the 9-14 Hz alpha band. Decision making is associated with frontal and temporo-central interhemispheric connections in the alpha band. During decision making, a second network in the theta band that connects left-temporal, central, and occipital areas bears similarity to the neural signature for preparing a motor response. A similar theta band network is also present during the motor response, with additionally alpha band connectivity between right-temporal and posterior areas. This demonstrates that the processing stages discovered with the HSMM-MVPA method are indeed linked to distinct synchronization patterns, leading to a closer understanding of the functional role of oscillations in cognition.

While the functional relevance of neural oscillations has been largely investigated, both the nature and the role of scale-free dynamics in brain processing have been disputed. New method: Here, we offer a novel method to rigorously enrich the characterization of scale-free brain activity using a robust wavelet-based assessment of self-similarity and multifractality. For this, we analyzed human brain activity recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants were at rest or performing a visual motion discrimination task. Results: First, we report consistent infraslow (from 0.1 to 1.5 Hz) scale-free dynamics (i.e., self-similarity and multifractality) in resting-state and task data. Second, we observed a fronto-occipital gradient of self-similarity reminiscent of the known hierarchy of temporal scales from sensory to higher-order cortices; the anatomical gradient was more pronounced in task than in rest. Third, we observed a significant increase of multifractality during task as compared to rest. Additionally, the decrease in self-similarity and the increase in multifractality from rest to task were negatively correlated in regions involved in the task, suggesting a shift from structured global temporal dynamics in resting-state to locally bursty and non Gaussian scale-free structures during task. Comparison with existing method(s): We showed that the wavelet leader based multifractal approach extends power spectrum estimation methods in the way of characterizing finely scale-free brain dynamics. Conclusions: Altogether, our approach provides novel fine-grained characterizations of scale-free dynamics in human brain activity.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive technique to record such neuronal activity due to excellent temporal and fair amount of spatial resolution. Single channel, connectivity as well as brain network analysis using MEG data in resting state and task-based experiments were analyzed from existing literature. Single channel analysis studies reported a less complex, more regular and predictable oscillations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily in the left parietal, temporal and occipital regions. Investigations on both functional connectivity (FC) and effective (EC) connectivity analysis demonstrated a loss of connectivity in AD compared to healthy control (HC) subjects found in higher frequency bands. It has been reported from multiplex network of MEG study in AD in the affected regions of hippocampus, posterior default mode network (DMN) and occipital areas, however, conclusions cannot be drawn due to limited availability of clinical literature. Potential utilization of high spatial resolution in MEG likely to provide information related to in-depth brain functioning and underlying factors responsible for changes in neuronal waves in AD. This review is a comprehensive report to investigate diagnostic biomarkers for AD may be identified by from MEG data. It is also important to note that MEG data can also be utilized for the same pursuit in combination with other imaging modalities.

In most cases they are appropriate, but sometimes unconventional measures, more suited for specific objects, are needed to perform the task. In our present work, we propose three new complexity measures to quantify complexity of topographic closed loops of alpha carrier frequency phase potentials (CFPP) of healthy humans in wake and drowsy states. EEG of ten adult individuals was recorded in both states, using a 14-channel montage. For each subject and each state, a topographic loop (circular directed graph) was constructed according to CFPP values. Circular complexity measure was obtained by summing angles which directed graph edges (arrows) form with the topographic center. Longitudinal complexity was defined as the sum of all arrow lengths, while intersecting complexity was introduced by counting the number of intersections of graph edges. Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test was used on the sets of these three measures, as well as on fractal dimension values of some loop properties, to test differences between loops obtained in wake vs. drowsy. While fractal dimension values were not significantly different, longitudinal and intersecting complexities, as well as anticlockwise circularity, were significantly increased in drowsy.

Electrophysiological dynamics of Chinese phonology during visual word recognition in Chinese-English bilinguals	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TIME-COURSE; UNCONSCIOUS TRANSLATION; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; SEMANTIC ACTIVATION; REPETITION; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; EEG; ERP; POTENTIALS	Silent word reading leads to the activation of orthographic (spelling), semantic (meaning), as well as phonological (sound) information. For bilinguals, native language information can also be activated automatically when they read words in their second language. For example, when Chinese-English bilinguals read words in their second language (English), the phonology of the Chinese translations is automatically activated. Chinese phonology, however, consists of consonants and vowels (segmental) and tonal information. To what extent these two aspects of Chinese phonology are activated is yet unclear. Here, we used behavioural measures, event-related potentials and oscillatory EEG to investigate Chinese segmental and tonal activation during word recognition. Evidence of Chinese segmental activation was found when bilinguals read English words (faster responses, reduced N400, gamma-band power reduction) and when they read Chinese words (increased LPC, gamma-band power reduction). In contrast, evidence for Chinese tonal activation was only found when bilinguals read Chinese words (gamma-band power increase). Together, our converging behavioural and electrophysiological evidence indicates that Chinese segmental information is activated during English word reading, whereas both segmental and tonal information are activated during Chinese word reading. Importantly, gamma-band oscillations are modulated differently by tonal and segmental activation, suggesting independent processing of Chinese tones and segments.

Musical genre-dependent behavioural and EEG signatures of action planning. A comparison between classical and jazz pianists	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Plasticity; Action planning; Specialised-musical training; Event-related potentials; Oscillations	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; MOTOR CORTICES; BAND ACTIVITY; MUSICIANS; CORTEX; IMPROVISATION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	It is well established that musical training induces sensorimotor plasticity. However, there are remarkable differences in how musicians train for proficient stage performance. The present EEG study outlines for the first time clear-cut neurobiological differences between classical and jazz musicians at high and low levels of action planning, revealing genre-specific cognitive strategies adopted in production. Pianists imitated chord progressions without sound that were manipulated in terms of harmony and context length to assess high-level planning of sequence-structure, and in terms of the manner of playing to assess low-level parameter specification of single acts. Jazz pianists revised incongruent harmonies faster as revealed by an earlier reprogramming negativity and beta power decrease, hence neutralising response costs, albeit at the expense of a higher number of manner errors. Classical pianists in turn experienced more conflict during incongruent harmony, as shown by theta power increase, but were more ready to implement the required manner of playing, as indicated by higher accuracy and beta power decrease. These findings demonstrate that specific demands and action focus of training lead to differential weighting of hierarchical action planning. This suggests different enduring markers impressed in the brain when a musician practices one or the other style.

It is well known, for example, that reactions are faster when an imperative stimulus and its required response are congruent than when they are not, even if stimulus location itself is completely irrelevant for the task (the so-called Simon effect). However, because these effects have been frequently investigated in single-modality scenarios, the consequences of spatial congruence when more than one sensory modality is at play are less well known. Interestingly, at a behavioral level, the visual Simon effect vanishes in mixed (visual and tactile) modality scenarios, suggesting that irrelevant spatial information ceases to exert influence on vision. To shed some light on this surprising result, here we address the expression of irrelevant spatial information in EEG markers typical of the visual Simon effect (P300, theta power modulation, LRP) in mixed-modality contexts. Our results show no evidence for the visual-spatial information to affect performance at behavioral and neurophysiological levels. The absence of evidence of the neural markers of visual S-R conflict in the mixed-modality scenario implies that some aspects of spatial representations that are strongly expressed in single-modality scenarios might be bypassed.

Resting beta activation and trait motivation: Neurophysiological markers of motivated motor-action preparation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Approach motivation; Beta activation; Motor-action preparation; Motor cortex; Proactive control; Personality	FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SELF-REGULATION; PERSONALITY; IMPULSIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Based on Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (Gray and McNaughton 2000), human behavior is influenced by systems of approach motivation, avoidance motivation, and a third regulatory system presiding over the other two. These systems mediate action and are likely related to neurophysiological markers of motor-action preparation. Previous research has found that lower levels of beta activity over the motor cortex are associated with greater motor-action preparation. The current study sought to test whether trait approach, avoidance, and regulatory control would relate to resting beta activity over the motor cortex, a measure of motor-action preparation. One hundred twenty-eight individuals completed measures of trait behavioral approach motivation and trait behavioral avoidance motivation (BIS/BAS; Carver and White 1994), as well as regulatory control (UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviour Scale; Whiteside et al. 2005). Then, resting EEG was recorded. Greater trait approach was negatively associated with resting beta activity. In contrast, greater trait impulsivity was associated with greater resting beta activity. Lower levels of resting beta activity in the motor cortex appear to be associated with traits related to deliberate motivated motor behaviors. Trait motor-action preparation seems to be an indicator of tendencies toward planful motivated behavior.	[Threadgill, A.

In Pagnotta et al. (2018) [1] we benchmarked nonparametric GGC methods using EEG data recorded during unilateral whisker stimulations in ten rats; here, we include detailed information about the benchmark dataset. In addition, we provide codes for estimating nonparametric GGC and a simulation framework to evaluate the effects on GGC analyses of potential problems, such as the common reference problem, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) differences between channels, and the presence of additive noise. We focus on nonparametric methods here, but these issues also affect parametric methods, which can be tested in our framework as well. Our examples allow showing that time reversal testing for GGC (tr-GGC) mitigates the detrimental effects due to SNR imbalance and presence of mixed additive noise, and illustrate that, when using a common reference, tr-GGC unambiguously detects the causal influence's dominant spectral component, irrespective of the characteristics of the common reference signal. Finally, one of our simulations provides an example that nonparametric methods can overcome a pitfall associated with the implementation of conditional GGC in traditional parametric methods.

We tested romantic couples in a paradigm that involves consoling touch and examined the attenuation of the mu/alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) in the consoling partner. During the task, the toucher either held the consoled partner's right hand (human touch) or held onto the armrest of the chair (non-human touch), while the consoled partner experienced inflicted pain (pain condition) or did not experience any pain (no-pain condition). In accordance with our hypotheses, the results revealed an interaction between touch and pain at in mu/alpha rhythms in all central sites (C3, C4, Cz). Specifically, we found that the toucher's mu suppression was higher in the consoling touch condition, i.e., while touching the partner who is in pain, compared to the three control conditions. Additionally, we found that in the consoling touch condition, mu suppression at electrode C4 of the toucher correlated with a measure of situational empathy. Our findings suggest that electrophysiological and behavioral measures that have been associated with empathy for pain are modulated during consoling touch.

To investigate whether exposure to emotionally aversive pictures affects subsequent resting-state networks differently from exposure to neutral pictures, a resting-state fMRI study implementing a two-group repeated-measures design in healthy young adults (N = 34) was conducted. We focused on investigating (i) patterns of amygdala whole-brain and hippocampus connectivity in both a seed-to-voxel and seed-to-seed approach, (ii) whole-brain resting-state networks with an independent component analysis coupled with dual regression, and (iii) the amygdala's fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, all while EEG recording potential fluctuations in vigilance. In spite of the successful emotion induction, as demonstrated by stimuli rating and a memory-facilitating effect of negative emotionality, none of the resting-state measures was differentially affected by picture valence. In conclusion, resting-state networks connectivity as well as the amygdala's low frequency oscillations appear to be unaffected by preceding exposure to widely used emotionally aversive visual stimuli in healthy young adults.

Twelve subjects completed four different STEM learning tasks - two entailing passive learning (watching a video or reading), and two entailing active learning (solving problems based on the passive learning). There were two mathematics tasks (one active and one passive) and two Python programming tasks (one active, one passive). Subjects were fitted with wearable brainwave sensors that captured cortical oscillations from four scalp electrodes, and transformed the signals from each electrode into five distinct frequency bands. This yielded 10 samples per second within each frequency band and from each electrode. We then trained ensemble-based machine learning algorithms (boosting and bagging of decision tree learners) to classify various features of tasks and subjects from a single sample of brainwave activity. We explored several different types of training/ testing regimes, and our results suggest that within a single session, brain activity patterns for each of these four types of learning are substantially different, but that the patterns do not generalize well between sessions. Importantly, the brainwave patterns differ greatly between individuals, which suggests that applications using such devices will need to rely on personalization to achieve high accuracy. The project is a first step toward developing apps that could use individualized EEG feedback to help subjects develop learning strategies that optimize their learning experience.

It can be observed in neuronal activity at different spatiotemporal scales, including in neuronal membrane potentials, local field potentials, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography. A central research topic in contemporary neuroscience is to elucidate the functional role of noise in neuronal information processing. Experimental studies have shown that a suitable level of noise may enhance the detection of weak neuronal signals by means of stochastic resonance. In response, theoretical research, based on the theory of stochastic processes, nonlinear dynamics, and statistical physics, has made great strides in elucidating the mechanism and the many benefits of stochastic resonance in neuronal systems. In this perspective, we review recent research dedicated to neuronal stochastic resonance in biophysical mathematical models. We also explore the regulation of neuronal stochastic resonance, and we outline important open questions and directions for future research. A deeper understanding of neuronal stochastic resonance may afford us new insights into the highly impressive information processing in the brain.

It remains controversial whether cardiac fibrillatory dynamics are the result of a deterministic or a stochastic process. Traditional methods to differentiate deterministic from stochastic processes have several limitations and are not reliably applied to short and noisy data obtained during clinical studies. The appearance of missing ordinal patterns (MOPs) using the Bandt-Pompe (BP) symbolization is indicative of deterministic dynamics and is robust to brief time series and experimental noise. Our aim was to evaluate whether human AF dynamics is the result of a stochastic or a deterministic process. We used 38 intracardiac atrial electrograms during AF from the coronary sinus of 10 patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF. We extracted the intervals between consecutive atrial depolarizations (AA interval) and converted the AA interval time series to their BP symbolic representation (embedding dimension 5, time delay 1). We generated 40 iterative amplitude-adjusted, Fourier-transform (IAAFT) surrogate data for each of the AA time series. IAAFT surrogates have the same frequency spectrum, autocorrelation, and probability distribution with the original time series. Using the BP symbolization, we compared the number of MOPs and the rate of MOP decay in the first 1000 timepoints of the original time series with that of the surrogate data. We calculated permutation entropy and permutation statistical complexity and represented each time series on the causal entropy-complexity plane. We demonstrated that (a) the number of MOPs in human AF is significantly higher compared to the surrogate data (2.7 +/- 1.18 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.28, p < 0.001); (b) the median rate of MOP decay in human AF was significantly lower compared with the surrogate data (6.58 x 10(-3) vs. 7.79 x 10(-3), p < 0.001); and (c) 81.6% of the individual recordings had a rate of decay lower than the 95% confidence intervals of their corresponding surrogates. On the causal entropy-complexity plane, human AF lay on the deterministic part of the plane that was located above the trajectory of fractional Brownian motion with different Hurst exponents on the plane. This analysis demonstrates that human AF dynamics does not arise from a rescaled linear stochastic process or a fractional noise, but either a deterministic or a nonlinear stochastic process. Our results justify the development and application of mathematical analysis and modeling tools to enable predictive control of human AF. Published by AIP Publishing.

Closed-loop system to enhance slow-wave activity	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						auditory stimulation; sleep; closed-loop; slow wave activity; EEG; brainwave entrainment	MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; HUMAN SLEEP; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; AGE; HOMEOSTASIS; DYNAMICS; OLD	Objective. Recent evidence reports cognitive, metabolic, and sleep restoration benefits resulting from the enhancement of sleep slow-waves using auditory stimulation. Our objective is to make this concept practical for consumer use by developing and validating an electroencephalogram (EEG) closed-loop system to deliver auditory stimulation during sleep to enhance slow-waves. Approach. The system automatically detects slow-wave sleep with 74% sensitivity and 97% specificity and optimally delivers stimulation in the form of 50 ms-long tones separated by a constant one-second inter-tone interval at a volume that is dynamically modulated such that louder tones are delivered when sleep is deeper. The system was tested in a study involving 28 participants (18F, 10M; 36.9 +/- 7.3 years old; median age: 40 years old) who used the system for ten nights (five nights in a sham condition and five in a stimulation condition). Four nights in each condition were recorded at-home and the fifth one in-lab. Main results. The analysis in two age groups defined by the median age of participants in the study shows significant slow wave activity enhancement (+ 16.1%, p < 0.01) for the younger group and absence of effect on the older group. However, the older group received only a fraction (57%) of the stimulation compared to the younger group. Changes in sleep architecture and EEG properties due to aging have influenced the amount of stimulation. The analysis of the stimulation timing suggests an entrainment-like phenomenon where slow-waves align to the stimulation periodicity. In addition, enhancement of spindle power in the stimulation condition was found. Significance. We show evidence of the viability of delivering auditory stimulation during sleep, at home, to enhance slow wave activity. The system ensures the stimulation delivery to be at the right time during sleep without causing disturbance.

Macronutrient composition of a morning meal and the maintenance of attention throughout the morning	NUTRITIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; Cognition; EEG; Breakfast; Vigilance; Alpha-band; Oscillations	ALPHA-BAND ACTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HEALTHY-YOUNG ADULTS; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; BREAKFAST COMPOSITION; CARBOHYDRATE CONTENT; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; MOOD MEASURES; GLUCOSE; CAFFEINE	Background: At present, the impact of macronutrient composition and nutrient intake on sustained attention in adults is unclear, although some prior work suggests that nutritive interventions that engender slow, steady glucose availability support sustained attention after consumption. A separate line of evidence suggests that nutrient consumption may alter electroencephalographic markers of neurophysiological activity, including neural oscillations in the alpha-band (8-14 Hz), which are known to be richly interconnected with the allocation of attention. It is here investigated whether morning ingestion of foodstuffs with differing macronutrient compositions might differentially impact the allocation of sustained attention throughout the day as indexed by both behavior and the deployment of attention-related alpha-band activity. Methods: Twenty-four adult participants were recruited into a three-day study with a cross-over design that employed a previously validated sustained attention task (the Spatial CTET). On each experimental day, subjects consumed one of three breakfasts with differing carbohydrate availabilities (oatmeal, cornflakes, and water) and completed blocks of the Spatial CTET throughout the morning while behavioral performance, subjective metrics of hunger/fullness, and electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements of alpha oscillatory activity were recorded. Results: Although behavior and electrophysiological metrics changed over the course of the day, no differences in their trajectories were observed as a function of breakfast condition. However, subjective metrics of hunger/fullness revealed that caloric interventions (oatmeal and cornflakes) reduced hunger across the experimental day with respect to the non-caloric, volume-matched control (water). Yet, no differences in hunger/fullness were observed between the oatmeal and cornflakes interventions. Conclusion: Observation of a relationship between macronutrient intervention and sustained attention (if one exists) will require further standardization of empirical investigations to aid in the synthesis and replicability of results. In addition, continued implementation of neurophysiological markers in this domain is encouraged, as they often produce nuanced insight into cognition even in the absence of overt behavioral changes.

J	Quercia, A; Zappasodi, F; Committeri, G; Ferrara, M				Quercia, Angelica; Zappasodi, Filippo; Committeri, Giorgia; Ferrara, Michele			Local Use-Dependent Sleep in Wakefulness Links Performance Errors to Learning	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						delta activity; errors; high-density EEG; overlearning; time on task; wayfinding	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; WAKE IDENTIFICATION; BOTTOM-UP; NAVIGATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HOMEOSTASIS; SYNCHRONIZATION; QUESTIONNAIRE; METAANALYSIS	Sleep and wakefulness are no longer to be considered as discrete states. During wakefulness brain regions can enter a sleep-like state (off-periods) in response to a prolonged period of activity (local use-dependent sleep). Similarly, during nonREM sleep the slow-wave activity, the hallmark of sleep plasticity, increases locally in brain regions previously involved in a learning task. Recent studies have demonstrated that behavioral performance may be impaired by off-periods in wake in task-related regions. However, the relation between off-periods in wake, related performance errors and learning is still untested in humans. Here, by employing high density electroencephalographic (hd-EEG) recordings, we investigated local use-dependent sleep in wake, asking participants to repeat continuously two intensive spatial navigation tasks. Critically, one task relied on previous map learning (Wayfinding) while the other did not (Control). Behaviorally awake participants, who were not sleep deprived, showed progressive increments of delta activity only during the learning-based spatial navigation task. As shown by source localization, delta activity was mainly localized in the left parietal and bilateral frontal cortices, all regions known to be engaged in spatial navigation tasks. Moreover, during the Wayfinding task, these increments of delta power were specifically associated with errors, whose probability of occurrence was significantly higher compared to the Control task. Unlike the Wayfinding task, during the Control task neither delta activity nor the number of errors increased progressively. Furthermore, during the Wayfinding task, both the number and the amplitude of individual delta waves, as indexes of neuronal silence in wake (off-periods), were significantly higher during errors than hits. Finally, a path analysis linked the use of the spatial navigation circuits undergone to learning plasticity to off periods in wake. In conclusion, local sleep regulation in wakefulness, associated with performance failures, could be functionally linked to learning-related cortical plasticity.

It has been hypothesized there may be relationships between mindfulness and NF in terms of the neural pathways through which they induce salutary outcomes. The aim of the study was to evaluate possible changes in mindfulness and cognitive functioning following an alpha-based NF intervention, and the role of alpha power as a mediator of improvements. A controlled, non-randomized, trial with 50 healthy participants was conducted with two experimental conditions: a six-session NF intervention and a waiting-list control group. Both groups were administered mindfulness questionnaires (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)) and cognitive measures (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT)), at pre- and post-test. The NF intervention focused on the up-regulation of upper alpha power. Differences among groups were estimated using ANCOVAs, and mediation assessment through path analyses. Compared to controls, the NF group showed enhanced task-related upper alpha power (effect size (ES) = 1.16, p < 0.001), mindfulness outcomes (MAAS: ES = 0.94, p = 0.004; FFMQ: ES = 1.38, p < 0.001), and a trend of cognitive functioning (PASAT time: ES = 0.59, p = 0.062). Upper alpha power had a mediating effect for cognitive functioning (PASAT errors: indirect effect = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.21-1.85), but not for mindfulness. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NF for increasing mindfulness in healthy individuals with no previous experience in mindfulness or neurofeedback training, suggesting that NF may be an acceptable method of augmenting mindfulness-related capacities in the general population.

We sought to test the performance of three strategies for binary classification (logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning) for the problem of predicting successful episodic memory encoding using direct brain recordings obtained from human stereo EEG subjects. We also sought to test the impact of applying t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) for unsupervised dimensionality reduction, as well as testing the effect of reducing input features to a core set of memory relevant brain areas. This work builds upon published efforts to develop a closed-loop stimulation device to improve memory performance. Approach. We used a unique data set consisting of 30 stereo EEG patients with electrodes implanted into a core set of five common brain regions (along with other areas) who performed the free recall episodic memory task as brain activity was recorded. Using three different machine learning strategies, we trained classifiers to predict successful versus unsuccessful memory encoding and compared the difference in classifier performance (as measured by the AUC) at the subject level and in aggregate across modalities. We report the impact of feature reduction on the classifiers, including reducing the number of input brain regions, frequency bands, and the impact of tSNE. Results. Deep learning classifiers outperformed both support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). A priori selection of core brain regions also improved classifier performance for LR and SVM models, especially when combined with tSNE. Significance. We report for the first time a direct comparison among traditional and deep learning methods of binary classification to the problem of predicting successful memory encoding using human brain electrophysiological data. Our findings will inform the design of brain machine interface devices to affect memory processing.

Such a perspective overlooks that the spectral power time series present spontaneous oscillations, the dynamics of which have been associated with the state of health and could be also linked to superior processes such as attention, memory, or cognition. In this work, amplitude of the ERP has been associated with dynamics of the power spectral density (PSD) time series. Approach: Data from a public P3 speller database were analyzed. Statistics about latency, amplitude and scalp distribution of the ERP confirm correct task realization. The spectral power over alpha, beta and gamma bands were correlated with ERP amplitude, considering such estimations time-locked with stimuli presentation. Additionally, PSD time series over the same bands were constructed using a sliding window not synced with stimulation. From these time series, a scaling exponent was computed using a detrended fluctuation analysis approach, and such indices were correlated with ERP amplitude of all registered electrodes. Main results: The correlation between ERP amplitude and scaling exponents of PSD series achieve statistical significance in almost all channels and for all analyzed bands (excepting alpha at C4). In particular, beta and gamma PSD series achieve R-2 values above 0.6 for Cz. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis with time-locked PSD achieves a statistically significant relationship with ERP amplitude (p < 0.05) but with a coefficient of determination (R-2) below 0.2, only for gamma and alpha over the C4 and Pz channels. Significance: The ERP amplitude and scaling exponent of the PSD time series show an anticorrelated behavior, suggesting that larger ERP amplitudes are elicited when the PSD series are less autocorrelated, similar to white noise, further suggesting that the processes involved in the generation of such dynamics could be related to the mechanisms of cognitive responses.

More recently, by emphasizing the analysis of similarity instead of differences across tasks, we concluded that differences between an attention task and quiet resting may be negligible or at least unsystematic across subjects. Due to the possibility that individual differences could be due to noise in a wide sense or some inherent instability of beta activity, we designed a replication study to explicitly test whether pairs of individuals matched for head size and shape would still present less similar beta topography than each individual between sessions or tasks. We used independent component analysis (ICA) for an exhaustive decomposition of beta activity in a visual attention task and in quiet resting, recorded by 256-channel EEG in 20 subjects, on two separate days. We evaluated whether each ICA component obtained in one task and in one given individual could be explained by a linear regression model based on the topographic patterns of the complementary task (correlation between one component with a linear combination of components from complementary conditions), of the same task in a second session and of a matched individual. Results again showed a high topographic similarity between conditions, as previously seen between reasoning and simple visual attention beta correlates. From an overall number of 16 components representing brain activity obtained for the tasks (out of 60 originally computed where the remaining were considered noise), over 92% could satisfactorily be explained by the complementary task. Although the similarity between sessions was significantly smaller than between tasks on each day, the similarity between sessions was statistically higher than that between subjects in a highly significant way. We discuss the possible biases of group spatial averaging and the emphasis on differences as opposed to similarities, and noise in a wide sense, as the main causes of hardly replicable findings on task-related forms of activity and the inconclusive state of a universal functional mapping of cortical association areas.

Neuromodulation with single-element transcranial focused ultrasound in human thalamus	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						human; neuromodulation; somatosensory; thalamus; transcranial; ultrasound	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEDIAN-NERVE; BRAIN-STIMULATION; CORTEX; THALAMOTOMY; NONHUMAN	Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has proven capable of stimulating cortical tissue in humans. tFUS confers high spatial resolutions with deep focal lengths and as such, has the potential to noninvasively modulate neural targets deep to the cortex in humans. We test the ability of single-element tFUS to noninvasively modulate unilateral thalamus in humans. Participants (N = 40) underwent either tFUS or sham neuromodulation targeted at the unilateral sensory thalamus that contains the ventro-posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of thalamus. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from scalp electrodes contralateral to median nerve stimulation. Activity of the unilateral sensory thalamus was indexed by the P14 SEP generated in the VPL nucleus and cortical somatosensory activity by subsequent inflexions of the SEP and through time/frequency analysis. Participants also under went tactile behavioral assessment during either the tFUS or sham condition in a separate experiment. A detailed acoustic model using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also presented to assess the effect of individual skull morphology for single-element deep brain neuromodulation in humans. tFUS targeted at unilateral sensory thalamus inhibited the amplitude of the P14 SEP as compared to sham. There is evidence of translation of this effect to time windows of the EEG commensurate with SI and SII activities. These results were accompanied by alpha and beta power attenuation as well as time-locked gamma power inhibition. Furthermore, participants performed significantly worse than chance on a discrimination task during tFUS stimulation.

Interactions between frontal and posterior oscillatory dynamics support adjustment of stimulus processing during reinforcement learning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Reinforcement learning; Oscillations; MEG; Beamforming; Power-power correlations	WORKING-MEMORY; BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION; NEURONAL INTERACTIONS; ENVELOPE CORRELATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION ERROR; DECISION-MAKING; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; THETA POWER	Reinforcement learning (RL) in humans is subserved by a network of striatal and frontal brain areas. The electrophysiological signatures of feedback evaluation are increasingly well understood, but how those signatures relate to the use of feedback to guide subsequent behavioral adjustment remains unclear. One mechanism for post-feedback behavioral optimization is the modulation of sensory processing. We used source-reconstructed MEG to test whether feedback affects the interactions between sources of oscillatory activity in the learning network and task-relevant stimulus-processing areas. Participants performed a probabilistic RL task in which they learned associations between colored faces and response buttons using trial-and-error feedback. Delia-band (2-4 Hz) and theta-band (4-8 Hz) power in multiple frontal regions were sensitive to feedback valence. Low and high beta-band power (12-20 and 20-30 Hz) in occipital, parietal, and temporal regions differentiated between color and face information. Consistent with our hypothesis, single-trial power-power correlations between frontal and posterior-sensory areas were modulated by the interaction between feedback valence and the relevant stimulus characteristic (color versus identity). These results suggest that long-range oscillatory coupling supports post-feedback updating of stimulus processing.

Identification of biomarkers could be helpful for differential diagnosis and for tailored therapeutic approaches. Objective: This review focuses on diagnostic biomarkers of epilepsy, including genetic, serological, neuroimaging and electrophysiological variables. Methods: References were mainly identified through PubMed search until December 2017 and backtracking of references in pertinent studies. Results: Several promising diagnostic biomarkers of epilepsy exist, with causative value or predicting liability to develop seizures after acquired brain injuries. Short non-coding RNAs are deregulated in serum and cerebral tissue of epilepsy subjects: these molecules are promising diagnostic biomarkers, being easy to assess and reproducible. Advanced imaging techniques may allow identification of subtle epileptogenic lesions, often with prognostic value. Novel electrophysiological biomarkers of epilepsy include perturbed cortical connectivity and excitability induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation, as well as high-frequency oscillations detected by intracranial and scalp electroencephalographic recordings.

To improve event-related desynchronization during motor imagery and obtain improved brain-computer interface classification accuracy, we introduce dynamic video guidance and complex motor tasks to the motor imagery paradigm. Methods: Eleven participants were included in the experiment; 64-channel electroencephalographic data were collected and analyzed during four motor imagery tasks with different guidance. Time-frequency analysis, spectral-time variation analysis, topographical distribution maps, and statistical analysis were utilized to analyze the event-related desynchronization patterns. Common spatial patterns were used to extract spatial pattern features and support vector machines were used to discriminate the offline classification accuracies in three bands (the alpha band, beta band, alpha and beta band) for comparison. Results: The experimental outcomes showed that complex motor imagery tasks coupled with dynamic video guidance induced significantly stronger event-related desynchronization than other paradigms, which use simple motor imagery tasks or static guidance. Similar results were obtained during analysis of the motor imagery brain-computer interface classification performance; namely, the highest average classification accuracy in complex and dynamic guidance was improved by approximately 14%, compared with static guidance. For individually specified paradigms, all participants obtained a classification accuracy that exceeded or was equal to 87.5%. Conclusions: This study provides an optional route to enhance the event-related desynchronization activities and classification accuracy of a motor imagery brain-computer interface through optimization of motor imagery tasks and instructive guidance.

Its potential effects on brain oscillations, especially on theta rhythm (4-8 Hz) that is related to a variety of cognitive processes, remain controversial. Using local field potentials recorded from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), we investigated here the impact of spikes on theta rhythm immediately after spikes and during the prolonged periods (lasting 4-36 s) between adjacent spikes. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded in different epileptogenic areas including the anterior hippocampus (aH) and the entorhinal cortex (EC) as well as in the extended propagation pathway. We found that interictal spikes had a significant inhibitory effect on theta rhythm. Power of theta rhythm was reduced immediately after spikes, and the inhibitory effect on theta rhythm might sustain during the prolonged between-spike periods. The inhibitory effect was more severe when the epileptogenic areas involved both the aH and EC compared to that involved only a single structure. These observations suggest that interictal spikes have a significant negative impact on theta rhythm and may thus playa role in theta-related cognition changes in patients with TLE.

However, due to inherent difficulties in both data acquisition and data analysis methods, studies on large-scale brain dynamics of mouse with local field potential (LFP) recording are very rare. In this paper, we did a series of works on modeling large-scale mouse brain dynamic activities responding to fearful earthquake. Based on LFP recording data from 13 brain regions that are closely related to fear learning and memory and the effective Bayesian connectivity change point model, we divided the response time series into four stages: "Before," "Earthquake," "Recovery," and "After." We first reported the changes in power and theta-gamma coupling during stage transitions. Then, a recurrent neural network model was designed to model the functional dynamics in these thirteen brain regions and six frequency bands in response to the fear stimulus. Interestingly, our results showed that the functional brain connectivities in theta and gamma bands exhibited distinct response processes: in theta band, there is a separated-united-separated alternation in whole-brain connectivity and a low-high-low change in connectivity strength; however, gamma bands have a united-separated-united transition and a high-low-high alternation in connectivity pattern and strength. In general, our results offer a novel perspective in studying functional brain dynamics under fearful stimulus and reveal its relationship to the brain's structural connectivity substrates.

The vast majority of prior investigations, however, utilize paradigms involving visual disruptions (e.g.. intervening blank screens, saccadic movements, "mudsplashes"), making it difficult to isolate neural responses toward visual changes cleanly. To address this issue in this present study, high-density EEG data (256 channel) were collected from 25 participants using a paradigm in which visual changes were progressively introduced into detailed real-world scenes without the use of visual disruption. Oscillatory activity associated with undetected changes was contrasted with activity linked to their absence using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Although an insufficient number of detections were present to allow for analysis of actual change detection, increased beta-2 activity in the right inferior parietal lobule (rIPL), a region repeatedly associated with change blindness in disruption paradigms, followed by increased theta activity in the right superior temporal gyros (rSTG) was noted in undetected visual change responses relative to the absence of change. We propose the rIPL beta-2 activity to be associated with orienting attention toward visual changes. with the subsequent rise in rSTG theta activity being potentially linked with updating preconscious perceptual memory representations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study represents the first neuroimaging-based investigation of gradual change blindness, a visual phenomenon that has significant potential to shed light on the processes underlying visual detection and conscious perception. The use of gradual change materials is reflective of real-world visual phenomena and allows for cleaner isolation of signals associated with the neural registration of change relative to the use of abrupt change transients.

The direction of the cortical effects mainly depend on the polarity and the waveform of the applied current. The aim of the present work is to provide a broad overview of recent studies in which tCS has been applied to modulate sleepiness, sleep, and vigilance, evaluating the efficacy of different stimulation techniques and protocols. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in these stimulations and their ability to affect arousal and sleep dynamics. Furthermore, we critically review works that, by means of stimulating sleep/vigilance patterns, in the sense of enhancing or disrupting them, intended to ameliorate several clinical conditions. The examined literature shows the efficacy of tCSs in modulating sleep and arousal pattern, likely acting on the top-down pathway of sleep regulation. Finally, we discuss the potential application in clinical settings of this neuromodulatory technique as a therapeutic tool for pathological conditions characterized by alterations in sleep and arousal domains and for sleep disorders per se.

A group of thirty-two patients with the first-episode schizophrenia and comparable healthy controls underwent resting-state qEEG and cognitive assessment. Phase Lag Index (PLI) was applied as a connectivity index and the synchronizations were analyzed in six frequencies. Pairs of electrodes were grouped to separately cover frontal, temporal, central, parietal and occipital regions. PLI was calculated for intra-regional connectivity and between-regions connectivity. Computer version processing speed tests were applied to control for possible fluctuations in cognitive efficiency during the performance of the tasks. In the group of patients, in comparison to healthy controls, significantly higher PLI values were recorded in theta frequency, especially in the posterior areas and decreased PLI in low-alpha frequency within the frontal regions. Mean PLI in gamma frequency was also lower in the patients group. Regression analysis showed that lower intra-regional PLI for left frontal cortex and higher PLI within somatosensory cortex in theta band, together with the duration of untreated psychosis, proved to be significant predictors of impaired processing speed in first-episode patients. Our investigation confirmed that disrupted cortico-cortical synchronization contributes to cognitive slowing in schizophrenia.

When choosing between two options, we often feel conflicted, especially when trading off costs and benefits occurring at different times (e.g., saving for later versus spending now). Although previous work has investigated the neurophysiological basis of conflict during inhibitory control tasks, less is known about subjective conflict resulting from competing subjective preferences. In this pre-registered study, we investigated subjective conflict during intertemporal choice, whereby participants chose between smaller immediate versus larger delayed rewards (e.g., $15 today vs. $22 in 30 days). We used economic modeling to parametrically vary eleven different levels of conflict, and recorded EEG data and pupil dilation. Midfrontal theta power, derived from EEG, correlated with pupil responses, and our results suggest that these signals track different gradations of subjective conflict. Unexpectedly, both signals were also maximally enhanced when decisions were surprisingly easy. Therefore, these signals may track events requiring increased attention and adaptive shifts in behavioral responses, with subjective conflict being only one type of such event. Our results suggest that the neural systems underlying midfrontal theta and pupil responses interact when weighing costs and benefits during intertemporal choice. Thus, understanding these interactions might elucidate how individuals resolve self-control conflicts.

Recognition memory advantage for negative emotional words has an early expiry date: Evidence from brain oscillations and ERPs	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Emotional words; Recognition memory; LAG; ERPs; EROs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AFFECTIVE NORMS; THETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; SPANISH WORDS; EEG ALPHA; VALENCE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; RETRIEVAL; RETENTION; ATTENTION	Evidence from prior studies has shown an advantage in recognition memory for emotional compared to neutral words. Whether this advantage is short-lived or rather extends over longer periods, as well as whether the effect depends on words' valence (i.e., positive or negative), remains unknown. In the present ERP/EEG study, we investigated this issue by manipulating the lag distance (LAG-2, LAG-8 and LAG-16) between the presentation of old and new words in an online recognition memory task. LAG differences were observed at behavior, ERPs and in the theta frequency band. In line with previous studies, negative words were associated with faster reaction times, higher hit rates and increased amplitude in a positive ERP component between 386 and 564 ms compared to positive and neutral words. Remarkably, the interaction of LAG by EMOTION revealed that negative words were associated with better performance and larger ERPs amplitudes only at LAG-2. Also in the LAG-2 condition, emotional words (i.e., positive and negative words) induced a stronger desynchronization in the beta band between 386 and 542 ms compared to neutral words. These early enhanced memory effects for emotional words are discussed in terms of the Negative Emotional Valence Enhances Recapitulation (NEVER) model and the mobilization-minimization hypothesis.

Alpha desynchronization/synchronization during working memory testing is compromised in acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							4TH INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; SPORT HELD; EEG; CONCUSSION; ATTENTION; PHASE; PERFORMANCE; THETA	Diagnosing and monitoring recovery of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is challenging because of the lack of objective, quantitative measures. Diagnosis is based on description of injuries often not witnessed, subtle neurocognitive symptoms, and neuropsychological testing. Since working memory (WM) is at the center of cognitive functions impaired in mTBI, this study was designed to define objective quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) measures of WM processing that may correlate with cognitive changes associated with acute mTBI. First-time mTBI patients and mild peripheral (limb) trauma controls without head injury were recruited from the emergency department. WM was assessed by a continuous performance task (N-back). EEG recordings were obtained during N-back testing on three occasions: within five days, two weeks, and one month after injury. Compared with controls, mTBI patients showed abnormal induced and evoked alpha activity including event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS). For induced alpha power, TBI patients had excessive frontal ERD on their first and third visit. For evoked alpha, mTBI patients had lower parietal ERD/ERS at the second and third visits. These exploratory qEEG findings offer new and non-invasive candidate measures to characterize the evolution of injury over the first month, with potential to provide much-needed objective measures of brain dysfunction to diagnose and monitor the consequences of mTBI.

Functional connectivity (FC) in the alpha frequency band (a, 8-12 Hz) during rest is associated with improved performance on various cognitive and motor tasks. In this study we explored how FC is associated with visuo-motor skill learning and offline consolidation. We tested two hypotheses by which resting-state FC might achieve its impact on behavior: preparing the brain for an upcoming task or consolidating training gains. Twenty-four healthy participants were assigned to one of two groups: The experimental group (n = 12) performed a computerized mirror-drawing task. The control group (n = 12) performed a similar task but with concordant cursor direction. High-density 156-channel resting-state EEG was recorded before and after learning. Subjects were tested for offline consolidation 24h later. The Experimental group improved during training and showed offline consolidation. Increased alpha-FC between the left superior parietal cortex and the rest of the brain before training and decreased alpha-FC in the same region after training predicted learning. Resting-state FC following training did not predict offline consolidation and none of these effects were present in controls. These findings indicate that resting-state alpha-band FC is primarily implicated in providing optimal neural resources for upcoming tasks.

In this study, we simultaneously recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs) we simultaneously recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs) from 2 participants as 1 pair (in total, 34 right-handed participants as 17 pairs) during an alternate tapping task in which pairs of participants alternated tapping a key with their right finger. Participants sat facing computer displays and were asked to match their partners' tapping intervals using visual feedback that was presented on the displays. Based on their ability to synchronize, we divided participants into Good performance and Poor performance groups. In both groups, wavelet analyses of EEG data revealed alpha-(approximately 12 Hz) and beta-(approximately 20 Hz) amplitude modulation in the left motor areas. Interestingly, both alpha and beta amplitudes were correlated between individuals from the Good group, but not from the Poor group. Moreover, while the Good group showed intra-brain and inter-brain alpha-phase synchronization (about 12 Hz) within the posterior brain areas (i.e., visual areas) and the central brain areas (i.e., motor areas), the Poor group did not. These results suggest that inter-brain synchronization may play an important role in coordinating one's behavioral rhythms with those of others.

Oscillatory Brain Responses Reflect Anticipation during Comprehension of Speech Acts in Spoken Dialog	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						turn-taking; pragmatics; EEG; neuronal oscillations; anticipatory processes; speech acts	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; TURN-TAKING; ATTENTION; THETA; BETA; MODULATION; PREDICTION; STIMULUS; ALPHA; MECHANISMS	Everyday conversation requires listeners to quickly recognize verbal actions, so-called speech acts, from the underspecified linguistic code and prepare a relevant response within the tight time constraints of turn-taking. The goal of this study was to determine the time-course of speech act recognition by investigating oscillatory EEG activity during comprehension of spoken dialog. Participants listened to short, spoken dialogs with target utterances that delivered three distinct speech acts (Answers, Declinations, Pre-offers). The targets were identical across conditions at lexico-syntactic and phonetic/prosodic levels but differed in the pragmatic interpretation of the speech act performed. Speech act comprehension was associated with reduced power in the alpha/beta bands just prior to Declination speech acts, relative to Answers and Pre-offers. In addition, we observed reduced power in the theta band during the beginning of Declinations, relative to Answers. Based on the role of alpha and beta desynchronization in anticipatory processes, the results are taken to indicate that anticipation plays a role in speech act recognition. Anticipation of speech acts could be critical for efficient turn-taking, allowing interactants to quickly recognize speech acts and respond within the tight time frame characteristic of conversation. The results show that anticipatory processes can be triggered by the characteristics of the interaction, including the speech act type.

Indeed, if we rotate the object, we achieve a pool of observed shadows from different angulations, gradients, shapes and variable length contours that make it possible for us to increase our available information. Starting from this simple observation, we show how informational entropies might turn out to be useful in the evaluation of scale-free dynamics in the brain. Indeed, brain activity exhibits a scale-free distribution that leads to the variations in the power law exponent typical of different functional neurophysiological states. Here we show that modifications in scaling slope are associated with variations in Renyi entropy, a generalization of Shannon informational entropy. From a three-dimensional object's perspective, by changing its orientation (standing for the cortical scale-free exponent), we detect different two-dimensional shadows from different perception angles (standing for Renyi entropy in different brain areas). We show how, starting from known values of Renyi entropy (easily detectable in brain fMRIs or EEG traces), it is feasible to calculate the scaling slope in a given moment and in a given brain area.

Methods: We analyzed 15 children with diagnosis of FCDB in surgical specimen and 3 T MRI by using MEG. Using AdSPM, we analyzed a +/- 50 ms epoch relative to each single moving dipole (SMD) and applied summation technique to estimate the source activity. The most active area in AdSPM was defined as the location of AdSPM spike source. We compared spatial congruence between MRI-visible FCDB and (1) dipole cluster in SMD method; and (2) AdSPM spike source. Results: AdSPM localized FCDB in 12 (80%) of 15 children whereas dipole cluster localized six (40%). AdSPM spike source was concordant within seizure onset zone in nine (82%) of 11 children with intracranial video EEG. Eleven children with resective surgery achieved seizure freedom with follow-up period of 1.9 +/- 1.5 years. Ten (91%) of them had an AdSPM spike source in the resection area. Conclusion: AdSPM can noninvasively and neurophysiologically localize epileptogenic FCDB, whether it overlaps with the dipole cluster or not.

Neural source dynamics of brain responses to continuous stimuli: Speech processing from acoustics to comprehension	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Minimum norm estimate; Speech representation; Impulse response; Temporal response function; Reverse correlation	AUDITORY WORD RECOGNITION; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; MOTOR CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; EEG-DATA; MEG; FREQUENCY; LANGUAGE; LOCALIZATION; RESOLUTION	Human experience often involves continuous sensory information that unfolds over time. This is true in particular for speech comprehension, where continuous acoustic signals are processed over seconds or even minutes. We show that brain responses to such continuous stimuli can be investigated in detail, for magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, by combining linear kernel estimation with minimum norm source localization. Previous research has shown that the requirement to average data over many trials can be overcome by modeling the brain response as a linear convolution of the stimulus and a kernel, or response function, and estimating a kernel that predicts the response from the stimulus. However, such analysis has been typically restricted to sensor space. Here we demonstrate that this analysis can also be performed in neural source space. We first computed distributed minimum norm current source estimates for continuous MEG recordings, and then computed response functions for the current estimate at each source element, using the boosting algorithm with cross-validation. Permutation tests can then assess the significance of individual predictor variables, as well as features of the corresponding spatio-temporal response functions. We demonstrate the viability of this technique by computing spatio-temporal response functions for speech stimuli, using predictor variables reflecting acoustic, lexical and semantic processing. Results indicate that processes related to comprehension of continuous speech can be differentiated anatomically as well as temporally: acoustic information engaged auditory cortex at short latencies, followed by responses over the central sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus, possibly related to somatosensory/motor cortex involvement in speech perception; lexical frequency was associated with a left-lateralized response in auditory cortex and subsequent bilateral frontal activity; and semantic composition was associated with bilateral temporal and frontal brain activity. We conclude that this technique can be used to study the neural processing of continuous stimuli in time and anatomical space with the millisecond temporal resolution of MEG. This suggests new avenues for analyzing neural processing of naturalistic stimuli, without the necessity of averaging over artificially short or truncated stimuli.

In 2013, ECT was initiated approximately 60-90seconds after administration of thiopental and succinylcholine. This interval was increased to 120seconds in 2014. Ninety-three patients were included (40 in 2013 and 53 in 2014). Outcome measures were length of seizure, number of re-stimulations, number of ECTs per series and stimulation dosage. Regression model analyses were conducted with entering year of treatment (2013 vs. 2014), sex and age as covariates.Results: We showed that a lowered frequency of re-stimulation was independently associated with the 2014 treatment regimen. No effect of treatment regimen on duration of seizures as measured clinically or by EEG, on number of treatments per series or on stimulation dosage was observed.Conclusions: We found an association between an increased time interval from administration of thiopental and succinylcholine to ECT and a lowered risk of re-stimulations. The current study substantially strengthens the evidence on the benefits of delaying ECT after administration of anaesthetic agent and muscle relaxant.

The mechanisms leading to the high therapeutic effectiveness of DBS are poorly understood so far, but modulation of oscillatory activity is likely to play an important role. Thus, investigating the effect of DBS on cortical oscillatory activity can help clarifying the neurophysiological mechanisms of DBS. Here, we aimed at scrutinizing changes of cortical oscillatory activity by DBS at different frequencies using magneto-encephalography (MEG). MEG data from 17 PD patients were acquired during DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) the day after electrode implantation and before implanting the pulse generator. We stimulated the STN unilaterally at two different stimulation frequencies, 130 Hz and 340 Hz using an external stimulator. Data from six patients had to be discarded due to strong artefacts and two other datasets were excluded since these patients were not able to finalize the paradigm. After DBS artefact removal, power spectral density (PSD) values of MEG were calculated for each individual patient and averaged over the group. DBS at both 130 Hz and 340 Hz led to a widespread suppression of cortical alpha/beta band activity (8-22 Hz) specifically over bilateral sensorimotor cortices. No significant differences were observed between the two stimulation frequencies. Our finding of a widespread suppression of cortical alpha/beta band activity is particularly interesting as PD is associated with pathologically increased levels of beta band activity in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit. Therefore, suppression of such oscillatory activity might be an essential effect of DBS for relieving motor symptoms in PD and can be achieved at different stimulation frequencies above 100 Hz.

Methods: We analyzed electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from 63 patients with focal epilepsy, and delineated the spatial-temporal dynamics of visually-elicited high-gamma70-110 Hz amplitudes on a standard brain template. We then clarified the neuronal events underlying visual evoked potential (VEP) components, by correlating with high-gamma amplitude measures. Results: The medial-occipital cortex initially revealed rapid neural activation followed by prolonged suppression, reflected by augmentation of high-gamma activity lasting up to 100 ms followed by attenuation lasting up to 1000 ms, respectively. With a number of covariate factors incorporated into a prediction model, the eccentricity representation independently predicted the magnitude of post-activation suppression, which was more intense in regions representing more parafoveal visual fields compared to those of more peripheral fields. The initial negative component on VEP was sharply contoured and co-occurred with early high-gamma augmentation, whose offset then co-occurred with a large positive VEP peak. A delayed negative VEP peak was blunt and co-occurred with prolonged high-gamma attenuation. Conclusions: Eccentricity-dependent gradient in neural suppression in the medial-occipital region may explain the functional difference between peripheral and parafoveal/ central vision. Early negative and positive VEP components may reflect neural activation, whereas a delayed negative VEP peak reflecting neural suppression. Significance: Our observation provides the mechanistic rationale for transient scotoma or mild flash-blindness, characterized by physiological afterimage preferentially formed in central vision following intense but non-injurious light exposure.

In the present MEG study, we analyzed pre- and post-stimulus oscillatory activity time-locked to the reading of a target word. We experimentally contrasted the processing of the same target word following two highly constraining sentence contexts, in which the constraint was driven either by the semantic content or by the lexical association between words. Previous research suggests the presence of sensory facilitation for expected words in the latter condition but not in the former. We observed a dissociation between beta (similar to 20 Hz) and gamma (>50 Hz) band activity in pre- and post-stimulus time intervals respectively. Both the beta and gamma effects were evident in occipital brain regions, and only the pre-stimulus beta effect additionally involved left pre-articulatory motor regions. Lexically constrained (vs. semantically constrained) words elicited reduced beta power around 400 msec before the target word in motor regions and a functionally related gamma enhancement in occipital regions around 200 msec post-target.

This suggests that theta EEG pattern can also be used as a bio-indicator of the efficiency of VNS. In the present study, we focused on three specific, technical issues related to the stimulation procedure of the vagal nerve: i/does the type of the electrode used for VNS and the technique of its implantation affect the parameters of the HPC theta rhythm? ii/does the type of electrode used determine the current intensity threshold of VNS-induced HPC theta? iii/is the repeatability of the VNS effect determined by the type of electrode used? We demonstrated that a platinum-iridium cuff electrode offers some important advantages over a tungsten electrode. Firstly, despite some possible mechanical and compression nerve damage related to permanent contact with the vagal nerve, it offers a lower current intensity threshold for inducing theta oscillations. Secondly, and most importantly, the cuff electrode offers repeatability of the VNS effect on the HPC theta rhythm. However, one disadvantage of using this type of an electrode is that the permanent pressure on the vagal nerve by the cuff itself may decrease the amplitude of the investigated field potential.

Based on a spatially extended computational model of cortical electric activity with realistic mesoscopic connectivity, we reconstructed the single epileptic focus and multiple epileptic foci by activating the activity level of local neuronal cluster with single-pulse stimulation disturbance, to simulate the physiologically observed synchronous brain activity of epileptogenic focus onsets and propagations. Results show that single epileptic focus with smaller excitatory activity region fails to spread into the surrounding brain regions, except for transient propagation to the neighborhood which eventually disappears with the recession of activity energy. However, as the excitatory activity region corresponding to the single epileptic focus getting larger, the synchronous oscillations of adjacent neuronal populations can not only be successfully initiated but also can propagate to the surrounding farther normal brain regions, due to the local and remote feedforward excitatory connectivities. This can ultimately cause a comprehensive onset of focal epilepsy. In particular, to investigate the effect of multifocal seizures on the propagations of epileptic onsets, we divided the large single focus into three equal multifocal regions. Detailed investigation reveals that compared to the single epileptic focus, multifocal seizure onsets are more easily to promote the generalized epileptic seizures and increase the spreading speed of synchronous oscillations of epileptic seizures.

Here, we investigated the potential sleep-protective role of sleep spindles on noise-induced sleep alterations. Methods: Twenty-six young (19-33 years, 12 women) and 18 older (52-70 years, 9 women) healthy volunteers underwent a repeated measures polysomnographic 6-day laboratory study. Participants spent one noise-free baseline night, followed by four transportation noise-exposure nights (road traffic or railway noise; continuous or intermittent: average sound levels of 45 dB, maximum sound levels of 50-62 dB), and one noise-free recovery night. Sleep stages were scored manually and fast sleep spindle characteristics were quantified automatically using an individual band-pass filtering approach. Results: Nighttime exposure to transportation noise significantly increased sleep EEG arousal indices. Sleep structure and continuity were not differentially affected by noise exposure in individuals with a low versus a high spindle rate. Spindle rates showed an age-related decline along with more noise-induced sleep alterations. All-night spindle rates did not predict EEG arousal or awakening probability from single railway noise events. Spindle characteristics were affected in noise-exposure nights compared to noise-free nights: we observed a reduction of the spindle amplitude in both age groups and of the spindle rate in the older group. Conclusions: We have evidence that spindle rate is more likely to represent a trait phenomenon, which does not seem to play a sleepprotective role in nighttime transportation noise-induced sleep disruptions. However, the marked reduction in spindle amplitude is most likely a sensitive index for noise-induced sleep alterations. Statement of Significance Growing epidemiological evidence suggests various adverse health effects of long-term nighttime transportation noise exposure. In the EU, 7.9 million adults are estimated to experience sleep disturbances due to nighttime transportation noise exposure with additional community noise sources such as neighbor noise not even considered. Individuals differ greatly in sleep-related noise sensitivity. A better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these differences could help to identify targets for intervention. This study in young and older healthy individuals indicated that sleep spindles, discussed in the literature for their potential sleep-protective function, do not significantly modify noiseinduced sleep alterations after controlling for age and may therefore not serve as a physiological marker of sleep-related noise sensitivity.

No Differential Effects of Two Different Alpha-Band Electrical Stimulation Protocols Over Fronto-Parietal Regions on Spatial Attention	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; coherence; connectivity; transcranial alternating current stimulation; visual attention; EEG	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; PHASE SYNCHRONY; PARIETAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; FEEDFORWARD; FEEDBACK	In a previous study using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), we found preliminary evidence that phase coherence in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) within the fronto-parietal network may critically support top-down control of spatial attention (van Schouwenburg et al., 2017). Specifically, synchronous alpha-band stimulation over the right frontal and parietal cortex (0 degrees relative phase) was associated with changes in performance and fronto-parietal coherence during a spatial attention task as compared to sham stimulation. In the current study, we firstly aimed to replicate these findings with synchronous tACS. Second, we extended our previous protocol by adding a second tACS condition in which the right frontal and parietal cortex were stimulated in a desynchronous fashion (180 degrees relative phase), to test the specificity of the changes observed in our previous study. Participants (n = 23) were tested in three different sessions in which they received either synchronous, desynchronous, or sham stimulation over the right frontal and parietal cortex. In contrast to our previous study, we found no spatially selective effects of stimulation on behavior or coherence in erther stimulation protocol compared to sham. We highlight some of the differences in study design that may have contributed to this discrepancy in findings and more generally may determine the effectiveness of tACS.

In rodents, boundary representations have been identified at the single-cell level in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of the hippocampal formation. Although studies of hippocampal function and spatial behavior suggest that similar representations might exist in humans, boundary-related neural activity has not been identified electrophysiologically in humans until now. To address this gap in the literature, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the hippocampal formation of surgical epilepsy patients (of both sexes) while they performed a virtual spatial navigation task and compared the power in three frequency bands (1-4, 4-10, and 30-90 Hz) for target locations near and far from the environmental boundaries. Our results suggest that encoding locations near boundaries elicited stronger theta oscillations than for target locations near the center of the environment and that this difference cannot be explained by variables such as trial length, speed, movement, or performance. These findings provide direct evidence of boundary-dependent neural activity localized in humans to the subiculum, the homolog of the hippocampal subregion in which most boundary cells are found in rodents, and indicate that this system can represent attended locations that rather than the position of one's own body.

A model for the evolution of the neuronal network in kindled brain slices	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Hippocampus; Epilepsy; Kindling; Hebbian learning; Overlapping communities; Complex networks	SPONTANEOUS EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; PRINCIPAL NEURONS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EPILEPSY; SEIZURES; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; DYNAMICS; EEG; CONNECTIVITY	A biologically realistic neuronal network model for epileptic burst dynamics in chemically kindled rat hippocampal slices is proposed. The neuronal dynamics of hippocampus is incorporated through Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neurons. Creation of new synapses or strengthening of existing synapses observed in the kindled brain slices is modelled through a hebbian learning mechanism that is switched on during kindling. The model reproduces a number of important features of kindling experiments. Prior to kindling, the neuronal network shows low activity oscillation corresponding to the normal or resting state of the brain. Subthreshold stimulation leads to a small growth in synapses that is not enough to elicit afterdischarge and the network reverts to the resting phase. At a critical threshold the network shows novel bistable bursting dynamics characterized by recurrent transition between a low 'normal' activity and a high 'bursting' activity as observed in experiments. Suprathreshold stimuli generate seizure states. For the four initial network choices, i.e., regular, small world, random and modular topologies, bistable dynamics and seizure states were observed for all. We observe that all topologies lead to seizure generation by the same mechanism of formation of modular clusters that fire simultaneously during population bursts. We believe that this computer model for focal epilepsy shall be useful in future epilepsy research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This connection rests on animal studies describing oscillations in the alpha band as a mode of phasic thalamocortical information transfer for low-level visual stimuli, which critically relies on GABAergic interneurons. Here, we investigated the interplay of these parameters by measuring occipital alpha band peak frequency by means of magnetoencephalography, visual temporal resolution by means of behavioral testing, and occipital GABA levels by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Importantly, we investigated a sample of healthy participants and patients with varying grades of hepatic encephalopathy, which are known to exhibit decreases in the investigated parameters, thus providing an increased parameter space. We found that occipital alpha band peak frequency and visual temporal resolution were positively correlated, i.e., higher occipital alpha band peak frequencies were on average related to a higher temporal resolution. Likewise, occipital alpha band peak frequency correlated positively with occipital GABA levels. However, correlations were significant only when both healthy participants and patients were included in the analysis, thereby indicating a connection of the measures on group level (instead of the individual level). These findings provide new insights into neurophysiological and neurochemical underpinnings of visual perception.

Nociceptive stimuli also elicit insular gamma-band oscillations (GBOs), possibly preferential for thermonociception, which have been suggested to reflect the intensity of perceived pain. To shed light on the functional significance of these two responses, we investigated whether they would be modulated by stimulation intensity and temporal expectation - two factors contributing to stimulus saliency. Insular activity was recorded from 8 depth electrodes (41 contacts) implanted in the left insula of 6 patients investigated for epilepsy. Thermonociceptive, vibrotactile, and auditory stimuli were delivered using two intensities. To investigate the effects of temporal expectation, the stimuli were delivered in trains of three identical stimuli (S1-S2-S3) separated by a constant 1-s interval. Stimulation intensity affected intensity of perception, the magnitude of low-frequency LFPs, and the magnitude of nociceptive GBOs. Stimulus repetition did not affect perception. In contrast, both low-frequency LFPs and nociceptive GBOs showed a marked habituation of the responses to S2 and S3 as compared to S1 and, hence, a dissociation with intensity of perception. Most importantly, although insular nociceptive GBOs appear to be preferential for thermonociception, they cannot be considered as a correlate of perceived pain.

Synchrony surfacing: Epicortical recording of correlated action potentials	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						assembly-coding; auditory cortex; brain-machine interfaces; electrocorticography; synchronous spiking; visual cortex	ORGANIZATION; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISM	Synchronous spiking of multiple neurons is a key phenomenon in normal brain function and pathologies. Recently, approaches to record spikes from the intact cortical surface using small high-density arrays of microelectrodes have been reported. It remained unaddressed how epicortical spiking relates to intracortical unit activity. We introduced a mesoscale approach using an array of 64 electrodes with intermediate diameter (250 mu m) and combined large-coverage epicortical recordings in ferrets with intracortical recordings via laminar probes. Empirical data and modelling strongly suggest that our epicortical electrodes selectively captured synchronized spiking of neurons in the cortex beneath. As a result, responses to sensory stimulation were more robust and less noisy compared to intracortical activity, and receptive field properties were well preserved in epicortical recordings. This should promote insights into assembly-coding beyond the informative value of subdural EEG or single-unit spiking, and be advantageous to real-time applications in brain-machine interfacing.

So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for gamma type of brain waves. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data and considered four situations: sleeping, relaxing, active and moving. Then, we used mean-shift clustering algorithm to cluster the data. The evaluation results show that our testbed can judge the human situation by using gamma waves.

In this paper, we propose using singular value decomposition (SVD) with clustering to group related words as enhanced signals for textual features in tweets in order to improve the correlation with events. The proposed method applies SVD to the time series vector for each feature to factorize the matrix of feature/day counts, to ensure the independence of the feature vectors. Then, k-means clustering is applied to build a look-up table that maps members of each cluster to the cluster centroid. The look-up table is used to map each feature in the original data to the centroid of its cluster. Then, we calculate the sum of the term-frequency vectors of all features in each cluster to the term-frequency vector of the cluster centroid. To evaluate the method, we calculated the correlations of the cluster centroids with the golden standard record vector before and after summing the vectors of the cluster members to the centroid vector. The proposed method is applied to multiple correlation techniques including the Pearson, Spearman, distance correlation, and Kendal Tao. The experiments also considered the different word forms and lengths of the features including keywords, n grams, skip grams, and bags-of-words. The correlation results are enhanced significantly as the highest correlation scores have increased from 0.22 to 0.70, and the average correlation scores have increased from 0.22 to 0.60.

JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES			English	Article							EEG; DYNAMICS; NEUROPERCOLATION; NEURODYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; GAMMA; MODEL	Subjective experience suggests that we continuously observe, perceive, and evaluate the environment as we make decisions and intentional actions. The percept of continuity of our cognition, however, is an illusion. In the past decades, ample experimental evidence has been accumulated indicating that cognition evolves through a sequence of discontinuities and transients, and there are discernable neural processes correlating with the cognitive sequences. These discontinuities are crucial in the intentional action perception cycle, as they mark the cognitive 'aha' moment of deep understanding and conscious insight. Walter Freeman developed a hierarchical model to describe these physiological findings, culminating in the cinematic theory of cognition. Following the traditions of meta-stability, transient neurodynamics, and brain chaos, discontinuities are described as phase transitions in the cortical neuropil. This approach not only leads to deep theoretical insights of neural correlates of cognition and consciousness, but it also helps to form a conceptual framework to create artificially intelligent devices that are in harmony with humans and serve peaceful development of humanity.

A pressing question is to what extent results from visual studies generalize to other domains. Answering this question allows determining whether metacognition operates through shared, supramodal mechanisms or through idiosyncratic, modality-specific mechanisms. Here, we report three new lines of evidence for decisional and postdecisional mechanisms arguing for the supramodality of metacognition. First, metacognitive efficiency correlated among auditory, tactile, visual, and audiovisual tasks. Second, confidence in an audiovisual task was best modeled using supramodal formats based on integrated representations of auditory and visual signals. Third, confidence in correct responses involved similar electrophysiological markers for visual and audiovisual tasks that are associated with motor preparation preceding the perceptual judgment. We conclude that the supramodality of metacognition relies on supramodal confidence estimates and decisional signals that are shared across sensory modalities.

Methods: A non-invasive polysomnographic study of 6 spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) was conducted. The relative beta power of the motor cortex and its linear relation with muscle tone in the facial mentalis muscle and the abductor caudae medialis muscle of the tail during wakefulness and sleep stages were calculated. Results: A strong negative linear relationship (r = -.8, P = .03) was found between the relative power of the beta2 band in the left motor cortex and abductor caudae medialis muscle tone during delta sleep. Conclusions: The left motor cortex, through beta2 band activity, interacts with abductor caudae medialis muscle tonicity during delta sleep. This interaction takes part in the mechanisms that regulate the sleep postures.

Sleep Spindle Refractoriness Segregates Periods of Memory Reactivation	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; THALAMOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; ENHANCES MEMORY; EEG DYNAMICS; BRAIN; RHYTHMS; HIPPOCAMPUS; DENSITY; RIPPLES	The stability of long-term memories is enhanced by reactivation during sleep. Correlative evidence has linked memory reactivation with thalamocortical sleep spindles, although their functional role is not fully understood. Our initial study replicated this correlation and also demonstrated a novel rhythmicity to spindles, such that a spindle is more likely to occur approximately 3-6 s following a prior spindle. We leveraged this rhythmicity to test the role of spindles in memory by using real-time spindle tracking to present cues within versus just after the presumptive refractory period; as predicted, cues presented just after the refractory period led to better memory. Our findings demonstrate a precise temporal link between sleep spindles and memory reactivation. Moreover, they reveal a previously undescribed neural mechanism whereby spindles may segment sleep into two distinct substates: prime opportunities for reactivation and gaps that segregate reactivation events.

This enhancement is generally thought to be caused by active inhibition of task-irrelevant visual inputs. During sequential memory processing, we previously found that alpha-band activity increases from beginning to midterm during memory encoding, and conversely decreases from midterm to ending. In the present study, we conducted two experiments to determine the spatial and functional role of alpha-band rhythm during sequential memory processing. The first experiment showed that alpha-band rhythm increased in the occipital brain region, suggesting that active inhibition of task-irrelevant visual inputs continues from midterm to ending of memory encoding. The second experiment, in which subjects could not anticipate the ending of the sequential presentation of memory items, demonstrated that alpha-band rhythm is suppressed in correspondence with preparation for memory recall. These results indicate that alpha-band rhythm is simultaneously modulated by multiple brain processes in sequential memory encoding.

Whether sleep-dependent memory consolidation is also apparent in infants in their first few months of life has not been investigated. We demonstrate that 3-month-old infants only remember a cartoon face approximately 1.5-2hours after its first presentation when a period of sleep followed learning. Furthermore, habituation time, that is, the time to become bored with a stimulus shown repetitively, correlated negatively with the density of infant sleep spindles, implying that processing speed is linked to specific electroencephalographic components of sleep. Our findings show that without a short period of sleep infants have problems remembering a newly seen face, that sleep enhances memory consolidation from a very early age, highlighting the importance of napping in infancy, and that infant sleep spindles may be associated with some aspects of cognitive ability.

Resting-state connectivity after visuo-motor skill learning is inversely associated with offline consolidation in Parkinson's disease and healthy controls	CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; Functional connectivity; Skill learning; Parkinson's disease; Offline consolidation	MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; HUMAN BRAIN; TIME-COURSE; SLEEP; TASK; SEQUENCE; PERFORMANCE; REORGANIZATION	Procedural memory refers to skills acquired through practice and depends on cortico-striatal and cortico-cerebellar circuits. These circuits are typically affected in Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to impaired skill learning, including defective offline consolidation, early in the course of the disease. Evidence points to a role of slow oscillations (<4 Hz) during sleep for offline consolidation. However recent studies showed consolidation over the course of the day, suggesting that consolidation may arise during wakefulness, too. Here we investigate whether functional connectivity (FC) at rest after visuo-motor skill learning is associated with the extent of offline improvements in healthy controls and PD patients. Nineteen participants (9 PD, 10 healthy controls) performed a mirror-drawing task. High-density 156-channel resting state EEG was recorded before and immediately after training. Performance on the task was measured again 24 h later to test for offline consolidation. Delta-band (1-3.5 Hz) FC centered on the left parietal cortex after training predicted offline consolidation. Weak FC was observed in most healthy controls and associated with marked overnight improvement, while strong FC was observed in most PD patients and associated with weak offline consolidation or loss of the skill. These findings indicate that offline consolidation starts immediately after visuo-motor skill learning in brain regions and frequencies typically involved in sleep-related consolidation.

Modulation of task-related cortical connectivity in the acute and subacute phase after stroke	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical plasticity; dynamic causal modelling; motor recovery; reorganization; time post-stroke	MOTOR NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; AREAS; REORGANIZATION; MOVEMENT; FMRI; REPRESENTATIONS; HEMISPHERE; DORSAL; EEG	The functional relevance of cortical reorganization post-stroke is still not well understood. In this study, we investigated task-specific modulation of cortical connectivity between neural oscillations in key motor regions during the early phase after stroke. EEG and EMG recordings were examined from 15 patients and 18 controls during a precision grip task using the affected hand. Each patient attended two sessions in the acute and subacute phase (median of 3 and 34days) post-stroke. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for induced responses was used to investigate task-specific modulations of oscillatory couplings in a bilateral network comprising supplementary motor area (SMA), dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1). Fourteen models were constructed for each subject, and the input induced by the experimental manipulation (task) was set to inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Bayesian model selection favoured a fully connected model. A reduced coupling from SMA and intact M1 in the -band (31-48Hz) to lesioned M1 in the -band (15-30Hz) was observed in patients in the acute phase compared to controls. Behavioural performance improved significantly in the subacute phase, while an increased positive coupling from intact PMd to lesioned M1 and a less negative modulation from lesioned M1 to intact M1 were observed for patients compared to controls both from the -band to the -band. We infer that the observed differences in cross-frequency cortical interactions are important for functional recovery.

Here, we report that in rodents and human cadaver brains, similar to 75% of scalp-applied currents are attenuated by soft tissue and skull. Using intracellular and extracellular recordings in rats, we find that at least 1 mV/mm voltage gradient is necessary to affect neuronal spiking and subthreshold currents. We designed an 'intersectional short pulse' stimulation method to inject sufficiently high current intensities into the brain, while keeping the charge density and sensation on the scalp surface relatively low. We verify the regional specificity of this novel method in rodents; in humans, we demonstrate how it affects the amplitude of simultaneously recorded EEG alpha waves. Our combined results establish that neuronal circuits are instantaneously affected by intensity currents that are higher than those used in conventional protocols.

To test the response of different experimental animals under different epileptic intensity of light stimulus, we need a, precise and real-time synchronization neural signal recording system. And we can utilize the change of EEC corresponds to the effect of applying optogenetics in the experimental body with this system. The system contains a laser, light stimulation-electric recording neural interface, neural signal recording module and PC software. The system can adjust laser stimulation frequency, amplitude and duty cycle and illumination time in real tittle, and synchronously collect neural signals. This system is a multi-input system so we. simplify the system to a single-input system. The system is able to find the optimal optical stimulation parameters to inhibit the onset of epilepsy mice. The development or this system can promote the application of optogenetic technology in neuromodulation research of experimental body.

This EEG study aimed to investigate whether aspects of phonetic perception are affected by the experience of tinnitus. We examined a sample of individuals with chronic, subjective tinnitus (n = 30, age range 30-50 yrs.), who underwent behavioural screening (standard tinnitus questionnaires) and comprehensive audiometric testing that covered peripheral and central hearing abilities (pure tone audiometry, suprathreshold audiometry (frequency selectivity and temporal compression), and speech in noise performance). In addition, participants performed a phoneme discrimination task embedded in an active oddball paradigm, while auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded. In particular, we aimed to investigate if reported speech difficulties in chronic tinnitus trace back to deficits in more elementary speech processes such as phonetic processing. Furthermore, we explored whether central hearing loss and tinnitus' psychometric profile may account for deficiencies in speech perception. The analysis of behavioural and audiometric data showed indications of mild to moderate symptoms of tinnitus distress when peripheral hearing loss was not in evidence. Nevertheless, tinnitus distress was negatively related to speech in noise performance which may be indicative of a lack of inhibitory competence. We further observed an effect of tinnitus distress on phoneme discrimination. More precisely, higher tinnitus distress was associated with higher accuracy and longer reaction times, while the effect on reaction times was mediated by the individual N2 ERP peak amplitudes. Our results suggest that tinnitus clearly interacts with the central auditory system in that responsiveness to salient input changes as a function of tinnitus-related distress, irrespective of peripheral hearing loss. Akin to individuals with higher psychological stress, persons with increased tinnitus-related distress demonstrate higher sensitivity during auditory processing. Taken together, we interpret our findings in light of a Bayesian approach (Sedley et al., 2016). According to this view, tinnitus distress-related factors (e.g., attention, stress) influence the excitability of the central auditory system and this, in turn, affects the sensory precision of inflowing auditory input, including spoken language.

Methods Results We investigated 123 patients who underwent focal cortical resection following extraoperative electrocorticography recording and had at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up. We examined whether consideration of MI would improve the prediction of postoperative seizure outcome. MI was measured at each intracranial electrode site during interictal slow-wave sleep. We compared the accuracy of prediction of patients achieving International League Against Epilepsy class 1 outcome between the full multivariate logistic regression model incorporating MI in addition to conventional clinical, seizure onset zone (SOZ), and neuroimaging variables, and the reduced logistic regression model incorporating all variables other than MI. Ninety patients had class 1 outcome at the time of most recent follow-up (mean follow-up = 5.7 years). The full model had a noteworthy outcome predictive ability, as reflected by regression model fit R-2 of 0.409 and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic plot of 0.838. Incomplete resection of SOZ (P < 0.001), larger number of antiepileptic drugs at the time of surgery (P = 0.007), and larger MI in nonresected tissues relative to that in resected tissue (P = 0.020) were independently associated with a reduced probability of class 1 outcome. The reduced model had a lower predictive ability as reflected by R-2 of 0.266 and AUC of 0.767. Anatomical variability in MI existed among nonepileptic electrode sites, defined as those unaffected by magnetic resonance imaging lesion, SOZ, or interictal spike discharges. With MI adjusted for anatomical variability, the full model yielded the outcome predictive ability of R-2 of 0.422, AUC of 0.844, and sensitivity/specificity of 0.86/0.76. Significance MI during interictal recording may provide useful information for the prediction of postoperative seizure outcome.

It is well established that WM performance can be enhanced by a retrospective cue presented during storage, yet the neural mechanisms responsible for this benefit are unclear. Here, we tested several explanations for retrospective cue benefits by quantifying changes in spatial WM representations reconstructed from alpha-band (8 -12 Hz) EEG activity recorded from human participants (both sexes) before and after the presentation of a retrospective cue. This allowed us to track cue-related changes in WM representations with high temporal resolution (tens of milliseconds). Participants encoded the locations of two colored discs for subsequent report. During neutral trials, an uninformative cue instructed participants to remember the locations of both discs across a blank delay, and we observed a monotonic decrease in the fidelity of reconstructed spatial WM representations with time. During valid trials, a 100% reliable cue indicated that the color of the disc participants would be probed to report. Critically, valid cues were presented immediately after the termination of the encoding display ["valid early" (VE) trials] or midway through the delay period ("valid late" (VL) trials]. During VE trials, the gradual loss of location-specific information observed during neutral trials was eliminated, while during VL trials it was partially reversed. Our findings suggest that retrospective cues engage several different mechanisms that together serve to mitigate information loss during WM storage.

Previously, we have reported the left hippocampal volume increase and theta-gamma coupling (TGC) enhancement associated with working memory improvement following rTMS in depression. This study was aimed to examine whether there is a structure-function relationship in hippocampal neuroplasticity induced by prefrontal rTMS. Thirty-one patients with major depression underwent longitudinal MRI scans and resting-state EEG recordings with the 10-20 system using averaged ear-lobes reference, following 10 sessions of high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Pearson's correlation analyses were applied for the longitudinal changes among the left and right hippocampal volumes as measured by manual volumetry, theta and gamma spectral powers, and TGC as measured by resting-state EEG. The analyses demonstrated that the left hippocampus volume increases correlated with TGC increases at the left central area (r = 0.576, p = 0.001, N = 31), whereas no significant correlations were observed among changes of right hippocampal volume, right central TGC, bilateral gamma or theta powers. These finding suggests structure-function relationship in rTMS-induced neuroplastic changes mediated through the hippocampus and prefrontal network at the stimulated side. Therefore, high-frequency prefrontal rTMS may exert its cognitive effect through the hippocampal structural-functional neuroplasticity.

Planning versus comprehension in turn-taking: Fast responders show reduced anticipatory processing of the question	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Turn-taking; EEG; N400; Language comprehension; Language production; Prediction	BRAIN; TASK; CONVERSATION; INTERFERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; SIGNATURES; OVERLAP; MEG	Rapid response latencies in conversation suggest that responders start planning before the ongoing turn is finished. Indeed, an earlier EEG study suggests that listeners start planning their responses to questions as soon as they can (Bogels et al., 2015a). The present study aimed to (1) replicate this early planning effect and (2) investigate whether such early response planning incurs a cost on participants' concurrent comprehension of the ongoing turn. During the experiment participants answered questions from a confederate partner. To address aim (1), the questions were designed such that response planning could start either early or late in the turn. Our results largely replicate Bogels et al. (2015a), showing a large positive ERP effect and an oscillatory alpha/beta reduction right after participants could have first started planning their verbal response, again suggesting an early start of response planning. To address aim (2), the confederate's questions also contained either an expected word or an unexpected one to elicit a differential N400 effect, either before or after the start of response planning. We hypothesized an attenuated N400 effect after response planning had started. In contrast, the N400 effects before and after planning did not differ. There was, however, a positive correlation between participants' response time and their N400 effect size after planning had started; quick responders showed a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced attention to comprehension and possibly reduced anticipatory processing. We conclude that early response planning can indeed impact comprehension processing.

Eye-Closure Enhances Creative Performance on Divergent and Convergent Creativity Tasks	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						creativity; divergent thinking; convergent thinking; eye-closure; alpha-power; working memory	EEG-ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GAZE AVERSION; MEMORY LOAD; THINKING; SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; INCREASE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INTELLIGENCE	In today's world of rapid changes and increasing complexity, understanding and enhancing creativity is of critical importance. Studies investigating EEG correlates of creativity linked power in the alpha frequency band to creativity, and alpha-power has been interpreted as reflecting attention on internal mental representations and inhibition of external sensory input. Thus far, however, there is no direct evidence for the idea that internally directed attention facilitates creativity. The aim of the current study was to experimentally investigate the relationship between eye-closure-a simple and effective means to stimulate internally directed attention-and creativity. Moreover, to test whether the potential beneficial effect of eye-closure is specific for creativity, or whether it improves general cognitive functioning, the current study tested the effect of eye-closure on creativity and on working memory (WM). Participants completed four tasks to measure divergent and convergent creativity (Adapted Alternative Uses (AAU) Test, Remote Associates Test (RAT), Sentence Construction Test, and Word Construction Test), and one task to measure WM (Digit Span Test). For each task, participants had to perform two versions, one version with eyes open and one version with eyes closed. Eye-closure facilitated creative performance on the classical divergent and convergent creativity tasks (AAU Test and RAT). No effect of eye-closure was observed on the WM task. These findings provide a novel and easily applicable means to enhance divergent and convergent creativity through eye-closure.

Temporal predictions are modeled by the hazard function, which describes the instantaneous probability for an event to occur given it has not occurred yet. Here, we tackle the question of whether and how the human brain tracks continuous temporal hazard on a moment-to-moment basis, and how flexibly it adjusts to strictly implicit variations in the hazard function. We applied an encoding-model approach to human electroencephalographic data recorded during a pitch-discrimination task, in which we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability of the target tones by varying the interval between cue and target tone (i.e. the foreperiod). Critically, temporal predictability either was driven solely by the passage of time (resulting in a monotonic hazard function) or was modulated to increase at intermediate foreperiods (resulting in a modulated hazard function with a peak at the intermediate foreperiod). Forward-encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions, showing that implicit variations of temporal hazard bear tractable signatures in the human electroencephalogram. Notably, this tracking signal was reconstructed best from the supplementary motor area, underlining this area's link to cognitive processing of time. Our results underline the relevance of temporal hazard to cognitive processing and show that the predictive accuracy of the encoding-model approach can be utilized to track abstract time-resolved stimuli.

In this study, we explicitly manipulated the participants' focus of attention while they listened to the musical pieces. We used an ecologically valid experimental setting by presenting the musical stimuli simultaneously with naturalistic film sequences. In one condition, the participants were instructed to focus their attention on the musical piece (attentive listening), whereas in the second condition, the participants directed their attention to the film sequence (passive listening). We used two instrumental musical pieces: an electronic pop song, which was a major hit at the time of testing, and a classical musical piece. During music presentation, we measured electroencephalographic oscillations and responses from the autonomic nervous system (heart rate and high-frequency heart rate variability). During passive listening to the pop song, we found strong event-related synchronizations in all analyzed frequency bands (theta, lower alpha, upper alpha, lower beta, and upper beta). The neurophysiological responses during attentive listening to the pop song were similar to those of the classical musical piece during both listening conditions. Thus, the focus of attention had a strong influence on the neurophysiological responses to the pop song, but not on the responses to the classical musical piece. The electroencephalographic responses during passive listening to the pop song are interpreted as a neurophysiological and psychological state typically observed when the participants are drawn into the music'.

To greatly speed up sleep staging without compromising accuracy, we developed a novel framework for performing real-time automatic sleep stage classification. The client-server architecture adopted here provides an end-to-end solution for anonymizing and efficiently transporting polysomnography data from the client to the server and for receiving sleep stages in an interoperable fashion. The framework intelligently partitions the sleep staging task between the client and server in a way that multiple low-end clients can work with one server, and can be deployed both locally as well as over the cloud. The framework was tested on four datasets comprising (approximate to)1700 polysomnography records ((approximate to)12 000 hr of recordings) collected from adolescents, young, and old adults, involving healthy persons as well as those with medical conditions. We used two independent validation datasets: one comprising patients from a sleep disorders clinic and the other incorporating patients with Parkinson's disease. Using this system, an entire night's sleep was staged with an accuracy on par with expert human scorers but much faster ((approximate to)5 s compared with 30-60 min). To illustrate the utility of such real-time sleep staging, we used it to facilitate the automatic delivery of acoustic stimuli at targeted phase of slow-sleep oscillations to enhance slow-wave sleep.

Resting heart rate variability in young women is a predictor of EEG reactions to linguistic ambiguity in sentences	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Anxiety; Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs); Resting-state HRV; Semantic recognition; Stress; Uncertainty in decision-making	TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; SEX-DIFFERENCES	Recent research has found a relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive control mechanisms underlying various experimental tasks. This study explored the interaction between gender and resting-state HRV in brain oscillatory activity during visual recognition of linguistic ambiguity while taking state and trait anxiety scores into account. It is well known that stress or anxiety increases arousal levels, particularly under uncertainty situations. We tasked 50 young Mandarin speakers (26 women: average age 26.00 +/- 4.449) with the recognition of linguistic ambiguity in English (foreign) sentences with the purpose of imposing a sense of uncertainty in decision-making. Our results revealed a dependency between resting-state HRV and theta/alpha power in individual women. Low HRV women showed stronger theta/alpha desynchronization compared with their high HRV counterparts, independent of topographic localization. However, low and high HRV men exhibited comparable theta/alpha activity. Trait anxiety scores affected alpha power in the parieto-occipital regions, whereas men with higher scores and women with lower scores showed stronger alpha desynchronization. We posit that stress provoking situations may impose additional effects on theta/alpha desynchronization in the frontal and temporal regions, a condition in which the interdependency between brain oscillatory activity and resting-state HRV could interact with cognitive control differently in men and women.

We addressed here the possible early changes in spontaneous oscillatory brain activity after mTBI, and their feasibility as an indicator of injury in clinical evaluation. We recorded resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions from 26 patients (11 females and 15 males, aged 20-59) with mTBI 6days-6months after the injury, and compared their spontaneous oscillatory activity to corresponding data from 139 healthy controls. Twelve of the patients underwent a follow-up measurement at 6months. Ten of all patients were without structural lesions in MRI. At single-subject level, aberrant 4-7Hz (theta) band activity exceeding the +2 SD limit of the healthy subjects was visible in 7 out of 26 patients; three out of the seven patients with abnormal theta activity were without any detectable lesions in MRI. Of the patients that participated in the follow-up measurements, five showed abnormal theta activity in the first recording, but only two in the second measurement. Our results suggest that aberrant theta-band oscillatory activity can provide an early objective sign of brain dysfunction after mTBI. In 3/7 patients, the slow-wave activity was transient and visible only in the first recording, urging prompt timing for the measurements in clinical settings.

In this paper, a non-linear analytical methodology is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the phase-synchrony dynamics in epilepsy patients. A set of finite neuronal oscillators was adaptively extracted from a multi-channel electro-corticographic (ECoG) dataset utilizing noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode de-composition (NA-MEMD). Next, the instantaneous phases of the oscillatory functions were extracted using the Hilbert transform in order to be utilized in the mean-phase coherence analysis. The phase-synchrony dynamics were then assessed using eigenvalue decomposition. The extracted neuronal oscillators were grouped with respect to their frequency range into wideband (1-600 Hz), ripple (80-250 Hz), and fast-ripple (250-600 Hz) bands in order to investigate the dynamics of ECoG activity in these frequency ranges as seizures evolve. Drug-refractory patients with frontal and temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrated a reduction in phase-synchrony around seizure onset. However, the network phase-synchrony started to increase toward seizure end and achieved its maximum level at seizure offset for both types of epilepsy. This result suggests that hyper-synchronization of the epileptic network may be an essential self-regulatory mechanism by which the brain terminates seizures.

Haptic exploration attenuates and alters somatosensory cortical oscillations	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							MEDIAN NERVE-STIMULATION; LATENCY PERIPHERAL INPUTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SENSORY INPUT; MOTOR CORTEX; MOVEMENT; EEG; SUPPRESSION; DYNAMICS; CHILDREN	Several behavioural studies have shown that children have reduced sensory perceptions during movement; however, the neurophysiological nexus for these altered perceptions remains unknown. We used magnetoencephalographic brain imaging and advanced beamforming methods to address this knowledge gap. In our experiment, a cohort of children (aged 10-18 years) underwent stimulation of the median nerve when either sitting quietly (i.e. passive stimulation condition) or performing haptic exploration of a ball with the left hand. Our results revealed two novel observations. First, there was a relationship between the child's age and the strength of the beta (18-26 Hz) response seen within the somatosensory cortices during the passive stimulation condition. This suggests that there may be an age-dependent change in the processing of peripheral feedback by the somatosensory cortices. Second, all of the cortical regions that were active during the passive stimulation condition were almost completely gated during the haptic task. Instead, the haptic task involved neural oscillations within Brodmann area 2, which is known to convey less spatially precise tactile information but is involved in the processing of more complex somatosensations across the respective digits. These results imply that the reduced somatosensory perceptions seen during movements in healthy children may be related to the gating of certain neural generators, aswell as activation of haptic-specific neural generators within the somatosensory cortices. The utilization of such haptic-specific circuits during development may lead to the enhanced somatosensory processing during haptic exploration seen in healthy adults.

The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent it is possible to improve the effectiveness of operation of sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interfaces (SMR-BCI) by supplementing user training with elements modifying the characteristics of visual feedback. Four experimental groups had training designed to reinforce BCI control by: visual feedback in the form of dummy faces expressing emotions (Group 1); flashing the principal elements of visual feedback (Group 2) and giving both visual feedbacks in one condition (Group 3). The fourth group participated in training with no modifications (Group 4). Training consisted of a series of trials where the subjects directed a ball into a basket located to the right or left side of the screen. In Group 1 a schematic image a face, placed on the controlled object, showed various emotions, depending on the accuracy of control. In Group 2, the cue and targets were flashed with different frequency (4 Hz) than the remaining elements visible on the monitor. Both modifications were also used simultaneously in Group 3. SMR activity during the task was recorded before and after the training. In Group 3 there was a significant improvement in SMR control, compared to subjects in Group 2 and 4 (control). Differences between subjects in Groups 1, 2 and 4 (control) were insignificant. This means that relatively small changes in the training procedure may significantly impact the effectiveness of BCI control. Analysis of behavioural data acquired from all participants at training showed greater effectiveness in directing the object towards the right side of the screen. Subjects with the greatest improvement in SMR control showed a significantly lower difference in the accuracy of rightward and leftward movement than others.

Average spectral power changes at the hippocampal electroencephalogram in schizophrenia model induced by ketamine	FUNDAMENTAL & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalogram; hippocampus; ketamine; schizophrenia; spectral analysis	GRAPE SEED PROANTHOCYANIDINS; INDUCED MYOCARDIAL INJURY; OLIGOMERIC PROANTHOCYANIDINS; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; CARDIAC FIBROSIS; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION; CRATAEGUS; EXTRACT; ACID	The use of ketamine (Ket) as a pharmacological model of schizophrenia is an important tool for understanding the main mechanisms of glutamatergic regulated neural oscillations. Thus, the aim of the current study was to evaluate Ket-induced changes in the average spectral power using the hippocampal quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). To this end, male Wistar rats were submitted to a stereotactic surgery for the implantation of an electrode in the right hippocampus. After three days, the animals were divided into four groups that were treated for 10 consecutive days with Ket (10, 50, or 100 mg/kg). Brainwaves were captured on the 1st or 10th day, respectively, to acute or repeated treatments. The administration of Ket (10, 50, or 100 mg/kg), compared with controls, induced changes in the hippocampal average spectral power of delta, theta, alpha, gamma low or high waves, after acute or repeated treatments. Therefore, based on the alterations in the average spectral power of hippocampal waves induced by Ket, our findings might provide a basis for the use of hippocampal QEEG in animal models of schizophrenia.

Stable Microsaccades and Microsaccade-Induced Global Alpha Band Phase Reset Across the Life Span	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						microsaccade; spike potential; microsaccadic lambda response; alpha band synchronization; aging	SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENT; DISTINCTIVE FEATURES; COVERT ATTENTION; EEG; AGE; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; VELOCITY; LATENCY; ORIENTATION	PURPOSE. To understand the effect of aging on microsaccade functions and brain physiologic responses, we quantified microsaccades and their physiologic correlates (including their interaction with alpha band brain oscillation) in normal subjects of different ages. METHODS. Twenty-two normally sighted young (18 to 29 years), 22 middle-aged (31 to 55 years), and 22 elderly subjects (56 to 77 years) participated in this cross-sectional study. Dense array EEG and high-resolution eye-tracking data were simultaneously recorded during a fixation task. We quantified microsaccade features, spike potential (SP), microsaccadic lambda response (MLR) and microsaccade-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), and intertrial coherence (ITC) in the alpha and beta frequency bands and compared them between three age groups. RESULTS. After microsaccade onset, (1) alpha band ERSP increased (100 to 150 ms) occipitally and ITC increased (150 to 220 ms) globally in the brain; (2) low beta ITC increased (150 to 220 ms) in occipital and central regions and peaked (0 to 50 ms) in frontal region; and (3) high beta ITC increased (0 to 50 ms) globally with no beta band ERSP changes. Microsaccade features, the latency and amplitude of SP and MLR, and microsaccade-related temporalspectral power and synchronization dynamics were all stable across different age groups. CONCLUSIONS. Microsaccades are well preserved in aging and can be used as reference points for studying neurodegenerative or neuro-ophthalmologic diseases where the oculomotor system is affected. Microsaccade-induced alpha band activity is a potential biomarker to better understand and monitor these diseases, and we propose that microsaccades trigger `` cortical refreshment'' by resetting alpha band phase globally to prepare (sensitize) the brain for subsequent visual processing.

Phase-Amplitude Coupling of the Electroencephalogram in the Auditory Cortex in Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Auditory steady-state response; Electroencephalography; Generalized Morse wavelet; Phase-amplitude coupling; Resting state; Schizophrenia	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; EXCITABILITY; MECHANISMS; NETWORK; VOLUME; MODEL; GYRUS	BACKGROUND: Cross-frequency interactions may coordinate neural circuits operating at different frequencies. While neural oscillations associated with particular circuits in schizophrenia (SZ) are impaired, few studies have examined cross-frequency interactions. Here we examined phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the electroencephalograms of individuals with SZ and healthy control subjects (HCs). We computed PAC during the baseline period of 40-Hz auditory steady-state stimulation and rest. We hypothesized that subjects with SZ would show abnormal theta/gamma coupling during stimulation, especially in the left auditory cortex, and coupling with high frequencies would be higher during stimulation than during rest. METHODS: We reanalyzed data from 18 subjects with SZ and 18 HCs. Auditory cortex electroencephalogram activity was estimated using dipole source localization. PAC was computed using the debiased PAC measure, calculated with the generalized Morse wavelet transform. PAC clusters were identified using cluster-corrected permutation testing and interrogated in analyses of variance with correction for multiple tests. RESULTS: Overall, coupling of high beta and gamma amplitude was higher during the auditory steady-state response, while alpha/beta PAC was higher during rest. Theta/alpha PAC was higher in subjects with SZ than in HCs. Theta/gamma PAC was lateralized to the left hemisphere in HCs but was not lateralized in subjects with SZ. CONCLUSIONS: PAC involving high frequencies was state dependent and not abnormal in SZ. Increased theta/alpha PAC in subjects with SZ was consistent with other evidence of increased low-frequency activity. Hemispheric lateralization of theta/gamma PAC was reduced in subjects with SZ, consistent with evidence for left hemisphere auditory cortex abnormalities in subjects with SZ. PAC may reveal new insights into neural circuitry abnormalities in SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Thus, there is a great interest in identifying these modifications enough time in advance to prevent a dangerous effect and to intervene. In addition, these changes can be a risk factor for epileptic patients and can increase the possibility of death. Notably autonomic changes associated to seizures are highly depended of seizure type, localization and lateralization. The aim of this study was to develop a patient-specific approach to predict seizures using electrocardiogram (ECG) features. Specifically, from the RR series, both time and frequency variables and features obtained by the recurrence quantification analysis were used. The algorithm was applied in a dataset of 15 patients with 38 different types of seizures. A feature selection step, was used to identify those features that were more significant in discriminating preictal and interictal phases. A preictal interval of 15 minutes was selected. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was then built to classify preictal and interictal phases. First, a classifier was set up to classify preictal and interictal segments of each patient and an average sensibility of 89.06% was obtained, with a number of false positive per hour (FP/h) of 0.41. Then, in those patients who had at least 3 seizures, a double-cross-validation approach was used to predict unseen seizures on the basis of a training on previous ones. The results were quite variable according to seizure type, achieving the best performance in patients with more stereotypical seizure. The results of the proposed approach show that it is feasible to predict seizure in advance, considering patient-specific, and possible seizure specific, characteristics.

These fluctuations were found to be correlated across brain regions and are thought to reflect neuronal activity fluctuations between functionally connected areas of the brain. However, the origin of these infra-slow resting-state fluctuations remains unknown. Here, using a detailed computational model of the brain network, we show that spontaneous infra-slow (<0.05 Hz) activity could originate due to the ion concentration dynamics. The computational model implemented dynamics for intra- and extracellular k(+) and Na+ and intracellular Cl- ions, Na+/K+ exchange pump, and KCC2 cotransporter. In the network model simulating resting awake-like brain state, we observed infra-slow fluctuations in the extracellular K+ concentration, Na+/K+ pump activation, firing rate of neurons, and local field potentials. Holding K+ concentration constant prevented generation of the infra-slow fluctuations. The amplitude and peak frequency of this activity were modulated by the Na+/K+ pump, AMPA/GABA synaptic currents, and glial properties. Further, in a large-scale network with long-range connections based on CoCoMac connectivity data, the infra-slow fluctuations became synchronized among remote clusters similar to the resting-state activity observed in vivo. Overall, our study proposes that ion concentration dynamics mediated by neuronal and glial activity may contribute to the generation of very slow spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity that are reported as the resting-state fluctuations in fMRI and EEG recordings.

Several lines of evidence suggest that spindles are initiated within the thalamus, whereas slow waves are generated and modulated in the cortex. A decrease in sleep spindle activity has been described in Schizophrenia (SCZ), including chronic, early course, and early onset patients. In contrast, slow waves have been inconsistently found to be reduced in SCZ, possibly due to confounds like duration of illness and antipsychotic medication exposure. Nontheless, the implication of sleep spindles and slow waves in the neurobiology of SCZ and related disorders, including their heritability, remains largely unknown. Unaffected first-degree relatives (FDRs) share a similar genetic background and several neurophysiological and cognitive deficits with SCZ patients, and allow testing whether some of these measures are candidate endophenotypes. In this study, we performed sleep high-density EEG recordings to characterise the spatiotemporal features of sleep spindles and slow waves in FDRs of SCZ probands and healthy subjects (HS) with no family history of SCZ. We found a significant reduction of integrated spindle activity (ISAs) in FDRs relative to HS, whereas spindle density and spindle duration were not different between groups. FDRs also had decreased slow wave amplitude and slopes. Altogether, our results suggest that ISAs deficits might represent a candidate endophenotype for SCZ. Furthermore, given the slow wave deficits observed in FDRs, we propose that disrupted cortical synchronisation increases the risk for SCZ, but thalamic dysfunction is necessary for the disorder to fully develop.

Method: Adult rats were used to establish a lithium-pilocarpine (pilo) epileptic model, and were assigned to a lithium-pilocarpine (PILO), VPA + PILO, QUIN + PILO or CBX + PILO group. Intracranial electroencephalography was performed before and after status epilepticus (SE). The hippocampal connexin (CX) 43, CX32 and CX36 expressions were analyzed via western blotting. Results: The time required for the disappearance of SE after chloral hydrate injection was lower in the intervention groups than in the PILO group (p < 0.05). Seizures induced CX43 expression, but had no significant effects on CX36 or CX32 expressions. Pretreatment with VPA, QUIN and CBX inhibited CX43, CX36 and CX32 expression after SE. The average spectral power of the FRs was significantly lower in the VPA + PILO and QUIN + PILO groups than in the PILO group at 10 min after SE, 10 min before chloral hydrate injection, and 10 min after chloral hydrate injection (p < 0.05). The average spectral power of FRs was lower in the CBX + PILO group than in the PILO group at 10 min after SE (p < 0.05). The average spectral power of FRs in the 3 intervention groups recovered to the baseline level at 10 min after chloral hydrate injection and persisted for 3 days after SE. The dynamic changes in the average and peak spectral power of FRs were similar. Significance: After SE, CX may participate in pathological FR generation by establishing abnormal electrical synaptic transmission. Gap junction blockers can inhibit various CX expressions, and thus decrease FR energy and alleviate the degree of seizure. These findings could contribute to the development of new anti-epileptic drugs with novel mechanistic targets.

Although some studies suggest that distress is encoded by changes in alpha activity and functional connectivity between specific brain regions, no study that we know has delved into the whole brain temporal dynamics of the distress component. In the current study, we compare the changes in the mean and variance of functional connectivity and small-worldness parameter over 3 min of resting state EEG to analyze the fluctuation in transient stable states, and network structure. On comparing these measures between healthy controls and patients experiencing low and high levels of distress due to a continuous ringing in the ear (tinnitus), we observe an increase in fluctuation between transient stable states characterized by an increase in both variance of functional connectivity and the small-worldness parameter. This results in a possible increase in degrees of freedom leading to a paradoxical equilibrium of the network structure in highly distressed patients. This may also be interpreted as a maladaptive compensation to look for information in order to reduce the hypersalience in highly distressed individuals. In addition, this is correlated with the amount of distress only in the high distress tinnitus group, suggesting a catastrophic breakdown of the brain's resilience. Distress not only accompanies tinnitus, but other disorders such as somatic disorders, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc. Since the current study focuses on a disorder-general distress symptom, the methods and results of the current study have a wide application in different neuropathologies.

In order to systematically investigate how specific parameters of tACS affect working memory, we manipulated the frequency of stimulation (theta frequency vs. gamma frequency), the type of task (n-back vs. change detection task) and the content of the tasks (verbal vs. figural stimuli). A repeated measures design was used that consisted of three sessions: theta tACS, gamma tACS and sham tACS. In total, four experiments were conducted which differed only with respect to placement of tACS electrodes (bilateral frontal, bilateral parietal, left fronto-parietal and right-fronto parietal). Healthy female students (N = 72) were randomly assigned to one of these groups, hence we were able to assess the efficacy of theta and gamma tACS applied over different brain areas, contrasted against sham stimulation. The pre-post/sham resting electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis showed that theta tACS significantly affected theta amplitude, whereas gamma tACS had no significant effect on EEG amplitude in any of the frequency bands of interest. Gamma tACS did not significantly affect working memory performance compared to sham, and theta tACS led to inconsistent changes in performance on the n-back tasks. Active theta tACS significantly affected P3 amplitude and latency during performance on the n-back tasks in the bilateral parietal and right-fronto parietal protocols.

Stress Elevates Frontal Midline Theta in Feedback-based Category Learning of Exceptions	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MULTIPLE MEMORY-SYSTEMS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR; BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; CORTISOL RESPONSES; CONFLICT DETECTION; PREDICTION ERRORS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING	Adapting behavior based on category knowledge is a fundamental cognitive function, which can be achieved via different learning strategies relying on different systems in the brain. Whereas the learning of typical category members has been linked to implicit, prototype abstraction learning, which relies predominantly on prefrontal areas, the learning of exceptions is associated with explicit, exemplar-based learning, which has been linked to the hippocampus. Stress is known to foster implicit learning strategies at the expense of explicit learning. Procedural, prefrontal learning and cognitive control processes are reflected in frontal midline theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations during feedback processing. In the current study, we examined the effect of acute stress on feedback-based category learning of typical category members and exceptions and the oscillatory correlates of feedback processing in the EEG. A computational modeling procedure was applied to estimate the use of abstraction and exemplar strategies during category learning. We tested healthy, male participants who underwent either the socially evaluated cold pressor test or a nonstressful control procedure before they learned to categorize typical members and exceptions based on feedback. The groups did not differ significantly in their categorization accuracy or use of categorization strategies. In the EEG, however, stressed participants revealed elevated theta power specifically during the learning of exceptions, whereas the theta power during the learning of typical members did not differ between the groups. Elevated frontal theta power may reflect an increased involvement of medial prefrontal areas in the learning of exceptions under stress.

Despite extensive investigations of underlying the neural background, mechanisms of the distortion still remain unknown. The current study analyzed brain oscillatory dynamics in different frequencies during resting state and presentation of affective stimuli in nonclinical individuals with high Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores (HB) versus controls. Both behavioral and electrocortical markers of clinical depression were apparent at subclinical level. A resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) of HB revealed increased power in low frequencies, predominantly in the frontal cortical areas, that is in accordance with a spatio-temporal dysfunction model of depression. Related to that, transition from an eyes-closed to eyes-open condition was associated with diminished alpha blockade in HB, suggesting difficulties with the relocation of attention focus from inner processes toward environmental stimuli. Subsequently, independently of a sign of emotion, five out of six discrete emotions were evaluated as less valenced and four out of six as less intense by HB than by controls, corroborating the view of emotion context insensitivity (ECI) associated with depression. Underlying brain oscillatory dynamics revealed that depression was associated with deficits in the early, implicit, processing stages of emotional stimuli. Later processing stages were characterized by prominent power surges in low and alpha frequencies, presumably indicating emotion upregulation processes and increased engagement of cognitive mechanisms in affective tasks. The study provides brain oscillatory-based mechanisms of emotion processing distortions associated with depression.

The MFB stimulation produces a highly reliable behavioral output that enabled a clear distinction of the animal behavioral states between the non-ICSS and ICSS periods. However, the cortical states during these reward-seeking behaviors are not fully characterized in comparison to those during volitional behavior. This study was designed to characterize the cortical rhythms of and coherence between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during the wheel-turning behavior reinforced by the ICSS in comparison to the wheel-turning without ICSS. We used a wheel for freely moving mice, which was programmed to deliver cathode currents through an electrode in the MFB at each one-quarter turn of the wheel to induce ICSS. The wheel-turning epochs were extracted from the pre-ICSS, ICSS and post-ICSS sessions and the prefrontal EEGs and the hippocampal LFPs in the epochs were analyzed with power and synchronization analyses. During the ICSS, the EEG power decreased at 6 similar to 10 Hz in the prefrontal cortex, while was not significantly altered in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we found that the phase synchrony between the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus corresponding to information transmission between the two regions during reward-seeking motion decreased preceding MFB stimulation reinforced by ICSS. Our findings suggest that theta-activity can be reliably dissociated from active behavior if the animal is involved in self-stimulation.

Short summary: EEG recordings and ERP measurements of young adults with positive and negative family history of alcoholism where obtained while they performed a Go/No-Go task to assess inhibitory processes. Offspring of alcoholics showed a different ERP pattern compared to the control group and exerted greater effort than the control group. Methods: ERP measurements were obtained by electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of 65 participants divided into two groups: one group of 30 subjects with positive family history of alcoholism and a control group of 35 subjects with negative family history of alcoholism. They performed a Go/No-Go task, where each individual was required to classify visual stimuli by colour (Go) and inhibit their response to a No-Go signal. Results: OA have higher P3 amplitudes during the Go condition in all of the regions analysed and higher No-Go P3 amplitudes than control subjects in the frontal region. Unlike controls, OA have no differences between the P3 amplitudes across conditions. Conclusions: The absence of differences between the P3 Go and No-Go observed in the OA group can be interpreted as a possible alteration related with inhibition, in a way that they may need to recruit similar resources for inhibitory and classificational processes for both conditions. Therefore, the P3 component may be considered as a useful endophenotype and a vulnerability marker to develop addictive behaviour.

Additionally, a transition state is often discriminated which in rodents is termed intermediate stage (IS). Although these sleep stages are thought of as unitary phenomena affecting the whole brain in a congruent fashion, recent findings have suggested that sleep stages can also appear locally restricted to specific networks and regions. Here, we compared in rats sleep stages and their transitions between neocortex and hippocampus. We simultaneously recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from skull electrodes over frontal and parietal cortex and the local field potential (LFP) from the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus. Results indicate a high congruence in the occurrence of sleep and SWS (>96.5%) at the different recording sites. Congruence was lower for REM sleep (>87%) and lowest for IS (<36.5%). Incongruences occurring at sleep stage transitions were most pronounced for REM sleep which in 36.6 per cent of all epochs started earlier in hippocampal LFP recordings than in the other recordings, with an average interval of 17.2 +/- 1.1 s between REM onset in the hippocampal LFP and the parietal EEG (p < 0.001). Earlier REM onset in the hippocampus was paralleled by a decrease in muscle tone, another hallmark of REM sleep. These findings indicate a region-specific regulation of REM sleep which has clear implications not only for our understanding of the organization of sleep, but possibly also for the functions, e.g. in memory formation, that have been associated with REM sleep.

This measure was specifically developed for weighted graphs, but it can also be applied to binary graphs. The proposed complexity measure was designed to capture the interplay between two properties of a system: the 'information' (calculated by means of Shannon entropy) and the 'order' of the system (estimated by means of a disequilibrium measure). SGC is based on the concept that complex graphs should maintain an equilibrium between the aforementioned two properties, which can be measured by means of the edge weight distribution. In this study, SGC was assessed using four synthetic graph datasets and a real dataset, formed by electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from controls and schizophrenia patients. SGC was compared with graph density (GD), a classical measure used to evaluate graph complexity. Our results showed that SGC is invariant with respect to GD and independent of node degree distribution. Furthermore, its variation with graph size (N) is close to zero for N > 30. Results from the real dataset showed an increment in the weight distribution balance during the cognitive processing for both controls and schizophrenia patients, although these changes are more relevant for controls. Our findings revealed that SGC does not need a comparison with null-hypothesis networks constructed by a surrogate process. In addition, SGC results on the real dataset suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a deficit in the brain dynamic reorganization related to secondary pathways of the brain network.

EEG recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a target event. PD patients ("on" medication) and healthy controls performed two sessions: in the first the regularity of the predictive sequence was implicit, while in the second this regularity was made explicit. PD and control subjects showed shorter reaction times for predicted versus random targets across both the implicit and explicit sessions. Healthy controls showed a facilitation of the P3b latency for predicted targets (compared with random targets) in both the implicit and explicit sessions, while PD patients showed no significant P3b latency differences between the two target conditions across both sessions. In healthy controls the P3b amplitude of the last most-informative stimulus of the predictive sequence (n-1) was larger in the explicit compared to the implicit session, while this difference was absent in PD patients. Functional connectivity measures showed that during the explicit and implicit sessions detection of n-1 was associated with higher gamma values and weaker fronto-central-parietal connections, in the theta band, in PD compared to controls. The findings suggest that implicit and explicit processing of predictive contextual information is altered in PD patients and that this may be associated with functional connectivity abnormalities within top-down frontal networks.

The human electrocerebellogram (ECeG) recorded non-invasively using scalp electrodes	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Cerebellum; Electrocerebellogram (ECeG); Vection	CEREBELLAR CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; STIMULATION; SYSTEMS; MONKEY	The electrocerebellogram (ECeG), a manifestation of cerebellar cortical local field potentials (LFPs), is characterised by a predominance of high frequency components at the gamma range (30-80 Hz) and beyond up to several hundred Hz, in contrast to the electroencephalogram (EEG) which is composed predominantly of lower frequencies at or below the gamma range. Although the potential clinical role of the ECeG has been suggested, the prospect of a non-invasive method for routine recording in humans has remained elusive. Here we show for the first time that high-frequency power characteristic of the ECeG may be easily measurable using surface electrodes placed over the posterior fossa at the approximate original 10/20 CB location. In a sample of six subjects we have compared continuous electrical recordings in a supine posture under visual motion stimulation at CB1/2, about 5% inferior and medial to PO9/10 of the 10-10 system, with those at standard 10/20 locations of C3/4 and O1/2, as well as over the splenius muscles as controls against myogenic contamination. In a neutral baseline condition high-frequency power was significantly greater over the posterior fossa, especially in ultra gamma (80-160 Hz) and very high frequency (VHF, 160-320 Hz) bands, compared to occipital or central leads. We also found that visual stimulation, in the form of visual motion in particular, was effective in increasing the high-frequency power in CB electrodes, including in beta (14-30 Hz) and gamma, compared with electrodes over the occipital and frontal cortex. We propose that the human ECeG can be recorded non-invasively and may have application both in understanding cerebellar function and clinically.	[Todd, Neil P.

An EEG study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Empathy; Pain; Racial bias; ERP; EEG oscillations; Information processing	MEASURING INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST; NEURAL RESPONSES; OTHERS PAIN; INTERGROUP RELATIONSHIPS; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN; RACE; INFORMATION	The aim of this study was to identify racial bias influences on empathic processing from early stimulus encoding, over categorization until late motor processing stages by comparing brain responses (electroencephalogram) to pictures of fair-and dark-colored hands in painful or neutral daily-life situations. Participants performed a pain judgment task and a skin color judgment task. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) substantiated former findings of automatic empathic influences on stimulus encoding, reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN), and late controlled influences on the stimulus categorization, as reflected by the late posterior positivity (P3b). Concerning the racial bias in empathy (RBE) effect, more positive amplitudes in the 280-340 ms time window over frontocentral electrodes in the painful than the neutral condition for fair- but not dark-colored hands speak for an early influence of racial bias. This was further supported by correlations with empathic concern scores for fair- but not dark-colored stimuli. Additionally, P3b amplitude differences between fair- and dark-colored hands to painful stimuli increased with the implicit racial attitude of participants, suggesting that the categorization stage is not completely immune to racial bias. Regarding the motor processing stages, power change values in the upper beta-band (19-30 Hz) revealed for painful compared to neutral stimuli larger facilitation of sensorimotor activity before the response and larger inhibition after the response, independent of skin color. In conclusion, present findings speak for an influence of the RBE on early perceptual encoding but also on the late categorization stage that depends on the participant's implicit attitude towards racial outgroups.

After presenting brief video clips of a soccer scene, participants had to imagine themselves as the acting player and to think either of a creative/original or an obvious/conventional move (control condition) that might lead to a goal. Performance of the soccer task generally elicited comparatively strong alpha power decreases at parietal and occipital sites, indicating high visuospatial processing demands. This power decrease was less pronounced in the creative vs. control condition, reflecting a more internally oriented state of information processing characterized by more imaginative mental simulation rather than stimulus-driven bottom-up processing. In addition, more creative task performance in the soccer task was associated with stronger alpha desynchronization at left cortical sites, most prominently over motor related areas. This finding suggests that individuals who generated more creative moves were more intensively engaged in processes related to movement imagery. Unlike the domain-specific creativity measure, individual's trait creative potential, as assessed by a psychometric creativity test, was globally positively associated with alpha power at all cortical sites. In investigating creative processes implicated in complex creative behavior involving more ecologically valid demands, this study showed that thinking creatively in soccer decision-making situations recruits specific brain networks supporting processes related to visuospatial attention and movement imagery, while the relative increase in alpha power in more creative conditions and in individuals with higher creative potential might reflect a pattern relevant across different creativity domains.

In our case, the target was the primary motor cortex (M1). We identified the endogenous neurodynamics of hand M1's subgroups of pyramidal neuronal pools in each of our subjects by applying Functional Source Separation (FSS) to their EEG recordings. We then tested whether the corticospinal excitability of the hand representation under the above described stimulation, which we named transcranial individual neurodynamics stimulation (tIDS), was higher than in the absence of stimulation (baseline). As a check, we compared tIDS with the most efficient noninvasive facilitatory corticospinal tES known so far, which is 20 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). The control conditions were as follows: (1) sham, (2) transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) in the same frequency range as tIDS (1-250 Hz), and (3) a low current tIDS (tIDS(low)). Corticospinal excitability was measured with motor-evoked potentials under transcranial magnetic stimulation. The mean motor-evoked potential amplitude increase was 31% of the baseline during tIDS (p < 0.001), and it was 15% during tACS (p = 0.096). tRNS, tIDS(low), and sham induced no effects. Whereas tACS did not produce an enhancement in any subject at the individual level, tIDS was successful in producing an enhancement in 8 of the 16 subjects.

Methods: Members of the European Society for Paediatric Anaesthesiology were invited to participate in an online survey about their thoughts regarding the use, applicability and reliability of hypnosis monitoring in children. Results: The survey achieved a response rate of 30% (N = 168). A total of 138 completed surveys were included for further analysis. Sixty-eight respondents used hypnosis monitoring in children (Users) and 70 did not (Non-users). Sixty-five percent of the Users reported prevention of intra-operative awareness as their main reason to apply hypnosis monitoring. Among the Non-users, the most frequently given reason (43%) not to use hypnosis monitoring in children was the perceived lack or reliability of the devices in children. Hypnosis monitoring is used with a higher frequency during propofol anaesthesia than during inhalation anaesthesia. Hypnosis monitoring is furthermore used more frequently in children > 4 years than in younger children. An ideal hypnosis monitor should be reliable for all age groups and any (combination of) anaesthetic drug. We found no agreement in the interpretation of monitor index values and subsequent anaesthetic interventions following from it. Conclusions: Prevention of intraoperative awareness appears to be the most important reason to use hypnosis monitoring in children. The perceived lack of reliability of hypnosis monitoring in children is the most important reasons not to use it. No consensus currently exists on how to adjust anaesthesia according to hypnosis monitor index values in children.

Methods: Time domain HRV parameters of 24-hour data, frequency and non-linear domain HRV parameters were calculated using a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) from subjects in a resting and awake state (5-min data from 9:00-10:00 a.m.). Circadian fluctuation (24 one-hour segments) and the night (00:00 - 05:00)/day (07:30 - 09:30) ratio of each HRV parameter were measured in (i) refractory epilepsy (n = 51) and (ii) healthy, age and sex matched controls (n = 50). Cosinor fit method was used to quantify the pattern of the circadian rhythm of HRV. Results: Compared to healthy controls, patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had significantly decreased time domain (mean_RR, STDRR, RMSSD, pNN50, HRV_triangular_index), frequency domain (VLF_power, LF_power, HF_power, Total_power) and non-linear domain (Poincare SD1, SD2, D-2) HRV measurements. There were also overall reductions in amplitude and the baseline of circadian curves of HRV parameter in the patients group, especially nocturnal inhibition of cardiac autonomic modulations was stronger than that in daytime. The majority of differences in HRV values between the two groups reached a maximum in early morning (usually 5:00 or 6:00 am.). No significant differences were found in the night/day ratios of multi-domain HRV measurements between patients and healthy controls (p = 0.862). Conclusions: The significant suppression of HRV parameters in patients with refractory epilepsy may reflect the inhibitions of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. This is notably the first time that marked circadian diversity of HRV measurments between the patient and control groups were found and quantified by cosinor fit method. The difference in amplitude increased during night with peak occurrence between 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. These findings may be linked to cardiac autonomic dysfunction and subsequent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is reported to often occur during night or early morning. Taken together, HRV parameters may be potential bio-markers for predicting SUDEP.

Modulating functional connectivity after stroke with neurofeedback: Effect on motor deficits in a controlled cross-over study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; EEG; Functional connectivity; Motor cortex; Stroke	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; DEFAULT MODE; HUMAN BRAIN; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION; PERFORMANCE; RECOVERY	Synchronization of neural activity as measured with functional connectivity (FC) is increasingly used to study the neural basis of brain disease and to develop new treatment targets. However, solid evidence for a causal role of FC in disease and therapy is lacking. Here, we manipulated FC of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex in ten chronic human stroke patients through brain-computer interface technology with visual neurofeedback. We conducted a double-blind controlled crossover study to test whether manipulation of FC through neurofeedback had a behavioral effect on motor performance. Patients succeeded in increasing FC in the motor cortex. This led to improvement in motor function that was significantly greater than during neurofeedback training of a control brain area and proportional to the degree of FC enhancement. This result provides evidence that FC has a causal role in neurological function and that it can be effectively targeted with therapy.

Competitive learning modulates memory consolidation during sleep	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Competition; Oscillations; Prioritization; Reactivation; Reward; Consolidation	DEPENDENT MEMORY; REACTIVATION; RETRIEVAL; SPINDLES; DENSITY; BRAIN; LEADS; EEG	Competition between memories can cause weakening of those memories. Here we investigated memory competition during sleep in human participants by presenting auditory cues that had been linked to two distinct picture-location pairs during wake. We manipulated competition during learning by requiring participants to rehearse picture-location pairs associated with the same sound either competitively (choosing to rehearse one over the other, leading to greater competition) or separately; we hypothesized that greater competition during learning would lead to greater competition when memories were cued during sleep. With separate-pair learning, we found that cueing benefited spatial retention. With competitive-pair learning, no benefit of cueing was observed on retention, but cueing impaired retention of well-learned pairs (where we expected strong competition). During sleep, post-cue beta power (16-30 Hz) indexed competition and predicted forgetting, whereas sigma power (11-16 Hz) predicted subsequent retention. Taken together, these findings show that competition between memories during learning can modulate how they are consolidated during sleep.

Sleep spindles and cognitive performance across adolescence: A meta-analytic review	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE			English	Review						Sleep spindles; Cognitive performance; IQ; Children; Adolescents; EEG	DECLARATIVE MEMORY; STAGE-2 SLEEP; KINDERGARTEN-CHILDREN; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; INTELLIGENCE; BRAIN; CONSOLIDATION; FINGERPRINT; ABILITIES; PUBERTY	Higher sleep spindle activity generally relates to better cognitive performance in adults, while studies in children often show the opposite. As children become young adults, there is rapid brain maturation and development of higher-order cognitive functions, and therefore investigations within this age group may elucidate the relationship between spindles and cognition in this developmental period. Twelve studies published between 2009 and 2016 were identified. Meta analyses revealed a positive relationship between spindles and cognition overall (r = 0.27), however effects varied depending on cognitive domain. Moderate positive relationships were seen for fluid IQ (r = 0.44), working memory/executive function (r = 0.40) and speed/accuracy (r = 0.33), while full IQ/verbal IQ was not significantly associated (r = -0.05). Meta-regressions indicated cognitive domain and spindle characteristic had a small influence over effect sizes, while age and gender did not have a significant influence. The relationship between spindles and cognition in adolescents is likely influenced by individual neural makeup and brain maturation.	[Reynolds, C. M.; Short, M.

It has been demonstrated that sleep spindle is related to memory consolidation, neurodegenerative disease, and mental disorders. Slow wave activity (0.5-4 Hz) is the most prominent EEG activity during sleep and appears as a large, spontaneous synchronization of cortical neurons. The role of slow wave activity has been proposed to regulate synaptic strength and memory consolidation. Many studies have investigated the effect of acoustic stimuli during the sleep slow wave. However, there have been few studies which investigated an effect of acoustic stimulation during sleep spindle activity. In this study, we examined the neurophysiological effect of acoustic stimulation during sleep spindle activity. We delivered pink noise after the detection of sleep spindle, and surmised that acoustic stimulation after sleep spindle detection may preserve delta activity during ongoing sleep. Further, we observed suppression of the sleep spindle activity around the times of acoustic stimulation and evoked slow wave activity and theta band activity immediately after tone onset.

So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for gamma type of brain waves. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data and considered four situations: sleeping, relaxing, active and moving. Then, we used mean-shift clustering algorithm to cluster the data. The evaluation results show that our testbed can judge the human situation by using delta, theta, gamma and alpha brain waves.

Sleep-like cortical OFF-periods disrupt causality and complexity in the brain of unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; THALAMIC-STIMULATION; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; NETWORK MECHANISMS; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; DELTA WAVES; CONSCIOUSNESS; DISORDERS; RECOVERY	Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients may retain intact portions of the thalamocortical system that are spontaneously active and reactive to sensory stimuli but fail to engage in complex causal interactions, resulting in loss of consciousness. Here, we show that loss of brain complexity after severe injuries is due to a pathological tendency of cortical circuits to fall into silence (OFF-period) upon receiving an input, a behavior typically observed during sleep. Spectral and phase domain analysis of EEG responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals the occurrence of OFF-periods in the cortex of UWS patients (N = 16); these events never occur in healthy awake individuals (N = 20) but are similar to those detected in healthy sleeping subjects (N = 8). Crucially, OFF-periods impair local causal interactions, and prevent the build-up of global complexity in UWS.

This paper investigates the effect of acute stress on brain activity using task switching. Surprisingly few studies have been conducted in this area. There is behavioral and physiological evidence to indicate that acute stress makes the participants more tense which results in a better performance. In this current study, under stressful conditions, the participants gave quick responses with high accuracy. However, unexpected results were found in relation to salivary cortisol. Furthermore, the electroencephalogram results showed that acute stress was pronounced at the frontal and parietal midline cortex, especially on the theta, alpha, and gamma bands. One possible explanation for these results may be that the participants changed their strategy in relation to executive functions during stressful conditions by paying more attention which resulted in a higher working memory capacity which enhanced performance during the task switching.

Early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's with event-related potentials and event-related desynchronization in N-back working memory tasks	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Alzheimer'S disease; Mild cognitive impairment; Working memory; Event-related potentials; Event-related (de)synchronization	MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG DYNAMICS; BAND POWER; DISEASE; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; HEALTHY; PROGRESSION	Background and Objective: In this study we investigate whether or not event-related potentials (ERP) and/or event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) can be used to differentiate between 27 healthy elderly (HE), 21 subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 15 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Methods: Using 32-channel EEG recordings, we measured ERP responses to a three-level (N-back, N = 0,1,2) visual working memory task. We also performed ERD analysis over the same EEG data, dividing the full-band signal into the well-known delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Both ERP and ERD analyses were followed by cluster analysis with correction for multicomparisons whenever significant differences were found between groups. Results: Regarding ERP (full-band analysis), our findings have shown both patient groups (MCI and AD) with reduced P450 amplitude (compared to HE controls) in the execution of the non-match 1-back task at many scalp electrodes, chiefly at parietal and centro-parietal areas. However, no significant differences were found between MCI and AD in ERP analysis whatever was the task. As for sub-band analyses, ERD/ERS measures revealed that HE subjects elicited consistently greater alpha ERD responses than MCI and AD patients during the 1-back task in the match condition, with all differences located at frontal, central and occipital regions. Moreover, in the non-match condition, it was possible to distinguish between MCI and AD patients when they were performing the 0-back task, with MCI presenting more desynchronization than AD on the theta band at temporal and fronto-temporal areas. In summary, ERD analyses have revealed themselves more valuable than ERP, since they showed significant differences in all three group comparisons: HE vs. MCI, HE vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD. Conclusions: Based on these findings, we conclude that ERD responses to working memory (N-back) tasks could be useful not only for early MCI diagnosis or for improved AD diagnosis, but probably also for assessing the likelihood of MCI progression to AD, after further validated by a longitudinal study.

Analytic Tools for Post-traumatic Epileptogenesis Biomarker Search in Multimodal Dataset of an Animal Model and Human Patients	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						MRI; EEG; epilepsy; epileptogenesis; informatics; neuroimaging; TBI; biomarker	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DIFFUSION-TENSOR; PERIVASCULAR SPACES; MRI; EEG; STATE; ABNORMALITIES; SEGMENTATION; CONNECTIVITY	Epilepsy is among the most common serious disabling disorders of the brain, and the global burden of epilepsy exerts a tremendous cost to society. Most people with epilepsy have acquired forms of the disorder, and the development of antiepileptogenic interventions could potentially prevent or cure epilepsy in many of them. However, the discovery of potential antiepileptogenic treatments and clinical validation would require a means to identify populations of patients at very high risk for epilepsy after a potential epileptogenic insult, to know when to treat and to document prevention or cure. A fundamental challenge in discovering biomarkers of epileptogenesis is that this process is likely multifactorial and crosses multiple modalities. Investigators must have access to a large number of high quality, well-curated data points and study subjects for biomarker signals to be detectable above the noise inherent in complex phenomena, such as epileptogenesis, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and conditions of data collection. Additionally, data generating and collecting sites are spread worldwide among different laboratories, clinical sites, heterogeneous data types, formats, and across multi-center preclinical trials. Before the data can even be analyzed, these data must be standardized. The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) is a multicenter project with the overarching goal that epileptogenesis after TBI can be prevented with specific treatments. The identification of relevant biomarkers and performance of rigorous preclinical trials will permit the future design and performance of economically feasible full-scale clinical trials of antiepileptogenic therapies. We have been analyzing human data collected from UCLA and rat data collected from the University of Eastern Finland, both centers collecting data for EpiBioS4Rx, to identify biomarkers of epileptogenesis. Big data techniques and rigorous analysis are brought to longitudinal data collected from humans and an animal model of TBI, epilepsy, and their interaction. The prolonged continuous data streams of intracranial, cortical surface, and scalp EEG from humans and an animal model of epilepsy span months. By applying our innovative mathematical tools via supervised and unsupervised learning methods, we are able to subject a robust dataset to recently pioneered data analysis tools and visualize multivariable interactions with novel graphical methods.

It must be carried out by an epileptologist/neurophysiologist with sufficient training and qualification in this field. The objectives of the interpretation are to define the brain topography of interictal activities (irritative zone) and the epileptogenic zone, defined as the site of primary organization of ictal discharges. Several patterns of seizure onset are possible, the most typical including fast discharges. The interpretation of the SEEG is based on the recording of spontaneous activity but also on the results of intracerebral electrical stimulation. It must be done with accurate anatomical information on the location of the electrodes in terms of the patient's anatomy. Quantification of interictal activities (spikes, high frequency oscillations) and ictal activity (epileptogenicity index) is recommended. The interpretation of the SEEG must also take into account functional data and will be the basis for the final decision on the operability and type of intervention chosen.

Several conditions are investigated: background/eyes closed; background/eyes opened; listening to instructions for the cognitive task; operative rest (time lapse between listening to instructions and the beginning of the task); as well as short intervals immediately preceding exposure to target stimuli (preparatory stage), which were paired facial images with identical or different emotional expressions. At all these pre-task stages, high-anxiety subjects exhibit much lower electroencephalograph amplitude values for alpha and theta bands (as compared with low-anxiety subjects). The most prominent differences in electroencephalograph amplitude values revealed during the phases of listening to instructions and operative rest. These datum may provide more precise electrophysiological markers of the level of anxiety during conditions preceding cognitive task performance.

Previous studies have demonstrated changes in behavior and gait with increased sensory and cognitive load, but the underlying cortical mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study. in a mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approach, 16 young adults walked on a treadmill with high-density EEG while 3-dimensional (3D) motion capture tracked kinematics of the head and feet. Visual load was manipulated with the presentation of optic flow with and without continuous mediolateral perturbations. The effects of cognitive load were assessed by the performance of a go/no-go task on half of the blocks. During increased sensory load, participants walked with shorter and wider strides. which may indicate a more restrained pattern of gait. Interestingly. cognitive task engagement attenuated these effects of sensory load on gait. Using an independent component analysis and dipole-filling approach, we found that cautious gait was accompanied by neuro-oscillatory modulations localized to frontal (supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex) and parietal (inferior parietal lobule, precuneus) areas. Our results show suppression in alpha/mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) rhythms. suggesting enhanced activation of these regions with unreliable sensory inputs. These findings provide insight into the neural correlates of gait adaptation and may be particularly relevant to older adults who are less able to adjust to ongoing cognitive and sensory demands while walking. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The neural underpinnings of gait adaptation in humans are poorly understood. To this end, we recorded high-density EEG combined with three-dimensional body motion tracking as participants walked on a treadmill while exposed to full-field optic flow stimulation. Perturbed visual input led to a more cautious gait pattern with neuro-oscillatory modulations localized to premotor and parietal regions. Our findings show a possible brain-behavior link that might further our understanding of gait and mobility impairments.

The idea consists in setting up the audiometric profile without subjective inference from patients and evaluators. The challenge encountered is to reduce the detection time of auditory thresholds reaching high correlation coefficients between the objective and the conventional thresholds, as well as reducing difference between thresholds. Methods: This paper evaluated the use of the Multiple Magnitude-Squared Coherence (MMSC) in Auditory Steady-State Responses (ASSRs) evoked by amplitude modulated tones around 40 Hz, attaining objective audiograms, which were, later, compared to conventional audiograms. It was proposed an analysis of the electroencephalogram signals of ten subjects, monaurally stimulated, in the intensities 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 dB SPL, for carrier frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz. After the detection protocol parameters variation, two detectors were selected according to behavioral thresholds. Results: The method of this study resulted in a Maximum detector with correlation coefficient r = 0.9262, mean difference between the objective and behavioral thresholds of 6.44 dB SPL, average detection time per ear of 49.96 min and per stimulus of 2.08 min. Meanwhile, the Fast detector presented coefficient r = 0.8401, mean difference of 6.81 dB SPL, average detection time of 28.20 min per ear and 1.18 per stimulus. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the MMSC use in the auditory responses detection might provide a reliable and efficient estimation of auditory thresholds. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Sensorimotor Oscillations During a Reciprocal Touch Paradigm With a Human or Robot Partner	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						human-robot interaction; mu desynchronization; beta synchronization; social robotics; tactile perception	TACTILE STIMULATION; BODY MAPS; ALPHA; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; RHYTHMS; EEG; POTENTIALS; EDUCATION; DYNAMICS	Robots provide an opportunity to extend research on the cognitive, perceptual, and neural processes involved in social interaction. This study examined how sensorimotor oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) activity can be influenced by the perceived nature of a task partner - human or robot - during a novel "reciprocal touch" paradigm. Twenty adult participants viewed a demonstration of a robot that could "feel" tactile stimulation through a haptic sensor on its hand and "see" changes in light through a photoreceptor at the level of the eyes; the robot responded to touch or changes in light by moving a contralateral digit. During EEG collection, participants engaged in a joint task that involved sending tactile stimulation to a partner (robot or human) and receiving tactile stimulation back. Tactile stimulation sent by the participant was initiated by a button press and was delivered 1500 ms later via an inflatable membrane on the hand of the human or on the haptic sensor of the robot partner. Stimulation to the participant's finger (from the partner) was sent on a fixed schedule, regardless of partner type. We analyzed activity of the sensorimotor mu rhythm during anticipation of tactile stimulation to the right hand, comparing mu activity at central electrode sites when participants believed that tactile stimulation was initiated by a robot or a human, and to trials in which "nobody" received stimulation. There was a significant difference in contralateral mu rhythm activity between anticipating stimulation from a human partner and the "nobody" condition. This effect was less pronounced for anticipation of stimulation from the robot partner. Analyses also examined beta rhythm responses to the execution of the button press, comparing oscillatory activity when participants sent tactile stimulation to the robot or the human partner. The extent of beta rebound at frontocentral electrode sites following the button press differed between conditions, with a significantly larger increase in beta power when participants sent tactile stimulation to a robot partner compared to the human partner. This increase in beta power may reflect greater predictably in event outcomes. This new paradigm and the novel findings advance the neuroscientific study of human-robot interaction.

Methods Key findings Anxiolytic activity was studied by elevated plus maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), light/dark box test (LDT) and Vogel's conflict test (VCT). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to know the changes in brain activity instigated by GABA antagonist. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine and norepinephrine levels in brain tissues were estimated by HPLC. The mRNA (CREB, BDNF, GABA, and 5-HT1A) and protein expression (CREB, p-CREB, BDNF, ERK 1/2, p-ERK 1/2, GABA(A)R alpha 1, 5-HT1A and GAPDH) levels in brain tissue were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Terminalia chebula tannin-rich extract (TCHE) supplementation increased locomotion in mice towards open arm (EPM), time spent in illuminated area (LDT), rearing frequency (OFT) and number of shocks (VCT) compared to PTX (P < 0.05). Furthermore, TCHE down-regulated serum cortisol levels and showed increased levels of 5-HT, DA and NE. Gene expressions such as BDNF, CREB, GABA(A) and 5-HT1A were up-regulated by TCHE treatment compared to PTX. Conclusions Terminalia chebula tannin-rich extract showed significant anxiolytic activity against picrotoxin and could be used as natural therapy in neurodegenerative disorders.

Electrophysiological correlates of adaptive control and attentional engagement in patients with first episode schizophrenia and healthy young adults	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha rhythm; cognitive control; EEG; error processing; schizophrenia; theta rhythm	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; CONTEXT-PROCESSING DEFICITS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ERROR-DETECTION; NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS	The goal of this study was to investigate the neural dynamics of error processing and post-error adjustments in cognitive control and attention to a cognitive task in schizophrenia. We adopted a time-frequency approach in order to examine activity in the theta and alpha frequency bands as indices of cognitive control and attentional engagement. The results showed that error processing was characterized by increases in theta-band activity, accompanied by decreases in alpha-band activity, in both healthy control participants and participants with schizophrenia. However, both the theta and alpha effects were significantly reduced in participants with schizophrenia. Post-error increases in theta activity were associated with improved accuracy on subsequent trials in control participants but not in participants with schizophrenia. In addition, increases in alpha-band activity were found in the prestimulus period before partial attention lapses, but only for control participants and participants with schizophrenia with relatively low positive symptom severity. These results provide evidence for a deficit in cognitive control mechanisms mediated by midfrontal theta activity in schizophrenia, and suggest a particularly pronounced deficit in patients' ability to engage adaptive control mechanisms following errors. Our results also indicate that partial attention lapses can be indexed in both control participants and participants with schizophrenia by increases in alpha activity, but that in schizophrenia this varies as a function of positive symptom severity. We suggest that disrupted theta-band function represents a key deficit of schizophrenia, whereas disruptions in the alpha band may be the byproduct of atypically regulated attention.

We proposed a continuous resection ratio of high order HFO channels and compared this ratio with each patient's post-surgical outcome, to determine the quantitative threshold of HFO distribution to delineate the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Methods: We enrolled a total of 43 patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy. The patients were used to optimize the parameters for SEEG electrodes, to test the algorithm for identifying false HFOs, and to calculate the continuous resection ratio of high order HFO channels. The ratio can be used to determine a quantitative threshold to locate the epileptogenic zone. Results: Following optimization, the sensitivity, and specificity of our detector were 66.84 and 73.20% (ripples) and 69.76 and 66.13% (fast ripples, FRs), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of our algorithm for removing false HFOs were 76.82 and 94.54% (ripples) and 72.55 and 94.87% (FRs), respectively. The median of the continuous resection ratio of high order HFO channels in patients with good surgical outcomes, was significantly higher than in patients with poor outcome, for both ripples and FRs (P < 0.05 ripples and P < 0.001 FRs). Conclusions: Our automated detector has the advantage of not only applying to various intracranial electrodes but also removing false HFOs. Based on the continuous resection ratio of high order HFO channels, we can set the quantitative threshold for locating epileptogenic zones.

The effects of exercise intensity and post-exercise recovery time on cortical activation as revealed by EEG alpha peak frequency	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Sport; Brain; Alpha oscillations; iAPF; IAF; Alpha peak frequency	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BAND OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTS; METAANALYSIS; AROUSAL; VOLUME	Acute physical exercise (APE) induces an increase in the individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF), a cortical parameter associated with neural information processing speed. The aim of this study was to further scrutinize the influence of different APE intensities on post-exercise iAPF as well as its time course after exercise cessation. 95 healthy young (18-35 years) subjects participated in two randomized controlled experiments (EX1 and EX2). In EX1, all participants completed a graded exercise test (GXT) until exhaustion and were randomly allocated into different delay groups (immediately 0, 30, 60 and 90 min after GXT). The iAPF was determined before, immediately after as well as after the group-specific delay following the GXT. In EX2, participants exercised for 35 min at either 45-50%, 65-70% or 85-90% of their maximum heart rate (HRmax). The iAPF was determined before, immediately after as well as 20 min after exercise cessation. In EX1, the iAPF was significantly increased immediately after the GXT in all groups. This effect was not any more detectable after 30 min following exercise cessation. In EX2, a significant increase of the iAPF was found only after high-intensity (85-90% HRmax) exercise. The results indicate intense or exhaustive physical exercise is required to induce a transient increase in the iAPF that persists about 30 min following exercise cessation. Based on these findings, further research will have to scrutinize the behavioral implications associated with iAPF modulations following exercise.	[Gutmann, B.; Huelsduenker, T.; Strueder, H.

Effects of Aging on Cortical Neural Dynamics and Local Sleep Homeostasis in Mice	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; mice; neocortex; sleep	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; AGE-RELATED DECLINE; NREM SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; REGIONAL DIFFERENCES; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RISK-FACTORS	Healthy aging is associated with marked effects on sleep, including its daily amount and architecture, as well as the specific EEG oscillations. Neither the neurophysiological underpinnings nor the biological significance of these changes are understood, and crucially the question remains whether aging is associated with reduced sleep need or a diminished capacity to generate sufficient sleep. Here we tested the hypothesis that aging may affect local cortical networks, disrupting the capacity to generate and sustain sleep oscillations, and with it the local homeostatic response to sleep loss. We performed chronic recordings of cortical neural activity and local field potentials from the motor cortex in young and older male C57BL/6J mice, during spontaneous waking and sleep, as well as during sleep after sleep deprivation. In older animals, we observed an increase in the incidence of non-rapid eye movement sleep local field potential slow waves and their associated neuronal silent (OFF) periods, whereas the overall pattern of state-dependent cortical neuronal firing was generally similar between ages. Furthermore, we observed that the response to sleep deprivation at the level of local cortical network activity was not affected by aging. Our data thus suggest that the local cortical neural dynamics and local sleep homeostatic mechanisms, at least in the motor cortex, are not impaired during healthy senescence in mice. This indicates that powerful protective or compensatory mechanisms may exist to maintain neuronal function stable across the life span, counteracting global changes in sleep amount and architecture.

Methods We hypothesized that a seizure-free outcome could be expected in patients in whom the surgical planning included the majority of HFO-generating brain tissue while a poor seizure outcome could be expected in patients in whom only a few such areas were planned to be resected. Fifty-two patients were included from 3 tertiary epilepsy centers during a 1-year period. Ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) were automatically detected during slow-wave sleep with chronic intracranial EEG in 2 centers and acute intraoperative electrocorticography in 1 patient. Results There was a correlation between the removal of HFO-generating regions and seizure-free outcome at the group level for all patients. No correlation was found, however, for the center-specific analysis, and an individual prognostication of seizure outcome was true in only 36 patients (67%). Moreover, some patients became seizure-free without removal of the majority of HFO-generating tissue. The investigation of influencing factors, including comparisons of visual and automatic analysis, using a threshold analysis for areas with high HFO activity, and excluding contacts bordering the resection, did not result in improved prognostication. Conclusions On an individual patient level, a prediction of outcome was not possible in all patients. This may be due to the analysis techniques used. Alternatively, HFOs may be less specific for epileptic tissue than earlier studies have indicated.

J	Cowley, BU				Cowley, Benjamin Ultan			Studying the integrated functional cognitive basis of sustained attention with a Primed Subjective-Illusory-Contour Attention Task	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; PERCEPTION; COMPONENT; OSCILLATIONS; ILLUSIONS; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; ALPHA; ADHD	Sustained attention plays an important role in everyday life, for work, learning, or when affected by attention disorders. Studies of the neural correlates of attention commonly treat sustained attention as an isolated construct, measured with computerized continuous performance tests. However, in any ecological context, sustained attention interacts with other executive functions and depends on lower level perceptual processing. Such interactions occur, for example, in inhibition of interference, and processing of complex hierarchical stimuli; both of which are important for successful ecological attention. Motivated by the need for more studies on neural correlates of higher cognition, I present an experiment to investigate these interactions of attention in 17 healthy participants measured with high-resolution electroencephalography. Participants perform a novel 2-alternative forced-choice computerised performance test, the Primed Subjective Illusory Contour Attention Task (PSICAT), which presents gestalt-stimuli targets with distractor primes to induce interference inhibition during complex-percept processing. Using behavioural and brain-imaging analyses, I demonstrate the novel result that task-irrelevant incongruency can evoke stronger behavioural and neural responses than the task-relevant stimulus condition; a potentially important finding in attention disorder research. PSICAT is available as an open-source code repository at the following url, allowing researchers to reuse and adapt it to their requirements.

In the present study, we investigated the oscillatory activity within the Cx, MTh, and NRT, in normal and different dopamine (DA)-deficient states. We performed our experiments in both acute and chronic DA-denervated rats by injecting into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) tetrodotoxin (TTX) or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), respectively. Interestingly, almost all the electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands changed in acute and/or chronic DA depletion, suggesting alteration of all oscillatory activities and not of a specific band. Overall, delta(2-4 Hz) and theta(4-8 Hz) band decreased in NRT and Cx in acute and chronic state, whilst, alpha(8-13 Hz) band decreased in acute and chronic states in the MTh and NRT but not in the Cx. The beta(13-40 Hz) and gamma(60-90 Hz) bands were enhanced in the Cx. In the NRT the beta bands decreased, except for high-beta (H beta, 25-30 Hz) that increased in acute state. In the MTh, L beta and H beta decreased in acute DA depletion state and y decreased in both TTX and 6-OHDA-treated animals. These results confirm that abnormal cortical beta band are present in the established DA deficiency and it might be considered a hallmark of PD. The abnormal oscillatory activity in frequency interval of other bands, in particular the dampening of low frequencies in thalamic stations, in both states of DA depletion might also underlie PD motor and non-motor symptoms. Our data highlighted the effects of acute depletion of DA and the strict interplay in the oscillatory activity between the MTh and NRT in both acute and chronic stage of DA depletion. Moreover, our findings emphasize early alterations in the NRT, a crucial station for thalamic information processing.

Recently, a study in the bearded dragon (P. vitticeps) reported states analogous to REM and SWS alternating in a surprisingly regular 80-s period, suggesting a common origin of the two sleep states across amniotes. We first confirmed these results in the bearded dragon with deep brain recordings and electrooculogram (EOG) recordings. Then, to confirm a common origin and more finely characterize sleep in lizards, we developed a multiparametric approach in the tegu lizard, a species never recorded to date. We recorded EOG, electromyogram (EMG), heart rate, and local field potentials (LFPs) and included data on arousal thresholds, sleep deprivation, and pharmacological treatments with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake blocker that suppresses REM sleep in mammals. As in the bearded dragon, we demonstrate the existence of two sleep states in tegu lizards. However, no clear periodicity is apparent. The first sleep state (S1 sleep) showed high-amplitude isolated sharp waves, and the second sleep state (S2 sleep) displayed 15-Hz oscillations, isolated ocular movements, and a decrease in heart rate variability and muscle tone compared to S1. Fluoxetine treatment induced a significant decrease in S2 quantities and in the number of sharp waves in S1. Because S2 sleep is characterized by the presence of ocular movements and is inhibited by a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as is REM sleep in birds and mammals, it might be analogous to this state. However, S2 displays a type of oscillation never previously reported and does not display a desynchronized electroencephalogram (EEG) as is observed in the bearded dragons, mammals, and birds. This suggests that the phenotype of sleep states and possibly their role can differ even between closely related species. Finally, our results suggest a common origin of two sleep states in amniotes. Yet, they also highlight a diversity of sleep phenotypes across lizards, demonstrating that the evolution of sleep states is more complex than previously thought.

Cortical auditory evoked potential time-frequency growth functions for fully objective hearing threshold estimation	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Hearing threshold; Objective audiometery; Electroencephalography; Spectral analysis; Phase-locking value; Growth functions	BEHAVIORAL THRESHOLDS; RESPONSE AUDIOMETRY; ELECTRIC RESPONSES; EABR THRESHOLDS; PROGRAM	Cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) thresholds have been shown to correlate well with behaviourally determined hearing thresholds. Growth functions of CAEPs show promise as an alternative to single level detection for objective hearing threshold estimation; however, the accuracy and clinical relevance of this method is not well examined. In this study, we used temporal and spectral CAEP features to generate feature growth functions. Spectral features may be more robust than traditional peak-picking methods where CAEP morphology is variable, such as in children or hearing device users. Behavioural hearing thresholds were obtained and CAEPs were recorded in response to a 1 kHz puretone from twenty adults with no hearing loss. Four features, peak-to-peak amplitude, root-mean-square, peak spectral power and peak phase-locking value (PLV) were extracted from the CAEPs. Functions relating each feature with stimulus level were used to calculate objective hearing threshold estimates. We assessed the performance of each feature by calculating the difference between the objective estimate and the behaviourally-determined threshold. We compared the accuracy of the estimates using each feature and found that the peak PLV feature performed best, with a mean threshold error of 2.7 dB and standard deviation of 5.9 dB from behavioural threshold across subjects. We also examined the relation between recording time, data quality and threshold estimate errors, and found that on average for a single threshold, 12.7 minutes of recording was needed for a 95% confidence that the threshold estimate was within 20 dB of the behavioural threshold using the peak-to-peak amplitude feature, while 14 minutes is needed for the peak PLV feature. These results show that the PLV of CAEPs can be used to find a clinically relevant hearing threshold estimate. Its potential stability in differing morphology may be an advantage in testing infants or cochlear implant users. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Allan			Insight and Dissociation in Lucid Dreaming and Psychosis	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						REM sleep; dreaming; consciousness; EEG; psychosis; delirium; lucid dreaming; affective disorder	REM-SLEEP; GAMMA SYNCHRONY; FREE-ENERGY; CONSCIOUSNESS; WAKING; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; SYMPTOMS; SELF; OSCILLATIONS	Dreams and psychosis share several important features regarding symptoms and underlying neurobiology, which is helpful in constructing a testable model of, for example, schizophrenia and delirium. The purpose of the present communication is to discuss two major concepts in dreaming and psychosis that have received much attention in the recent literature: insight and dissociation. Both phenomena are considered functions of higher order consciousness because they involve metacognition in the form of reflective thought and attempted control of negative emotional impact. Insight in dreams is a core criterion for lucid dreams. Lucid dreams are usually accompanied by attempts to control the dream plot and dissociative elements akin to depersonalization and derealization. These concepts are also relevant in psychotic illness. Whereas insightfulness can be considered innocuous in lucid dreaming and even advantageous in psychosis, the concept of dissociation is still unresolved. The present review compares correlates and functions of insight and dissociation in lucid dreaming and psychosis.

J	Reiner, M; Lev, DD; Rosen, A				Reiner, Miriam; Lev, Dror D.; Rosen, Amit			Theta Neurofeedback Effects on Motor Memory Consolidation and Performance Accuracy: An Apparent Paradox?	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CENTRAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HIPPOCAMPAL ACTIVATION; LEARNED HELPLESSNESS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; BASAL GANGLIA; REM-SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION	Previous studies have shown that theta neurofeedback enhances motor memory consolidation on an easy-to-learn finger-tapping task. However, the simplicity of the finger-tapping task precludes evaluating the putative effects of elevated theta on performance accuracy. Mastering a motor sequence is classically assumed to entail faster performance with fewer errors. The speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) principle states that as action speed increases, motor performance accuracy decreases. The current study investigated whether theta neurofeedback could improve both performance speed and performance accuracy, or would only enhance performance speed at the cost of reduced accuracy. A more complex task was used to study the effects of parietal elevated theta on 45 healthy volunteers The findings confirmed previous results on the effects of theta neurofeedback on memory consolidation. In contrast to the two control groups, in the theta-neurofeedback group the speed-accuracy tradeoff was reversed. The speed-accuracy tradeoff patterns only stabilized after a night's sleep implying enhancement in terms of both speed and accuracy. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the assumption that fraudsters use their emotional competence to deceive their victims, their emotional responsiveness is not expected to be protective against utilitarian decision-making. The present study investigates the key role of emotional responsiveness in relation to moral decision-making in 11 imprisoned fraudsters, 10 imprisoned violent offenders, and 11 non-offenders. Participants' neural baseline activation of bilateral anterior insula (AI) was used as an indicator for emotional responsiveness. Results indicate that fraudsters and non-offenders have a higher right AI baseline activation than violent offenders. Yet, fraudsters and violent offenders show a stronger tendency towards utilitarian decisions than non-offenders. The predictive power of AI baseline activation on moral decision-making reaches significance only for fraudsters. Results give evidence that fraudsters are highly sensitive to their emotional state of mind, which, contrary to our expectation, exerts a strong influence on their moral decisions.

To investigate such interactions, functional directed connectivity methods based on nonparametric spectral factorization are promising tools, because they can be straightforwardly extended to the nonstationary case using wavelet transforms or multitapers on sliding time window, and allow estimating time-varying spectral measures of Granger-Geweke causality (GGC) from multivariate data. Here we systematically assess the performance of various nonparametric GGC methods in real EEG data recorded over rat cortex during unilateral whisker stimulations, where somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) propagate over known areas at known latencies and therefore allow defining fixed criteria to measure the performance of time-varying directed connectivity measures. In doing so, we provide a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of the spectral decomposition parameters that might influence the performance of wavelet and multitaper approaches. Our results show that, under the majority of parameter settings, nonparametric methods can correctly identify the contralateral primary sensory cortex (cS1) as the principal driver of the cortical network. Furthermore, we observe that, when properly optimized, the approach based on Morlet wavelet provided the best detection of the preferential functional targets of cS1; while, the best temporal characterization of whisker-evoked interactions was obtained with a sliding-window multitaper. In addition, we find that nonparametric methods provide GGC estimates that are robust against signal downsampling. Taken together our results provide a range of plausible application values for the spectral decomposition parameters of nonparametric methods, and show that they are well suited to characterize timevarying directed causal influences between neural systems with good temporal resolution.

We hypothesized that such stable individual differences exist and are associated with trait-like individual differences in resting-state brain activity. We tested this idea by recording participants' resting-state electroencephalograms (RS-EEGs) on 4 occasions over approximately 7 weeks and then tasking them with solving anagrams and compound remote associates problems that are solvable by either strategy. We found that peoples' tendency to solve problems consistently by insight or by analysis spans both tasks and time. Moreover, we discovered trait-like individual differences in the balance between frontal and posterior resting-state brain activity and in temporal-lobe hemispheric asymmetries that predict, at least weeks in advance, the tendency to solve by insight versus analysis. The discovery of an insight-analytic dimension of cognitive style and its neural basis in resting state brain activity suggests new avenues for the development of neuroscience-based methods for intellectual, educational, and vocational assessment.

Many studies reported poor language ability in children with BECTS compared with healthy control children. To elucidate the harmful effects of BECTS on language cognition, we studied the magnetoencephalographic activity elicited by an auditory language comprehension task. Methods: The participants (N = 20) included 10 children diagnosed with BECTS (aged 10.8 +/- 2.8 years) and 10 age-matched healthy children (control) (aged 10.6 +/- 1.6 years). Cognitive function was assessed using general intellectual function and language ability. In patients with BECTS, we reviewed the clinical course and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. We recorded the cortical responses elicited by an auditory language comprehension task using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We compared those results between groups and analyzed the correlation with cognitive scores and frequency of spikes. Results: The full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-4th edition was significantly reduced in the group with BELTS (96.4 +/- 123) compared with the control group (110.0 +/- 7.4). In half of the group with BECTS, the auditory comprehension score fell below the age-standard level. In the group with BECTS, the cortical activation during the task showed reduced intensity in language-associated areas such as the bilateral primary auditory cortex, left superior and mid-temporal areas, and inferior frontal area compared with those in the control group. In addition, the cortical activation in the left superior temporal area was negatively correlated with spike frequency and positively correlated with FSIQin the group with BECTS. Conversely, the right inferior frontal and mid-temporal areas had increased the activations in the group with BECIS. From the time frequency analysis, low gamma band event-related desynchronization was reduced in the group with BEM. Conclusion: Epileptic spikes negatively influenced responsiveness to the auditory language comprehension task in the language-associated cortices. These findings suggest that epileptic spikes could have a negative impact on the functional activity in rolandic areas and become a reason to change the functional development of the language network.

Nevertheless, it has not been reported in arboreal primates. The present study analyzed the sleeping postures, as well as the electromyographic and electroencephalographic (EEG) activities during three conditions: REMS, non-REMS (N-REMS), and wakefulness in spider monkeys. The study included six monkeys, whose EEGs were recorded at the O1-O2, C3, C4, F3, and F4 derivations to analyze relative power (RP) and interhemispheric, intrahemispheric, frontoposterior, and central-posterior coherence of frequency bands, which has been considered an index of arousal states. The bands analyzed were theta (4.0-7.0 Hz), alpha1 (8.0-10.5 Hz), alpha2 (11.0-13.5 Hz), and beta (14.0-30.0 Hz). Spider monkeys adopt a vertical posture during sleep, and in REMS a lack of muscular atonia was observed. The RP of the alpha bands at O1-O2 was higher during REMS than that during wakefulness, N-REMS1, and N-REMS2. At the C3 derivation, the RP of alpha1 was higher during REMS than that during N-REMS2. The RP of both alpha bands at the F4 derivation was higher during REMS than that during wakefulness, whereas REMS was characterized by a higher coherence between the F3 and O1-O2 derivations of the alpha2 band. These prevalences and the higher coherence of alpha bands during REMS could represent a correlate of behavioral traits and activated cortical areas related to a possible arousal state in spider monkeys while sleeping.

The present study aimed at investigating the neural bases of the processes involved in overcoming fixation effects during creative idea generation. Using the AU task adapted for EEG recording, we examined whether participant's ability to provide original ideas was related to alpha power changes in both the frontal and temporo-parietal regions. Critically, for half of the presented objects, the classical use of the object was primed orally, and a picture of the classical use was presented visually to increase functional fixedness (Fixation Priming condition). For the other half, only the name of the object and a picture of the object was provided to the participants (control condition). As expected, priming the classical use of an object before the generation of creative alternative uses of the object impeded participants' performances in terms of remoteness. In the control condition, while the frontal alpha synchronization was maintained across all successive time windows in participants with high remoteness scores, the frontal alpha synchronization decreased in participants with low remoteness scores. In the Fixation Priming condition, in which functional fixedness was maximal, both participants with high and low remoteness scores maintained frontal alpha synchronization throughout the period preceding their answer. Whereas participants with high remoteness scores maintained alpha synchronization in the temporo-parietal regions throughout the creative idea generation period, participants with low remoteness scores displayed alpha desynchronization in the same regions during this period. We speculate that individuals with high remoteness scores might generate more creative ideas than individuals with low remoteness scores because they rely more on internal semantic association and selection processes.

We previously provided initial evidence of shared and distinct event-related potential (ERP) impairments in ADHD and BD in a direct electrophysiological comparison, but no study to date has compared neural mechanisms underlying attentional impairments with finer-grained brain oscillatory markers. Here, we aimed to compare the neural underpinnings of impaired attentional processes in ADHD and BD, by examining event-related brain oscillations during a reaction-time task under slow-unrewarded baseline and fast-incentive conditions. We measured cognitive performance, ERPs and brain-oscillatory modulations of power and phase variability in 20 women with ADHD, 20 women with BD (currently euthymic) and 20 control women. Compared to controls, both ADHD and BD groups showed increased RTV in the baseline condition and increased RTV, theta phase variability and lower contingent negative variation in the fast-incentive condition. Unlike controls, neither clinical group showed an improvement from the slow-unrewarded baseline to the fast-incentive condition in attentional P3 amplitude or alpha power suppression. Most impairments did not differ between the disorders, as only an adjustment in beta suppression between conditions (lower in the ADHD group) distinguished between the clinical groups. These findings suggest shared impairments in women with ADHD and BD in cognitive and neural variability, preparatory activity and inability to adjust attention allocation and activation. These overlapping impairments may represent shared neurobiological mechanisms of attentional dysfunction in ADHD and BD, and potentially underlie common symptoms in both disorders.

Investigation of the changes in oscillatory power during task switching after mild traumatic brain injury	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; cognitive flexibility; concussion; executive function; theta	COGNITIVE CONTROL; LONG-TERM; TOP-DOWN; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG-ALPHA; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; INHIBITION; MEMORY	Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can cause persistent cognitive changes. These cognitive changes may be due to changes in neural communication. Task-switching is a cognitive control operation that may be susceptible to mTBI and is associated with oscillations in theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (14-30 Hz) ranges. This study aimed to investigate oscillatory power in response to cues indicating a task-switch after mTBI. Electroencephalogram and behavioral data were collected from 21 participants with a history of two or more concussions (mTBI) and 21 age- and gender-matched controls as they performed a task-switching paradigm. Participants differentiated whether visual stimuli were red or green, or circles or squares, depending on a cue. The cue changed every few trials with the first trial after a rule change being termed a switch trial. The mTBI group showed significantly less overall accuracy during the task. Over a posterior parietal region, the mTBI group showed more theta desynchronization than the control group from similar to 300 to similar to 600 ms post-cue during switch trials and from similar to 300 to 400 ms during maintain trials, along with less alpha and beta desynchronization than the control group from similar to 2,000 to similar to 2,200 ms post-cue. In a right parietal region, the mTBI group showed less alpha and beta desynchronization from similar to 525 to similar to 775 ms post-cue. However, there was no condition x group interaction in the behavior or oscillatory results. These oscillatory differences suggest a change in neural communication is present after mTBI that may relate to global changes in task performance.

From the point of view of anyone operating complex mechanical systems, i.e. those comprising independent components that are required to interact precisely in time, it goes to follows that the precise timing of such a system is essential. Not only essential but measurable, scalable ( if the system has several interacting parts, each doing tasks of different scale), and reliable over observations. The catastrophic consequence of an absence of such precision, for instance that required to govern the interference engine in many automobiles, is indicative of how important timing is for the function of dynamical systems at all levels of operation. The dynamicist and temporal considerations combined, indicate that it is necessary to consider the operating characteristic of any dynamical, cognitive brain system both in terms, superficially at least, of oscillation frequencies, which may themselves be forensic of an underlying time-related taxonomy. Currently there are only two sets of relevant and necessarily systematic observations in this field: one of these reports the precise dynamical structure of the perceptual systems engaged in dynamical binding across form and time; the second, derived both empirically from perceptual performance data, as well as obtained from theoretical models, demonstrates a timing taxonomy related to a fundamental operator referred to as the time quantum. In this contribution both sets of theory and observations are reviewed and compared for their predictive consistency. Conclusions about direct comparability are discussed for both theories of cognitive dynamics and time quantum models, with an agenda defined for future research.

Dose-Dependent Effects of Closed-Loop tACS Delivered During Slow-Wave Oscillations on Memory Consolidation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						memory consolidation; closed-loop; tACS; sleep; tDCS; learning and memory	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; COMPLEMENTARY LEARNING-SYSTEMS; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; SLEEP; TDCS; HIPPOCAMPUS; INTEGRATION; IMPROVEMENT; REPLAY; BRAIN	Sleep is critically important to consolidate information learned throughout the day. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) serves to consolidate declarative memories, a process previously modulated with open-loop non-invasive electrical stimulation, though not always effectively. These failures to replicate could be explained by the fact that stimulation has only been performed in open-loop, as opposed to closed-loop where phase and frequency of the endogenous slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) are matched for optimal timing. The current study investigated the effects of closed-loop transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) targeting SWOs during sleep on memory consolidation. 21 participants took part in a three-night, counterbalanced, randomized, single-blind, within-subjects study, investigating performance changes (correct rate and F1 score) on images in a target detection task over 24 h. During sleep, 1.5 mA closed-loop tACS was delivered in phase over electrodes at F3 and F4 and 180 degrees out of phase over electrodes at bilateral mastoids at the frequency (range 0.5-1.2 Hz) and phase of ongoing SWOs for a duration of 5 cycles in each discrete event throughout the night. Data were analyzed in a repeated measures ANOVA framework, and results show that verum stimulation improved post-sleep performance specifically on generalized versions of images used in training at both morning and afternoon tests compared to sham, suggesting the facilitation of schematization of information, but not of rote, veridical recall. We also found a surprising inverted U-shaped dose effect of sleep tACS, which is interpreted in terms of tACS-induced faciliatory and subsequent refractory dynamics of SWO power in scalp EEG. This is the first study showing a selective modulation of long-term memory generalization using a novel closed-loop tACS approach, which holds great potential for both healthy and neuropsychiatric populations.

However, neurological deficits that are not directly linked to seizure activity and that may persist after focus removal are frequent. The recruitment of remote brain regions of an epileptic network (EN) is recognized as a possible cause, but a profound lack of experimental evidence exists concerning their recruitment and the type of pathological activities they exhibit. We studied the development of epileptic activities at the large-scale in male mice of the kainate model of unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy using high-density surface EEG and multiple-site intracortical recordings. Weshow that, along with focal spikes and fast ripples that remain localized to the injected hippocampus (i. e., the EF), a subpopulation of spikes that propagate across the brain progressively emerges even before the expression of seizures. The spatiotemporal propagation of these generalized spikes (GSs) is highly stable within and across animals, defining a large-scale EN comprising both hippocampal regions and frontal cortices. Interestingly, GSs are often concomitant with muscular twitches. In addition, while fast ripples are, as expected, highly frequent in the EF, they also emerge in remote cortical regions and in particular in frontal regions where GSs propagate. Finally, we demonstrate that these remote interictal activities are dependent on the focus in the early phase of the disease but continue to be expressed after focus silencing at later stages. Our results provide evidence that neuronal networks outside the initial focus are progressively altered during epileptogenesis.

Seizures After Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Incidence, Risk Factors, and Impact on Mortality and Morbidity	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Cerebral hemorrhage; Seizure; Stroke	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; CONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; UNPROVOKED SEIZURES; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG; EPILEPSY; STROKE; EEG	OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most frequent causes of epilepsy in the United States. However, reported risk factors for seizure after are inconsistent, and their impact on inpatient morbidity and mortality is unclear. We aimed to study the incidence, risk factors, and impact of seizures after ICH in a nationwide patient sample. METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for patients admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of ICH between the years 1999 and 2011. Patients were subsequently dichotomized into groups of those with a diagnosis consistent with seizure and those without. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for seizure in this patient sample, and the association between seizures and mortality and morbidity. Logistic regression was then used for trend analysis of incidence of seizure diagnoses over time. RESULTS: We identified 220,075 patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of ICH. Of these, 11.87% had a diagnosis consistent with seizure. Factors associated with increased risk of seizure after ICH included higher categorical van Walraven score, encephalopathy, alcohol abuse, solid tumor, and prior stroke. Seizure was independently associated with decreased odds of morbidity (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.92) and mortality (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.72-0.77) in multivariate models controlling for existing comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures after were associated with decreased mortality and morbidity despite attempts to correct for existing comorbidities. Continuous monitoring of these patients for seizures may not be necessary in all circumstances, despite their frequency.

However, evidence of the brain's experience-dependent plasticity suggests that abnormal activity patterns may be reversed with treatment. In particular, neurofeedback training (NFT), an intervention based on operant conditioning resulting in self-regulation of brain electrical oscillations, has shown increasing promise in addressing abnormalities in brain function and behavior. We examined the effects of 20h of sensorimotor mu-rhythm-based NFT in children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and a matched control group of typically developing children (ages 8-17). During a functional magnetic resonance imaging imitation and observation task, the ASD group showed increased activation in regions of the human mirror neuron system following the NFT, as part of a significant interaction between group (ASD vs. controls) and training (pre- vs. post-training). These changes were positively correlated with behavioral improvements in the ASD participants, indicating that mu-rhythm NFT may be beneficial to individuals with ASD.

Morphological representations are extrapolated from morpho-syntactic rules	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Morphology; Visual word recognition; Neural representations; Magnetoencephalography	MORPHO-ORTHOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION; WORD RECOGNITION; NEURONAL COMMUNICATION; SEMANTIC TRANSPARENCY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG-ALPHA; DECOMPOSITION; FREQUENCY; MEG; DYNAMICS	The field of psycho- and neuro-linguistics has long-debated the decompositional model of visual word processing: Are written words processed via the visual forms of stem and affix morphemes, or as complex wholes? Although many have now settled upon a decompositional view, it is unclear what heuristic the brain uses to generate these visual morpheme-forms in the first place. Here we conduct a magneto-encephalography study to test two hypotheses for how this may be done: i) the brain encodes representations of the morphemes that follow the morpho-syntactic rules governing constituents: A stem morpheme will be represented if the word obeys the grammatical behaviour associated with its suffix; ii) the brain only encodes stem morphemes that occur with multiple suffixes or as words in isolation. Our results indicate that words with morpho-syntactic wellformedness as stem-suffix combinations are decomposed by the system, thus supporting the former hypothesis. This suggests that knowledge of morpho-syntactic rules can be used to form morphological representations of written words, in absence of independent experience with all of their constituent morphemes. Possible mechanisms supporting this computation are discussed.

Genetic animal models, especially rats with spike-and-wave discharges recorded on the electroencephalogram, the hallmark of absence seizures, offer strong face validity with the human pathology that allows precise exploration of the pathophysiology of this form of epilepsy. Using an array of different methods, recent studies have demonstrated that spike-and-wave discharges are initiated in the primary somatosensory cortex and then rapidly propagate to motor cortices and thalamic nuclei. More specifically, in vivo electrophysiological intracellular recordings showed that the pyramidal neurons of the deep layers of this cortex exhibit fast activation, hyperexcitability and hypersynchronizing characteristics in favor of their role as ictogenic neurons in absence seizures. Furthermore, longitudinal studies during brain maturation suggest the progressive development of these features. Exploration of the different key players in the maturation of the primary somatosensory cortex should determine the anomalies that lead to the development of the cortical generator of absence seizures.

We analyzed them based on the inherent AR structure obtained by parallel factor analysis decomposition in the cortical source space. AR showed a stable multicomponent structure in 78% of sixty 20- to 81-year-old healthy adults. Typically, it consists of 2 components. The distribution of the higher frequency occipito-parietal component widens with age, with its maximum moving from BA18/19 to BA37. The low-frequency component originating from the occipito-temporal regions in young adults also moves anteriorly with age, while maintaining its maximum within BA37. Both components slow down by 1 Hz over the adult lifespan. The multicomponent AR is more common in younger subjects, whereas a single-component AR in older subjects. This uneven occurrence as well as the increasing spatial and frequency overlaps between components suggest transformation of the multicomponent AR into the single-component AR with age. A detailed knowledge of AR component structure would be useful to monitor age-related neurodegenerative processes in humans. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This proposed role for SWS, coupled with observations of impaired SWS in several pathologies as well as in aging, has led some researchers to implement methods that could specifically enhance SWS. This review aims to gather the current knowledge extending from the cell to the clinic, in order to construct an overview of what is currently known about so-called SWS. We slowly expand the view from the molecular processes underlying SWS to the cell unit and assembly to cortical manifestations. We then describe its role in physiology and cognition to finally assess its association with clinical aspects. Finally, we address practical considerations for several techniques that could be used to manipulate SWS, in order to improve our understanding of SWS and possibly help the development of treatments for SWS clinical disorders.

Infant brain responses to felt and observed touch of hands and feet: an MEG study	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TACTILE STIMULATION; NEURAL BASIS; BODY MAPS; IMITATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; REPRESENTATION; PLASTICITY; MOVEMENTS	There is growing interest concerning the ways in which the human body, both one's own and that of others, is represented in the developing human brain. In two experiments with 7-month-old infants, we employed advances in infant magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain imaging to address novel questions concerning body representations in early development. Experiment 1 evaluated the spatiotemporal organization of infants' brain responses to being touched. A punctate touch to infants' hands and feet produced significant activation in the hand and foot areas of contralateral primary somatosensory cortex as well as in other parietal and frontal areas. Experiment 2 explored infant brain responses to visually perceiving another person's hand or foot being touched. Results showed significant activation in early visual regions and also in regions thought to be involved in multisensory body and self-other processing. Furthermore, observed touch of the hand and foot activated the infant's own primary somatosensory cortex, although less consistently than felt touch. These findings shed light on aspects of early social cognition, including action imitation, which may build, at least in part, on infant neural representations that map equivalences between the bodies of self and other.

It was hypothesized that somatosensory attention can modulate tactile-induced oscillation changes, which can decode different sensation attention tasks. Subjects performed four tactile attention tasks, prompted by cues presented in random order and while both wrists were simultaneously stimulated: 1) selective sensation on left hand (SS-L); 2) selective sensation on right hand (SS-R); 3) bilateral selective sensation; and 4) selective sensation suppressed or idle state (SS-S). The classification accuracy between SS-L and SS-R (79.9 +/- 8.7%) was comparable with that of a previous tactile BCI system based on selective sensation. Moreover, the accuracy could be improved to an average of 90.3 +/- 4.9% by optimal class-pair and frequency-band selection. Three-class discrimination had an accuracy of 75.2 +/- 8.3%, with the best discrimination reached for the classes SS-L, SS-R, and SS-S. Finally, four classes were classified with an accuracy of 59.4 +/- 7.3%. These results show that the proposed system is a promising new paradigm for multi-class BCI.

In 22 undergraduate students (M-age = 18.92 years, range 18-22 years), we employed a probabilistic negative reinforcement learning paradigm in which choices to avoid were followed by cues indicating successful or unsuccessful avoidance of an impending aversive noise. Our results showed that medial frontal theta power was enhanced following a cue that signaled avoidance was unsuccessful. In addition, self-reported lack of perseverance, a dimension of impulsivity characterized by an inability to maintain focus and determination during a challenging task, was negatively correlated with medial frontal theta elicited to an unsuccessful avoidance cue. We also observed robust differences in alpha attenuation and beta modulation following unsuccessful avoidance cue presentation. To our knowledge, this is the first study in humans to show a functional relation between medial frontal theta modulation and avoidance success. We discuss our findings in the context of frontal theta and self regulation, negative reinforcement, and anxiety. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[van Noordt, Stefon J.

J	Sen, S				Sen, Siddhartha			Measuring Consciousness	JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES			English	Article						consciousness formula; correlation functions; brain waves; memory	BRAIN DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; INFORMATION; MEMORY; FIELD	In this paper a theoretical model for measuring consciousness based on experimental observations is proposed. Consciousness, the awareness of one's self and one's immediate environment, is defined, in this paper, in terms of the information about this awareness that is contained in or being processed by the brain. This particular information content in the brain is extracted from the correlation functions of brain waves observed in EEG measurements at N points by determining an observation-based special time-dependent probability function, PN(t) (Appendix B) and Shannon's information theory formula. It is shown how PN(t) provides information about awareness contained in the ensemble of brain waves (Appendix A). Consciousness is defined either directly by a formula, C(t), that depends on PN(t) and represents the information contained in brain waves at time t, or its time derivate, D(t), that represents the rate at which this information is being processed. These measures are not localized; they do not depend on a single, immutable, hardwired detail of the brain but they do reflect subjective experiences, encoded by any one of a number of possible hardwired circuits. They are not clinical tools for measuring consciousness but rather represent ways to extract the information content of the brain from experimental measurements. Justifications, based on observational evidence, are given for the formulas presented.

This phenomenon, termed repetition suppression (RS), is classically held to stem from bottom-up neuronal adaptation. However, recent studies suggest that RS is driven by top-down predictive mechanisms. It remains controversial whether these top-down mechanisms of RS rely on conscious strategies, or if they represent a more fundamental aspect of perception, coding for physical properties of the repeated feature. The presence of top-down effects in the absence of perceptual awareness would indicate that conscious strategies are not sufficient to explain top-down mechanisms of RS. We combined an unconscious priming paradigm with EEG recordings and tested whether RS can be modulated by the probability of encountering a repetition, even in the absence of awareness. Our results show that both behavioural priming and RS near occipital areas are modulated by repetition probability, regardless of prime awareness. This contradicts previous findings that have argued that RS modulation is a by-product of conscious strategies. In contrast, we found that the increase in theta-band power following unrepeated trials-an index of conflict detection-is modulated only by expectations during conscious primes, implicating the use of conscious strategies. Together, our results suggest that the influence of predictions on RS can be either automatic in sensory brain regions or dependent on conscious strategies.

Due to the nature of invisibility itself, noise exposure is hard to be intuitively perceived through traditional training methods to improve workers' perception of noise hazards, such as, short verbal and written instructions, during employee orientation and site safety meeting. With an increasing adoption of advanced information technology in construction industry, building information modeling (BIM) visualization-enhanced safety training has been studied to raise occupational safety awareness in an intuition way. During training process, trainees' level of attentiveness throughout instruction is generally associated with their learning efficacy. However, little study has been done to quantitatively evaluate the level of attentiveness during BIM-enhanced safety training for occupational awareness improvement. Therefore, this research proposed a quantitative method to validate the level of attentiveness using BIM-enhanced noise exposure training to enhance workers' noise awareness through monitoring their neuropsychological activities. The brain activation patterns of the test subjects were collected and compared between the traditional text-based and auditory-based, and the BIM-enhanced training. The preliminary results illustrated that the BIM-enhanced training yielded higher level of attentiveness than other training methods, which could successfully prove its capability of promoting workers' awareness of workspace noise hazard.

No Evidence for Phase-Specific Effects of 40 Hz HD-tACS on Multiple Object Tracking	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						gamma; coherence; phase-locking; interhemispheric integration; multiple object tracking; transcranial alternating current stimulation	TEMPORAL CORRELATION HYPOTHESIS; OSCILLATORY NEURONAL RESPONSES; VISUAL FEATURE INTEGRATION; EEG COHERENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTEX; CAT; AREAS; FREQUENCY; MONKEY	Phase synchronization drives connectivity between neural oscillators, providing a flexible mechanism through which information can be effectively and selectively routed between task-relevant cortical areas. The ability to keep track of objects moving between the left and right visual hemifields, for example, requires the integration of information between the two cerebral hemispheres. Both animal and human studies have suggested that coherent (or phase-locked) gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz) might underlie this ability. While most human evidence has been strictly correlational, high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) has been used to manipulate ongoing interhemispheric gamma phase relationships. Previous research showed that 40 Hz tACS delivered bilaterally over human motion complex could bias the perception of a bistable ambiguous motion stimulus (Helfrich et al., 2014). Specifically, this work showed that in-phase (0 degrees offset) stimulation boosted endogenous interhemispheric gamma coherence and biased perception toward the horizontal (whereby visual tokens moved between visual hemifields-requiring interhemispheric integration). By contrast, anti-phase (180 degrees offset) stimulation decreased interhemispheric gamma coherence and biased perception toward the vertical (whereby tokens moved within separate visual hemifields). Here we devised a multiple object tracking arena comprised of four quadrants whereby discrete objects moved either entirely within the left and right visual hemifields, or could cross freely between visual hemifields, thus requiring interhemispheric integration. Using the same HD-tACS montages as Helfrich et al. (2014), we found no phase-specific effect of 40 Hz stimulation on overall tracking performance. While tracking performance was generally lower during between-hemifield trials (presumably reflecting a cost of integration), this difference was unchanged by in-vs. anti-phase stimulation. Our null results could be due to a failure to reliably modulate coherence in our study, or that our task does not rely as heavily on this network of coherent gamma oscillations as other visual integration paradigms.

Consolidation of motor skills has been shown to depend on periods of sleep. Conversely, motor adaptation during tasks not dependent on the hippocampus may not depend on sleep. Some research suggests that the training schedule affects the sleep dependency of motor adaptation tasks. Here, we investigated whether sleep differentially affects memory consolidation that depends on the training schedule. Healthy men were trained with their dominant, right hand on a force-field adaptation task and re-tested after an 11-h consolidation period involving overnight sleep (Sleep) or daytime wakefulness (Wake). Retesting included a transfer test of the non-dominant hand. Half of the subjects in each group adapted to different force-field magnitudes during training with low inter-trial force variability (Sleep-Blocked; Wake-Blocked), and the other half were trained with a high-variability schedule (Sleep-Random; Wake-Random). EEG was recorded during task execution and overnight polysomnography. Consolidation was comparable between Wake and Sleep groups, although performance changes over sleep correlated with sleep spindles nesting in slow-wave upstates. Higher training variability improved retest performance, including transfer learning, and these improvements correlated with higher alpha power in contralateral parietal areas. These enhanced consolidation effects might be fostered by feedback rather than feedforward mechanisms.

The hippocampal sharp wave-ripple in memory retrieval for immediate use and consolidation	NATURE REVIEWS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; COMPLEMENTARY LEARNING-SYSTEMS; CELL ASSEMBLY PATTERNS; SPONTANEOUS EEG SPIKES; CA1 PYRAMIDAL CELLS; RETROGRADE-AMNESIA; SPATIAL MEMORY; PLACE CELLS; EPISODIC MEMORY	Various cognitive functions have long been known to require the hippocampus. Recently, progress has been made in identifying the hippocampal neural activity patterns that implement these functions. One such pattern is the sharp wave-ripple (SWR), an event associated with highly synchronous neural firing in the hippocampus and modulation of neural activity in distributed brain regions. Hippocampal spiking during SWRs can represent past or potential future experience, and SWR-related interventions can alter subsequent memory performance. These findings and others suggest that SWRs support both memory consolidation and memory retrieval for processes such as decision-making. In addition, studies have identified distinct types of SWR based on representational content, behavioural state and physiological features. These various findings regarding SWRs suggest that different SWR types correspond to different cognitive functions, such as retrieval and consolidation. Here, we introduce another possibility-that a single SWR may support more than one cognitive function. Taking into account classic psychological theories and recent molecular results that suggest that retrieval and consolidation share mechanisms, we propose that the SWR mediates the retrieval of stored representations that can be utilized immediately by downstream circuits in decision-making, planning, recollection and/or imagination while simultaneously initiating memory consolidation processes.

We tested a possibility to improve recognition of difficult sounds after their presentation during SWS and the correlation of recognition with electrophysiological parameters of brain activity in two groups of healthy volunteers. For the main group of subjects, after two consecutive sessions of recognizing one of the two deviant sounds in the oddball paradigm, we presented only one sound during the SWS in a different sequence. In the control group, we played the same sequence with a new deviant sound during the SWS. For the main group after daytime sleep, we observed a significant improvement in recognition of that sound, which was repeatedly presented during the SWS stage. This improvement was accompanied by an increase in the amplitude and a decrease in the latency of Mismatch Negativity (MMN) a component of the event related potential. The control group had no significant changes in the sounds' recognition and in the parameters of MMN after sleep. Our data indicate that targeted reactivation of auditory memory during SWS may contribute to better recognition of sounds, and this progress correlates with electrophysiological patterns of brain activity.

On the one hand, nuisance factors such as motion can readily introduce coherent BOLD changes across the whole brain. On the other hand, the global signal has been linked to neural activity and vigilance levels, suggesting that it contains important neurophysiological information and should not be discarded. Any widespread pattern of coordinated activity is likely to contribute appreciably to the global signal. Such patterns may include large-scale quasiperiodic spatiotemporal patterns, known also to be tied to performance on vigilance tasks. This uncertainty surrounding the separability of the global BOLD signal from concurrent neurological processes motivated an examination of the global BOLD signal's spatial distribution. The results clarify that although the global signal collects information from all tissue classes, a diverse subset of the BOLD signal's independent components contribute the most to the global signal. Further, the timing of each network's contribution to the global signal is not consistent across volunteers, confirming the independence of a constituent process that comprises the global signal.

Our study aimed to evaluate neuroelectrical peripheral and central nervous system responses of sportsmen (SPR) and sedentary individuals (SED) during concentration grid test (CGT) employed under time pressure. Forty three SPR and 33 SED participated in the study. Neuroelectrical responses were simultaneously obtained during baseline and CGT. All responses were observed to increase under stress in both SED and SPR. The SPR's stress related peripheral responses were lower than SED's. When central values were evaluated a stress related increase according to baseline was observed in all frequency powers in all of the participants. Statistical comparison of increase rates revealed a significantly greater increase in beta in SED compared to SPR. Beta has been associated to alertness and cortical arousal. As SED exhibit greater beta increase under stress compared to SPR their state of cortical arousal and alertness may be interpreted to be higher than SPR. However the SPR's weak increase in beta and their lower peripheral responses taken together may imply that they are better in stress management. In fact according to their performance scores the SPR's higher level of performance under stress compared to SED shows that they are better at maintaining and focusing their attention under stress than SED.

In four experiments conducted on 70 healthy participants, we show that salient substartle sensory stimuli modulate isometric force exertion by human participants, and that this modulation is tightly coupled with electrocortical activity elicited by the same stimuli. We obtained four main results. First, the force modulation follows a complex triphasic pattern consisting of alternating decreases and increases of force, time-locked to stimulus onset. Second, this modulation occurs regardless of the sensory modality of the eliciting stimulus. Third, the magnitude of the force modulation is predicted by the amplitude of the electrocortical activity elicited by the same stimuli. Fourth, both neural and motor effects are not reflexive but depend on contextual factors. Together, these results indicate that sudden environmental stimuli have an immediate effect on motor processing, through a tight corticomuscular coupling. These observations suggest that saliency detection is not merely perceptive but reactive, preparing the animal for subsequent appropriate actions.

Imaging the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Cognitive Processes at High Temporal Resolution	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; DISEASE; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; NETWORK; MEMORY	This letter presents a noninvasive imaging technique that captures the exact timing and locations of cortical activity sequences that are specific to a cognitive process. These precise spatiotemporal sequences can be detected in the human brain as specific time-position pattern associated with a cognitive task. They are consistent with direct measurements of population activity recorded in nonhuman primates, thus suggesting that specific time-position patterns associated with a cognitive task can be identified. This imaging technique is based on estimating the amplitude of cortical current dipoles from MEG recordings. Although the spatial resolution of these estimations is poor (approximately 2 cm), the temporal resolution is high (milliseconds). We show that within these cortical current dipoles, time points of cortical activation can be identified as brief amplitude undulations and that sequences of these transients repeat with millisecond accuracy, hence making it possible to treat the timing of these transients as point processes. We illustrate the feasibility of finding spatiotemporal templates specific to the cognitive processes associated with following the rhythm of drumbeats that involve the activation at multiple cortical and cerebellar loci. These templates evolve at an accuracy of a few milliseconds. This approach can thus pave the way for new perspectives on the relationships between brain dynamics and cognition.

Methods: We used the Corpus Callosum Index (CCI) obtained from best mid-sagittal T2/FLAIR or Tl-weighted MRI at two time-points, more than one year apart. CCI has been mainly used in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but not in epilepsy, so we tested the validity of our results performing a proof of concept cohort, incorporating MS patients with and without epilepsy. Then, we explored this measurement in a well-characterized and long-term cohort of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with HS. Results: In the proof of concept cohort (MS without epilepsy n:40, and MS with epilepsy, n:15), we found a larger CCI atrophy rate in MS patients with poor epilepsy control vs. MS without epilepsy (p:0.01). Then, in HS patients (n:74), annualized CCI atrophy rate was correlated with the long-term Engel scale (Rho:0.31, p:0.007). In patients with post-surgical seizure recurrence, a larger CCI atrophy rate was found one year before any seizure relapse. Univariate analysis showed an increased risk of seizure recurrence in males, higher pre-surgical seizure frequency, necessity of invasive EEG monitoring, and higher CCI atrophy rate. Two of these variables were independent predictors in the multivariate analysis, male gender (HR:4.87, p:0.002) and CCI atrophy rate (HR:1.21, p:0.001). Conclusion: We demonstrated that atrophy of the corpus callosum, using the CCI, is related with poor seizure control in two different neurological disorders presenting with epilepsy, which might suggest that corpus callosum atrophy obtained in early post-surgical follow-up, could be a biomarker for predicting recurrences and guiding treatment plans.

The neurophysiological findings suggest that the hypnotic state is associated with an altered operating mode of the brain that is clearly different from the normal operating mode. While in the normal operating mode a dolorogenic stimulus induces a highly synchronized large-scale activity pattern that leads to the experience of pain, the altered operating mode inhibits the synchronization of spatially divided brain regions. As a consequence, the conscious experience of pain cannot arise. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism, a novel theoretical framework is made use of. It accepts consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe and is based on the hypothesis that the whole range of phenomenal qualities is built into the frequency spectrum of a ubiquitous background field. The body of evidence supports the view that in the normal operating mode our brains act as filters that extract the plethora of phenomenal nuances selectively from this field. In the altered operating mode, which establishes under hypnotic conditions, the extraction of phenomenal qualities is partially prevented. From this perspective, hypnotic analgesia is due to an impairment of the fundamental mechanism underlying conscious perception.

Methods: Our study consisted of 12 TBI patients aged 14-26 who had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9-13 in the first 24 hours after a motor vehicle accident. According to the severity of their GCS score, and regardless of the type of brain injury, patients were then distributed into two groups, moderate TBI (GCS score 9-12) or mild TBI (GCS score of 13). Neuropsychological tests were given to patients before the MEG recording. MEG was used to measure the power of the different frequency bands delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Results: The power of the beta frequency band was reduced and the theta/beta ratio was significantly increased in the moderate TBI group compared to the mild TBI group. Neuropsychological assessments results tended to support this finding but did not reach significance. Conclusion: The MEG results suggest that moderate TBI patients have greater processing and attention deficits than mild TBI patients. We concluded that MEG plays an important role in objectively detecting brain wave changes after TBI, which has implications for the prediction of cognitive sequelae after TBI.

Controversies still remain regarding their actual contribution to both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS also known as REM sleep) or PS alone. Methods: To address this point, we compared effects of chemogenetic activation and inhibition of MCH neurons on SWS and PS amounts and EEG rhythmic activities in transgenic Pmch-cre mice. Results: In agreement with recently reported optogenetic data, the activation of MCH neurons invariably facilitates PS onset and maintenance. Our chemogenetic experiments further disclose that the ultradian rhythm of SWS is also notably related to the activity of MCH neurons. We observed that the mean duration of SWS episodes is significantly extended when MCH neurons are inhibited. Conversely, when they were excited, SWS bouts were drastically shortened and depicted substantial changes in delta rhythmic activities in electroencephalographic recording likely reflecting a deeper SWS. Conclusions: According to these original findings, we propose that when MCH neurons are physiologically recruited, SWS depth is increased and the extinction of SWS episodes is accelerated, two joint physiological processes strengthening the probability for natural SWS to PS transition and likely facilitating PS onset.

This study investigated n:m CFC values between high and low frequencies in resting-state networks using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Simulation experiments with different frequency pairs were first conducted to evaluate the effect of SNR on the estimation of phase and CFC. The values of n:m CFC between each pair of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies were estimated from eye-open resting-state MEG data. The topographic maps of CFC values between alpha and other frequencies were illustrated. The results of simulation data showed the increased accuracy of phase and n:m CFC estimation for balanced power of two targeted frequencies. Results of MEG data exhibited that CFC maps of low-alpha activity presented broadly distributed coupling with high frequencies (including beta and gamma) in the frontal regions of salient ventral attention and frontoparietal control networks, whereas high-alpha activity coupling with the gamma band in the posterior part of frontoparietal control network. Our study demonstrates the versatile of n:m CFC values at rest in human brain. Caution should be considered when n:m CFC values would be used as an index of dysfunction at resting state in diseased brains.

Based on previous evidence showing that music training has an influence on language processing, cognitive functions, and word learning, we examined EEG-based intracranial functional connectivity in the ventral and dorsal streams while musicians and nonmusicians learned the meaning of novel words through picture-word associations. In accordance with the dual stream model, word learning was generally associated with increased beta functional connectivity in the ventral stream compared to the dorsal stream. In addition, in the linguistically most demanding "semantic task," musicians outperformed nonmusicians, and this behavioral advantage was accompanied by increased left-hemispheric theta connectivity in both streams. Moreover, theta coherence in the left dorsal pathway was positively correlated with the number of years of music training.

We developed here local field analyses to detect prodromal oscillatory abnormalities. We identified early band-specific patterns in local field potential recorded from freely-moving rats injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg). Theta frequency was significantly reduced and this effect was not related to the decreased locomotion of the animal. Furthermore, LPS-induced alterations show a region specific response when compared between the hippocampal region and medial prefrontal cortex. Delta mean frequency increased in the hippocampal region but not in the prefrontal cortex. We explored also the hypothesis that systemic inflammation increases the propensity of abnormally synchronized brain activity. Our data indicate that the LPS-evoked alteration of delta and theta frequency parameters reflects the formation of abnormal synchronization in similar frequency ranges. The onset of abnormal brain activity was indicated by spike-wave discharges in the range of 1-10 Hz with three main frequency domains. Importantly, the occurrence of spike-wave discharges was observed in the hippocampus but not in the cortex. In summary, the hippocampal theta rhythm is an accurate indicator of the oscillatory changes evoked by LPS application. The findings offer clear patterns of altered brain function that will facilitate mechanistic investigations of brain dysfunction and delirium occurring during sepsis. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Perspective: Assessing the Flexible Acquisition, Integration, and Deployment of Human Spatial Representations and Information	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						spatial representations; spatial information; navigation; egocentric; allocentric; virtual reality; relative vector discrimination (RVD) task	THETA OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY RETRIEVAL; REFERENCE FRAMES; VIRTUAL-REALITY; HUMAN BRAIN; NAVIGATION; ENVIRONMENTS; LOCOMOTION; ROLES; DIRECTION	Studying human spatial navigation in the lab can be challenging, particularly when including non-invasive neural measures like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and scalp encephalography (EEG). While there is broad consensus that human spatial navigation involves both egocentric (self-referenced) and allocentric (world-referenced) coding schemes, exactly how these can be measured in ecologically meaningful situations remains controversial. Here, we explore these two forms of representation and how we might better measure them by reviewing commonly used spatial memory tasks and proposing a new task: the relative vector discrimination (RVD) task. Additionally, we explore how different encoding modalities (desktop virtual reality, immersive virtual reality, maps, and real-world navigation) might alter how egocentric and allocentric representations manifest. Specifically, we discuss desktop virtual reality vs. more immersive forms of navigation that better approximate real-world situations, and the extent to which less immersive encoding modalities alter neural and cognitive codes engaged during navigation more generally. We conclude that while encoding modality likely alters navigation-related codes to some degree, including egocentric and allocentric representations, it does not fundamentally change the underlying representations. Considering these arguments together, we suggest that tools to study human navigation in the lab, such as desktop virtual reality, provide overall a reasonable approximation of in vivo navigation, with some caveats.

Neurophysiology underlying influence of stimulus reliability on audiovisual integration	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; audiovisual asynchrony; audiovisual integration; event-related potentials	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SIMULTANEITY JUDGMENTS; TEMPORAL-ORDER; INFORMATION; SYNCHRONY	We tested the predictions of the dynamic reweighting model (DRM) of audiovisual (AV) speech integration, which posits that spectrotemporally reliable (informative) AV speech stimuli induce a reweighting of processing from low-level to high-level auditory networks. This reweighting decreases sensitivity to acoustic onsets and in turn increases tolerance to AV onset asynchronies (AVOA). EEG was recorded while subjects watched videos of a speaker uttering trisyllabic nonwords that varied in spectrotemporal reliability and asynchrony of the visual and auditory inputs. Subjects judged the stimuli as in-sync or out-ofsync. Results showed that subjects exhibited greater AVOA tolerance for non-blurred than blurred visual speech and for less than more degraded acoustic speech. Increased AVOA tolerance was reflected in reduced amplitude of the P1-P2 auditory evoked potentials, a neurophysiological indication of reduced sensitivity to acoustic onsets and successful AV integration. There was also sustained visual alpha band (8-14 Hz) suppression (desynchronization) following acoustic speech onsets for nonblurred vs. blurred visual speech, consistent with continuous engagement of the visual system as the speech unfolds. The current findings suggest that increased spectrotemporal reliability of acoustic and visual speech promotes robust AV integration, partly by suppressing sensitivity to acoustic onsets, in support of the DRM's reweighting mechanism. Increased visual signal reliability also sustains the engagement of the visual system with the auditory system to maintain alignment of information across modalities.

Multiscale neural connectivity during human sensory processing in the brain	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							VISUAL-PERCEPTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; ATTENTION; GAMMA; BETA; COHERENCE; PARIETAL; DYNAMICS	Stimulus-related brain activity is considered using wavelet-based analysis of neural interactions between occipital and parietal brain areas in alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency bands. We show that human sensory processing related to the visual stimuli perception induces brain response resulted in different ways of parieto-occipital interactions in these bands. In the alpha frequency band the parieto-occipital neuronal network is characterized by homogeneous increase of the interaction between all interconnected areas both within occipital and parietal lobes and between them. In the beta frequency band the occipital lobe starts to play a leading role in the dynamics of the occipital-parietal network: The perception of visual stimuli excites the visual center in the occipital area and then, due to the increase of parieto-occipital interactions, such excitation is transferred to the parietal area, where the attentional center takes place. In the case when stimuli are characterized by a high degree of ambiguity, we find greater increase of the interaction between interconnected areas in the parietal lobe due to the increase of human attention. Based on revealed mechanisms, we describe the complex response of the parieto-occipital brain neuronal network during the perception and primary processing of the visual stimuli. The results can serve as an essential complement to the existing theory of neural aspects of visual stimuli processing.

Several studies have revealed a strong connection between auditory and motor processes and listening to and performing music, and music imagination. Recently, as a logical next step in music and movement, the cognitive and affective neuro-sciences have been directed towards expertise in dance. To understand the versatile and overlapping processes during artistic stimuli, such as music and dance, it is necessary to study them with continuous naturalistic stimuli. Thus, we used long excerpts from the contemporary dance piece Carmen presented with and without music to professional dancers, musicians, and laymen in an EEG laboratory. We were interested in the cortical phase synchrony within each participant group over several frequency bands during uni- and multimodal processing. Dancers had strengthened theta and gamma synchrony during music relative to silence and silent dance, whereas the presence of music decreased systematically the alpha and beta synchrony in musicians. Laymen were the only group of participants with significant results related to dance. Future studies are required to understand whether these results are related to some other factor (such as familiarity to the stimuli), or if our results reveal a new point of view to dance observation and expertise.

Spontaneous Infraslow Fluctuations Modulate Hippocampal EPSP-PS Coupling	ENEURO			English	Article						EEG; evoked response; excitability; hippocampus; infraslow; synapse	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; TO-TRIAL VARIABILITY; DENTATE GYRUS; IN-VIVO; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; THETA-RHYTHM; RAT; EXCITABILITY; STIMULATION	Extensive trial-to-trial variability is a hallmark of most behavioral, cognitive, and physiological processes. Spontaneous brain activity (SBA), a ubiquitous phenomenon that coordinates levels and patterns of neuronal activity throughout the brain, may contribute to this variability by dynamically altering neuronal excitability. In freely-behaving male rats, we observed extensive variability of the hippocampal evoked response across 28-min recording periods despite maintaining constant stimulation parameters of the medial perforant path. This variability was related to antecedent SBA: increases in low-frequency (0.5-9 Hz) and high-frequency (40.25-100 Hz) band-limited power (BLP) in the 4-s preceding stimulation were associated with decreased slope of the field EPSP (fEPSP) and increased population spike (PS) amplitude. These fluctuations in SBA and evoked response magnitude did not appear stochastic but rather exhibited coordinated activity across infraslow timescales (0.005-0.02 Hz). Specifically, infraslow fluctuations in high- and low-frequency BLP were antiphase with changes in fEPSP slope and in phase with changes in PS amplitude. With these divergent effects on the fEPSP and PS, infraslow SBA ultimately modulates EPSP-PS coupling and thereby enables hippocampal circuitry to generate heterogeneous outputs from identical inputs. Consequently, infraslow SBA appears well suited to dynamically alter sensory selection and information processing and highlights the fundamental role of endogenous neuronal activity for shaping the brain's response to incoming stimuli.

The degree to which the self is perceived as a part of social environment is modulated by cultural stereotypes, such as collectivism and individualism. Here, we tested the hypothesis that individuals who endorse collectivist values would spontaneously think more about their relationships with other people and this association would be mediated by connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the rest of the brain. Connectivity was evaluated based on resting state EEG data using the recently developed methods, which combine beam former spatial filtering with seed based connectivity estimation. The formal mediation analysis revealed that collectivism is associated with an enhanced connectivity of MPFC with a set of cortical regions that are frequently co-activated in moral reasoning, empathy, and theory of mind tasks and with diminished connectivity with the precuneus\posterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in self-centered cognition. The relationship between collectivism and social cognition was mediated by MPFC connectivity with the left middle temporal gyrus implying that in participants with collectivistic attitude, thinking about relationships with other people may be associated with semantic memory retrieval and reasoning on moral issues and others' intentions.

Medical informatics (MI) is an important cross-disciplinary field that, along with its applications, has received massive funding from the Chinese government. However, the question of how to evaluate China's input and output in MI remains important and complex issue of great significance for China and the rest of the world. Objective: This paper analyzed, for the first time, the quality and quantity of research by Chinese academics in MI based on their articles published in international specialty journals in recent years and examined MI research hotspots in China. Our purpose is to summarize the experiences and lessons learned by China and the rest of the world as they develop MI. Method: We targeted 18 MI journals listed in the JCR 2016 report and searched for papers published by Chinese academics in these 18 journals in the WOS and PUBMED databases and on journal sites. We also performed data cleansing and categorized the obtained information. We used Excel, SPSS, Ucinet and NetDraw to conduct quantitative analyses on the research papers. Results: A total of 1340 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria of this study. We observed a significant upward trend in the number of articles published over time, particularly after 2011. Lei Jianbo, Huang Zhengxing and Li Jin-song are active Chinese authors in the MI discipline who have written many high-quality publications. Meanwhile, universities remain the primary breeding grounds for scientific research: 93.36% of the articles came from universities. Zhejiang University published the most first-author articles, whereas Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Tsinghua University produced 17.76% of the total articles. According to the lists of authors, 24% of the papers were co-authored with foreign researchers. This rate of cooperation is increasing each year, from 5.88% to the current rate of 39.04%. An analysis of keywords showed that "EMR", "SVM", "Authentication", "Telecare medical information system", "EEG", "ECG" and "RFID" were the most frequently searched terms in popular technological fields, including artificial intelligence and image processing. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of high-frequency keywords and a broadening range of research fields, which has led to the emergence of several research hotspots, including MI systems, mobile health care, telecare, data mining and machine learning. Conclusions: Through the quantitative analysis of publications, we discovered the emergence of three stages - infancy, slow growth and rapid growth - in China's MI research in recent years as academics make achievements in their research works. The global influence of Chinese academics is growing, and they are making increasingly conscious efforts to enter into research collaborations with foreign researchers. The findings of Chinese academics' publications are gaining international recognition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, effectiveness of tACS underlies high variability and dependencies, which, as previous modeling works have suggested, may be mediated by local and network-level brain states. We used magnetoencephalography to record brain activity from 17 healthy participants at rest as they kept their eyes open (EO) or eyes closed (EC) while being stimulated with sham, weak, or strong alpha-tACS using a montage commonly assumed to target occipital areas. We reconstructed the activity of sources in all stimulation conditions by means of beamforming. The analysis of resting-state brain activity revealed an interaction of the external stimulation with the endogenous alpha power increase from EO to EC. This interaction was localized to the posterior cingulate, a region remote from occipital cortex. This suggests state-dependent (EO vs. EC) long-range effects of tACS. In a follow-up analysis of this online-tACS effect, we find evidence that this state-dependency effect is mediated by functional network changes: connection strength from the precuneus was significantly correlated with the state-dependency effect in the posterior cingulate during tACS. No analogous correlation could be found for alpha power modulations in occipital cortex. Altogether, this is the first strong evidence to illustrate how functional network architectures can shape tACS effects.

Its sources are located in the primary auditory cortex and the asymmetry of the planum temporale has previously been associated with hand preference and gender-related differences; thus subject's handedness and gender could potentially influence ASSRs. Nevertheless, electrophysiological studies of ASSRs are mainly dominated by right-handed participants and the observed findings can only be generalized to the right-handed populations. However, for a potential use of 40 Hz ASSR as a translational biomarker of neuropsychiatric disorders, it is important to investigate the response in association to handedness and gender. We included an equal number of left-handed and right-handed males and females and recorded EEG responses during left-ear, right-ear and both ears stimulation. The results of the study suggest that the processing of 40 Hz auditory stimulation depends on the subjects' gender and handedness: significantly lower phase-locking and strength of 40 Hz ASSRs were observed in left-handed females as compared to left-handed males, but right-handers did not differ in 40 Hz ASSRs. Our observation of the opposite impact of gender in the examined handedness groups stresses the importance of careful consideration of handedness and gender factors when evaluating the determinants of inter individual variability of 40 Hz ASSRs. This finding is of particular importance for clinical studies in psychiatry and neurology.

Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in communication and social interaction. The theory of mind (TM) links social deficiencies in ASD with a difficulty in representing the mental states of other people. The Mu rhythm (8-13Hz) has been studied as an expression of the possible neuronal basis of TM. In ASD, the physiological reactivity of the Mu rhythm to motor events is affected. During sleep, there are also phenomena related to sensorimotor processing. Objective. To characterize the Mu rhythm in the sleep of children with level 1 ASD, ages six to 10, and compare it with control children paired by age and sex. Method. Polysomnographic records for two consecutive nights. The record of the second night was analyzed visually (the first was considered habituation) to identify and select Mu rhythm segments throughout the night. The extracted segments were analyzed using the fast Fourier transform and subsequently with t tests on the data of C-3 and C-4. Results. A significant difference was found in the power spectrums of C-3 and C-4 t (1, 144) = 3.038, p= .003 and t (1, 144) = -2.301, p= .023, respectively. Discussion and conclusion. The results of this study are consistent with the morphological and topographic characteristics found in studies conducted during wakefulness. The results suggest that the Mu rhythm is caused intrinsically, without external sensory stimulation, and that there is a difference in this generation in the population with ASD.

We test the effect of tFUS on 7T BOLD fMRI signals from individual finger representations in the human primary motor cortex (M1) and connected cortical motor regions. Participants (N = 5) performed a cued finger tapping task in a 7T MRI scanner with their thumb, index, and middle fingers to produce a BOLD signal for individual M1 finger representations during either tFUS or sham neuromodulation to the thumb representation. Results: Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in activation volume of the M1 thumb representation for the tFUS condition as compared to sham. No differences in percent BOLD changes were found. This effect was spatially confined as the index and middle finger M1 finger representations did not show similar significant changes in either percent change or activation volume. No effects were seen during tFUS to M1 in the supplementary motor area or the dorsal premotor cortex. Conclusions: Single element tFUS can be paired with high field MRI that does not induce significant artifact. tFUS increases activation volumes of the targeted finger representation that is spatially restricted within M1 but does not extend to functionally connected motor regions.

However, the restoration of motor function following lesions of the corticospinal tract requires also the recruitment of additional neurons to increase the net corticospinal output. For this purpose, we investigated a novel protocol based on brain state-dependent paired associative stimulation. Motor imagery (MI)-related electroencephalography was recorded in healthy males and females for brain state-dependent control of both cortical and peripheral stimulation in a brain-machine interface environment. State-dependency was investigated with concurrent, delayed, and independent stimulation relative to the MI task. Specifically, sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta-band (16-22 Hz) triggered peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis and transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation, either synchronously or subsequently. These MI-related paradigms were compared with paired cortical and peripheral input applied independent of the brain state. Cortical stimulation resulted in a significant increase in corticospinal excitability only when applied brain state-dependently and synchronously to peripheral input. These gains were resistant to a depotentiation task, revealed a nonlinear evolution of plasticity, and were mediated via the recruitment of additional corticospinal neurons rather than via synchronization of neuronal firing. Recruitment of additional corticospinal pathways may be achieved when cortical and peripheral inputs are applied concurrently, andduring beta-ERD. These findings resemble a gating mechanism and are potentially important for developing closed-loop brain stimulation for the treatment of hand paralysis following lesions of the corticospinal tract.

This study examined the outcome of epilepsy in patients with mitochondrial disorders and its relation with the clinical phenotype, genotype and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Patients and methods: The cohort was derived from the database of 67 patients with definite genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders evaluated over a period of 11 years (2006-2016). Among this, 27 had epilepsy and were included in final analysis. Data were analyzed with special reference to clinical phenotypes, genotypes, epilepsy characteristics, EEG findings, anti epileptic drugs used, therapeutic response, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Patients were divided into three groups according to the seizure frequency at the time of last follow up: Group I- Seizure free; Group II- Infrequent seizures; Group III- uncontrolled seizures. For each group the clinical phenotype, genotype, magnetic resonance imaging and duration of epilepsy were compared. Results: The phenotypes & genotypes included Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke like episodes (MELAS) & m.3243A > G mutation (n = 10), Myoclonic Epilepsy Ragged Red Fiber syndrome (MERRF) m.8344A > G mutation (n = 4), Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia plus & POLGI mutation (CPEO, n = 6), episodic neuroregression due to nuclear mutations (n = 6; NDUFVI (n = 3), NDUFA1, NDUFS2, MPV17-1 one each), and one patient with infantile basal ganglia stroke syndrome, mineralizing angiopathy & MT-ND5 mutations. Seven patients (25.9%) were seizure free; seven had infrequent seizures (25.9%), while thirteen (48.1%) had frequent uncontrolled seizures. Majority of the subjects in seizure free group had episodic neuroregression & leukoencephalopathy due to nuclear mutations (85.7%). Patients in group II with infrequent seizures had CPEO, POLG1 mutation and a normal MRI (71%) while 62% of the subjects in group III had MELAS, m.3243A > G mutation and stroke like lesions on MRI. Conclusions: A fair correlation exists between the outcome of epilepsy, clinical phenotypes, genotypes and magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The recognition of these patterns is important clinically because of the therapeutic and prognostic implications.

Effects of Intrahippocampal Injections of Melipramin on EEG, Brain Self-Stimulation, and Behavioral Indices of Rats under Conditions of Neurogenic Stress	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						intrahippocampal microinjections; melipramin; chronic neurogenic stress; brain self-stimulation (BSS); two-chamber test; open field test	ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE; HIPPOCAMPUS; FREQUENCY; SYSTEM	In young (3-month-old) male Wistar rats, we studied the effects of intrahippocampal microinjections of melipramin under conditions of emotional stress induced by sessions of electrical nociceptive stimulation of the limbs. In most cases, seven-day-long stressing resulted in suppression of electrical activity of the hippocampus, exerted ambivalent effects on the frequency of brain self-stimulation (BSS) events, decreased the communicability of animals in the two-chamber test, and increased the latencies of going of the animal from the arena center and grooming episodes in the open field test. Injections of melipramin interfered with the development of stress-induced disorders in the hippocampus, decreased the normalized content of beta oscillations in the neocortex and the theta-index in the hypothalamus, increased the BSS frequency, and decreased the level of negativation of the behavioral manifestations of this phenomenon. The duration of stay of a rat near the partition in the two-chamber test increased, the mobility and number of grooming episodes in the open field enhanced, but the latency of leaving the arena center also increased (similarly to what was observed in the control). On the 8th-9th day of the poststress period, behavioral disorders of rats of the control group in the two-chamber test were smoothed to a significant extent. The stability of the examined indices or the reverse development of stress-induced disorders within the above period in animals injected with melipramin were indicative of a significant role of the hippocampus in the formation of central effects of this antidepressant and also of adaptogenic and stress-protective properties of this drug.

Cortico-Striatal Cross-Frequency Coupling and Gamma Genesis Disruptions in Huntington's Disease Mouse and Computational Models	ENEURO			English	Article						fast-spiking interneuron; gamma; Huntington's disease	FAST-SPIKING INTERNEURONS; BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; MEDIUM SPINY NEURONS; GAP-JUNCTIONS; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; VENTRAL STRIATUM; BETA RHYTHMS; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS	Abnormal gamma band power across cortex and striatum is an important phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) in both patients and animal models, but neither the origin nor the functional relevance of this phenotype is well understood. Here, we analyzed local field potential (LFP) activity in freely behaving, symptomatic R6/2 and Q175 mouse models and corresponding wild-type (WT) controls. We focused on periods of quiet rest, which show strong gamma activity in HD mice. Simultaneous recording from motor cortex and its target area in dorsal striatum in the R6/2 model revealed exaggerated functional coupling over that observed in WT between the phase of delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) in cortex and striatum and striatal amplitude modulation of low gamma frequencies (25-55 Hz; i.e., phase-amplitude coupling, PAC), but no evidence that abnormal cortical activity alone can account for the increase in striatal gamma power. Both HD mouse models had stronger coupling of gamma amplitude to delta phase and more unimodal phase distributions than their WT counterparts. To assess the possible role of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in these phenomena, we developed a computational model based on additional striatal recordings from Q175 mice. Changes in peak gamma frequency and power ratio were readily reproduced by our computational model, accounting for several experimental findings reported in the literature. Our results suggest that HD is characterized by both a reorganization of cortico-striatal drive and specific population changes related to intrastriatal synaptic coupling.

However, previous studies are limited in that most studied subjects with other comorbidities that may have affected cortical activity. In this regard, to assess ongoing cortical oscillatory activity in idiopathic hyperacusis patients with no comorbidities, we compared differences in resting-state cortical oscillatory patterns between five idiopathic hyperacusis subjects and five normal controls. The hyperacusis group demonstrated significantly higher electrical activity in the right auditory-related cortex for the gamma frequency band and left superior parietal lobule (SPL) for the delta frequency band versus the control group. The hyperacusis group also showed significantly decreased functional connectivity between the left auditory cortex (AC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), between the left AC and left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) for the gamma band, and between the right insula and bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and between the left AC and left sgACC for the theta band versus the control group. The higher electrical activity in the SPL may indicate a readiness of circuit-breaker activity to shift attention to forthcoming sound stimuli. Also, because of the disrupted salience network, consisting of the dACC and insula, abnormally increased salience to all sound stimuli may emerge, as a consequence of decreased top-down control of the AC by the dACC and dysfunctional emotional weight attached to auditory stimuli by the OFC. Taken together, abnormally enhanced attention and salience to forthcoming sound stimuli may render hyperacusis subjects hyperresponsive to non-noxious auditory stimuli.

Neuron dynamics variability and anomalous phase synchronization of neural networks	CHAOS			English	Article							DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; RECURRENCE PLOTS; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT; EPILEPSY; EEG	Anomalous phase synchronization describes a synchronization phenomenon occurring even for the weakly coupled network and characterized by a non-monotonous dependence of the synchronization strength on the coupling strength. Its existence may support a theoretical framework to some neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's and some episodes of seizure behavior generated by epilepsy. Despite the success of controlling or suppressing the anomalous phase synchronization in neural networks applying external perturbations or inducing ambient changes, the origin of the anomalous phase synchronization as well as the mechanisms behind the suppression is not completely known. Here, we consider networks composed of N = 2000 coupled neurons in a small-world topology for two well known neuron models, namely, the Hodgkin-Huxley-like and the Hindmarsh-Rose models, both displaying the anomalous phase synchronization regime. We show that the anomalous phase synchronization may be related to the individual behavior of the coupled neurons; particularly, we identify a strong correlation between the behavior of the inter-bursting-intervals of the neurons, what we call neuron variability, to the ability of the network to depict anomalous phase synchronization. We corroborate the ideas showing that external perturbations or ambient parameter changes that eliminate anomalous phase synchronization and at the same time promote small changes in the individual dynamics of the neurons, such that an increasing individual variability of neurons implies a decrease of anomalous phase synchronization. Finally, we demonstrate that this effect can be quantified using a well known recurrence quantifier, the "determinism." Moreover, the results obtained by the determinism are based on only the mean field potential of the network, turning these measures more suitable to be used in experimental situations.

Using a novel protocol, EEG data were simultaneously recorded from ethnic Chinese religious believers in group and individual settings as they rated the perceived efficacy of low, medium, and high arousal spirit-medium rituals presented as video clips. Neural oscillatory patterns were then analyzed for these perceptual judgements, categorized as low, medium, and high efficacy. The results revealed distinct neural signatures and behavioral patterns between the experimental conditions. Arousal levels predicted ratings of ritual efficacy. Increased efficacy was marked by suppressed alpha and beta power, regardless of group or individual setting. In groups, efficacy ratings converged. Individual setting showed increased within-participant phase synchronization in alpha and beta bands, while group setting enhanced between-participant theta phase synchronization. This reflected group participants' orientation toward a common perspective and social coordination. These findings suggest that co-presence in groups leads to a social-tuning effect supported by between-participant theta phase synchrony. Together these neural synchrony patterns reveal how collective rituals have both individual and communal dimensions. The emotionality of spirit-medium rituals drives individual perceptions of efficacy, while co-presence in groups signals the significance of an event and socially tunes enhanced agreement in perceptual ratings. In other words, mass gatherings may foster social cohesion without necessarily requiring group-size scaling limitations of direct face-to-face interaction. This could have implications for the scaling computability of synchrony in large groups as well as for humanistic studies in areas such as symbolic interactionism.

The current study explored the time course of the effect of trust decisions on outcome evaluation processing using electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. Twenty-two healthy young adults made trust or distrust decisions regarding a message they received from a stranger in a card game. The results showed that at the early stage of outcome processing, feedback-related negativity (FRN) was more negative for losses than for gains, and more importantly, this valence effect of FRN was greater for outcomes following trust decisions than distrust decisions. At the later stage, the P3 was larger for gains than for losses and for outcomes following trust decisions than distrust decisions. In addition, at both the early and late stages, differences in the mid-frontal theta power between losses and gains were also greater in the trust condition than in the distrust condition. These findings indicate that trust decisions could effectively modulate the processing of outcome evaluation at different stages. The trust effect at the early stage of outcome processing suggests that compared to distrust decisions, trust decisions result in greater motivation and expectancy to obtain positive outcomes. While the trust effect on the later stage of outcome processing suggests that individuals pay more attention and feel stronger emotional experience to the outcomes following trust decisions. This study sheds light on the neural mechanisms of trust decisions modulating outcome processing.

Cortical nociceptive processes are reduced by visual alpha-band entrainment in the human brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LASER-EVOKED POTENTIALS; REALISTIC HEAD MODEL; PAIN PERCEPTION; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; CINGULATE CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; LOCALIZATION; MODULATION; COMPONENTS	BackgroundAcute noxious stimuli induce a suppression of cortical alpha activity, yet little is known about whether increasing alpha activity affects the processing of noxious stimuli. We have previously shown that visual alpha stimulation reduces experimental pain. Here, we demonstrate that increasing alpha power causes a reciprocal suppression of acute nociceptive processing. MethodsWe attempted to increase cortical alpha activity through visual entrainment at 8Hz, 10Hz and 12Hz to investigate the influence on the electrophysiological pain response. Moderately painful laser-heat stimuli were delivered following 10minutes of visual entrainment across the alpha range. ResultsAlpha power increased significantly relative to the 1Hz control condition following 8Hz and 10Hz visual stimulation. Significant reductions in the P2 peak amplitude of the laser-evoked potential were found following visual entrainment at 10Hz; the frequency stimulation resulting in the largest reduction in pain perception. Source analysis revealed that, following the 10Hz stimulation, sources of increased alpha power and decreased nociceptive processing overlapped in precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, with further reductions in nociceptive processing in insula cortex. ConclusionsAs far as we are aware, this is the first study to provide direct evidence that experimental induction of increased alpha power suppresses the cortical processing of acute pain. SignificanceWhile it is known that visual stimulation can increase the brain's oscillatory alpha rhythms, here, we show that this increase in alpha power occurs alongside reduced cortical processing of nociception, as measured with EEG.

We recently reported the role of intradermal nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway in CQ-evoked scratching in mice. Chloroquine stimulates neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity to over-producing NO in the skin. Sumatriptan, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 1b/1d receptors (5-HTR1b/1d) agonist, is involved in pain and used to treat migraine and cluster headaches. According to previous studies, sumatriptan inhibits NOS activity. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of sumatriptan on CQ-induced scratching. We used the rostral back model of itch. Chloroquine was injected intradermally into the rostral back of NMRI mice, and the scratching behavior was evaluated by measuring the number of bouts over 30 min. We evaluated the effect of sumatriptan and combination of sumatriptan and a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, L-N-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), on the scratching behavior. Additionally, the changes of skin, hippocampus, and cortical nitrite level after different treatments were studied. Intraperitoneal and intradermal sumatriptan attenuates CQ-induced itch which reversed by GR-127935, the selective 5-HTR1b and 5-HTR1d antagonist. Co-administration of subeffective doses of sumatriptan and L-NAME significantly decreases the scratching behavior. Intradermal injection of CQ significantly increases the intradermal nitrite levels while it does not have any significant effects on hippocampal or cortical nitrite concentrations. Likewise, the effective doses of intraperitoneal and intradermal sumatriptan significantly reduce intradermal nitrite levels. We concluded that sumatriptan suppresses CQ-induced itch most likely by activating 5-HT1b/1d receptors. This effect probably mediates through NO pathway.

J	Kim, H; Kim, J				Kim, Hyunchul; Kim, Jungsuk			Online Epileptic Seizure Detection: Statistical Signal Processing Based on Multichannel Electroencephalogram Sensors	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG Sensor; Epileptic Seizure; Statistical Signal Processing	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; BRAIN	This paper presents the framework for an online algorithm for epileptic seizure detection based on component and discriminant analysis combined with a Bayesian decision approach. In our approach, feature vectors representing ictal, interictal, and normal brain activity are extracted from multichannel electrocorticographic (ECoG) sensor data sets based on autoregressive (AR) model parameter estimation. AR model parameters are estimated according to the Yule-Walker equation for offline feature extraction, whereas the weighted least square estimation (WLSE) is adopted for efficient online AR model parameter estimation. We also consider principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and the most discriminative information extraction to aid online epileptic seizure detection. The extracted information is imported to the online detector implanted on the brain surface. We consider PCA combined with cosine similarity and LDA-based similarity score as a decision rule. Simulation result shows that the PCA method combined with cosine similarity has average 96.6% detection accuracy and 1.2 ms detection latency for the test vectors under study. For fair comparison of detector performance, the line length detection algorithm is tested under the same simulation condition and the result shows that the approach based on the PCA method with cosine similarity measure outperforms the LDA-based approach and the line length detection algorithm. Based on the study, we further propose a hybrid approach combining PCA with cosine similarity and an LDA-based similarity score method. The simulation result shows that the hybrid method has a higher detection rate under the same false detection rate compared to the PCA method with cosine similarity measure.

We studied the intracortical organization of spindles in men and women by recording spontaneous sleep spindles from different cortical layers using linear microelectrode arrays. Two patterns of spindle generation were identified using visual inspection, and confirmed with factor analysis. Spindles (10-16Hz) were largest and most common in upper and middle channels, with limited involvement of deep channels. Many spindles were observed in only upper or only middle channels, but approximately half occurred in both. In spindles involving both middle and upper channels, the spindle envelope onset in middle channels led upper by similar to 25-50 ms on average. The phase relationship between spindle waves in upper and middle channels varied dynamically within spindle epochs, and across individuals. Current source density analysis demonstrated that upper and middle channel spindles were both generated by an excitatory supragranular current sink while an additional deep source was present for middle channel spindles only. Only middle channel spindles were accompanied by deep low (25-50 Hz) and high (70-170 Hz) gamma activity. These results suggest that upper channel spindles are generated by supragranular pyramids, and middle channel by infragranular. Possibly, middle channel spindles are generated by core thalamocortical afferents, and upper channel by matrix. The concurrence of these patterns could reflect engagement of cortical circuits in the integration of more focal (core) and distributed (matrix) aspects of memory. These results demonstrate that at least two distinct intracortical systems generate human sleep spindles.

J	Drijvers, L; Ozyurek, A; Jensen, O				Drijvers, Linda; Ozyurek, Asli; Jensen, Ole			Alpha and Beta Oscillations Index Semantic Congruency between Speech and Gestures in Clear and Degraded Speech	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ADVERSE LISTENING CONDITIONS; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; NEURAL INTEGRATION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; ICONIC GESTURES; HUMAN BRAIN; LANGUAGE; INFORMATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG	Previous work revealed that visual semantic information conveyed by gestures can enhance degraded speech comprehension, but the mechanisms underlying these integration processes under adverse listening conditions remain poorly understood. We used MEG to investigate how oscillatory dynamics support speech-gesture integration when integration load is manipulated by auditory (e.g., speech degradation) and visual semantic (e.g., gesture congruency) factors. Participants were presented with videos of an actress uttering an action verb in clear or degraded speech, accompanied by a matching (mixing gesture + mixing) or mismatching (drinking gesture + walking) gesture. In clear speech, alpha/beta power was more suppressed in the left inferior frontal gyrus and motor and visual cortices when integration load increased in response to mismatching versus matching gestures. In degraded speech, beta power was less suppressed over posterior STS and medial temporal lobe for mismatching compared with matching gestures, showing that integration load was lowest when speech was degraded and mismatching gestures could not be integrated and disambiguate the degraded signal. Our results thus provide novel insights on how low-frequency oscillatory modulations in different parts of the cortex support the semantic audiovisual integration of gestures in clear and degraded speech: When speech is clear, the left inferior frontal gyrus and motor and visual cortices engage because higher-level semantic information increases semantic integration load. When speech is degraded, posterior STS/middle temporal gyrus and medial temporal lobe are less engaged because integration load is lowest when visual semantic information does not aid lexical retrieval and speech and gestures cannot be integrated.

Through mechanisms that are still unclear, normal physiological pain can lose its adaptive value and evolve into pathological chronic neuropathic pain. Chronic pain is a multifaceted experience that can be understood in terms of somatosensory, affective, and cognitive dimensions, each with associated symptoms and neural signals. While there have been many attempts to treat chronic pain, in this article we will argue that feedback-controlled 'closed-loop' deep brain stimulation (DBS) offers an urgent and promising route for treatment. Contemporary DBS trials for chronic pain use "open-loop" approaches in which tonic stimulation is delivered with fixed parameters to a single brain region. The impact of key variables such as the target brain region and the stimulation waveform is unclear, and long-term efficacy has mixed results. We hypothesize that chronic pain is due to abnormal synchronization between brain networks encoding the somatosensory, affective and cognitive dimensions of pain, and that multisite, closed-loop DBS provides an intuitive mechanism for disrupting that synchrony. By (1) identifying biomarkers of the subjective pain experience and (2) integrating these signals into a state-space representation of pain, we can create a predictive model of each patient's pain experience. Then, by establishing how stimulation in different brain regions influences individual neural signals, we can design real-time, closed-loop therapies tailored to each patient. While chronic pain is a complex disorder that has eluded modern therapies, rich historical data and state-of-the-art technology can now be used to develop a promising treatment.

However, network-level analyses of anesthesia, particularly in humans, are sparse. The authors hypothesized that propofol-induced loss of consciousness results in functional disconnection of human sensorimotor cortices underlying the loss of volitional motor responses. Methods: The authors recorded local field potentials from sensorimotor cortices in patients with Parkinson disease (N = 12) and essential tremor (N = 7) undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery, before and after propofol-induced loss of consciousness. Local spectral power and interregional connectivity (coherence and imaginary coherence) were evaluated separately across conditions for the two populations. Results: Propofol anesthesia caused power increases for frequencies between 2 and 100 Hz across the sensorimotor cortices and a shift of the dominant spectral peak in and frequencies toward lower frequencies (median SD peak frequency: 24.5 +/- 2.6 Hz to 12.8 +/- 2.3 Hz in Parkinson disease; 13.8 +/- 2.1 Hz to 12.1 +/- 1.0 Hz in essential tremor). Despite local increases in power, sensorimotor cortical coherence was suppressed with propofol in both cohorts, specifically in frequencies (18 to 29 Hz) for Parkinson disease and and (10 to 48 Hz) in essential tremor. Conclusions: The decrease in functional connectivity between sensory and motor cortices, despite an increase in local spectral power, suggests that propofol causes a functional disconnection of cortices with increases in autonomous activity within cortical regions. This pattern occurs across diseases evaluated, suggesting that these may be generalizable effects of propofol in patients with movement disorders and beyond.

In the present study, electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 27 young adults (22-25 years) and 25 old adults (61-76 years) were recorded during an audiovisual temporal asynchrony integration task with seven conditions [auditory (A), visual (V), AV, A50V, A100V, V50A and V100A]. We calculated the phase lag index (PLI)-weighted connectivity networks modulated by the audiovisual tasks and found that the PLI connections showed obvious dynamic changes after stimulus onset. In the theta (47 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) bands, the AV and V50A conditions induced stronger functional connections and higher global and local efficiencies, reflecting a stronger audiovisual integration effect, which was attributed to the auditory information arriving at the primary auditory cortex earlier than the visual information reaching the primary visual cortex. Importantly, the functional connectivity and network efficiencies of old adults revealed higher global and local efficiencies and higher degree in both the theta and alpha bands. These larger network efficiencies indicated that old adults might experience more difficulties in attention and cognitive control during the audiovisual integration task with temporal asynchrony than young adults. There were significant associations between network efficiencies and peak time of integration only in young adults. We propose that an audiovisual task with multiple conditions might arouse the appropriate attention in young adults but would lead to a ceiling effect in old adults. Our findings provide new insights into the network topography of old adults during audiovisual integration and highlight higher functional connectivity and network efficiencies due to greater cognitive demand.

Subjects involved in a cooperative but frustrating task (poor performance as manipulated by an external feedback) were required to cooperate (T1) during an attentional task in a way to synchronize their responses and obtain better outcomes. Methods: We manipulated their strategies by providing false feedbacks (T2) signaling the incapacity to create a synergy, which was reinforced by a general negative evaluation halfway through the game. A control condition was provided (no cooperation required, T0) as well as a check for possible learning effect (time series analysis). The effects of the feedback in modulating subjects' behavioral performance and electrocortical activity were explored by means of brain oscillations (delta, theta, alpha, beta) and autonomic activity (heart rate, HR; skin conductance activity, SCR). Results: Results showed a specific pattern of behavioral, neural, and peripheral responses after the social feedback. In fact, within this condition, worse behavioral outcomes emerged, with longer response times with respect to the prefeedback one. In parallel, a specific right-lateralized effect was observed over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with increased delta and theta power compared to the previous condition. Moreover, increased SCR was observed with respect to the first part. Conclusions: Two interpretations are put forward to explain the present findings: 1) the contribution of negative emotions in response to failing interactions or 2) a motivational disengagement toward goal-oriented cooperation elicited by frustrating evaluations.

Our understanding of the functional significance of these ERP components has been hampered by variability in their robustness, as well as their temporal and scalp distribution across studies. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of choice of reference electrode or spatial filter on the number, timing and scalp distribution of ERP elicited during task-switching. We compared four configurations, including the two most common (i.e., average mastoid reference and common average reference) and two novel ones that aim to reduce volume conduction (i.e., reference electrode standardization technique (REST) and surface Laplacian) on mixing cost and switch cost effects in cue-locked and target-locked ERP waveforms in 201 healthy participants. All four spatial filters showed the same well-characterized ERP components that are typically seen in task-switching paradigms: the cue-locked switch positivity and target-locked N2/P3 effect. However, both the number of ERP effects associated with mixing and switch cost, and their temporal and spatial resolution were greater with the surface Laplacian transformation which revealed rapid temporal adjustments that were not identifiable with other spatial filters. We conclude that the surface Laplacian transformation may be more suited to characterize EEG signatures of complex spatiotemporal networks involved in cognitive control.	[Wong, Aaron S.

These disturbances are apparent in experiments showing time delays between motor commands and visual feedback. The experimental paradigm manipulating temporal delay is considered possible to clarify, in detail, the degree of altered limb perception, peculiarity and movement disorders that are caused by temporal sensorimotor incongruence. However, the neural mechanisms of these body perceptions, peculiarity and motor control remain unknown. In this experiment, we used exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) with independent component analysis (ICA) to clarify the neural mechanisms of altered limb perceptions caused by temporal sensorimotor incongruence. Seventeen healthy participants were recruited, and temporal sensorimotor incongruence was systematically evoked using a visual feedback delay system. Participants periodically extended their right wrists while viewing video images of their hands that were delayed by 0, 150, 250, 350 and 600 ms. To investigate neural mechanisms, altered limb perceptions were then rated using the 7-point Liken scale and brain activities were concomitantly examined with electroencephalographic (EEG) analyses using eLORETA-ICA. These experiments revealed that peculiarities are caused prior to perceptions of limb loss and heaviness. Moreover, we show that supplementary motor and parietal association areas are involved in changes of peculiarity, limb loss, heaviness and movement accuracy due to temporal sensorimotor incongruence. We suggest that abnormalities in these areas contribute to neural mechanisms that modify altered limb perceptions and movement accuracy.

Previous Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) studies have shown that presentation of emotional negative stimuli affects human motor cortex excitability resulting in larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Up to date no TMS studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effect of personal memories with negative emotional value on corticospinal excitability. In this study we hypothesized that negative AM retrieval will modulate corticomotor excitability and sensorimotor integration as determined by TMS neurophysiological parameters. Furthermore, we investigated whether TMS responses during retrieval of negative AM are associated with specific personality traits. Twelve healthy subjects were asked to recall either a negative or a neutral AM across two different days in a randomized order. During this memory retrieval, the following TMS parameters were recorded: MEPs; Short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and Intracortical facilitation (ICF); Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and Long- latency afferent inhibition (LAI). Personality traits were assessed by using the Big Five scale. Statistical analysis was performed using factorial ANOVAs and multiple linear regression models. When compared to retrieval of neutral AM, recollection of negative AM induced a larger increase in MEP amplitude, an increase in ICF, and a decrease in SAI. The neuroticism personality trait was a significant predictor of the MEP amplitude increase during retrieval of negative AM. Altogether these results indicate that cortical excitability and sensorimotor integration are selectively modulated by the valence of AM. These results provide the first TMS evidence that the modulatory effect of the AM retrieval is associated with specific personality traits.

Anomia, a disruption of semantic memory access, is the most common residual language disturbance and is seen in dementia and following injury to temporal cortex. While such anomia has been well characterized by lesion symptom mapping studies, its pathophysiology is not well understood. We hypothesize that inputs to the semantic memory system engage a specific heteromodal network hub that integrates lexical retrieval with the appropriate semantic content. Such a network hub has been proposed by others, but has thus far eluded precise spatiotemporal delineation. This limitation in our understanding of semantic memory has impeded progress in the treatment of anomia. We evaluated the cortical structure and dynamics of the lexical semantic network in driving speech production in a large cohort of patients with epilepsy using electrocorticography (n = 64), functional MRI (n = 36), and direct cortical stimulation (n = 30) during two generative language processes that rely on semantic knowledge: visual picture naming and auditory naming to definition. Each task also featured a non-semantic control condition: scrambled pictures and reversed speech, respectively. These large-scale data of the left, language-dominant hemisphere uniquely enable convergent, high-resolution analyses of neural mechanisms characterized by rapid, transient dynamics with strong interactions between distributed cortical substrates. We observed three stages of activity during both visual picture naming and auditory naming to definition that were serially organized: sensory processing, lexical semantic processing, and articulation. Critically, the second stage was absent in both the visual and auditory control conditions. Group activity maps from both electrocorticography and functional MRI identified heteromodal responses in middle fusiform gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, and inferior frontal gyrus; furthermore, the spectrotemporal profiles of these three regions revealed coincident activity preceding articulation. Only in the middle fusiform gyrus did direct cortical stimulation disrupt both naming tasks while still preserving the ability to repeat sentences. These convergent data strongly support a model in which a distinct neuroanatomical substrate in middle fusiform gyrus provides access to object semantic information. This under-appreciated locus of semantic processing is at risk in resections for temporal lobe epilepsy as well as in trauma and strokes that affect the inferior temporal cortex-it may explain the range of anomic states seen in these conditions. Further characterization of brain network behaviour engaging this region in both healthy and diseased states will expand our understanding of semantic memory and further development of therapies directed at anomia.

Mindfulness-based training with transcranial direct current stimulation modulates neuronal resource allocation in working memory: A randomized pilot study with a nonequivalent control group	HELIYON			English	Article						Psychology; Clinical psychology; Neuroscience	HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; BRAIN-STIMULATION; NEURAL PLASTICITY; ATTENTION	Mindfulness-based training (MBT) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) methods such as direct current stimulation (tDCS) have demonstrated promise for the augmentation of cognitive abilities. The current study investigated the potential compatibility of concurrent "electrical" MBT and tDCS (or eMBT) by testing its combined effects on behavioral and neurophysiological indices of working memory (WM) and attentional resource allocation. Thirty-four healthy participants were randomly assigned to either a MBT task with tDCS group (eMBT) or an active control training task with sham tDCS (Control) group. Training lasted 4-weeks, with up to twenty MBT sessions and with up to eight of those sessions that were eMBT sessions. Electroencephalography was acquired during varying WM load conditions using the n-back task (1-, 2-, 3-back), along with performance on complex WM span tasks (operation and symmetry span) and fluid intelligence measures (Ravens and Shipley) before and after training. Improved performance was observed only on the 3-back and spatial span tasks for eMBT but not the Control group. During 3-back performance in the eMBT group, an increase in P3 amplitude and theta power at electrode site Pz was also observed, along with a simultaneous decrease in frontal midline P3 amplitude and theta power compared to the Control group. These results are consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis, where higher cognitive capacity was associated with more distributed brain activity (i.e., increase in parietal and decrease in frontal amplitudes). Future longitudinal studies are called upon to further examine the direct contributions of tDCS on MBT by assessing the differential effects of electrode montage, polarity, current strength and a direct contrast between the eMBT and MBT conditions on performance and neuroimaging outcome data. While preliminary, the current results provided evidence for the potential compatibility of using eMBT to modulate WM capacity through the allocation of attention and its neurophysiological correlates.

Conventional decoding pipeline for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) consists of chained different stages of feature extraction, time-frequency analysis and statistical learning models. Each of these stages uses a different algorithm trained in a sequential manner, which makes it difficult to make the whole system adaptive. The goal was to create an adaptive online system with a single objective function and a single learning algorithm so that the whole system can be trained in parallel to increase the decoding performance. Here, we used deep neural networks consisting of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called long short term memory (LSTM) to address these needs. Approach. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) data collected by Kubanek et al. The task consisted of individual finger flexions upon a visual cue. Our model combined a hierarchical feature extractor CNN and a RNN that was able to process sequential data and recognize temporal dynamics in the neural data. CNN was used as the feature extractor and LSTM was used as the regression algorithm to capture the temporal dynamics of the signal. Main results. We predicted the finger trajectory using ECoG signals and compared results for the least angle regression (LARS), CNN-LSTM, random forest, LSTM model (LSTM_HC, for using hard-coded features) and a decoding pipeline consisting of band-pass filtering, energy extraction, feature selection and linear regression. The results showed that the deep learning models performed better than the commonly used linear model. The deep learning models not only gave smoother and more realistic trajectories but also learned the transition between movement and rest state. Significance. This study demonstrated a decoding network for BMI that involved a convolutional and recurrent neural network model. It integrated the feature extraction pipeline into the convolution and pooling layer and used LSTM layer to capture the state transitions. The discussed network eliminated the need to separately train the model at each step in the decoding pipeline. The whole system can be jointly optimized using stochastic gradient descent and is capable of online learning.

Nevertheless, there remain several controversies surrounding ET, such as whether it is a disorder of abnormal neuronal oscillations within the tremor network. In this work, the resting-state fMRI data were collected from 17 ET patients and 17 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. First, using FOur-dimensional (spatiotemporal) Consistency of local neural Activities (FOCA) the abnormal synchronization of fMRI signals in ET patients were investigated. Then, global functional connectivity intensity (gFCI) and density (gFCD) were analyzed in the regions exhibiting significant FOCA differences. Compared with healthy controls, patients with ET showed the increased FOCA values found in the bilateral cuneus, the left lingual gyrus, the left paracentral lobule, the right middle temporal gyrus, the bilateral precentral gyrus, the right postcentral gyrus, the pallidum and putamen. Decreased FOCA values in ET patients were located in the frontal gyrus, the bilateral anterior cingulate and the medial dorsal nucleus of right thalamus. In ET patients, significant changes in gFCI and gFCD were located in the cuneus, the middle temporal gyrus and the middle frontal gyms. Changes in gFCI were also found in the medial frontal gyms and thalamus in addition to changes in gFCD in the precentral gyms. Our results provided further evidence that ET might present with abnormal spontaneous activity in the tremor network, including motor-related cotex, basal ganglia and thalamus, as well as distributed non-motor areas. This work also demonstrated that FOCA and functional connectivity have the potential to provide important insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of ET.

As these characteristics are problematic for most existing clock-based models of interval timing, here we explore an alternative notion that suggests that time perception and working memory encoding might be closely connected. In this integrative model, the consolidation of a new item in working memory initiates cortical oscillations that also signal the onset of a. time interval. The objective of this study was to test whether memory consolidation indeed acts as the starting signal of interval timing. Participants performed an attentional blink task in which they not only reported the targets, but also the estimated target onsets, allowing us to calculate estimated lag. In the attentional blink task, the second target (T2) in a rapid serial visual presentation is often not reported when it follows quickly after the first target (T1). However, if this fast T2 is reported, memory consolidation of T2 is presumably delayed. Consequently, if memory consolidation determines interval onset, we would expect a later estimated onset when consolidation is delayed. Furthermore, as the P3 ERP component is assumed to reflect memory consolidation, we expect that the estimated onsets and subjective lag are functions of the P3 latencies. The behavioral data show that the presumed delay in memory consolidation did not lead to later estimated onsets. In addition, the EEG results suggest that there was no relationship between P3 latency and subjective lag or estimated onset. Overall, our results suggest that there is no direct link between the encoding of items in working memory and sub-second interval timing of these items in the attentional blink task.

However, a reliable characterization of sleep patterns in this clinical population continues to be challenging given severely altered brain oscillations, frequent and extended artifacts in clinical recordings and the absence of established staging criteria. In the present study, we try to address these issues and investigate the usefulness of a multivariate machine learning technique based on permutation entropy, a complexity measure. Specifically, we used long-term polysomnography (PSG), along with video recordings in day and night periods in a sample of 23 DOC; 12 patients were diagnosed as Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) and 11 were diagnosed as Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Eight hour PSG recordings of healthy sleepers (N = 26) were additionally used for training and setting parameters of supervised and unsupervised model, respectively. In DOC, the supervised classification (wake, N1, N2, N3 or REM) was validated using simultaneous videos which identified periods with prolonged eye opening or eye closure. The supervised classification revealed that out of the 23 subjects, 11 patients (5 MCS and 6 UWS) yielded highly accurate classification with an average F1-score of 0.87 representing high overlap between the classifier predicting sleep (i.e. one of the 4 sleep stages) and closed eyes. Furthermore, the unsupervised approach revealed a more complex pattern of sleep-wake stages during the night period in the MCS group, as evidenced by the presence of several distinct clusters. In contrast, in UWS patients no such clustering was found. Altogether, we present a novel data-driven method, based on machine learning that can be used to gain new and unambiguous insights into sleep organization and residual brain functioning of patients with DOC.

Oscillatory Mechanisms of Response Conflict Elicited by Color and Motion Direction: An Individual Differences Approach	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							THETA DYNAMICS REVEAL; 2 SIMON TASKS; FRONTAL THETA; STIMULUS; CORTEX; ADAPTATION; TIME; EEG; INTERFERENCE; RESOLUTION	Goal-directed behavior requires control over automatic behavior, for example, when goal-irrelevant information from the environment captures an inappropriate response and conflicts with the correct, goal-relevant action. Neural oscillations in the theta band (approximate to 6 Hz) measured at midfrontal electrodes are thought to form an important substrate of the detection and subsequent resolution of response conflict. Here, we examined the extent to which response conflict and associated theta-band activity depend on the visual stimulus feature dimension that triggers the conflict. We used a feature-based Simon task to manipulate conflict by motion direction and stimulus color. Analyses were focused on individual differences in behavioral response conflict elicited across different stimulus dimensions and their relationship to conflict-related midfrontal theta. We first confirmed the presence of response conflict elicited by task-irrelevant motion and stimulus color, demonstrating the usefulness of our modified version of the Simon task to assess different sensory origins of response conflict. Despite titrating overall task performance, we observed large individual differences in the behavioral manifestations of response conflict elicited by the different visual dimensions. These behavioral conflict effects were mirrored in a dimension-specific relationship with conflict-related midfrontal theta power, such that, for each dimension, individual midfrontal theta power was generally higher when experienced response conflict was high. Finally, exploratory analyses of interregional functional connectivity suggested a role for phase synchronization between frontal and parietal scalp sites in modulating experienced conflict when color was the task-relevant visual dimension. Highlighting the importance of an individual differences approach in cognitive neuroscience, these results reveal large individual differences in experienced response conflict depending on the source of visual interference, which are predicted by conflict-related midfrontal theta power.

Electrocorticographic high-gamma modulation with passive listening paradigm for pediatric extraoperative language mapping	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						cognition; drug-resistant epilepsy; epilepsy surgery; language localization	ELECTRICAL CORTICAL STIMULATION; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FMRI; EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; SPEECH; OSCILLATIONS; PARAMETERS; PROSODY; STREAMS	ObjectiveThis prospective study compared the topography of high-gamma modulation (HGM) during a story-listening task requiring negligible patient cooperation, with the conventional electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) using a picture-naming task, for presurgical language localization in pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy. MethodsPatients undergoing extraoperative monitoring with subdural electrodes were included. Electrocorticographic signals were recorded during quiet baseline and a story-listening task. The likelihood of 70- to 150-Hz power modulation during the listening task relative to the baseline was estimated for each electrode and plotted on a cortical surface model. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were estimated compared to ESM, using a meta-analytic framework. ResultsNineteen patients (10 with left hemisphere electrodes) aged 4-19 years were analyzed. HGM during story listening was observed in bilateral posterior superior temporal, angular, supramarginal, and inferior frontal gyri, along with anatomically defined language association areas. Compared to either cognitive or both cognitive and orofacial sensorimotor interference with naming during ESM, left hemisphere HGM showed high specificity (0.82-0.84), good accuracy (0.66-0.70), and DOR of 2.23 and 3.24, respectively. HGM was a better classifier of ESM language sites in the left temporoparietal cortex compared to the frontal lobe. Incorporating visual naming with the story-listening task substantially improved the accuracy (0.80) and DOR (13.61) of HGM mapping, while the high specificity (0.85) was retained. In the right hemisphere, no ESM sites for aphasia were seen, and the results of HGM and ESM comparisons were not significant. SignificanceHGM associated with story listening is a specific determinant of left hemisphere ESM language sites. It can be used for presurgical language mapping in children who cannot cooperate with conventional language tasks requiring active engagement. Incorporation of additional language tasks, if feasible, can further improve the diagnostic accuracy of language localization with HGM.	[Arya, Ravindra; Wilson, J.

An imbalance of circadian rhythm hormones serves as an early sign of the progress of age-related disease and brain pathology in aging. The aim of this study was to determine the cortisol-melatonin ratio in relation to brain activity and cognitive function in aging. Material/Methods: Sixty-four aging subjects were recruited from the brain healthy project. The morning salivary of all subjects was collected for cortisol and melatonin levels analysis. The brain activity was recorded for 5 minutes in the eyes open condition and seven cognitive functions were assessed by the MoCA. Results: The results were divided into a low ratio group and a high ratio group of cortisol-melatonin ratio. The low ratio group and the high ratio group differed in the delta-beta ratio at the left temporal lope (p < .05), and the delayed recall in the high ratio group was markedly higher than in the low ratio group. Moreover, the cortisol-melatonin ratio was strongly correlated with delayed recall (p < .05), the delta-beta ratio in the left temporal lope (p < .05), the theta alpha ratio in the left temporal lope (p < .05), and right temporal lope (p < .05). Conclusions: We found that a low cortisol-melatonin ratio corresponded to a high delta-beta ratio and a high thetaalpha ratio at the left temporal lobe with a low score of delayed recall function, but a high cortisol-melatonin ratio corresponded to a low delta-beta ratio and a low theta-alpha ratio at the left temporal lobe with a high score of delayed recall. The imbalance of the circadian hormone related to cognitive function and brain activity in aging could serve as a biomarker of age-related diseases.

While these findings are consistent with theories of age-related declines in selective attention and inhibitory control, the degree to which older adults are able to selectively attend to relevant contextual information during encoding is unknown. To better understand the neural dynamics associated with selective attention during encoding, the current study applied multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) to oscillatory EEG in order to track moment-to-moment shifts of attention between relevant and irrelevant contextual information during encoding. Young and older adults studied pictures of objects in the presence of two contextual features: a color and a scene, and their attention was directed to the object's relationship with one of those contexts (i.e., target context). Results showed that patterns of oscillatory power successfully predicted whether selective attention was directed to a scene or color, across age groups. Individual differences in overall classification performance were associated with individual differences in target context memory accuracy during retrieval. However, changes in classification performance within a trial, suggestive of fluctuations in selective attention, predicted individual differences in hyper-binding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use MPVA techniques to decode attention during episodic encoding and the impact of attentional shifts toward distracting information on age-related context memory impairments and hyper-binding. These results are consistent with the as-of-yet unsubstantiated theory that age-related declines in context memory may be attributable to poorer selective attention and/or greater inhibitory deficits in older adults.

An enduring issue in the context of electrophysiology is the presence of common signals. For example a non-silent reference electrode adds a common signal across all recorded data and this adversely affects functional and effective connectivity analysis. To address the common signals problem, a number of methods have been proposed, but relatively few detailed investigations have been carried out. As a result, our understanding of how common signals affect neural connectivity estimation is incomplete. For example, little is known about recording preparations involving high spatial-resolution electrodes, used in linear array recordings. We address this gap through a combination of theoretical review, simulations, and empirical analysis of local field potentials recorded from the brains of fruit flies. We demonstrate how a framework that jointly analyzes power, coherence, and quantities based on Granger causality reveals the presence of common signals. We further show that subtracting spatially adjacent signals (bipolar derivations) largely removes the effects of the common signals. However, in some special cases this operation itself introduces a common signal. We also show that Granger causality is adversely affected by common signals and that a quantity referred to as "instantaneous interaction" is increased in the presence of common signals. The theoretical review, simulation, and empirical analysis we present can readily be adapted by others to investigate the nature of the common signals in their data. Our contributions improve our understanding of how common signals affect power, coherence, and Granger causality and will help reduce the misinterpretation of functional and effective connectivity analysis.

J	Ombao, H; Fiecas, M; Ting, CM; Low, YF				Ombao, Hernando; Fiecas, Mark; Ting, Chee-Ming; Low, Yin Fen			Statistical models for brain signals with properties that evolve across trials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						Autoregressive model; Coherence; Markov-switching model; Partial directed coherence; Spectral representation; State-space	FUNCTIONAL NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; COHERENCE; NEURONS; STATES; MRI; MMN	Most neuroscience cognitive experiments involve repeated presentations of various stimuli across several minutes or a few hours. It has been observed that brain responses, even to the same stimulus, evolve over the course of the experiment. These changes in brain activation and connectivity are believed to be associated with learning and/or habituation. In this paper, we present two general approaches to modeling dynamic brain connectivity using electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded across replicated trials in an experiment. The first approach is the Markovian regime-switching vector autoregressive model (MS-VAR) which treats EEGs as realizations of an underlying brain process that switches between different states both within a trial and across trials in the entire experiment. The second is the slowly evolutionary locally stationary process (SEv-LSP) which characterizes the observed EEGs as a mixture of oscillatory activities at various frequency bands. The SEv-LSP model captures the dynamic nature of the amplitudes of the band-oscillations and cross-correlations between them. The MS-VAR model is able to capture abrupt changes in the dynamics while the SEv-LSP directly gives interpretable results. Moreover, it is nonparametric and hence does not suffer from model misspecification. For both of these models, time-evolving connectivity metrics in the frequency domain are derived from the model parameters for both functional and effective connectivity. We illustrate these two models for estimating cross-trial connectivity in selective attention using EEG data from an oddball paradigm auditory experiment where the goal is to characterize the evolution of brain responses to target stimuli and to standard tones presented randomly throughout the entire experiment. The results suggest dynamic changes in connectivity patterns over trials with inter-subject variability.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who were diagnosed with BTLE by scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and underwent ATL from 2001 to 2015. In addition, 80 patients were randomly selected as a control group. Results: One hundred seventeen patients were included in this study and were divided into four groups by intracranial recordings as follows: 78 patients with unilateral seizure onset (Group 1), 13 patients with lateralizable dominant seizure onset (Group 2), 14 patients with lateralizable neuroimaging abnormalities (Group 3), and 12 patients without lateralizable dominant seizure onset or neuroimaging abnormalities (Group 4). The 12 patients in Group 4 declined surgical resection, whereas the remaining 105 patients received ATL, and 93 of them were followed up for more than 1 year after surgery. At the 1-, 2-, and 3-year, follow-ups the percentage of patients who were seizure free was 52.9%, 56.5%, and 58.9%, respectively. For the mean postoperative efficacy, there was a statistical difference in patients who were seizure free either between Group 1 + Group 2 + Group 3 and the control group (44.1% vs. 67.5%, p = 0.002), or between Group 1 and the control group (48.5% vs. 67.5%, p = 0.019), or between Group 2 + Group 3 and the control group (32.0% vs. 67.5%, p = 0.002). However, the difference was significant only at the first year follow-up, and there was no significant difference afterward. Significance: Although the surgical outcome of patients with BTLE is not as good as that of patients with unilateral TLE in short-term follow-up, quite a portion of these patients could benefit from unilateral temporal lobe resection in the long term.

Methods: Twenty mTBI patients with mTBI and 20 healthy controls underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a cued continuous performance task (AX-CPT). Neuropsychological, behavioral, and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected and analyzed. Results: There were significant differences between the mTBI group and the control group in their MMSE total scores, attention, and calculation, but there were no significant differences in orientation, memory, recall, and verbal scores. There were significant differences between the mTBI group and the control group in hitting the number, reaction time, and the number of errors of omission, but there were no significant differences in the number of false errors. The amplitude of Go-N2 and Nogo-N2 was significantly smaller for the mTBI group than that for the control group. The amplitude of Go-P3 was significantly smaller for the mTBI group than that for the control group, but not for the amplitude of Nogo-P3. The Go-ERS were significantly less for the mTBI group than for the control group during the 0-200 ms after the stimulus onset. The Go-ERD and Nogo-ERD were significantly less for the mTBI group than for the control group during the 600-1,000 ms after the stimulus onset. The Go-ERS were significantly less for the mTBI group than for the control group during the 200-400ms after the stimulus onset. There were no significant differences in the Nogo-ERS and Nogo-ERD/ERS between the mTBI group and the control group. Conclusion: Patients with mTBI exhibited impairments in sustained attention and conflict monitoring, while response inhibition may have been spared.

Beta activity however is not constantly elevated, but comes in bursts. In previous work we showed that the longer beta bursts are maintained, the more the oscillatory synchronisation within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) increases, which is posited to limit the information coding capacity of local circuits. Accordingly, a higher incidence of longer bursts correlates positively with clinical impairment, while the opposite is true for short, more physiological bursts. Here, we test the hypothesis that beta bursts not only indicate local synchronisation within the STN, but also phasic coupling across the motor network and hence entail an even greater restriction of information coding capacity in patients with PD. Local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus and EEG over the motor cortex area were recorded in nine PD patients after temporary lead externalization after surgery for deep brain stimulation and overnight withdrawal of levodopa. Beta bursts were defined as periods exceeding the 75th percentile of signal amplitude and the coupling between bursts was considered using two distinct measurements, first the % overlapping (%OVL) as a feature of the amplitude coupling and secondly the phase synchrony index (PSI) to measure the phase coupling between regions. %OVL between STN and cortex and between the left and the right STN was higher than expected between the regions than if they had been independent. Similarly, PSI was higher during bursts as opposed to non-bursts periods. In addition, %OVL was greater for long compared to short bursts. Our results support the hypothesis that beta bursts involve long-range coupling between structures in the basal ganglia-cortical network. The impact of this is greater during long as opposed to short duration beta bursts. Accordingly, we posit that episodes of simultaneously elevated coupling across multiple structures in the basal ganglia-cortical circuit further limit information coding capacity and may have further impact upon motor impairment.

Real-time detection and discrimination of visual perception using electrocorticographic signals	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						ECoG; real-time; gamma; visual; brain-computer interface; BCI; high gamma mapping	HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; VENTRAL TEMPORAL CORTEX; HUMAN FACE PERCEPTION; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; WORD FORM AREA; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; FIELD POTENTIALS; SPATIAL FILTERS	Objective. Several neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the ventral temporal cortex contains specialized regions that process visual stimuli. This study investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of electrocorticographic (ECoG) responses to different types and colors of visual stimulation that were presented to four human participants, and demonstrated a real-time decoder that detects and discriminates responses to untrained natural images. Approach. ECoG signals from the participants were recorded while they were shown colored and greyscale versions of seven types of visual stimuli (images of faces, objects, bodies, line drawings, digits, and kanji and hiragana characters), resulting in 14 classes for discrimination (experiment I). Additionally, a real-time system asynchronously classified ECoG responses to faces, kanji and black screens presented via a monitor (experiment II), or to natural scenes (i.e. the face of an experimenter, natural images of faces and kanji, and a mirror) (experiment III). Outcome measures in all experiments included the discrimination performance across types based on broadband gamma activity. Main results. Experiment I demonstrated an offline classification accuracy of 72.9% when discriminating among the seven types (without color separation). Further discrimination of grey versus colored images reached an accuracy of 67.1%. Discriminating all colors and types (14 classes) yielded an accuracy of 52.1%. In experiment II and III, the real-time decoder correctly detected 73.7% responses to face, kanji and black computer stimuli and 74.8% responses to presented natural scenes. Significance. Seven different types and their color information (either grey or color) could be detected and discriminated using broadband gamma activity. Discrimination performance maximized for combined spatial-temporal information. The discrimination of stimulus color information provided the first ECoG-based evidence for color-related population-level cortical broadband gamma responses in humans. Stimulus categories can be detected by their ECoG responses in real time within 500 ms with respect to stimulus onset.

This paper describes 11 patients with de novo heterozygous missense mutations in SYT1. All mutations alter highly conserved residues, and cluster in two regions of the SYT1 C2B domain at positions Met303 (M303K), Asp304 (D304G), Asp366 (D366E), Ile368 (I368T) and Asn371 (N371K). Phenotypic features include infantile hypotonia, congenital ophthalmic abnormalities, childhood-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders, motor stereotypies, and developmental delay varying in severity from moderate to profound. Behavioural characteristics include sleep disturbance and episodic agitation. Absence of epileptic seizures and normal orbitofrontal head circumference are important negative features. Structural MRI is unremarkable but EEG disturbance is universal, characterized by intermittent low frequency high amplitude oscillations. The functional impact of these five de novo SYT1 mutations has been assessed by expressing rat SYT1 protein containing the equivalent human variants in wild-type mouse primary hippocampal cultures. All mutant forms of SYT1 were expressed at levels approximately equal to endogenous wild-type protein, and correctly localized to nerve terminals at rest, except for SYT1 M303K, which was expressed at a lower level and failed to localize at nerve terminals. Following stimulation, SYT1 I368T and SYT1 N371K relocalized to nerve terminals at least as efficiently as wild-type SYT1. However, SYT1 D304G and SYT1 D366E failed to relocalize to nerve terminals following stimulation, indicative of impairments in endocytic retrieval and trafficking of SYT1. In addition, the presence of SYT1 variants at nerve terminals induced a slowing of exocytic rate following sustained action potential stimulation. The extent of disturbance to synaptic vesicle kinetics is mirrored by the severity of the affected individuals' phenotypes, suggesting that the efficiency of SYT1-mediated neurotransmitter release is critical to cognitive development. In summary, de novo dominant SYT1 missense mutations are associated with a recognizable neurodevelopmental syndrome, and further cases can now be diagnosed based on clinical features, electrophysiological signature and mutation characteristics. Variation in phenotype severity may reflect mutation-specific impact on the diverse physiological functions of SYT1.	[Baker, Kate; Raymond, F.

Electrocorticographies for 39 patients with medically intractable neocortical epilepsy were analyzed. We separately analyzed 38 frequencies from 0.9 to 800 Hz including both high-frequency activities and low-frequency activities to select hands related to seizure outcome. An automatic detector using amplitude-duration-number thresholds was used. Interictal electrocorticography data sets of 8 min for each patient were selected. In the first training data set of 20 patients, the automatic detector was optimized to best differentiate the seizure-free group from not-seizure-free-group based on ranks of resection percentages of activities detected using a genetic algorithm. The optimization was validated in a different data set of 19 patients. There were 16 (41%) seizure-free patients. The mean follow-up duration was 21 +/- 11 mo (range. 13-44 mo). After validation, frequencies significantly related to seizure outcome were 5.8, 8.4-25, 30, 36. 52. and 75 among low-frequency activities and 108 and 800 Hz among high-frequency activities. Resection for 5.8, 8.4-25, 108. and 800 Hz activities consistently improved seizure outcome. Resection effects of 17-36. 52, and 75 Hz activities on seizure outcome were variable according to thresholds. We developed and validated an automated detector for monitoring interictal pathological and inhibitory/physiological activities in neocortical epilepsy using a datadriven approach through outcome-guided machine learning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Outcome-guided machine learning based on seizure outcome was used to improve detections for interictal electrocorticographic low- and high-frequency activities. This method resulted in better separation of seizure outcome groups than others reported in the literature. The automatic detector can be trained without human intervention and no prior information. It is based only on objective seizure outcome data without relying on an expert's manual annotations. Using the method, we could find and characterize pathological and inhibitory activities.

J	Rataj, K; Nazareth, DS; van der Velde, F				Rataj, Karolina; Nazareth, Deniece S.; van der Velde, Frank			Use a Spoon as a Spade?: Changes in the Upper and Lower Alpha Bands in Evaluating Alternate Object Use	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						creativity; alternate use evaluation task; alpha; N400; sustained negativity; event-related desynchronization	THETA-POWER INCREASES; EEG-ALPHA; DIVERGENT THINKING; TOP-DOWN; VERBAL CREATIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; ERP; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONVERGENT; MEMORY	Previous electrophysiological research on human creative cognition has related creative ideation to increased activity in the alpha band, an effect which mainly reflects increased general attentional demands. Research on alpha unrelated to creativity has revealed different functional roles of the upper (semantic processes) and lower (attentional processes) alpha sub-bands. At the same time, the need to dissect creative thinking into specific cognitive operations, such as, semantic processing, re-representation, or conceptual expansion has become evident. The main aim of the reported study was to test whether increased semantic processing demands linked to creating conceptual re-representations of objects required for evaluating alternate uses modulate activity in the upper and/or lower alpha sub-bands. For this purpose, we performed an alternate use evaluation task (AUeT), in which participants saw word pairs representing common uses, alternate uses, and unrelated word pairs, and evaluated whether a given use was common or uncommon (question 1), and how usable it was (question 2). Such an approach allowed us to examine the time-course of semantic processing involved in evaluating alternate uses. Additionally, the results could be contrasted with event-related potential (ERP) studies on creative language and semantic processing. We assumed that demands related to access and integration of semantic information needed to create a re-representation of objects (alternate uses) would be larger than in the case of common uses, which do not require creating a re-representation. This should be reflected in more activity in the alpha band in response to alternate than common uses, which was observed in the analysis of the upper alpha band over parieto-occipital sites. In the lower alpha band, more activity over the left than right anterior sites was observed for alternate uses, which might reflect increased attentional demands. Additionally, in the ERP analysis, alternate uses evoked larger N400 (400-500 ms) amplitudes than common uses, a pattern that extended to later time windows (500-1,000 ms). Overall, the results indicate increased semantic processing demands in alternate use evaluation, possibly linked to the creation of conceptual re-representations.

Rhythms of Core Clock Genes and Spontaneous Locomotor Activity in Post-Status Epilepticus Model of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						clock genes; epilepsy; seizure; spontaneous locomotor activity; circadian rhythm	HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONAL MORPHOLOGY; MAMMALIAN CIRCADIAN CLOCK; RAT MODEL; ANTICONVULSANT ACTIVITY; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEI; SIBERIAN HAMSTERS; MOUSE HIPPOCAMPUS; LIMBIC SEIZURES; DIURNAL RHYTHM; ANIMAL-MODEL	The interaction of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (mTLE) with the circadian system control is apparent from an oscillatory pattern of limbic seizures, daytime's effect on seizure onset and the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs. Moreover, seizures per se can interfere with the biological rhythm output, including circadian oscillation of body temperature, locomotor activity, EEG pattern as well as the transcriptome. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this cross-talk remain unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluated the temporal expression of seven core circadian transcripts (Bmal1, Clock, Cry1, Cry2, Per1, Per2, and Per3) and the spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) in post-status epilepticus (SE) model of mTLE. Twenty-four hour oscillating SLA remained intact in post-SE groups although the circadian phase and the amount and intensity of activity were changed in early post-SE and epileptic phases. The acrophase of the SLA rhythm was delayed during epileptogenesis, a fragmented 24 h rhythmicity and extended active phase length appeared in the epileptic phase. The temporal expression of circadian transcripts Bmal1, Cry1, Cry2, Per1, Per2, and Per3 was also substantially altered. The oscillatory expression of Bmal1 was maintained in rats imperiled to SE, but with lower amplitude (A = 0.2) and an advanced acrophase in the epileptic phase. The diurnal rhythmof Cry1 and Cry2 was absent in the early post-SE but was recovered in the epileptic phase. Per1 and Per2 rhythmic expression were disrupted in post-SE groups while Per3 presented an arrhythmic profile in the epileptic phase, only. The expression of Clock did not display rhythmic pattern in any condition. These oscillating patterns of core clock genes may contribute to hippocampal 24 h cycling and, consequently to seizure periodicity. Furthermore, by using a pool of samples collected at 6 different Zeitgeber Times (ZT), we found that all clock transcripts were significantly dysregulated after SE induction, except Per3 and Per2. Collectively, altered SLA rhythm in early post-SE and epileptic phases implies a possible role for seizure as a nonphotic cue, which is likely linked to activation of hippocampal-accumbens pathway. On the other hand, altered temporal expression of the clock genes after SE suggests their involvement in the MTLE.	[Matos, Heloisa de Carvalho; Pereira, Wanessa dos Santos; Gitai, Daniel L.
