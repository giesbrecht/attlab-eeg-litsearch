EEG is a noninvasive neuroimaging method which directly measures the brain activity in a form of time series of electrical potential oscillations. The assessment of brain dynamics and activity patterns is of crucial importance for the understanding of brain functionality. Over the years, the progress in data mining and processing techniques have contributed to the exploration of the time and frequency domain characteristics embodied in the EEG recordings. Here, a synergistic methodology that enables the analysis of the structural features of EEG and moreover, aims to combine the EEG channels' spatiotemporal dependencies utilizing the Stochastic Petri Nets model, is presented.

As a new biological method, electroencephalography (EEG) is gradually applied in biometric recognition, because scientists believe that practicability and portability are the development direction of EEG identity authentication. This work investigates the feasibility of using resting state EEG signals recorded by single-channel portable device for identity authentication. Single-channel EEG classification are effectively improved by using mixed-method in three feature domains (i.e., time, frequency, and time-frequency), feature selection (Rayleigh quotient) and classifier design (ensemble classifier). We invited 46 subjects to participate in the EEG identity authentication experiment. Experimental results show that the open-eyed resting state is an ideal authentication method, and the average classification accuracy of the authentication algorithm can reach 95.48 in 2 seconds, validating that the new method of processing single-channel EEG signals is especially useful in extrapolating EEG identity authentication to realistic field contexts.

Absolute pitch (AP) musicians perceive, recognize, and name pitches in absolute terms, whereas relative pitch (RP) musicians, representing the large majority of musicians, perceive pitches in relation to other pitches. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the neural representations underlying tone listening and tone labeling in a large sample of musicians (n =105). Participants performed a pitch processing task with a listening and a labeling condition during EEG acquisition. Using a brain-decoding framework, we tested a prediction derived from both theoretical and empirical accounts of AP, namely that the representational similarity of listening and labeling is higher in AP musicians than in RP musicians. Consistent with the prediction, time-resolved single-trial EEG decoding revealed a higher representational similarity in AP musicians during late stages of pitch perception. Time-frequency-resolved EEG decoding further showed that the higher representational similarity was present in oscillations in the theta and beta frequency bands. Supplemental univariate analyses were less sensitive in detecting subtle group differences in the frequency domain. Taken together, the results suggest differences between AP and RP musicians in late pitch processing stages associated with cognition, rather than in early processing stages associated with perception.

Tonic Cold Pain Detection Using Choi-Williams Time-Frequency Distribution Analysis of EEG Signals: A Feasibility Study	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						time-frequency distribution; electroencephalography (EEG); support vector machine (SVM); pain detection		Detecting pain based on analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) signals can enhance the ability of caregivers to characterize and manage clinical pain. However, the subjective nature of pain and the nonstationarity of EEG signals increase the difficulty of pain detection using EEG signals analysis. In this work, we present an EEG-based pain detection approach that analyzes the EEG signals using a quadratic time-frequency distribution, namely the Choi-Williams distribution (CWD). The use of the CWD enables construction of a time-frequency representation (TFR) of the EEG signals to characterize the time-varying spectral components of the EEG signals. The TFR of the EEG signals is analyzed to extract 12 time-frequency features for pain detection. These features are used to train a support vector machine classifier to distinguish between EEG signals that are associated with the no-pain and pain classes. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we have recorded EEG signals for 24 healthy subjects under tonic cold pain stimulus. Moreover, we have developed two performance evaluation procedures-channel- and feature-based evaluation procedures-to study the effect of the utilized EEG channels and time-frequency features on the accuracy of pain detection. The experimental results show that our proposed approach achieved an average classification accuracy of 89.24% in distinguishing between the no-pain and pain classes. In addition, the classification performance achieved using our proposed approach outperforms the classification results reported in several existing EEG-based pain detection approaches.

Although several brain regions are known to be involved in the autonomic control, the functional brain-heart interplay (BHI) during emotional processing is not fully characterized yet. To this aim, we investigate BHI during emotional elicitation in healthy subjects. The functional linear and nonlinear couplings are quantified using the maximum information coefficient calculated between time-varying electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra within the canonical bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma), and time-varying low-frequency and high-frequency powers from heartbeat dynamics. Experimental data were gathered from 30 healthy volunteers whose emotions were elicited through pleasant and unpleasant high-arousing videos. Results demonstrate that functional BHI increases during videos with respect to a resting state through EEG oscillations not including the gamma band (>30 Hz). Functional linear coupling seems associated with a high-arousing positive elicitation, with preferred EEG oscillations in the theta band ([4,8) Hz) especially over the left-temporal and parietal cortices. Differential functional nonlinear coupling between emotional valence seems to mainly occur through EEG oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha bands and sympathovagal dynamics, as well as through delta, alpha, beta oscillations and parasympathetic activity mainly over the right hemisphere. Functional BHI through delta and alpha oscillations over the prefrontal region seems primarily nonlinear. This study provides novel insights on synchronous heartbeat and cortical dynamics during emotional video elicitation, also suggesting that a nonlinear analysis is needed to fully characterize functional BHI.

One particular form of interaction is the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, known as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Current methods for quantifying PAC mostly rely on Hilbert transform which assumes that brain activity is stationary and narrowband. Moreover, these methods are limited to quantifying bivariate PAC and cannot capture multivariate cross-frequency coupling between different brain regions. This paper presents a new complex time-frequency based high resolution PAC measure and its extension to the multivariate case using PARAFAC (Parallel Factor) model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both simulated and real electroencephalogram (EEG) data.	[Munia, Tamanna T.

The neural basis of chronic pain is still not completely understood. Previous work has implicated prefrontal brain areas in chronic pain. Furthermore, prefrontal neuronal oscillations at gamma frequencies (60-90 Hz) have been shown to reflect the perceived intensity of longer lasting experimental pain in healthy human participants. In contrast, noxious stimulus intensity has been related to alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-29 Hz) oscillations in sensorimotor areas. However, it is not fully understood how the intensity of ongoing pain as the key symptom of chronic pain is represented in the human brain. Here, we asked 31 chronic back pain patients to continuously rate their ongoing pain while simultaneously recording electroencephalography (EEG). Time-frequency analyses revealed a positive association between ongoing pain intensity and prefrontal beta and gamma oscillations. No association was found between pain and alpha or beta oscillations in sensorimotor areas. These findings indicate that ongoing pain as the key symptom of chronic pain is reflected by neuronal oscillations implicated in the subjective perception of longer lasting pain rather than by neuronal oscillations related to the processing of objective nociceptive input. The findings, thus, support a dissociation of pain intensity from nociceptive processing in chronic back pain patients. Furthermore, although possible confounds by muscle activity have to be taken into account, they might be useful for defining a neurophysiological marker of ongoing pain in the human brain.

Current theories of neural oscillations and analysis techniques employed to investigate their functional significance are based on an often implicit assumption: In the absence of experimental manipulation, the spectral content of any given EEG- or MEG-recorded neural oscillator remains approximately stationary over the course of a typical experimental session (similar to 1 h), spontaneously fluctuating only around its dominant frequency. Here, we examined this assumption for ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz). We found that alpha peak frequency systematically decreased over time, while alpha-power increased. Intriguingly, these systematic changes showed partial independence of each other: Statistical source separation (independent component analysis) revealed that while some alpha components displayed concomitant power increases and peak frequency decreases, other components showed either unique power increases or frequency decreases. Interestingly, we also found these components to differ in frequency. Components that showed mixed frequency/power changes oscillated primarily in the lower alpha-band (similar to 8-10 Hz), while components with unique changes oscillated primarily in the higher alpha-band (similar to 9-13 Hz). Our findings provide novel clues on the time-varying intrinsic properties of large-scale neural networks as measured by M/EEG, with implications for the analysis and interpretation of studies that aim at identifying functionally relevant oscillatory networks or at driving them through external stimulation.

Here, we administer tPBM in the form of NIR light (810 nm wavelength) pulsed at 40 Hz to the default mode network (DMN), and examine its effects on human neural oscillations, in a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we found that a single session of tPBM significantly increases the power of the higher oscillatory frequencies of alpha, beta and gamma and reduces the power of the slower frequencies of delta and theta in subjects in resting state. Furthermore, the analysis of network properties using inter-regional synchrony via weighted phase lag index (wPLI) and graph theory measures, indicate the effect of tPBM on the integration and segregation of brain networks. These changes were significantly different when compared to sham stimulation. Our preliminary findings demonstrate for the first time that tPBM can be used to non-invasively modulate neural oscillations, and encourage further confirmatory clinical investigations.

First, the production of the sequence has been accomplished by selecting the prominent brain rhythm having the maximum instantaneous power at specific timestamp consecutively throughout the EEG. To this purpose, the reassigned smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (RSPWVD) has been employed. Then, in order to verify the proposed technique and evaluate its performance, a case study of seizure detection has been implemented. As experimental validation, 93 patients from the Karunya database have been investigated. Moreover, to characterize the brain rhythm sequence for seizure detection, two additional indices derived from the power discharge and synchronous behavior have been applied. Results show that the particular rhythm pattern during the seizure is usually one type (either $\delta $ , $\theta $ , or $\alpha$ ) and it is subject-dependent. Hence, by focusing on the changes of such particular rhythm through the two indices, the time-related occurrences of seizures can be determined in detail. Meanwhile, the representative channels for seizure detection can be found by studying the similarity of sequences, which are helpful to reduce the number of applied channels. Finally, the proposed technique provides an accuracy of 98.9, which demonstrates it is competent to detect the appearances of abnormal seizures from the EEG signals reliably. Consequently, the brain rhythm sequencing could open a new way to interpret and characterize the EEG in various applications such as for epileptic patients.

With the advancements of the multichannel sensor applications, the need for multivariate algorithms has become obvious for extracting features that stem from multichannel dependency in addition to mono-channel features. In order to model the joint oscillatory structure of these multichannel signals, MSST has recently been proposed. It uses the concepts of joint instantaneous frequency and bandwidth. Electrophysiological data processing mostly requires joint time-frequency analysis in addition to both time and frequency analysis separately. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT) are the main approaches utilized in time-frequency analysis. In this paper, the feasibility and performance of multivariate wavelet-based synchrosqueezing algorithm was demonstrated on EEG signals obtained from publically available DEAP database by comparing with its univariate version. Eight emotional states were considered by combining arousal-valence and dominance dimensions. Using linear support vector machines (SVM) as a classifier, MSST and its univariate version resulted in the highest prediction accuracy rates of (9) over tilde3% among all emotional states.

Power spectrum analysis of EEG data showed a distinct gradual change in the power of low-frequency oscillations in response to highly pleasant, but not neutral, musical excerpts. Specifically, listening to highly pleasant music was associated with (i) relatively higher oscillatory activity in the theta band over the frontocentral (FC) area and in the alpha band over the parieto-occipital area, and (ii) a gradual increase in the oscillatory power over time. Correlation analysis between behavioral and electrophysiological data revealed that theta power over the FC electrodes was correlated with subjective assessment of pleasantness while listening to music. To study the link between attention and positive valence in our experiments, volunteers performed a delayed match-to-sample memory task while listening to the musical excerpts. The subjects' performances were significantly lower under highly pleasant conditions compared to neutral conditions. Listening to pleasant music requires higher degrees of attention, leading to the observed decline in memory performance. Gradual development of low-frequency oscillations in the frontal and posterior areas may be at least partly due to gradual recruitment of higher levels of attention over time in response to pleasurable music.

It is non-invasive technique to analyze brain signals which help to identify that either signals are showing normal or abnormal activity of the brain i.e. Different emotional states and mental diseases. The signals of EEG are non-stationary means the frequency of signals changes over time. To study these non-stationary signals, wavelet transform is used to classify EEG segment for seven different subjects.

This paper introduced the novel features based on the multiscale information analysis (MIA) of EEG signals for distinguishing emotional states in four dimensions based on Russell's circumplex model. The algorithms were applied to extract features on the DEAP database, which included multiscale EEG complexity index in the time domain, and ensemble empirical mode decomposition enhanced energy and fuzzy entropy in the frequency domain. The support vector machine and cross validation method were applied to assess classification accuracy. The classification performance of MIA methods (accuracy = 62.01%, precision = 62.03%, recall/sensitivity = 60.51%, and specificity = 82.80%) was much higher than classical methods (accuracy = 43.98%, precision = 43.81%, recall/sensitivity = 41.86%, and specificity = 70.50%), which extracted features contain similar energy based on a discrete wavelet transform, fractal dimension, and sample entropy. In this study, we found that emotion recognition is more associated with high frequency oscillations (51-100Hz) of EEG signals rather than low frequency oscillations (0.3-49Hz), and the significance of the frontal and temporal regions are higher than other regions. Such information has predictive power and may provide more insights into analyzing the multiscale information of high frequency oscillations in EEG signals.

It is significant to research the relationship between high-frequency oscillation and epilepsy originating area for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. In view of the identification of epileptic EEG and the location of epileptic foci, a localization algorithm based on Teager operator is proposed. Firstly, the original epileptic EEG data are preprocessed, the wavelet weighted threshold and the frequency notch method are used to denoise the original epileptic high frequency oscillation signal. Taking into account the frequency characteristics of the high frequency oscillating signal itself, the FIR (Finite Impulse Response) digital filter is used to filter the epileptic high-frequency oscillation signal. Secondly, because the high frequency oscillation rhythm has the characteristics of high frequency, high energy and low amplitude, the Teager energy operator and curve length method are used to extract the characteristics. The PSD (Power Spectral Density) method is applied to qualitative analysis of epileptic lesion location. Finally, the EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) algorithm is used to decompose the high-frequency oscillation signal. Combined with Teager energy operator, Teager-huang transform is used to analyze the signal by time-frequency energy analysis. Quantitative analysis of epileptic lesion location is made by using EMD energy entropy method for different lead epileptic signals. The algorithm can effectively locate the location of the focus, independent of individual parameters and high degree of automation. It has good clinical application prospects. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Rhythmicity facilitates pitch discrimination: Differential roles of low and high frequency neural oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Beta; Delta; Delta-beta coupling; Dynamic attending theory; EEG; Entrainment; Beta; Delta; Delta-beta coupling; Dynamic attending theory; EEG; Entrainment	CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; TEMPORAL PREDICTION; ACTIVITY REFLECTS; ENTRAINMENT; PERCEPTION; BETA; AMPLITUDE; DYNAMICS; BEAT	Previous studies indicate that temporal predictability can enhance timing and intensity perception, but it is not known whether it also enhances pitch perception, despite pitch being a fundamental perceptual attribute of sound. Here we investigate this in the context of rhythmic regularity, a form of predictable temporal structure common in sound streams, including music and speech. It is known that neural oscillations in low (delta: 1-3 Hz) and high (beta: 15-25 Hz) frequency bands entrain to rhythms in phase and power, respectively, but it is not clear why both low and high frequency bands entrain to external rhythms, and whether they and their coupling serve different perceptual functions. Participants discriminated near-threshold pitch deviations (targets) embedded in either rhythmic (regular/isochronous) or arrhythmic (irregular/non-isochronous) tone sequences. Psychophysically, we found superior pitch discrimination performance for target tones in rhythmic compared to arrhythmic sequences. Electroencephalography recordings from auditory cortex showed that delta phase, beta power modulation, and delta-beta coupling were all modulated by rhythmic regularity. Importantly, trial-by-trial neural-behavioural correlational analyses showed that, prior to a target, the depth of U-shaped beta power modulation predicted pitch discrimination sensitivity whereas cross-frequency coupling strength predicted reaction time. These novel findings suggest that delta phase might reflect rhythmic temporal expectation, beta power temporal attention, and delta-beta coupling auditory-motor communication. Together, low and high frequency auditory neural oscillations reflect different perceptual functions that work in concert for tracking rhythmic regularity and proactively facilitate pitch perception.

To understand the dynamic interplay between neural activity and spoken language development, we used resting-state EEG recordings to explore the relation between alpha oscillations (7-10 Hz) and oral language ability in 4- to 6-yearold children with typical development (N = 41). Three properties of alpha oscillations were investigated: a) alpha power using spectral analysis, b) flexibility of the alpha frequency quantified via the oscillation's momentto-moment fluctuations, and c) scaling behavior of the alpha oscillator investigated via the long-range temporal correlation in the alpha-amplitude time course. All three properties of the alpha oscillator correlated with children's oral language abilities. Higher language scores were correlated with lower alpha power, greater flexibility of the alpha frequency, and longer temporal correlations in the alpha-amplitude time course. Our findings demonstrate a cognitive role of several properties of the alpha oscillator that has largely been overlooked in the literature.	[Kwok, Elaine Y.

We provide an updated view of the cortical origins of evoked responses and discuss potential mechanisms contributing to ERP generation. In particular, we focus on the relationship between evoked and ongoing oscillatory activity and discuss the differences between ERPs and cortical activation as indexed by high-frequency activity in human intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). We highlight several possibilities for how ERPs can precisely index human perception and behavior in nontraditional approaches, such as neuronal entrainment through steady-state evoked potentials, multivariate decoding, and cross-frequency correlations. We argue that analyses of time-locked responses are beneficial to assess nonlinear and nonsinusoidal neuronal activity on a fine-grained temporal scale, since analyses in the time domain are less susceptible to artifacts than spectral decomposition techniques. Taken together, the current review provides a state-of-the-art overview of ERPs and their application in cognitive and clinical neurophysiology.

In this paper, we present a robust method for electroencephalography (EEG) source localization based on a new multiway temporal-spatial-spectral (TSS) analysis for epileptic spikes via graph signal processing and multiway blind source separation. Instead of using the temporal behavior of the EEG distributed sources, we first apply the graph wavelet transform to the spatial variable for epilepsy tensor construction in order to exploit latent information of the spatial domain. We then apply the tensorial multiway blind source separation method for estimating the sources and hence localizing them. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the TSS analysis and to compare it with two state-of-the-art types of analysis: space-time-frequency (STF) and space-time-wave-vector (STWV). Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising for epileptic source estimation and localization.

A significant proportion of patients suffering from epilepsy can be effectively treated if their seizures are detected in a timely manner. However, detection of most seizures requires the attention of trained neurologists-a scarce resource. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic seizure detection capability. A tunable non-patient-specific, non-seizure-specific method is proposed to detect the presence and locality of a seizure using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This multifaceted computational approach is based on a network model of the brain and a distance metric based on the spectral profiles of EEG signals. This computationally time-efficient and cost-effective automated epileptic seizure detection algorithm has a median latency of 8 s, a median sensitivity of 83%, and a median false alarm rate of 2.9%. Hence, it is capable of being used in portable EEG devices to aid in the process of detecting and monitoring epileptic patients.

Technical advances over the last 100 years or so have rendered EEG a true brain imaging technique. Here, we provide an accessible primer on the biophysics of EEG, on measurement aspects, and on the analysis of EEG data. We use the example of event-related potentials (ERPs), although the issues apply equally to other varieties of EEG signals, and provide an overview of analytic methods at the base of the so-called electrical neuroimaging framework. We detail the interpretational strengths of electrical neuroimaging for organizational researchers and describe some domains of ongoing technical developments. We likewise emphasize practical considerations with the use of EEG in more real-world settings. This primer is intended to provide organizational researchers specifically, and novices more generally, an access point to understanding how EEG may be applied in their research.

This study attemptsto comprehend the cognitive decline of MCI-AD under both resting and cognitive task conditions.ResultsWavelet-based synchrosqueezing transform (SST) alleviates the smearing of energy observed in the spectrogram around the central frequencies in short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and continuous wavelet transform (CWT). A precise TF representation is assured due to the reassignment of scale variable to the frequency variable. It is discerned from the studies of time domain measures encompassing fractal dimension (FD) and approximate entropy (ApEn), that the parietal lobe is the most affected in MCI-AD under both resting and cognitive states. Alterations in asymmetry in the brain hemispheres are analysed using the homologous areas inter-hemispheric symmetry (HArS).ConclusionTime and time-frequency domain analysis of EEG signals have been used for distinguishing various brain states. Therefore, EEG analysis is highly useful for the screening of AD in its prodromal phase.

Methods: Simultaneous EEG and MEG were recorded in 30 patients with drug resistant focal epilepsy. Ripples were automatically detected and visually checked in virtual channels throughout the cortex. The number and location of ripples in EEG and MEG were compared to each other and to a region of interest (ROI) defined by clinically available information. Results: Eleven patients showed ripples in both MEG and EEG, 11 only in EEG and one only in MEG. Twenty-four percent of the ripples occurred simultaneously in EEG and MEG, 71% only in EEG, and 5% only in MEG. Three patients without spikes in EEG showed EEG ripples. Ripple localization was concordant with the ROI in 80% of patients with MEG ripples, as opposed to 62% full or partial concordance for EEG ripples. With the optimal threshold for localizing the ROI, sensitivity and specificity were more than 80%. Conclusions: Ripples in MEG are less frequent but more specific and sensitive for the region of interest than ripples in EEG. Ripples in EEG can exist without spikes in the EEG. Significance: Ripples in MEG and EEG provide complementary information. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While deep neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have gained remarkable attention recently, they still suffer from high dimensionality of the training data. Two-dimensional input images of CNNs are more vulnerable to be redundant versus one-dimensional input time-series of conventional neural networks. In this study, we propose a new dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the dimension of CNN inputs based on the tensor decomposition of the time-frequency representation of EEG signals. The proposed tensor decomposition-based dimensionality reduction algorithm transforms a large set of slices of the input tensor to a concise set of slices which are called super-slices. Employing super-slices not only handles the artifacts and redundancies of the EEG data but also reduces the dimension of the CNNs training inputs. We also consider different time-frequency representation methods for EEG image generation and provide a comprehensive comparison among them.

Video-EEG monitoring is a key feature of presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery which reveals the relation of seizure semiology and associated EEG changes. Analysis of seizure semiology along with interpretation of interictal and ictal EEG features provide critical information in identifying the epileptogenic zone in epilepsy surgery candidates. If presurgical noninvasive tests are discordant or yield inadequate data, invasive EEG recordings may be necessary. Intracranial electrodes are also used for cortical stimulation and mapping when the epileptogenic zone is in close proximity with the eloquent cortex. Invasive EEG is performed with subdural grid/strip electrodes and depth electrodes and may either be limited to intraoperative recordings or obtained long-term while the patient is admitted to video-EEG monitoring unit. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) with stereotactically implanted electrodes have been utilized increasingly, particularly for determination of deep foci. Video-EEG monitoring should be performed in specialized centers that have dedicated health professionals.

Compared with single modal emotion recognition, the multimodal paradigm introduces complementary information for emotion recognition. Hence, in this work, we presented a decision level fusion framework for detecting emotions continuously by fusing the Electroencephalography (EEG) and facial expressions. Three types of movie clips (positive, negative, and neutral) were utilized to elicit specific emotions of subjects, the EEG and facial expression signals were recorded simultaneously. The power spectrum density (PSD) features of EEG were extracted by time-frequency analysis, and then EEG features were selected for regression. For the facial expression, the facial geometric features were calculated by facial landmark localization. Long short-term memory networks (LSTM) were utilized to accomplish the decision level fusion and captured temporal dynamics of emotions. The results have shown that the proposed method achieved outstanding performance for continuous emotion recognition, and it yields 0.625 0.029 of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). From the results, the fusion of two modalities outperformed EEG and facial expression separately. Furthermore, different numbers of time-steps of LSTM was applied to analyze the temporal dynamic capturing.

Source localization of high-frequency activity in tripolar electroencephalography of patients with epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epilepsy; Electroencephalography; High-frequency oscillations; Tripolar concentric ring electrode; Source localization	EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; ICTAL SCALP EEG; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; FAST RIPPLES; OSCILLATIONS; SEGMENTATION; ACCURATE; SURGERY; SPIKES; MODELS	Objective: The objective of the study was to localize sources of interictal high-frequency activity (HFA), from tripolar electroencephalography (tEEG), in patient-specific, realistic head models. Methods: Concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) and tEEG were recorded from nine patients undergoing video-EEG, of which eight had seizures during the recordings and the other had epileptic activity. Patient-specific, realistic boundary element head models were generated from the patient's magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Forward and inverse modeling was performed to localize the HFA to cortical surfaces. Results: In the present study, performed on nine patients with epilepsy, HFA observed in the tEEG was localized to the surface of subject-specific, realistic, cortical models, and found to occur almost exclusively in the seizure onset zone (SOZ)/irritative zone (IZ). Significance: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been studied as precise biomarkers of the SOZ in epilepsy and have resulted in good therapeutic effect in surgical candidates. Knowing where the sources of these highly focal events arc located in the brain can help with diagnosis. High-frequency oscillations are not commonly observed in noninvasive EEG recordings, and invasive electrocorticography (ECoG) is usually required to detect them. However, tEEG, i.e., EEG recorded on the scalp with tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCREs), has been found to detect narrowband HFA from high gamma (approximately 80 Hz) to almost 400 Hz that correlates with SOZ diagnosis. Thus, source localization of HFA in tEEG may help clinicians identify brain regions of the epileptic zone. At the least, the tEEG HFA localization may help determine where to perform intracranial recordings used for precise diagnosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To do so, we collected high-density EEG data from thirty participants while they were driving in a car simulator. The EEG was separated into independent components that were clustered across participants according to their scalp map topographies. For each component, time-frequency activity related to braking and acceleration events was determined through wavelet analysis, and the cortical generators were estimated through minimum norm source localisation. Comparisons of the time-frequency patterns of power and phase activations revealed that theta power synchronisation distinguishes braking from acceleration events 800 ms before the action and that phase-locked activity increases for braking 800 ms before foot movement in the theta-alpha frequency range. In addition, source reconstruction showed that the dorso-mesial part of the premotor cortex plays a key role in preparation of foot movement. Overall, the results illustrate that dorso-mesial premotor areas are involved in movement preparation while driving, and that low-frequency EEG rhythms could be exploited to predict drivers' intention to brake or accelerate.

Little is known, however, about the role of these rhythms in supporting DMN connectivity. Biophysical studies suggest that lower and higher frequencies mediate long- and short-range connectivity, respectively. Accordingly, we hypothesized that interactions between all DMN areas are supported by the alpha rhythm, and that the connectivity between specific DMN areas is established through other frequencies, mainly in the beta and/or gamma bands. To test this hypothesis, we used high-density electroencefalographic data collected in 19 healthy volunteers at rest. We analyzed frequency-dependent functional interactions between four main DMN nodes in a broad (1-80 Hz) frequency range. In line with our hypothesis, we found that the frequency-dependent connectivity profile between pairs of DMN nodes had a peak at 9-11 Hz. Also, the connectivity profile showed other peaks at higher frequencies, which depended on the specific connection. Overall, our findings suggest that frequency-dependent connectivity analysis may be a powerful tool to better understand how different neuronal oscillations support connectivity within and between brain networks.

Despite the increasing evidence over the last century, certain aspects of epilepsy and sleep interactions are still incompletely or not well understood. This article discusses the influence of sleep on adult focal epilepsy as assessed objectively via EEG, and highlights new developments of the last decade regarding sleep microstructure and new markers of the epileptogenic zone such as high-frequency oscillations > 80 Hz. It further describes evidence obtained from invasive intracranial EEG, as this is a unique method to assess directly cortical activity of superficial and deep structures of the human brain. Important achievements of the last decade were to unravel how epileptic activity is modulated by sleep, underlining the role of sleep slow waves to enhance epileptic activity, to demonstrate that seizure types are differently affected by sleep, and to show that sleep may be useful to better identify the epileptogenic zone for epilepsy surgery in drug-resistant epilepsy.

However, there is still no objective and universal index for diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Many researchers have studied language processing in schizophrenia since most of the patients show symptoms related to language processing, such as thought disorder, auditory verbal hallucinations, or delusions. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) with millisecond order high temporal resolution, have been applied to reveal the abnormalities in language processing in schizophrenia. The aims of this review are (a) to provide an overview of recent findings in language processing in schizophrenia with EEG and MEG using neurophysiological indices, providing insights into underlying language related pathophysiological deficits in this disease and (b) to emphasize the advantage of EEG and MEG in research on language processing in schizophrenia.

The combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a real-time brain state-dependent stimulation system allows the study of relations of dynamics of brain activity, cortical excitability, and plasticity induction. Here, we demonstrate a newly developed method to synchronize the timing of brain stimulation with the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations using a real-time data analysis system. This real-time EEG-triggered TMS of the human motor cortex, when TMS is synchronized with the surface EEG negative peak of the sensorimotor mu-alpha (8-14 Hz) rhythm, has shown differential corticospinal excitability and plasticity effects. The utilization of this method suggests that real-time information about the instantaneous brain state can be used for efficacious plasticity induction. Additionally, this approach enables personalized EEG-synchronized brain stimulation which may lead to the development of more effective therapeutic brain stimulation protocols.

IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; emotion; parasympathetic nervous system; recall; wavelet cross-correlation analysis	CROSS-CORRELATION ANALYSIS; HEART-RATE; CORTEX	An emotional event can provoke somatic symptoms as a consequence of brain responses accompanying reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). ANS consists of the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system, and their anatomical and physiological mechanisms are different. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time lag between the responses of electroencephalography (EEG) and the parasympathetic nervous system (from electrocardiography; ECG) during emotional recall. EEG and ECG of healthy young adults were simultaneously recorded during the recall of emotionally pleasant and unpleasant audiovisual stimuli, with three repetitions. A time series (TS) of relative power spectra from EEG and a TS of power spectral values in high frequency (HF) of RR intervals in ECG were obtained using fast Fourier transform. The time lag between the TS of EEG and HF was calculated using wavelet cross-correlation analysis. The results indicated that the cerebral cortex responded earlier than the parasympathetic nervous system to the pleasant stimuli. In contrast, the parasympathetic nervous system responded earlier than the cerebral cortex to the unpleasant stimuli. These events constantly appeared in both unfamiliar and familiar situations. This study quantitatively shows that the parasympathetic nervous system quickly and constantly reacts to emotionally unpleasant stimuli. (c) 2019 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

This study examined the effects of state-related EEG changes, from rest to the task and within the task, on stimulus-response efforts in a visual Continuous Performance Test (CPT). EEG was recorded from fifty-six adults at rest with eyes-closed (EC) then eyes-open (EO), and during the CPT. Principal Components Analyses decomposed the EEG obtained from EC, EO and the task-based periods immediately pre-cue (PC) and preimperative (PI), and the ERPs to the cued Go/NoGo imperatives. EC amplitudes were correlated with Go/NoGo ERP amplitudes and behavioural outcomes. EEG amplitude changes from EO to PC, and from PC to PI, were assessed as predictors of these response measures. Longer mean reaction time (RT) was associated with greater RT variability (RTV) and reduced Go P2. The two EC alpha components correlated positively with RTV, and NoGo P1 and P2 positivity. Delta/theta amplitude reductions from PC to PI predicted Go N1-1 and NoGo N2b enhancements. Alpha-1 decreases from PC to PI predicted larger P2 and poorer NoGo accuracy rates, while alpha-3 decrements positively predicted NoGo P1. These findings highlight the ongoing alpha arousal effects on stimulus-response efforts, and the low frequency shifts in the cue to imperative interval associated with stimulus anticipation and response preparation. These relationships offer novel insights into the effects of pretask EEG activity, and within-task EEG changes, on attention and cognitive control processes.

Cortical oscillations, electrophysiological activity patterns, associated with cognitive functions and impaired in many psychiatric disorders can be observed in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) may directly target these oscillations and may serve as therapeutic approaches to restore functional impairments. However, the presence of electrical stimulation artifacts in neurophysiological data limits the analysis of the effects of stimulation. Currently available methods suffer in performance in the presence of nonstationarity inherent in biological data. Approach. Our algorithm, shape adaptive nonlocal artifact removal (SANAR) is based on unsupervised manifold learning. By estimating the Euclidean median of k-nearest neighbors of each artifact in a nonlocal fashion, we obtain a faithful representation of the artifact which is then subtracted. This approach overcomes the challenges presented by nonstationarity. Main results. SANAR is effective in removing stimulation artifacts in the time domain while preserving the spectral content of the endogenous neurophysiological signal. We demonstrate the performance in a simulated damsel. as well as in human iEEG data. Using two quantitative measures, that capture how much of information from endogenous activity is retained, we demonstrate that SANAR's performance exceeds that of one of the widely used approaches, independent component analysis, in the time domain as well as the frequency domain. Significance. This approach allows for the analysis of iEEG data, single channel or multiple channels, during DCS, a crucial step in advancing our understanding of the effects of periodic stimulation and developing new therapies.

EEG analysis is complicated by a number of confounds, particularly 1. The close relationship between EEG power and movement speed must be controlled for prior to further analysis. 2. The difficulty inherent in identifying EEG epochs associated with a particular behaviour. New Method: We utilized infra-red event stamping to accurately synchronize EEG recorded superficially above the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex with motion tracking data in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model (PLB1App) and wild-type controls (PLBw-r) performing a Y-maze spontaneous alternation task. Video tracking synchronized epochs capturing specific behaviours were automatically identified and extracted prior to auto-regressive spectral analysis. Results: Despite comparable behavioural performance, PLB1App mice demonstrated region and behavioural context specific deficits in regulation of Gamma power: In contrast to controls, hippocampal Gamma response to speed as well as prefrontal activity associated with correct vs. incorrect alternations was absent in 13LB1Api, mice. Regulation of hippocampal Gamma power in response to direction of movement did not differ. Comparison with existing Methods: This method allows for the first time to detect behaviour-specific differences in EEG response to speed that can be quantified and actively controlled for. Analysis across multiple parameters engaging different brain regions can now be used for detailed EEG profiling of brain-region specific functions. Conclusion: Combining infra-red event-stamping and auto-regressive modelling enables rapid, automated and sensitive phenotyping of AD mouse models. Subtle alterations in brain signalling can be detected prior to overt behavioural impairments.

Gamma and theta oscillations as measured with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) reflect the neural underpinnings of WM. The WM processes that fluctuate in conjunction with WM demands are closely correlated with WM test performance, and their EEG signatures are abnormal in several clinical populations. Novel interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been shown to modulate these oscillations and subsequently improve WM performance and clinical symptoms. Systematically identifying pathological WM-related gamma/theta oscillatory patterns with EEG/MEG and developing ways to target them with interventions such as TMS is an active area of clinical research. Results hold promise for enhancing the outcomes of our patients with WM deficits and for moving the field of clinical neuropsychology towards a mechanism-based approach.

Quantitative electroencephalography measures in rapid eye movement and nonrapid eye movement sleep are associated with apnea-hypopnea index and nocturnal hypoxemia in men	SLEEP			English	Article						quantitative EEG analysis; power spectral analysis; sleep disordered breathing; obstructive sleep apnea; insomnia	DRIVING SIMULATOR PERFORMANCE; EEG SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; REM-SLEEP; INSOMNIA; OSA; WAKEFULNESS; HYPERCAPNIA; PREVALENCE	Study Objectives Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) measures of sleep may identify vulnerability to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) sequelae, however, small clinical studies of sleep microarchitecture in OSA show inconsistent alterations. We examined relationships between quantitative EEG measures during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep and OSA severity among a large population-based sample of men while accounting for insomnia. Methods All-night EEG (F4-M1) recordings from full in-home polysomnography (Embletta X100) in 664 men with no prior OSA diagnosis (age >= 40) were processed following exclusion of artifacts. Power spectral analysis included non-REM and REM sleep computed absolute EEG power for delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta frequency ranges, total power (0.5-32 Hz) and EEG slowing ratio. Results Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 10/h was present in 51.2% (severe OSA [AHI >= 30/h] 11.6%). In mixed effects regressions, AHI was positively associated with EEG slowing ratio and EEG power across all frequency bands in REM sleep (all p < 0.05); and with beta power during NREM sleep (p = 0.06). Similar associations were observed with oxygen desaturation index (3%). Percentage total sleep time with oxygen saturation <90% was only significantly associated with increased delta, theta, and alpha EEG power in REM sleep. No associations with subjective sleepiness were observed. Conclusions In a large sample of community-dwelling men, OSA was significantly associated with increased EEG power and EEG slowing predominantly in REM sleep, independent of insomnia.

The question of how various face-related systems and functions may be bound together remains an active area of investigation. We hypothesize that face processing may be associated with specific frequency band oscillations that serve to integrate distributed face processing systems. Using a multimodal imaging approach, including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), simultaneous signals were acquired during face and object picture viewing. As expected for face processing, hemodynamic activity in the right occipital face area (OFA) increased during face viewing compared to object viewing, and in a subset of participants, the expected N170 EEG response was observed for faces. Based on recently reported associations between the theta band and visual processing, we hypothesized that increased hemodynamic activity in a face processing area would also be associated with greater theta-band activity originating in the same area. Consistent with our hypothesis, theta-band oscillations were also localized to the right OFA for faces, whereas alpha- and beta-band oscillations were not. Together, these findings suggest that theta-band oscillations originating in the OFA may be part of the distributed face-specific processing mechanism. (C) The Authors.

One of the main findings in this field is that the phase of electroencephalography (EEG) in the alpha band can affect perception of milliseconds-long stimuli. However, the importance of the phase of EEG for processing more naturalistic stimuli, which have a much longer duration, is still not clear. To address this question here, we presented word-nonword pairs, each of which was visible for 5 s and measured the effect of EEG phase during stimulus onset on later memory recall. The task consisted of an encoding (learning) phase in which 20 novel word-nonword pairs were presented, followed by a test phase in which participants were shown one of the seen words with four target nonwords to choose from. We found that memory recall performance was higher when the words during encoding were presented at a descending phase of the theta oscillation. This effect was the strongest in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that the phase of ongoing cortical activity can affect memorization of seconds-long stimuli that are an integral part of many daily tasks.

Data in the literature have shown that exposure to radiofrequency signals modifies the waking EEG with the main effect on the alpha band frequency (8-13 Hz). However, some studies have reported an increase in alpha band power, while others have shown a decrease, and other studies showed no effect on EEG power. Given that changes in the alpha amplitude are associated with attention and some cognitive aspects of human behavior, researchers deemed necessary to look whether alpha rhythm was modulated under RF-EMF exposure. The present review aims at comparing and discussing the main findings obtained so far regarding RF-EMF effects on alpha rhythm of human waking spontaneous EEG, focusing on differences in protocols between studies, which might explain the observed discrepancies and inconclusive results.

Rhythmic Temporal Expectation Boosts Neural Activity by Increasing Neural Gain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory processing; magnetoencephalography; multivariate decoding; rhythm processing; sensory prediction; temporal orienting	MULTIVARIATE PATTERN-ANALYSIS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; ATTENTION; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; MECHANISM; RESPONSES	Temporal orienting improves sensory processing, akin to other top- down biases. However, it is unknown whether these improvements reflect increased neural gain to any stimuli presented at expected time points, or specific tuning to task-relevant stimulus aspects. Furthermore, while other top- down biases are selective, the extent of trade-offs across time is less well characterized. Here, we tested whether gain and/or tuning of auditory frequency processing in humans is modulated by rhythmic temporal expectations, and whether these modulations are specific to time points relevant for task performance. Healthy participants (N = 23) of either sex performed an auditory discrimination task while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Acoustic stimulation consisted of sequences of brief distractors interspersed with targets, presented in a rhythmic or jittered way. Target rhythmicity not only improved behavioral discrimination accuracy and M/EEG-based decoding of targets, but also of irrelevant distractors preceding these targets. To explain this finding in terms of increased sensitivity and/or sharpened tuning to auditory frequency, we estimated tuning curves based on M/EEG decoding results, with separate parameters describing gain and sharpness. The effect of rhythmic expectation on distractor decoding was linked to gain increase only, suggesting increased neural sensitivity to any stimuli presented at relevant time points.

This behavioral peculiarity is mirrored by findings of cortical hyper-responsivity already in the interictal state. Using repetitive visual stimulation to elicit steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) in 30 interictal episodic migraineurs and 30 controls we show hyper-responsivity of the visual cortex in the migraineurs. Additionally, the occipital regions were remarkably stronger coupled to the temporal, premotor and the anterior cingulate cortex than in headache free controls. These data suggest harmonized oscillations of different cortical areas as a response to visual input which might be driven by the cuneus. Furthermore, the increased coupling is modulated by the current state of the migraine cycle as the coupling was significantly stronger in patients with longer interictal periods.

While they are necessary for identifying disease-specific neuropathology, they lack a clear and robust relationship with the clinical presentation of dementia; they can be altered in healthy individuals, while they often inadequately mirror the degree of cognitive and functional deficits in affected subjects. There is growing evidence that synaptic loss and dysfunction are early events during the trajectory of AD pathogenesis that best correlate with the clinical symptoms, suggesting measures of brain functional deficits as candidate early markers of AD. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely available and noninvasive diagnostic method that provides direct insight into brain synaptic activity in real time. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis additionally provides information on physiologically meaningful frequency components, dynamic alterations and topography of EEG signal generators, i.e. neuronal signaling. Numerous studies have shown that qEEG measures can detect disruptions in activity, topographical distribution and synchronization of neuronal (synaptic) activity such as generalized EEG slowing, reduced global synchronization and anteriorization of neuronal generators of fast-frequency resting-state EEG activity in patients along the AD continuum. Moreover, qEEG measures appear to correlate well with surrogate markers of AD neuropathology and discriminate between different types of dementia, making them promising low-cost and noninvasive markers of AD. Future large-scale longitudinal clinical studies are needed to elucidate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of qEEG measures as early functional markers of AD on an individual subject level.

Motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG), a promising technology to provide assistance and support rehabilitation of neurological patients with sensorimotor impairments, require a reliable and adaptable subject-specific model to efficiently decode motor intention. The most popular EEG feature extraction algorithm for MI-BCIs is the common spatial patterns (CSP) method, but its performance strongly depends on the predefined frequency band and time segment length for analyzing the EEG signal. Approach. In this work, a novel method for efficiently decoding motor intention for EEG-based BCIs performing multiple frequency band analysis in multiple EEG segments is presented. This decoding algorithm uses raw multichannel EEG data which are decomposed into specific T temporal and F frequency bands. Features are extracted at each t-f band by using CSP. Feature selection and classification are simultaneously performed by means of a fast procedure, based on elastic-net regression, which allows for the inclusion of a priori discriminative information into the model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested off-line on two public EEG-based MI-BCI datasets and on a self-acquired dataset in two configurations: multiple temporal windows and single temporal window. Main results. The experimental results show that the proposed multiple time-frequency band method yields overall accuracy improvements of up to 9% (average accuracy of 84.8%) as compared to the best current state-of-the-art methods based on filter bank analysis and CSP for MI detection. Also, classification variability is reduced, making the proposed method more robust to infra-subject EEG fluctuations. Significance. This paper presents a novel approach for improving motor intention detection by automatically selecting subject-specific spatio-temporal-spectral features, especially when MI has to be detected against rest condition. This technique contributes to the further advancement and application of EEG-based MI-BCIs for assistance and neurorehabilitation therapy.

We introduce different preprocessing and feature extraction algorithms for this purpose and develop an algorithm that selects features by their feature importance. This selection is used as an evaluation measure for features, their preprocessing algorithms and the EEG electrodes. Our results show that most influential features for signal interpretation are: common spatial patterns, fractal dimensions, as well as, variance and standard deviation of the preprocessed data. We show that preprocessing with continuous wavelet transforms outperforms the other tested preprocessing algorithms. Furthermore, we show that high gamma frequencies (70-90 Hz) contain more information than the lower mu-rhythms (8-12 Hz) where event-related-desynchronization (ERD) is known to occur. The important EEG electrodes for this classification task are located in the left and right back of the motor-cortex. The proposed algorithm can be further used to create subject-specific and performance models for real-time classification.

Previous work using invasive intracranial recordings and non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has shown that correlations between beta phase and broad-band gamma (>50 Hz) amplitude [i.e., phase amplitude coupling (PAC)] are elevated in PD, perhaps a reflection of this synchrony. Recently, it has also been shown, in invasive human recordings, that non-sinusoidal features of beta oscillation shape also characterize PD. Here, we show that these features of beta waveform shape also distinguish PD patients on and off medication using non-invasive recordings in a dataset of 15 PD patients with resting scalp EEG. Specifically, beta oscillations over sensorimotor electrodes in PD patients off medication had greater sharpness asymmetry and steepness asymmetry than on medication (sign rank, p < 0.02, corrected). We also showed that beta oscillations over sensorimotor cortex most often had a canonical shape, and that using this prototypical shape as an inclusion criteria increased the effect size of our findings. Together, our findings suggest that novel ways of measuring beta synchrony that incorporate waveform shape could improve detection of PD pathophysiology in non-invasive recordings. Moreover, they motivate the consideration of waveform shape in future EEG studies.

Conventionally, mental workload assessment studies are mainly based on time-statistics, frequency, and wavelet domain features. In this paper, we present a mental workload assessment system in discriminating high and low mental workload by extracting EEG features from two new domains: time-complexity and entropy domains features. According to statistical analysis, the result demonstrates that the Frontal and Frontal-Central are two dominating regions. In addition, by fusing the traditional and new features, we boosted the classification performance from 69% to 88%. It indicates time-complexity and entropy domain features are able to extract some non-linear characteristics of EEG, which could not be achieved by traditional approaches. We conclude that the new features are feasible to assess human mental workload, and could provide complementary information to traditional features.

On three different time-points during the two-week sea journey, the EEG and HRV were recorded from nine male scientists who participated in "The First Turkish Antarctic Research Expedition". The recordings were performed in a relaxed state with the eyes open, eyes closed, and during a space quantity perception test. For the EEG recordings, the wireless 14 channel EPOC-Emotiv device was used, and for the HRV recordings, a Polar heart rate monitor S810i was used. The HRV data were analyzed by time/frequency domain parameters and ordinal pattern statistics. For the EEG data, spectral band power in the conventional frequency bands, as well as permutation entropy values were calculated. Regarding HRV, neither conventional nor permutation entropy calculations produced significant differences for the different journey time-points, but only permutation entropy was able to differentiate between the testing conditions. During the cognitive test, permutation entropy values increased significantly, whereas the conventional HRV parameters did not show any significant differences. In the EEG analysis, the ordinal pattern statistics revealed significant transitions in the course of the sea voyage as permutation entropy values decreased, whereas spectral band power analysis could not detect any significant difference. Permutation entropy analysis was further able to differentiate between the three testing conditions as well between the brain regions. In the conventional spectral band power analysis, alpha band power could separate the three testing conditions and brain regions, and beta band power could only do so for the brain regions. This superiority of permutation entropy in discerning subtle differences in the autonomic and central nervous system's responses to an overwhelming subjective experience renders it suitable as an analysis tool for biomonitoring in extreme environments.

It has been reported that, among the electrophysiological oscillations, those in the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz) are the most dominant during resting state. We hypothesized that DMN spatial configuration closely depends on the specific neuronal oscillations considered, and that alpha oscillations would mainly correlate with increased blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the DMN. To test this hypothesis, we used high-density EEG (hdEEG) data simultaneously collected with fMRI scanning in 20 healthy volunteers at rest. We first detected the DMN from source reconstructed hdEEG data for multiple frequency bands, and we then mapped the correlation between temporal profile of hdEEG-derived DMN activity and fMRI-BOLD signals on a voxel-by-voxel basis. In line with our hypothesis, we found that the correlation map associated with alpha oscillations, more than with any other frequency bands, displayed a larger overlap with DMN regions. Overall, our study provided further evidence for a primary role of alpha oscillations in supporting DMN functioning. We suggest that simultaneous EEG-fMRI may represent a powerful tool to investigate the neurophysiological basis of human brain networks.

EEG time-frequency analysis provides arguments for arm swing support in human gait control	GAIT & POSTURE			English	Article						Arm swing; Gait cycle; Supplementary motor area (SMA); Ambulant electroencephalography (EEG); Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP)	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL-LOBE; SPINAL-CORD; CORTEX; MOVEMENT; WALKING; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS	Background: Human gait benefits from arm swing, which requires four-limb co-ordination. The Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) is involved in multi-limb coordination. With its location anterior to the leg motor cortex and the pattern of its connections, this suggests a distinct role in gait control. Research question: Is the SMA functionally implicated in gait-related arm swing? Methods: Ambulant electroencephalography (EEG) was employed during walking with and without arm swing in twenty healthy subjects (mean age: 64.9yrs, SD 7.2). Power changes across the EEG frequency spectrum were assessed by Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) analysis over both the putative SMA at electrode position Fz and additional sensorimotor regions. Results: During walking with arm swing, midline electrodes Fz and Cz showed a step-related pattern of Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) followed by Event Related Synchronization (ERS). Walking without arm swing was associated with significant ERD-ERS power reduction in the high-beta/low-gamma band over Fz and a power increase over Cz. Electrodes C3 and C4 revealed a pattern of ERD during contralateral- and ERS during ipsilateral leg swing. This ERD power decreased in gait without arm swing (low-frequency band). The ERSP pattern during walking with arm swing was similar at CP1 and CP2: ERD was seen during double support and the initial swing phase of the right leg, while a strong ERS emerged during the second half of the left leg's swing. Walking without arm swing showed a significant power reduction of this ERD-ERS pattern over CP2, while over CP1, ERS during left leg's swing turned into ERD. Conclusion: The relation between arm swing in walking and a step-related ERD-ERS pattern in the high-beta/low-gamma band over the putative SMA, points at an SMA contribution to integrated cyclic anti-phase movements of upper- and lower limbs. This supports a cortical underpinning of arm swing support in gait control.

Here, we introduce a method with tensor decomposition for measuring the task-induced oscillations in the human brain using electroencephalography (EEG). The time frequency representation of source-reconstructed single-trail EEG data constructed a third-order tensor with three factors of time * trails, frequency and source points. We then used a non-negative Canonical Polyadic decomposition (NCPD) to identify the temporal, spectral and spatial changes in electrophysiological brain activity. We validate this method using both simulation EEG data and real EEG data recorded during a task of irony comprehension. The results demonstrated that proposed method can track dynamics of the temporal-spectral modes of the rhythm in the brain on a timescale commensurate to the task they are undertaking.

Moreover, taking advantage of the high time resolution in EEG, it is possible to perform fast topographical reference-free analysis, since different scalp potential fields correspond to changes in the underlying sources within the brain. In this study, the spontaneous EEG resting state (eyes closed) was compared between 10 young adults ages 18-30 years with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 13 neurotypical controls. A microstate analysis was applied, focusing on four temporal parameters: mean duration, the frequency of occurrence, the ratio of time coverage, and the global explained variance (GEV). Using data that were acquired from a 65-channel EEG system, six resting-state topographies that best describe the dataset across all subjects were identified by running a two-step cluster analysis labeled as microstate classes A-F. The results indicated that microstates B and E displayed statistically significant differences between both groups among the temporal parameters evaluated. Classes B, D, E, and F were consistently more present in ASD, and class C in controls. The combination of these findings with the putative functional significance of the different classes suggests that during resting state, the ASD group was more focused on visual scene reconstruction, while the control group was more engaged with self-memory retrieval. Furthermore, from a connectivity perspective, the resting-state networks that have been previously associated with each microstate class overlap the brain regions implicated in impaired social communication and repetitive behaviors that characterize ASD.

Methods: Fifty-one DOC patients were enrolled in this study. For each patient, a Coma Recovery ScaleRevised (CRS-R) score and 20-min resting-state EEG were recorded. Consciousness recovery was assessed with a CRS-R score at a three-month follow-up. Twenty healthy subjects were included as controls. General harmonic wavelet transform-based bicoherence was used to quantify the quadratic phase coupling characteristics of the EEG oscillations. Results: Quadratic phase self-coupling (QPSC) at the delta (QPSC_delta), theta (QPSC_theta) and alpha (QPSC_alpha) bands were closely correlated with patient CRS-R scores. Particularly, the QPSC_theta value could significantly differentiate between vegetative state (VS) patients, minimally conscious state (MCS) patients and healthy control subjects. As compared to VS patients, patients with MCS had a lower QPSC_theta value on the left as well as a higher QPSC_alpha value in right frontal regions. The frontal QPSC_theta value showed significant differences between recovered and unrecovered patients. Conclusion: QPSC characteristics could differentiate between consciousness states and show a predictive ability for the recovery of consciousness in DOC patients. Significance: Changes in QPSC accompany consciousness injury and restoration in DOC patients. A QPSC assessment is helpful in the diagnosis and prognosis of DOC patients.

In this paper, we developed an artificial encoding model to mimic the dynamic brain visual processing system in terms of alpha oscillations. We analyzed the induced alpha power during free viewing of natural videos and extracted relevant features in a participant-independent way. Meanwhile, the visual characteristics that would trigger involuntary attention in the early stage of visual processing were extracted from videos and further employed to estimate the alpha fluctuations at every 0.5 s. We compared the encoding performances across 19 electrode channel locations and selected an optimal encoding model with a support vector regression. The results demonstrated a promising brain encoding model in EEG signals, that could further contribute to the development of brain-computer interface and visual design.

However, extensive preparation time, cleaning, and limited long-term stability of conventional gel-based electrode systems pose significant limitations in out-of-the-lab conditions. Dry electrode systems may contribute to rapid and repetitive mobile EEG acquisition with significantly reduced preparation time, reduced cleaning requirements, and possible self-application by the volunteer but are known for higher channel failure probability and increased sensitivity to movement artifacts. We performed a counterbalanced repeated measure endurance cycling study to objectively validate the performance and applicability of a novel commercially available 64-channel dry electrode cap for sport science. A total of 17 healthy volunteers participated in the study, performing an endurance cycling paradigm comprising five phases: (I) baseline EEG, (II) pre-cycling EEG, (III) endurance cycling, (IV) active recovery, and (V) passive recovery. We compared the performance of the 64-channel dry electrode cap with a commercial gel-based cap system in terms of usability metrics, reliability, and signal characteristics. Furthermore, we validated the performance of the dry cap during a realistic sport science investigation, verifying the hypothesis of a systematic, reproducible shift of the individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) induced by physical effort. The average preparation time of the dry cap was one-third of the gel-based electrode caps. The average channel reliability of the dry cap varied between 80 +/- 15% (Phase I), 66 +/- 19% (Phase III), and 91 +/- 10% (Phase V). In comparison, the channel reliability of the gel-based cap varied between 95 +/- 3, 85 +/- 9, and 82 +/- 9%, respectively. No considerable differences were evident for the comfort evaluations nor the signal characteristics of both caps. A within-volunteers repeated measure analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) did not show significant effects of the electrode type on the iAPF [F(1,12) = 1.670, p = 0.221, eta(2)(p) = 0.122, Power = 0.222]. However, a significant increase of the iAPF exists from Phase II to Phases IV and V due to exhaustive physical task. In conclusion, we demonstrated that dry electrode cap is equivalent to the gel-based electrode cap based on signal characteristics, comfort, and signal information content, thereby confirming the usefulness of dry electrodes in sports science and other mobile applications involving ample movement.

Synchronized oscillatory activities of numerous neural oscillators are thought to underlie alpha oscillations. The amplitude of alpha oscillations reflects the degree of synchronization, which is often modulated through alpha activation and inactivation, for example, in event-related synchronization and desynchronization. The range of synchronization can be estimated using the similarity between neighboring alpha oscillations. Yet, little is known about how the synchronization range of alpha oscillations varies with alpha activation/inactivation over different brain regions. To examine this, we recorded human electroencephalography (EEG) during different tasks used to modulate alpha oscillations. We found that the synchronization range of posterior alpha oscillations was reduced in the activation phase compared to that in the inactivation phase. In contrast, the synchronization range of anterior alpha oscillations was enhanced in the activation phase compared to that in the inactivation phase. The results imply that the mechanisms generating anterior and posterior alpha oscillations may be different.

These networks presumably reflect complex neurophysiological processes and have a central role in distinct perceptual and cognitive functions. In this work, we propose an innovative approach for characterizing RSNs according to their underlying neural oscillations. We investigated specific electrophysiological properties, including spectral features, fractal dimension, and entropy, associated with eight core RSNs derived from high-density electroencephalography (EEG) source-reconstructed signals. Specifically, we found higher synchronization of the gamma-band activity and higher fractal dimension values in perceptual (PNs) compared with higher cognitive (HCNs) networks. The inspection of this underlying rapid activity becomes of utmost importance for assessing possible alterations related to specific brain disorders. The disruption of the coordinated activity of RSNs may result in altered behavioral and perceptual states. Thus, this approach could potentially be used for the early detection and treatment of neurological disorders.

Technologies such as electroencephalography(EEG) are used for differential diagnosis and not to support the psychiatrist's positive diagnosis. Here, we show the potential of EEG recordings as biomarkers of the schizophrenia syndrome. We recorded EEG while schizophrenia patients freely viewed natural scenes, and we analyzed the average EEG activity locked to the image onset. We found significant differences between patients and healthy controls in occipital areas approximately 500 ms after image onset. These differences were used to train a classifier to discriminate the schizophrenia patients from the controls. The best classifier had 81% sensitivity for the detection of patients and specificity of 59% for the detection of controls, with an overall accuracy of 71%. These results indicate that EEG signals from a free-viewing paradigm discriminate patients from healthy controls and have the potential to become a tool for the psychiatrist to support the positive diagnosis of schizophrenia.

People with sensory overresponsiveness (SOR) perceive nonpainful stimuli as noxious and demonstrate hyperalgesia and lingering sensation to laboratory pain stimuli. Electroencephalography (EEG) of cortical activity at rest is widely used to explore endophenotypes but has not yet been tested in people with SOR. Therefore, we investigated the characteristics of resting-state EEG in participants with SOR. METHOD. Resting-state EEG (5-min, eyes-closed recording) was compared in participants with (n = 9) and without (n = 12) SOR. RESULTS. Participants with SOR demonstrated a global reduction of the EEG activity, including significantly lower theta and alpha 1 activity as well as faster peak alpha frequency. Higher sensory-responsiveness scores were associated with high peak alpha power in participants without SOR. CONCLUSION. Reduced alpha activity is commonly interpreted as an electrophysiological indicator of arousal and sensitivity to pain. The EEG pattern of response may partly explain the reported ongoing daily alertness to environmental stimuli in participants with SOR.

Epileptic Seizure Prediction With Multi-View Convolutional Neural Networks	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Time-domain analysis; Epilepsy; Time-frequency analysis; Electroencephalograms (EEG); seizure prediction; convolutional neural network (CNN); multi-view CNN; representation learning	EEG SIGNAL; CLASSIFICATION	The unpredictability of seizures is often considered by patients to be the most problematic aspect of epilepsy, so this work aims to develop an accurate epilepsy seizure predictor, making it possible to enable devices to warn patients of impeding seizures. To develop a model for seizure prediction, most studies relied on Electroencephalograms (EEGs) to capture physiological measurements of epilepsy. This work uses the two domains of EEGs, including frequency domain and time domain, to provide two different views for the same data source. Subsequently, this work proposes a multi-view convolutional neural network framework to predict the occurrence of epilepsy seizures with the goal of acquiring a shared representation of time-domain and frequency-domain features. By conducting experiments on Kaggle data set, we demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms all methods listed in the Kaggle leader board. Additionally, our proposed model achieves average area under the curve (AUCs) of 0.82 and 0.89 on two subjects of CHB-MIT scalp EEG data set. This work serves as an effective paradigm for applying deep learning approaches to the crucial topic of risk prediction in health domains.

However, the effect of ketamine has been modelled with a single time course and without consideration of physiological noise. Aims: This study aimed to investigate ketamine-induced alterations in resting neural activity using conventional pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging analysis techniques with physiological noise correction, and a novel analysis utilising simultaneously recorded electroencephalography data. Methods: Simultaneous electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging and physiological data were collected from 30 healthy male participants before and during a subanaesthetic intravenous ketamine infusion. Results: Consistent with previous literature, we show widespread cortical blood-oxygen-level dependent signal increases and decreased blood-oxygen-level dependent signals in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex following ketamine. However, the latter effect was attenuated by the inclusion of motion regressors and physiological correction in the model. In a novel analysis, we modelled the pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging response with the power time series of seven electroencephalography frequency bands. This showed evidence for distinct temporal time courses of neural responses to ketamine. No electroencephalography power time series correlated with decreased blood-oxygen-level dependent signal in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions: We suggest the decrease in blood-oxygen-level dependent signals in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex typically seen in the literature is the result of physiological noise, in particular cardiac pulsatility. Furthermore, modelling the pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging response with a single temporal model does not completely capture the full spectrum of neuronal dynamics. The use of electroencephalography regressors to model the response can increase confidence that the pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging is directly related to underlying neural activity.

Probabilistic graphical model identifies clusters of EEG patterns in recordings from neonates	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain monitoring; Electroencephalography; Automated detection; Neonate; Chow-Liu tree; Multi-dimensional scaling	PREMATURE-INFANTS; PRETERM INFANTS; INTENSIVE-CARE; BRAIN-DAMAGE; FULL-TERM; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DISTRIBUTIONS; OSCILLATIONS	Objectives: In this paper we introduce a novel method for the evaluation of neonatal brain function via multivariate EEG (electroencephalography) signal processing and embedding into a probabilistic graph, the so called Chow-Liu tree. Methods: Using 28 EEG recordings of preterm and term neonate infants the complex features of the EEG signals were constructed in the form of a Chow-Liu tree. The trees were embedded into a 3 dimensional Euclidean space. Clustering of specific EEG patterns was done by complete linkage algorithm. Results: Our analytic tool was able to build clusters of patients with pathological EEG findings. In particular, we were able to make a visual proof on a 3d multidimensional scaling coordinate system with a good performance. The distances (graph edit distance) between Chow-Liu trees of different infants were proportional to the clinical findings of corresponding infants. Conclusion: Our method may provide a basis for the future development of a diagnostic/prognostic noninvasive brain monitoring tool which will be able to differentiate between a variety of complex clinical findings. Significance: This model addresses relevant issues in neonatology and neuropediatrics in terms of identification of possible clinical factors which interfere with normal brain development and will allow fast unbiased recognition of infants with specific pathological EEG findings.

There is an increasing interest in using EEG analysis to detect seizure, and in this study we aim to get a better understanding of how to visualize the information in the EEG time-frequency feature, and design and train a novel random forest algorithm for EEG decoding, especially for multiple-levels of illness. Here, we propose an automatic detection framework for epileptic seizure based on multiple time-frequency analysis approaches; it involves a novel random forest model combined with grid search optimization. The short-time Fourier transformation visualizes seizure features after normalization. The dimensionality of features is reduced through principal component analysis before feeding them into the classification model. The training parameters are optimized using grid search optimization to improve detection performance and diagnostic accuracy by in the recognition of three different levels epileptic of conditions (healthy subjects, seizure-free intervals, seizure activity). Our proposed model was used to classify 500 samples of raw EEG data, and multiple cross-validations were adopted to boost the modeling accuracy. Experimental results were evaluated by an accuracy, a confusion matrix, a receiver operating characteristic curve, and an area under the curve. The evaluations indicated that our model achieved the more effective classification than some previous typical methods. Such a scheme for computer-assisted clinical diagnosis of seizures has a potential guiding significance, which not only relieves the suffering of patient with epilepsy to improve quality of life, but also helps neurologists reduce their workload.

Here, we review 184 EEG studies that report differences in frequency bands in the resting state condition (eyes open and closed) across a spectrum of psychiatric disorders including depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, addiction, bipolar disorder, anxiety, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia to determine patterns across disorders. Aggregating across all reported results we demonstrate that characteristic patterns of power change within specific frequency bands are not necessarily unique to any one disorder but show substantial overlap across disorders as well as variability within disorders. In particular, we show that the most dominant pattern of change, across several disorder types including ADHD, schizophrenia and OCD, is power increases across lower frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases across higher frequencies (alpha, beta and gamma). However, a considerable number of disorders, such as PTSD, addiction and autism show no dominant trend for spectral change in any direction. We report consistency and validation scores across the disorders and conditions showing that the dominant result across all disorders is typically only 2.2 times as likely to occur in the literature as alternate results, and typically with less than 250 study participants when summed across all studies reporting this result. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the results were infrequently reported and were typically small at between 20% and 30% and correlated weakly with symptom severity scores. Finally, we discuss the many methodological challenges and limitations relating to such frequency band analysis across the literature. These results caution any interpretation of results from studies that consider only one disorder in isolation, and for the overall potential of this approach for delivering valuable insights in the field of mental health.

We use a smart wearable Internet of Things-based signal recording system to record physiological human signals [EEG, electrocardiography (ECG)] in real time. Then, the movement artifacts are removed using ECG as a reference signal and the baseline estimation and denoising with sparsity (BEADS) filter algorithm for trend removal. The parameters (cut-off frequency) of the BEADS filter are optimized with respect to the number of QRS complexes detected in the reference ECG signal. Next, surrogate movement signals are generated using a linear combination of intrinsic mode functions derived from the sample movement signals by the application of empirical mode decomposition. Surrogate signals are used to test the efficiency of the BEADS method for filtering the movement-contaminated EEG signals. We provide an analysis of the efficiency of the method, extracted movement artifacts and detrended EEG signals.

In the present study a period-amplitude analysis method was applied for the automated detection of sleep spindles in all-night sleep EEG recordings of young healthy subjects. The method relies on the characterization of individual half-waves of the EEG data, by estimating electrographic parameters such as amplitude and duration and by assigning a grade to each half-wave depending on where it lies in the amplitude-frequency plane. The grading is followed by the detection system, checking consecutive half-wave characteristics and implementing a set of rules for determining the start and the end of spindle bursts and for retaining or rejecting sleep spindle indications provided during the various stages of the detection system. The sensitivity and false positive rate across subjects was 78.9% and 10.9%, respectively, providing indication that the method could be successfully applied to larger sets of healthy subjects of various age groups, as well as to patient populations.

Methods: Cortical dynamics during standing balance control were assessed in 13 girls with AIS and 13 age-matched controls using electroencephalography. Time-frequency analysis were used to determine frequency power during ankle proprioception alteration (ankle tendons co-vibration interval) or reintegration of ankle proprioception (post-vibration interval) with or without vision. Results: Balance control did not differ between groups. In the co-vibration interval, a significant suppression in alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) band power and a significant increase in theta (4-7 Hz) band power were found respectively in the vision and non-vision condition in the AIS group compared to the CTL group. In the post-vibration interval, significant suppressions in beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) band power were observed in the AIS group in the non-vision condition. Conclusion: Participants with AIS showed brain oscillations differences compared to CTL in the sensorimotor cortex while controlling their balance in various sensory conditions. Significance: Future study using evaluation of cortical dynamics could serve documenting whether rehabilitation programs have an effect on sensorimotor function in AIS.

In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded while the human subjects listened to a given set of words from English (familiar language) and Japanese (unfamiliar language). The subjects also provided behavioural signals in the form of spoken audio for each input audio stimuli. In order to quantify the representation level differences for the auditory stimuli of two languages, we use a classification approach to discriminate the two languages from the EEG signal recorded during listening phase by designing an off-line classifier. These experiments reveal that the time-frequency features along with phase contain significant language discriminative information. The language discrimination is further confirmed with a second subsequent experiment involving Hindi (the native language of the subjects) and Japanese (unknown language). A detailed analysis is performed on the recorded EEG signals and the audio signals to further understand the language learning processes. A pronunciation rating technique on the spoken audio data confirms the improvement of pronunciation over the course of trials for the Japanese language. Using single trial analysis, we find that the EEG representations also attain a level of consistency indicating a pattern formation. The brain regions responsible for language discrimination and learning are identified based on EEG channel locations and are found to be predominantly in the frontal region.

We hypothesized that prestimulus EEG oscillations modulate the subsequent MEPs in a state-dependent manner. Objective: We studied the relationship between prestimulus alpha/beta oscillations and MEPs during eyes open (EO)/closed (EC) conditions, and then modulated TMS intensity in the EO condition. Furthermore, we developed an EEG-triggered TMS system ("informed open-loop") to verify our hypothesis. Methods: TMS was applied to the left motor cortex. We first compared EEG power differences between high- and low-amplitude MEP epochs in the EO and EC conditions when using a high TMS intensity. Next, we evaluated the effects of varying TMS intensities (high vs. low) on the EEG-MEP relationship. Finally, we used EEG-triggered TMS to determine whether prestimulus EEG oscillations predicted MEP amplitudes. Results: Prestimulus higher-power alpha/low-beta bands produced larger MEPs only in the high-intensity EO condition. A positive relationship between EEG power and MEP amplitude was observed at C3 and left frontal electrodes. This relationship was obscured when using the lower TMS intensity but was observed in the high-intensity condition at the C3 electrode. EEG-triggered TMS demonstrated that higher alpha power predicted higher MEP amplitudes, but beta power at around 20 Hz did not. Conclusions: A causal relationship between alpha/low-beta oscillations and MEP amplitudes at rest requires high TMS intensity delivered when eyes are open. This association may allow us to develop a new informed open-loop TMS protocol. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

One particular form of interaction that is widely encountered is the modulation of the amplitude of broadband high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, defined as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Conventional methods for assessing PAC mostly rely on the Hilbert transform. Previous studies have shown that this method produces biased or spurious PAC estimates as it is highly dependent on the parameters of the bandpass filter used to extract narrowband signals from broadband signals. Recently, wavelet-based methods have been proposed to address some of these limitations. In this letter, we provide a thorough comparison between wavelet-based PAC measures and our recently introduced Reduced Interference Rihaczek (RID-Rihaczek) distribution based PAC both analytically and through simulations. The proposed method is shown to yield higher frequency resolution PAC estimates compared to wavelet-based methods.

However, many researchers put heavily handcraft feature extraction or carefully tailored feature engineering to each patient to achieve very high sensitivity and low false prediction rate for a particular dataset. This limits the benefit of the proposed approaches if a different dataset is used. Recently, representations learned using the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for object recognition are becoming a widely used model of the processing hierarchy in the human visual system. The correspondence between models and brain signals that holds the acquired activity at high temporal resolution has been explored less exhaustively. In this paper, deep learning CNN with a range of different architectures is designed for identifying related activities from raw electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, an improved short-time Fourier transform is used to stand for the time-frequency information after extracting the spectral images of the original EEG as input to CNN. Then CNN models are designed and trained to predict the DOA levels from EEG spectrum without handcrafted features, which presents an intuitive mapping process with high efficiency and reliability. As a result, the best trained CNN model achieved an accuracy of 93.50%, interpreted as CNN's deep learning to approximate the DOA by senior anesthesiologists, which highlights the potential of deep CNN combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.

But, how to use the cognitive principles to enhance the emotion recognition model is still a challenge. The purpose of this research paper is to investigate the emotion cognitive process and its application. Firstly, to evoke the response emotions, a three-stage experimental paradigm of long-time music stimuli was designed. The EEG signals were recorded in 15 healthy adults during the listening of 16 music clips respectively. Then, the time course analysis method of music-evoked emotions was proposed to examine the differences of brain activities. There was great increase of the spectral power in alpha band and a slight decrease in high-frequency beta and gamma bands during music listening. Through time analysis, the characteristics of the inspiring-keeping-fading were also found in different emotional states. After that, the most relevant EEG features were selected based on the time correlation analysis between EEG and music features. Finally, based on the cognitive principles inspired EEG features, an emotional prediction system was built. From the results, the accuracies of binary classification were 66.8% for valence and 59.5% for arousal. The accuracies of 3-classes classification performed as 45.9% for valence and 45.1% for arousal. These results suggest that with the help of cognitive principles, a better emotional recognition system could be built. Understanding the cognitive process could promote the development of artificial intelligence.

The role of electroencephalography (EEG) in detecting subtle dysfunctions in sensory temporal processing has been fully re-evaluated, thanks to advances in methods of quantitative analysis. However, the diagnostic value of EEG in migraine is very low, and migraine diagnosis is completely based on clinical criteria, while the utility of EEG in migraine pathophysiology has only been confirmed in more recent applications.Areas covered: The present review focuses on the few situations in which EEG may provide diagnostic utility, and on the numerous and intriguing applications of novel analysis, based on time-related changes in neuronal network oscillations and functional connectivity.Expert opinion: Although routine EEG is not particularly useful for the clinical assessment of migraine, novel methods of analysis, mostly based on functional connectivity, could improve knowledge of the migraine brain. The application is worthy of promotion and improvement in support of neuroimaging data to shed light on migraine mechanisms and support the rationale for therapeutic approaches.

Dynamic features of EEG oscillations may provide more understanding of the relationship between the content of inner conscious experience and electrical brain activity. We tested a correlation of rating on the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ) with dynamic parameters of EEG recorded in 49 healthy volunteers during the 10-min resting session. The participants filled ARSQ immediately after the rest. We investigated both linear (1 Hz-band power spectral density - PSD) and dynamic features (standard deviation and frequency of Hilbert envelope) of EEG averaged for the whole resting-state segment. Besides, we conducted a procedure of k-mean clustering based on PSD, localization of components retrieved by independent component analysis for 10-sec EEG epochs to assess spectral and temporal variability of EEG. The correlation analysis showed that the increase of PSD and cluster duration of the high-frequency alpha rhythm (12-13 Hz) in central and frontal areas was positively associated with the rating of experienced thoughts related to Planning (r = 0.44). The time of the presence of low amplitude delta oscillations correlated negatively with Planning (r = -0.52). The participants with higher ARSQ scores of Visual Thoughts had a higher standard deviation of the wideband (1-30 Hz) Hilbert envelope. Our data suggest that the dynamic properties of EEG reflect cognitive states assessed by ARSQ.

EEG analysis based driver status indication is one of the effective ways to measure driver status. This paper discusses about EEG analysis using wavelet transforms for separating EEG signal frequencies and extracting time and frequency domain features for further classification. EEG is a non-stationary signal and analysis only in time or frequency domain is not preferred. Wavelet transforms analyze the signals in both time and frequency domain. EEG rhythms consisting of different frequency bands are separated using Daubitius DB8 wavelet transform. Sleep data sets from Physionet were used for the proposed study. The drowsy status is indicated with alpha and theta frequency rhythms. The features representing alpha and theta activity were extracted and can be used to classify the driver status. The statistical features in time and frequency domain are used classify alert and drowsy state of the driver. Variants of SVM models were used to classify the signals and cubic SVM is found to give highest classification accuracy of 93.9%. The proposed method can be used to analyze driver status and further to analyze different sleep stages.	[Nissimagoudar, P. C.; Nandi, Anilkumar, V; Gireesha, H.

Removal of Gross Artifacts of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation in Simultaneous EEG Monitoring	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; tACS; artifact removal; adaptive filter	BRAIN-STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG/MEG; TDCS	Transcranial electrical stimulation is a widely used non-invasive brain stimulation approach. To date, EEG has been used to evaluate the effect of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS), but most studies have been limited to exploring changes in EEG before and after stimulation due to the presence of stimulation artifacts in the EEG data. This paper presents two different algorithms for removing the gross tACS artifact from simultaneous EEG recordings. These give different trade-offs in removal performance, in the amount of data required, and in their suitability for closed loop systems. Superposition of Moving Averages and Adaptive Filtering techniques are investigated, with significant emphasis on verification. We present head phantom testing results for controlled analysis, together with on-person EEG recordings in the time domain, frequency domain, and Event Related Potential (ERP) domain. The results show that EEG during tACS can be recovered free of large scale stimulation artifacts. Previous studies have not quantified the performance of the tACS artifact removal procedures, instead focusing on the removal of second order artifacts such as respiration related oscillations. We focus on the unresolved challenge of removing the first order stimulation artifact, presented with a new multi-stage validation strategy.

This hypothesis assumes discrete perception. In particular, the amplitude and the phase of the low frequency rhythm entails a cortical mechanism which paces the access of sensory information into the cognitive system. Evidence supporting this idea includes correlations between the phase of neural oscillations and behavioral performance in perception, spatial attention and working memory. Despite a widespread confidence in the theory, these findings have been mostly based on a varied range of exploratory approaches and inferential group statistics. Here, we aimed at validating the involvement of low frequency cortical rhythm in perception and at providing a clear-cut EEG analysis pipeline. Such an analytical pipeline should support the adoption of a hypothesis-driven framework for future replications and applications. The design, the analyses and the statistical power of the present experiment were based on prior studies in which phase opposition was successfully found. However, our results provide evidence for the involvement of pre-stimulus oscillatory alpha amplitude but not phase in perception. We discuss the null findings from the present study within the existing literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Physiological indicators including the heart rate (HR), amplitude of the R-wave (Delta R), heart rate variability (HRV), electro-encephalography alpha reactivity (alpha-EEG), electroencephalography beta reactivity (beta-EEG), eye blink frequency (BF), respiratory frequency (RF), respiratory depth (RD), skin conductance level (SCL), and skin temperature (ST) were measured and analysed through audio-visual reduction in a laboratory, and the obtained data were compared with the answers to a perceived restorativeness soundscape scale survey. Through the analysis of variance by a repeated measures method, it was found that all physiological indicators (except for alpha-EEG) changed after one minute of measurements. Furthermore, BF and ST were not affected by the changes in the soundscape type, and the natural sound decreased the levels of HR, RF, and RD and increased the values of Delta R, HRV, alpha-EEG, and beta-EEG. In addition, a canonical correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between the physiological indicators and subjective evaluation factors. The relationship between the physiological parameters measured within the first minute and results of subjective evaluation was relatively strong but insufficient for accurately interpreting the obtained physiological responses using only the subjective evaluation data.

The reactivation of this brain region can be beneficial for them, for instance, allowing them to use brain-machine interfaces for motor rehabilitation or restoration. These brain-machine interfacess generally use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the cortical activation during the attempts of movement, quantifying it as the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the alpha/mu rhythm. Based on previous evidence showing that higher tonic EEG alpha power is associated with higher ERD, we hypothesized that artificially increasing the alpha power over the motor cortex of these patients could enhance their ERD (ie, motor cortical activation) during movement attempts. We used EEG neurofeedback (NF) to enhance the tonic EEG alpha power, providing real-time visual feedback of the alpha oscillations measured over the motor cortex. This approach was evaluated in a C4, ASIA A, SCI patient (9 months after the injury) who did not present ERD during the movement attempts of his paralyzed hands. The patient performed 4 NF sessions (in 4 consecutive days) and screenings of his EEG activity before and after each session. After the intervention, the patient presented a significant increase in the alpha power over the motor cortex, and a significant enhancement of the mu ERD in the contralateral motor cortex when he attempted to close the assessed right hand. As a proof of concept investigation, this article shows how a short NF intervention might be used to enhance the motor cortical activation in patients with chronic tetraplegia.

In this study, with a rapid event-related simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy recording in humans, we explored the potential contribution of anticipatory electrophysiological activation and hemodynamic activation by examining how anticipatory low-frequency oscillations and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentration influence the subsequent event-related potential (ERP) marker of attentional selection. We found that expecting a target led to both a posterior lateralization of alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillation power and a lateralization of HbO response over the visual cortex. Importantly, the magnitude of cue-induced alpha lateralization was positively correlated with the nearby HbO lateralization in the visual cortex, and such a cue-induced alpha lateralization predicted the subsequent target-evoked N2pc amplitudes assumed to reflect attentional selection. Our results suggest that each individual's attentional selection biomarker as reflected by N2pc is predictable in advance via the anticipation-induced alpha lateralization, and such cue-induced alpha lateralization seems to play an important role in the functional coupling effects between the low-frequency EEG and the nearby hemodynamic activation.

By using the principle of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, we aimed to test if PAC might be eligible as a biomarker of attention in multimodal tasks such as driving. Surface EEG was measured simultaneously in drivers and copilots while participating in simulated driving scenarios with varying multimodal attentional demands. The PAC between Theta-band phase and Gamma-band amplitude from the EEG was obtained and evaluated. Results showed significant PAC differences between drivers and copilots in areas related to multimodal attention (prefrontal cortex, frontal eye fields, primary motor cortex, and visual cortex). The results were confirmed by behavioral data acquired during the test (detection task). We conclude that PAC does function as a biomarker for attentional demand by detecting cortical areas being activated through specific multimodal (in this case, driving) tasks.

To this end, the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) has emerged as a powerful clinical research tool. TMS-EEG allows cortical properties, such as excitability, inhibition, oscillatory activity, and connectivity, to be directly probed within a specific region of the cortex. This review will summarize the state of the current literature on TMS-EEG and its potential to uncover biological targets in psychiatric illnesses, with a focus on major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Collectively, the reviewed studies suggest that alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition and gamma oscillations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and neighboring frontal regions are potential shared biomarkers in psychiatry, highlighting the potential of TMS-EEG to help identify translational biomarkers.

Delayed in receiving medical attention can bring severe consequences. Conventional way of identifying TBI are from the computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, CT scan or MRI is hard to be performed to all patients as there were limited resources in the hospitals. As an early screening for TBI, EEG is a suitable substitution. Yet, it is time consuming for doctors or expert to perform EEG analysis manually for each patient. Therefore, this study suggests a machine learning method to identify moderate TBI patients. In this study, two type of features were analyzed. First is the raw EEG signal of alpha, beta, theta and gamma frequency bands. The second type of features are the power spectral density (PSD) of the respective frequency bands. The extracted features were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) separately to investigate the most informative frequency band features for identification of moderate TBI. From the result, it is found that alpha band features give the best identification accuracy which is at 87.5% for the raw features and 83.33% for the PSD.

Compared to the invasive neural signal based brain-machine interface (BMI), a non-invasive alternative, i.e., the electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BMI would be more widely accepted by the patients above. Ideally, a real-time continuous neuroprosthestic control is required for practical applications. However, conventional EEG-based BMIs mainly deal with the discrete brain activity classification. Until recently, the literature has reported several attempts for achieving the real-time continuous control by reconstructing the continuous movement parameters (e.g., speed, position, etc.) from the EEG recordings, and the low-frequency band EEG is consistently reported to encode the continuous motor control information. Previous studies with executed movement tasks have extensively relied on the amplitude representation of such slow oscillations of EEG signals for building models to decode kinematic parameters. Inspired by the recent successes of instantaneous phase of low-frequency invasive brain signals in the motor control and sensory processing domains, this study examines the extension of such a slow-oscillation phase representation to the reconstructing two-dimensional hand movements, with the non-invasive EEG signals for the first time. The data for analysis are collected on five healthy subjects performing 2D hand center-out reaching along four directions in two sessions. On representative channels over the cortices encoding the execution information of reaching movements, we show that the low-delta EEG phase representation is characterized by higher signal-to-noise ratio and stronger modulation by the movement tasks, compared to the low-delta EEG amplitude representation. Furthermore, we have tested the low-delta EEG phase representation with two commonly used linear decoding models. The results demonstrate that the low-delta EEG phase based decoders lead to superior performance for 2D executed movement reconstruction to its amplitude based counterparts, as well as the other-frequency band amplitude and power based features. Thus, our study contributes to improve the movement reconstruction from EEG by introducing a new feature set based on the low-delta EEG phase patterns, and demonstrates its potential for continuous fine motion control of neuroprostheses.

Researchers have recently proposed speech segmentation methods employing the relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity to separate sentences into segments with distinct intelligibility information. However, the effects of different RMS-level segments containing distinct intelligibility information on neural oscillations are not clear. Using scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data, we investigated the hypothesis that perceptual responses to different RMSlevel-dependent speech segments would have distinct EEG characteristics derived from the power values at each frequency band and the relationship between acoustics and neural oscillations at different response time and spatial distribution. We analyzed the EEG power and synchronized neural oscillations corresponding to auditory temporal fluctuations when subjects listened to Mandarin sentences with only high-RMS-level segments and only middle-RMS-level segments preserved, respectively. The results showed significantly stronger EEG spectral power in the delta and theta bands for high-RMS-level stimuli compared with middle-RMS-level stimuli, indicating that the former carry more speech-parsing information at the syllabic level. Differences in neural synchronization were also found between the high- and middle-RMS-level stimuli, allowing for the derivation of intelligibility indices for cortical responses corresponding to different RMS-level segments. These findings suggest that both high- and middle-RMS-level segments drive delta and theta rhythms to track stimuli, and that neural oscillations employ different tracking patterns for these two segment types during auditory sentence processing. Moreover, they suggest that neural oscillations can serve as effective indices for the identification of reliable intelligibility factors in RMS-level-dependent stimuli. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-four fifth graders solved multiplication problems while ongoing electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The arithmetic training revealed reduced errors together with a power increase in theta (4-7 Hz) but not in lower alpha (8-10 Hz) or upper alpha (10-13 Hz) bands. We conclude that increases in theta power subserved a shift from slow, procedural strategies to more efficient, automated procedural and retrieval strategies, which led to more efficient performance.

Changes related to cognitive decline may delay the stages of the speech production process in the aging brain. For example, semantic memory decline and poor inhibition may delay the retrieval of a concept from the mental lexicon. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable method for identifying the timing of speech production stages. So far, studies using EEG mainly focused on a particular speech production stage in a particular group of subjects. Differences between subject groups and between methodologies have complicated identifying time windows of the speech production stages. For the current study, the speech production stages lemma retrieval, lexeme retrieval, phonological encoding, and phonetic encoding were tracked using a 64-channel EEG in 20 younger adults and 20 older adults. Picture-naming tasks were used to identify lemma retrieval, using semantic interference through previously named pictures from the same semantic category, and lexeme retrieval, using words with varying age of acquisition. Non-word reading was used to target phonological encoding (using non-words with a variable number of phonemes) and phonetic encoding (using non-words that differed in spoken syllable frequency). Stimulus-locked and response-locked cluster-based permutation analyses were used to identify the timing of these stages in the full time course of speech production from stimulus presentation until 100 ms before response onset in both subject groups. It was found that the timing of each speech production stage could be identified. Even though older adults showed longer response times for every task, only the timing of the lexeme retrieval stage was later for the older adults compared to the younger adults, while no such delay was found for the timing of the other stages. The results of a second cluster-based permutation analysis indicated that clusters that were observed in the timing of the stages for one group were absent in the other subject group, which was mainly the case in stimulus-locked time windows. A z-score mapping analysis was used to compare the scalp distributions related to the stages between the older and younger adults. No differences between both groups were observed with respect to scalp distributions, suggesting that the same groups of neurons are involved in the four stages, regardless of the adults' age, even though the timing of the individual stages is different in both groups.

Validation of an automated sleep spindle detection method for mouse electroencephalography	SLEEP			English	Article						automated spindle detection; mouse electroencephalography; polysomnography; sigma; model species; psychiatry	SLOW OSCILLATIONS; NREM SLEEP; EEG; ZOLPIDEM; NEURONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ARCHITECTURE; CHANNELS; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS	Study Objectives: Sleep spindles are abnormal in several neuropsychiatric conditions and have been implicated in associated cognitive symptoms. Accordingly, there is growing interest in elucidating the pathophysiology behind spindle abnormalities using rodent models of such disorders. However, whether sleep spindles can reliably be detected in mouse electroencephalography (EEG) is controversial necessitating careful validation of spindle detection and analysis techniques. Methods: Manual spindle detection procedures were developed and optimized to generate an algorithm for automated detection of events from mouse cortical EEG. Accuracy and external validity of this algorithm were then assayed via comparison to sigma band (10-15 Hz) power analysis, a proxy for sleep spindles, and pharmacological manipulations. Results: We found manual spindle identification in raw mouse EEG unreliable, leading to low agreement between human scorers as determined by F1-score (0.26 +/- 0.07). Thus, we concluded it is not possible to reliably score mouse spindles manually using unprocessed EEG data. Manual scoring from processed EEG data (filtered, cubed root-mean-squared), enabled reliable detection between human scorers, and between human scorers and algorithm (F1-score > 0.95). Algorithmically detected spindles correlated with changes in sigma-power and were altered by the following conditions: sleep-wake state changes, transitions between NREM and REM sleep, and application of the hypnotic drug zolpidem (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Conclusions: Here we describe and validate an automated paradigm for rapid and reliable detection of spindles from mouse EEG recordings. This technique provides a powerful tool to facilitate investigations of the mechanisms of spindle generation, as well as spindle alterations evident in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders.

That is, healthcare costs are optimized towards patient benefit and sideways effects such as cost-related reduction in medication, in frequency of post-operatory interventions, in recovery times and in comorbidity risk. In this paper, we address the incidence of events related to stroke, epileptic seizures and tools to possibly predict their presence from Electroencephalography (EEG) signal acquired in post-surgery patients. Wavelet analysis and spectrogram indicate graphically changes in the energy content of the EEG signal. Physiologically based neuronal dynamic pathway is used to derive fractional order impedance models. Nonlinear least squares identification technique is used to identify model parameters, with results suggesting parameter redundancy. There is a significant difference in model parameter values between EEG signal with/-out events.

However, the study of these modulations after cognitive practice, resulting from a memory task, has been scarce. This work aims at examining age-related changes in the functional reorganization of the resting brain after cognitive training, namely, neuroplasticity, by means of the most innovative tools for data analysis. To this end, electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 34 young and 38 older participants. Different methods for data analyses, including frequency, time-frequency and machine learning-based prediction models were conducted. Results showed reductions in Alpha power in old compared to young adults in electrodes placed over posterior and anterior areas of the brain. Moreover, young participants showed Alpha power increases after task performance, while their older counterparts exhibited a more invariant pattern of results. These results were significant in the 140-160 s time window in electrodes placed over anterior regions of the brain. Machine learning analyses were able to accurately classify participants by age, but failed to predict whether resting state scans took place before or after the memory task. These findings greatly contribute to the development of multivariate tools for electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis and improve our understanding of age-related changes in the functional reorganization of the resting brain.

It decomposes signals into a number of amplitude and frequency modulated signals namely intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). However, some of these IMFs represents the original signal better while some of them are useless. IMF selection methods are suggested to determine the IMFs which represents the original signal better than other IMFs. In this study, we analyzed the effect of IMF selection methods in classification performance. We compared power based, correlation based and power spectral density based IMF selection methods in the classification of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are collected from subjects with multiple sclerosis. The EEG signals are classified as the patients are being cognitively impaired or intact. k-nearest neighbors, multilayer perceptron neural networks and random forest classifiers are used in classification. The results show that, effect of IMF selection methods on accuracy is changeable in regard to classifier preference.

Yet, it is unclear if tACS can modulate and restore neural oscillations that are reduced in patients with psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Here, we asked if tACS modulates network oscillations in schizophrenia. We performed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial to contrast tACS with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and sham stimulation in 22 schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations. We used high-density electroencephalography to investigate if a five-day, twice-daily 10Hz-tACS protocol enhances alpha oscillations and modulates network dynamics that are reduced in schizophrenia. We found that 10Hz-tACS enhanced alpha oscillations and modulated functional connectivity in the alpha frequency band. In addition, 10Hz-tACS enhanced the 40Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which is reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Importantly, clinical improvement of auditory hallucinations correlated with enhancement of alpha oscillations and the 40Hz-ASSR. Together, our findings suggest that tACS has potential as a network-level approach to modulate reduced neural oscillations related to clinical symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

On the other hand, the dynamics of the infra-slow EEG during performing cognitive tasks has not been well evaluated, because it has been excluded in the conventional EEG analysis. In this study, we evaluated infra-slow EEG during visual and auditory discrimination and found that the increase in the infraslow EEG power distributed widely over scalp region was significantly correlated with the increase of reaction time of both tasks. Importantly, this result is consistent with the interpretation that the infra-slow EEG activation reflects DMN activation. It is suggested that the infra-slow EEG power is available for an index for the DMN activation during performing cognitive tasks.

Here, we aimed to transiently modulate and test the cortical excitability during fear processing using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and brain oscillations in theta and alpha frequency bands with electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: We conducted two separate experiments (no-TMS and TMS). In the no-TMS experiment, EEG recordings were performed during the instructed fear paradigm in which a visual cue (CS+) was paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (electric shock), while the other visual cue was unpaired (CS-). In the TMS experiment, in addition the TMS was applied on the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). The participants also underwent structural MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning and were assigned pseudo-randomly to both experiments, such that age and gender were matched. The cortical excitability was evaluated by time-frequency analysis and functional connectivity with weighted phase lag index (WPLI). We further linked the excitability patterns with markers of stress coping capability. Results: After visual cue onset, we found increased theta power in the frontal lobe and decreased alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+ relative to CS- trials. TMS of dmPFC increased theta power in the frontal lobe and reduced alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+. The TMS pulse increased the information flow from the sensorimotor region to the prefrontal and occipital regions in the theta and alpha bands, respectively during CS+ compared to CS-. Pre-stimulation frontal theta power (0.75-1 s) predicted the magnitude of frontal theta power changes after stimulation (1-1.25 s). Finally, the increased frontal theta power during CS+ compared to CS- was positively correlated with stress coping behavior. Conclusion: Our results show that TMS over dmPFC transiently modulated the regional cortical excitability and the fronto-occipital information flows during fear processing, while the pre-stimulation frontal theta power determined the strength of achieved effects. The frontal theta power may serve as a biomarker for fear processing and stress-coping responses in individuals and could be clinically tested in mental disorders.

In this study, we propose, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a novel data adaptive empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based signal decomposition method for improving the classification accuracy of MI based EEG signals. Specifically, to reduce the system complexity and execution time, the proposed method selects 18 electrodes out of 118 to analyze the non-stationary and nonlinear EEG signal behaviors. Meanwhile, the method adopts the Welch power spectral density (PSD) analysis method for single mode selection out of the total 10 for each channel, and the Hilbert transform (HT) method for both instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous frequency (IF) signal components extraction for each selected mode. With seven commonly used machine-learning classifiers adopted, extensive experiments were conducted with the benchmark dataset IVa from BCI competition III to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that with the IA and IF component features being tested using the least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier, the EWT method achieves an average classification accuracy of 95.2% and 94.6% respectively, which is higher as compared with the existing methods. While for every participant, a classification accuracy of at least 80% could be achieved by employing a single feature only. Results also show that a combination of EWT and higher order statistics features, which contain both kurtosis and skewness of the extracted instantaneous components, help achieve a higher success rate. The better performances of EWT over those of the existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of EWT for BCI system applications.

This study explored the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals to assess changes in neural activity as individuals performed a training task in a virtual environment simulator. Commonly, task behavior and perception are used to assess a trainee's ability to perform a task, however, changes in cognition are not usually measured and could be important to provide a true indication of an individual's level of knowledge or skill. Approach. In this study, 15 participants acquired spatial knowledge via 60 navigation trials (divided into ten blocks) in a novel virtual environment. Time performance, perceived certainty, and EEG signal data were collected. Main results. A significant increase in alpha power and classification accuracy of EEG data from block 1 against blocks 2-10 was observed and stabilized after block 7, while time performance and perceived certainty measures improved and stabilized after block 5 and 6, respectively. Significance. Results suggest that changes in neural activity, which may reflect an increase in cognitive efficiency, could provide additional insight beyond time performance and perceived certainty.

Apart from the exciting interaction design prospects, HMDs bear significant potential in hosting an array of physiological sensors very adjacent to the human skull. As a proof of concept, we illustrate EEGlass, an early wearable prototype comprised of plastic eyewear frames for approximating the form factor of a modern HMD. EEGlass is equipped with an Open-BCI board and a set of EEG electrodes at the contact points with the skull for unobtrusively collecting data related to the activity of the human brain. We tested our prototype with 1 participant performing cognitive and sensorimotor tasks while wearing an established Electroencephalography (EEG) device for obtaining a baseline. Our preliminary results showcase that EEGlass is capable of accurately capturing resting state, detect motor-action and Electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts. Further experimentation is required, but our early trials with EEGlass are promising in that HMDs could serve as a springboard for moving EEG outside of the lab and in our everyday life, facilitating the design of neuroadaptive systems.

Additionally, subgroups were related to functional outcomes and very preterm birth. Methods: A Dutch cohort of 53 very preterm and 61 full-term born adolescents aged 13 years participated. Resting-state electroencephalography was recorded. Absolute and relative delta, theta, alpha, and beta power were compared between groups. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups with distinct activity patterns and to relate these patterns to intelligence, academic performance, motor skills, and very preterm birth. Results: Very preterm adolescents exhibited decreased relative beta activity. LCA with four classes showed the best model fit. The class with the highest level of delta and lowest levels of theta, alpha, and beta power was associated with lowest intelligence, academic, and motor estimates. Very preterm born adolescents were more likely than controls to be members of this class. Conclusion: Very preterm born adolescents showed altered oscillatory activity, indicating long-lasting effects of very preterm birth on brain functioning. Distinct activity patterns were associated with both functional outcomes and very preterm birth. Significance: Specific patterns of brain oscillations may serve as biomarkers for poor functional outcome after very preterm birth. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

It may act through entrainment of brain oscillations. Objectives To explore sTMS effects on neurophysiology with electroencephalography (EEG) in adults with major depressive disorder. Methods As an ancillary study to a clinical trial of sTMS, EEGs were recorded at baseline and at one and six weeks of treatment. Associations between EEG measures and clinical symptoms were examined. Results Absolute and relative power measures did not differ significantly between active and sham groups and did not change significantly over time. Changes occurring over six weeks in alpha current source density at anterior and central midline voxels were significantly correlated with changes in symptoms in subjects treated with active but not sham sTMS. Conclusion Neurophysiologic measures suggest that active but not sham sTMS engages brain targets, and that target engagement is related to treatment outcome.

The present study examined the effect of mindfulness meditation on episodic memory retrieval and theta oscillations. Using a longitudinal design, subjects in the mindfulness meditation experimental group who underwent 4 weeks of mindfulness meditation training and practice were compared to a waitlist control group. During the pre-training and post-training experimental sessions, subjects completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and studied adjectives and either imagined a scene (Place Task) or judged its pleasantness (Pleasant Task). During the recognition test, subjects decided which task was performed with each word ("Old Place Task" or "Old Pleasant Task") or "New." FFMQ scores and source discrimination were greater post-training than pre-training in the mindfulness meditation experimental group. Electroencephalography (EEG) results revealed that for the mindfulness meditation experimental group theta power was greater post-training than pre-training in right frontal and left parietal channels and changes in FFMQ scores correlated with changes in theta oscillations in right frontal channels (n = 20). The present results suggest that mindfulness meditation increases source memory retrieval and theta oscillations in a fronto-parietal network.

Many previous studies have focused on changes in brain morphology and deficits in learning behavior. However, effects of long-term exposure to stress hormones on electrical brain signaling and sleep-wake patterns have remained largely unexplored. This study aimed to monitor electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns induced by prolonged dexamethasone exposure. Adult male Wistar rats implanted with electrodes on the skull over the frontal and parietal cortices were intraperitoneally injected with either saline or dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) once daily for 21 consecutive days. Longitudinal EEG recording was performed on day 6, 11, 16 and 21. Fast Fourier transform was used for frequency power analysis. One-way ANOVA revealed significant increases in parietal EEG power of slow frequencies (delta, theta and alpha) particularly, with the dominant theta activity seen as early as day 11 of dexamethasone treatment. Sleep-wake analysis on day 21 confirmed a significant reduction of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and increased slow frequency oscillations mainly in the parietal cortex during the awake period. The number of high-voltage spindles (HVSs) (6-10 Hz EEG oscillation) was significantly increased during awake and slow wave sleep (SWS) periods following dexamethasone treatment. These findings demonstrated that distinct frequency oscillations, sleep-wakefulness and sleep spindles may be parameters of neuropathology produced by long-term dexamethasone exposure. Early detection of these parameters might be predictive of neuropathology in long-term corticosteroid users.

J	Salyers, JB; Dong, Y; Gai, Y				Salyers, Jacob B.; Dong, Yue; Gai, Yan			Continuous Wavelet Transform for Decoding Finger Movements From Single-Channel EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; finger; sensory motor rhythms; wavelet transform; slow cortical potentials		Human body movements can be reflected in brain signals and collected noninvasively with electroencephalography (EEG). Motor-related signals include sensory motor rhythms (also known as the Mu wave) in the upper-alpha band of 8-13 Hz and slow cortical potentials (SCPs) in the low frequency range of 0.1-5 Hz. This study compares the two signals for decoding finger movements. Human subjects were asked to individually lift each of the five digits of their right hand, at the rate of one every 10 s. EEG was recorded using a bipolar montage between ipsilateral and contralateral motor cortices. Electromyograms were obtained for identifying movement onsets. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) generated significant performance with SCPs but not with Mu. Meanwhile, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was applied to SCPs or Mu to create a spectrogram for each finger, showing distinctive amplitude and phase patterns. A dprime-based weighting algorithm was used to extract time-frequency features. With a template-matching paradigm, both SCP and Mu spectrograms yielded significant classification accuracies for multiple subjects, with the highest being >50% (chance = 20%). Interestingly, the index finger was better distinguished with Mu for most of the subjects, whereas the ring finger was better distinguished with SCPs. The CWT algorithm outperformed LDA by better decoding the thumb.

The influence of reward sensitivity, heart rate dynamics and EEG-delta activity on placebo analgesia	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Behavioral approach system; Involuntariness; Tonic cold-pain; Placebo analgesia; Heart rate variability; EEG-delta activity	TOMOGRAPHY LORETA ANALYSIS; SLOW-WAVE MAGNITUDE; RATE-VARIABILITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEUROVISCERAL INTEGRATION; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; INDUCED EXPECTATIONS; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS	Personality traits have been shown to interact with environmental cues to modulate biological responses including treatment responses, and potentially having a role in the formation of placebo effects. Here we used the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory Personality Questionnaire (RST-PQ) to identify personality traits that predict placebo analgesic responding. Cardiac inter-beat (R-R) time series and electroencephalographic (EEG) band oscillations were recorded from healthy women in a cold-pain (Pain) and placebo analgesia (PA) condition. The measures of Hypnotizability, and self-reported ratings of Hypnotic Depth, Motivation, Pain Expectation, Involuntariness in PA responding, Pain and Distress intensity were obtained. Separate principal components factor analyses with varimax rotation were performed on summarized heart rate variability (HRV) measures of time, frequency, nonlinear Complexity, and EEG-band activity. Both analyses yielded a similar three-factor solution including Frequency HRV (factor-1), Complexity HRV dynamics (factor-2), and time HRV & EEG-delta activity (factor-3). Reward Interest sub-trait of the Behavioral Approach System (BAS-RI), Pain Expectation, Involuntariness in PA responding, and Hypnotic Depth were positively associated, whereas negative changes in time-HRV & EEG-delta scores were associated with Pain Reduction. Multiple mediation analyses disclosed that BAS-RI, potentially served by the dopaminergic system, through Involuntariness in PA responding can alter placebo responding to laboratory pain. Our results also show that a linear compound of HR slowing and higher EEG delta activity during PA explains a substantial proportion of the variance in placebo analgesic responses. Future studies should examine the potential role that these individual difference measures may play in patient responsiveness to treatments for clinical pain.

Auditory-frontal Channeling in alpha and beta Bands is Altered by Age-related Hearing Loss and Relates to Speech Perception in Noise	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive aging; EEG; functional connectivity; time-frequency analysis; neural oscillations; speech processing	INHIBITORY CONTROL; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; MEMORY; EEG; CORTEX; INFORMATION; RECOGNITION; MECHANISMS	Difficulty understanding speech-in-noise (SIN) is a pervasive problem faced by older adults particularly those with hearing loss. Previous studies have identified structural and functional changes in the brain that contribute to older adults' speech perception difficulties. Yet, many of these studies use neuroimaging techniques that evaluate only gross activation in isolated brain regions. Neural oscillations may provide further insight into the processes underlying SIN perception as well as the interaction between auditory cortex and prefrontal linguistic brain regions that mediate complex behaviors. We examined frequency-specific neural oscillations and functional connectivity of the EEG in older adults with and without hearing loss during an active SIN perception task. Brain-behavior correlations revealed listeners who were more resistant to the detrimental effects of noise also demonstrated greater modulation of alpha phase coherence between clean and noise-degraded speech, suggesting a desynchronization reflects release from inhibition and more flexible allocation of neural resources. Additionally, we found top-down beta connectivity between prefrontal and auditory cortices strengthened with poorer hearing thresholds despite minimal behavioral differences. This is consistent with the proposal that linguistic brain areas may be recruited to compensate for impoverished auditory inputs through increased top-down predictions to assist SIN perception. Overall, these results emphasize the importance of top-down signaling in low-frequency brain rhythms that help compensate for hearing-related declines and facilitate efficient SIN processing.

Brain function is related to perceptual processing of emotional stimuli. The current EEG study evaluated the contextual effect of the positive and negative valence emotional stimuli processing on neural oscillations by examining the neurological activities. EEG data were collected from eighteen individuals based on the international 10-20 system with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. Electrodes from the visual cortex were selected for analysis (O1, Oz and O2). Pre-processing and filtering of the raw data were done with an independent-component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency decomposition functions included in EEGLAB and ERPLAB toolbox. The ERP result confirmed that there is a difference in the reaction time between the negative and positive valences emotional stimuli when participants were experiencing different affective state. Positively valence stimuli react faster than negatively valence emotional stimuli. Three time windows, P2 (125-230ms), EPN (120-200ms) and P3 (300-650ms) were obtained and differences in amplitude and latencies were analyzed. A higher P2 amplitude and a remarkable decrease on P3 amplitude were observed at the visual cortex. The spectral power analysis shows a higher reactivity of alpha band than theta and beta bands. Nonetheless, we found a remarkable decrease in beta power for the given condition. However, beta and theta band showed a spectral change appeared laterally. As enlightened by different scholars, alpha oscillations are associated with the top-down control of visual cortex and play an important role for perception and involved in information processing during periodic cycle of the sensory information.

Previous research has shown that talking about helping, sharing and giving to others creates positive impression on others, by which individuals and governments gain public approval. So far, the value judgement of approval and disapproval in terms of prosocial or antisocial has not been investigated in the domain of neuroscience of language. Here, the influence of prosocial words towards neural adaptability for greater acceptance is examined using behavioural response mapping with electroencephalography activities of human brain. The prosocial and antisocial words employing correct and incorrect set of sentences in English are presented to participants for performing grammatical judgement task. Our results show that processing of antisocial word requires larger neurocognitive resources as compared to prosocial one, which is corroborated with our behavioural response time suggesting higher response time for antisocial than prosocial words.

This clinical need is only partially fulfilled through a subjective, and at times inconclusive, the evaluation of the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) at seizures' onset (the so-called gold standard for focus localization in epilepsy). We herein present a novel method of multivariate analysis of the EEG that appears to be very promising for an objective and robust localization of the epileptogenic focus at seizures' onset. Using the measure of generalized partial directed coherence, combined with surrogate data analysis, we first estimated from multichannel intracranial EEG the statistically significant causal interactions between brain regions at the onset of 92 clinical seizures from nine patients with temporal lobe intractable epilepsy. From the networks that were formed based on the thus derived interactions, a set of centrality metrics was estimated per network node (brain site). Brain sites located anatomically within the epileptogenic focus were shown to be associated with greater inward centrality values than non-focal brain regions at high frequencies (gamma band), and particular inward centrality metrics accurately localized the focus in all nine patients. In addition to focus localization from seizure (ictal) onset, the developed novel frameworkfor analysis of EEG could be employed to identify the changes of the focal network over time, peri-ictally and interictally, and thus shed light onto the dynamics of ictogenesis, which could then have a significant impact on automated prediction and closed-loop control of seizures by neuromodulation.

We investigated hand open, palmar grasp, lateral grasp, pronation, and supination in 10 persons with cervical SCI. Discriminative movement information was provided by the time-domain of low-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Based on these signals, we obtained a maximum average classification accuracy of 45% (chance level was 20%) with respect to the five investigated classes. Pattern analysis indicates central motor areas as the origin of the discriminative signals. Furthermore, we introduce a proof-of-concept to classify movement attempts online in a closed loop, and tested it on a person with cervical SCI. We achieved here a modest classification performance of 68.4% with respect to palmar grasp vs hand open (chance level 50%).

Background: Pretask electroencephalography (EEG) information and Stroop effect are known to influence task engagement independently. However, neural mechanisms of pretask resting absolute alpha (PRAA) and pretask resting alpha frontal asymmetry (PRAFA) in influencing SA-task which is undergoing Stroop effect is still not understood. Method: The study involved pretask resting EEG measurements from 18 healthy individuals followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition during SA-task. To understand the effect of pretask alpha information and Stroop effect on SA, a robust correlation between mean reaction time, SA Index, PRAA, and PRAFA were assessed. Furthermore, neural underpinnings of PRAA, PRAFA in SA-task, and functional connectivity were analyzed through the EEG-informed fMRI approach. Results: Significant robust correlation of reaction time was observed with SA Index (Pearson: r = .50, pcorr = .05) and PRAFA (Pearson: r = .63; pcorr = .01), respectively. Similarly, SA Index significantly correlated with PRAFA (Pearson: r = .56, pcorr = .01; Spearman: r = .61, pcorr = .007), and PRAA (Pearson: r = .59, pcorr = .005; Spearman: r = .59, pcorr = .002). Neural underpinnings of SA-task revealed regions involved in visual-processing and higher-order cognition. PRAA was primarily underpinned at frontal-temporal areas and functionally connected to SA-task regions pertaining to the emotional regulation. PRAFA has correlated with limbic and parietal regions, which are involved in integration of visual, emotion, and memory information of SA-task. Conclusion: The results suggest a strong association of reaction time with SA-task and PRAFA and strongly support the hypothesis that PRAFA, PRAA, and associated neural mechanisms significantly influence the outcome of SA-task. Application: It is beneficial to study the effect of pretask resting information on SA-task to improve SA.

Time-time analysis of electroencephalogram signals for epileptic seizure detection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						short time Fourier transform; STFT; Stockwell transform; ST; time-time transform; TT; electroencephalogram; EEG; time-frequency analysis; quadratic discriminant analysis; QDA	S-TRANSFORM; EEG	The detection and classification of epileptic seizures using the electroencphalogram (EEG) signals has been actively worked upon by the researchers from past few decades. This paper attempts a novel application of time-time transform for analysis of electroencephalogram time-series for epileptic seizure detection by transforming it into secondary time-limited local constituent time-series. This technique (TT-transform) of time-time representation of the EEG time series is derived from S-transform, i.e., Stockwell transform (an extension of the wavelets), a method that represents a non-stationary time series as a set of complex time-localised spectra. With the help of TT-transform, a more informative representation of the time features of EEG signals has been obtained, around a particular point on the time axis which has been seen to prove very effective in seizure detection. As the TT-transform is completely invertible, it indicates frequency filtering and signal to noise improvements in the time domain. Features obtained upon application of TT-transform on EEG time-series are classified using quadratic discriminant analysis and the correct classification rate obtained is 100%.

Body representations as indexed by oscillatory EEG activities in the context of tactile novelty processing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Theta oscillation; Alpha and beta activities; Novelty detection	STIMULUS-SPECIFIC ADAPTATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BETA RHYTHMS; MU RHYTHM; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; ALPHA	Neural oscillatory activities in different frequency bands are known to reflect different cognitive functions. The current study investigates neural oscillations involved in tactile novelty processing, in particular how physically different digits of the hand may be categorized as being more or less similar to one another. Time-frequency analyses were conducted on EEG responses recorded from a somatosensory mismatch protocol involving stimulation of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th digits. The pattern of tactile stimulation leveraged a functional category boundary between the 1st digit (thumb) and the other fingers. This functional category has been hypothesized to derive, in part, from the way that the hand is used to grasp and haptically explore objects. EEG responses to standard stimuli (the 3rd digit, probability of 80%) and two deviant stimuli (1st digit as across-boundary deviant and 5th digit as within-boundary deviant, probability of 10% each) were examined. Analyses of EEG responses examined changes in power as well as phase information. Deviant tactile stimuli evoked significantly greater theta event-related synchronization and greater phase-locking values compared to the corresponding control stimuli. The increase in theta power evoked by the contrast of the 3rd digit and the 1st digit was significantly larger than for the contrast between the 3rd and 5th digits. Desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands was greater for deviant than control stimuli, which may reflect increased local cortical excitation to novel stimuli, modulated by top-down feedback processes as part of a hierarchical novelty detection mechanism. The results are discussed in the context of the growing literature on neural processes involved in the generation and maintenance of body representations.

Several analysis methods have been deployed to recognize the non-stationary multicomponent content in relation with seizures within EEG signals. In this paper, we analyzed CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database signals by high-resolution quadratic time-frequency distributions, namely; the Spectrogram (SP), the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD), and the Choi-Williams Distribution (CWD) in a comparison viewpoint. We accomplished this study to evaluate the performance of each method towards detecting seizure within EEG signals. We used the time-frequency extended Renyi Entropy (RE) as a performance metric towards energy distribution complexity Within the time-frequency plane. We calculated this parameter over frequency bandwidths of Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma brainwaves for the Quadratic Time-Frequency Distributions (QTFDs) of normal and abnormal EEG signals.

We verified whether increases in endurance performance after caffeine ingestion occurred together with changes in primary motor cortex (MC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation, neuromuscular efficiency (NME), and electroencephalography-electromyography coherence (EEG-EMG coherence). Twelve participants performed a time-to-task failure isometric contraction at 70% of the maximal voluntary contraction after ingesting 5 mg/kg of caffeine (CAF) or placebo (PLA), in a crossover and counterbalanced design. MC (Cz) and PFC (Fp1) EEG alpha wave and vastus lateralis (VL) muscle EMG were recorded throughout the exercise. EEG-EMG coherence was calculated through the magnitude squared coherence analysis in MC EEG gamma-wave (CI > 0.0058). Moreover, NME was obtained as the force-VL EMG ratio. When compared to PLA, CAF improved the time to task failure (p = 0.003, d = 0.75), but reduced activation in MC and PFC throughout the exercise (p = 0.027, d = 1.01 and p = 0.045, d = 0.95, respectively). Neither NME (p = 0.802, d = 0.34) nor EEG-EMG coherence (p = 0.628, d = 0.21) was different between CAF and PLA. The results suggest that CAF improved muscular performance through a modified central nervous system (CNS) response rather than through alterations in peripheral muscle or central-peripheral coupling.

Pericentral mu-rhythm oscillations, might contribute to inter-trial variability. Recent studies targeting mu-activity based on real-time electroencephalography (EEG) reported an influence of mu-power and mu-phase on the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in a preselected group with strong pericentral mu-activity. Other studies that determined mu-power or mu-phase based on post-hoc trial sorting according in non-preselected individuals were largely negative. Objectives: To reassess if cortico-spinal activity is modulated by the mu-rhythm, we applied single-pulse TMS to the M1-HAND conditional on the phase of the intrinsically expressed pericentral mu-rhythm in 14 non-preselected healthy young participants. Methods: TMS was given at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees of the mu-phase. Based on the absence of effects of mu-phase or mu-power when analyzing the mean MEP amplitudes, we also computed a linear mixed effects model, which included mu-phase, mu-power, inter-stimulus interval (ISIs) as fixed effects, treating the subject factor as a random effect. Results: Mixed model analysis revealed a significant effect of mu-power and ISI, but no effect of mu-phase and no interactions. MEP amplitude scaled linearly with lower mu-power or longer ISIs, but these modulatory effects were very small relative to inter-trial MEP variability. Conclusion: Our largely negative results are in agreement with previous offline TMS-EEG studies and point to a possible influence of ISI. Future research needs to clarify under which circumstances the responsiveness of human the M1-HAND to TMS depends on the synchronicity with mu-power and mu-phase. (C) 2019 The Authors.

They co-occur with physiological processes such as saccades, movement execution, and memory formation, but are also related to pathological processes in patients with epilepsy. Localization of the seizure onset zone, and, more specifically, of the to-be resected area in patients with refractory epilepsy seems to be supported by the detection of HFOs. The visual identification of HFOs is very time consuming with approximately 8 h for 10 min and 20 channels. Therefore, automated detection of HFOs is highly warranted. So far, no software for visual marking or automated detection of HFOs meets the needs of everyday clinical practice and research. In the context of the currently available tools and for the purpose of related local HFO study activities we aimed at converging the advantages of clinical and experimental systems by designing and developing a comprehensive and extensible software framework for HFO analysis that, on the one hand, focuses on the requirements of clinical application and, on the other hand, facilitates the integration of experimental code and algorithms. The development project included the definition of use cases, specification of requirements, software design, implementation, and integration. The work comprised the engineering of component-specific requirements, component design, as well as component- and integration-tests. A functional and tested software package is the deliverable of this activity. The project MEEGIPS, a Modular EEG Investigation and Processing System for visual and automated detection of HFOs, introduces a highly user friendly software that includes five of the most prominent automated detection algorithms. Future evaluation of these, as well as implementation of further algorithms is facilitated by the modular software architecture.

Intuitive thinking (coined System 1, see Kahneman, 2011) is fast, automatic, and effortless whereas analytical thinking (coined System 2) is slow, contemplative, and effortful. We extend seminal pupillometry research examining these modes of thinking by using electroencephalography (EEG) to decipher their respective underlying neural mechanisms. We demonstrate that System 1 thinking is characterized by an increase in parietal alpha EEG power reflecting autonomic access to long-term memory and a release of attentional resources whereas System 2 thinking is characterized by an increase in frontal theta EEG power indicative of the engagement of cognitive control and working memory processes. Consider our results in terms of an example - a child may need cognitive control and working memory when contemplating a mathematics problem yet an adult can drive a car with little to no attention by drawing on easily accessed memories. Importantly, the unravelling of intuitive and analytical thinking mechanisms and their neural signatures will provide insight as to how different modes of thinking drive our everyday lives.

Electroencephalographic studies of meditative states have been conducted for nearly 50 years, but no clear consensus has emerged about the neurophysiological changes underlying the practice of meditation. EEG 8-channel registration was performed on expert and novice meditators. A spectral analysis of the signals and a spectral entropy analysis was performed. Relevant neurophysiological differences were found between expert and novice meditators in the Alpha and Theta frequency bands and the entropy levels in each signal, that allow objective evaluation of the progression of meditation. These changes are especially noticeable in the prefrontal cortex. Changes in the states of the Alpha and Theta frequency bands may be associated with increased experience in meditation practice. Spectral entropy can serve as an indicator of long-term therapy progression.

In this study, we evaluated the changes in phase and power of slow cortical activity in delta and theta bands, during a motor imagery task controlled by an SMR-based BMI system. In Experiment I, EEG of 20 right-handed healthy volunteers was recorded performing a motor-imagery task using an SMR-based BMI controlling a visual animation, and during task-free intervals. In Experiment II, 10 subjects were evaluated along five daily sessions, while BMI-controlling same visual animation, a buzzer, and a robotic hand exoskeleton. In both experiments, feedback received from the controlled device was proportional to SMR power (11-14 Hz) detected by a real-time EEG-based system. Synchronization of slow EEG frequencies along the trials was evaluated using inter-trial-phase coherence (ITPC). Results: cortical oscillations of EEG in delta and theta frequencies synchronized at the onset and at the end of both active and task-free trials; ITPC was significantly modulated by feedback sensory modality received during the tasks; and ITPC synchronization progressively increased along the training. These findings suggest that phase-locking of slow rhythms and resetting by sensory afferences might be a functionally relevant mechanism in cortical control of motor function. We propose that analysis of phase synchronization of slow cortical rhythms might also improve identification of temporal edges in BMI tasks and might help to develop physiological markers for identification of context task switching and practice-related changes in brain function, with potentially important implications for design and monitoring of motor imagery-based BMI systems, an emerging tool in neurorehabilitation of stroke.

The neuronal oscillations occur at time scales well matched to the temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG); however, to derive meaning from the electrical brain activity as measured from the scalp, it is useful to decompose the EEG signal in space and time. In this study, we elaborate on the investigations into source-based signal decomposition of EEG. Using source localization, the electrical brain signal is spatially unmixed and the neuronal dynamics from a region of interest are analyzed using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a technique aimed at detecting periodic signals. We demonstrate, first in simulations, that the EMD is more accurate when applied to the spatially unmixed signal compared to the scalp-level signal. Furthermore, on EEG data recorded simultaneously with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand area of the primary motor cortex, we observe a link between the peak to peak amplitude of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) and the phase of the decomposed localized electrical activity before TMS onset. The results thus encourage combination of source localization and EMD in the pursuit of further insight into the mechanisms of the brain with respect to the phase and frequency of the electrical oscillations and their cortical origin.

However, the relationship between the physiological status of sleep and subjective fatigue remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that the non-recovery of fatigue at wake time due to non-restorative sleep might be ascribed to changes in specific parameters of electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) in poor sleepers. Twenty healthy female shift-working nurses participated in the study. Subjective fatigue was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) at bedtime and wake time. During sleep on the night between 2 consecutive day shifts, the EEG powers at the frontal pole, HRV based on electrocardiograms, and distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature were recorded and analyzed. The results indicated that the subjects with high fatigue on the VAS at wake time exhibited (1) a decrease in deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (stageN3) sleep duration in the first sleep cycle; (2) a decrease in REM latency; (3) a decrease in ultra-slow and delta EEG powers, particularly from 30 to 65 min after sleep onset; (4) a decrease in the total power of HRV, particularly from 0 to 30 min after sleep onset; (5) an increase in the very low frequency component of HRV; and (6) a smaller increase in the distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature, than those of the subjects with low fatigue levels. The correlational and structural equation modeling analyses of these parameters suggested that an initial decrease in the total power of HRV from 0 to 30 min after sleep onset might inhibit the recovery from fatigue during sleep (i.e., increase the VAS score at wake time) via its effects on the ultra-slow and delta powers from 30 to 65 min after sleep onset, stageN3 duration in the first sleep cycle, REM latency, and distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature. These findings suggest an important role of these physiological factors in recovery from fatigue during sleep, and that interventions to modify these physiological factors might ameliorate fatigue at wake time.

The previous literature on this has been inconclusive. Due to stochastic calculation of microstates it is important to address this issue because instead of providing further insights, it might lead us to ambiguous interpretations. New Method: Here we propose a new method that allows to remove the time-frequency trade-off, which hampered previous works, using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and the AM-FM model. The method is applied to two resting-state EEG datasets. Results: First, our analysis confirmed that, indeed, when overlooking time-dependence in frequency domain, the results are inconclusive and consequently, highlighted the importance of preserving time-information in the spectral domain. Second, it is confirmed using synthetic data that the local peaks in global field potential (GFP) waveform are influenced by spectral powers present in composite signals. Based on synthetic results, it is inferred that in our dataset, an average frequency range of 10-15 Hz dominates the formation and the temporal dynamics of microstates. Third, it is shown that multiple overlapping patterns of synchronized activities described by a single meta-process in full band microstate studies can be identified using the proposed frequency-band subdivision. The results are consistent across both datasets. Conclusion: This study opens several new ventures to be explored in the future: e.g. analysis of temporally overlapping patterns described so far by single topographic patterns, which we show to be spectrally differentiable via band-wise topographic segmentation proposed in the present study.

However, traditional CMC analysis is mainly based on the coherence method that can't determine the coupling direction, whereas Granger Causality (GC) is limited in identifying linear cause-effect relationship. In this paper, a time-frequency domain copula-based GC (copula-GC) method is proposed to assess CMC characteristic. The 32-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals over brain scalp and electromyography (EMG) signals from upper limb were recorded during controlling and maintaining steady-state force output for five stroke patients and five healthy controls. Then, the time-frequency copula-GC analysis was applied to evaluate the CMC strength in both directions. Experimental results show that the CMC strength of descending direction is greater than that of ascending direction in the time domain for healthy controls. With the increase of grip strength, the bi-directional CMC strength has an increasing trend. Meanwhile, the bi-directional CMC strength of right hand is larger than that of left hand. In addition, the bi-directional CMC strength of stroke patients is lower than that of healthy controls. In the frequency domain, the strongest CMC is observed at the beta frequency band. Additionally, the CMC strength of descending direction is slightly larger than that of ascending direction in healthy controls, while the CMC strength of descending direction is lower than that of ascending direction in stroke patients. We suggest that the proposed time-frequency domain analysis approach based on copula-GC can effectively detect complex functional coupling between cortical oscillations and muscle activities, and provide a potential quantitative analysis measure for motion control and rehabilitation evaluation.

Here we used simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during sleep to assess haemodynamic brain responses related to spindles after learning. Twenty young healthy participants were scanned with EEG/fMRI during (i) a declarative memory face sequence learning task, (ii) subsequent sleep, and (iii) recall after sleep (learning night). As a control condition an identical EEG/fMRI scanning protocol was performed after participants over-learned the face sequence task to complete mastery (control night). Results demonstrated increased responses in the fusiform gyrus both during encoding before sleep and during successful recall after sleep, in the learning night compared to the control night. During sleep, a larger response in the fusiform gyrus was observed in the presence of fast spindles during the learning as compared to the control night. Our findings support a cortical reactivation during fast spindles of brain regions previously involved in declarative learning and subsequently activated during memory recall, thereby promoting the cortical consolidation of memory traces.

Tensor decomposition of TMS-induced EEG oscillations reveals data-driven profiles of antiepileptic drug effects	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; BRAIN; COMPONENTS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXCITABILITY; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; EMG	Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography is a powerful tool to probe human cortical excitability. The EEG response to TMS stimulation is altered by drugs active in the brain, with characteristic "fingerprints" obtained for drugs of known mechanisms of action. However, the extraction of specific features related to drug effects is not always straightforward as the complex TMS-EEG induced response profile is multi-dimensional. Analytical approaches can rely on a-priori assumptions within each dimension or on the implementation of cluster-based permutations which do not require preselection of specific limits but may be problematic when several experimental conditions are tested. We here propose an alternative data-driven approach based on PARAFAC tensor decomposition, which provides a parsimonious description of the main profiles underlying the multidimensional data. We validated reliability of PARAFAC on TMS-induced oscillations before extracting the features of two common anti-epileptic drugs (levetiracetam and lamotrigine) in an integrated manner. PARAFAC revealed an effect of both drugs, significantly suppressing oscillations in the alpha range in the occipital region. Further, this effect was stronger under the intake of levetiracetam. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that PARAFAC can easily disentangle the effects of subject, drug condition, frequency, time and space in TMS-induced oscillations.

Spatial neuronal synchronization and the waveform of oscillations: Implications for EEG and MEG	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							MU-RHYTHM; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; CORTEX; GENERATION; MODEL	Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and are implicated in virtually all brain functions. Although they can be described by a prominent peak in the power spectrum, their waveform is not necessarily sinusoidal and shows rather complex morphology. Both frequency and temporal descriptions of such non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations can be utilized. However, in non-invasive EEG/MEG recordings the waveform of oscillations often takes a sinusoidal shape which in turn leads to a rather oversimplified view on oscillatory processes. In this study, we show in simulations how spatial synchronization can mask non-sinusoidal features of the underlying rhythmic neuronal processes. Consequently, the degree of non-sinusoidality can serve as a measure of spatial synchronization. To confirm this empirically, we show that a mixture of EEG components is indeed associated with more sinusoidal oscillations compared to the waveform of oscillations in each constituent component. Using simulations, we also show that the spatial mixing of the non-sinusoidal neuronal signals strongly affects the amplitude ratio of the spectral harmonics constituting the waveform. Finally, our simulations show how spatial mixing can affect the strength and even the direction of the amplitude coupling between constituent neuronal harmonics at different frequencies. Validating these simulations, we also demonstrate these effects in real EEG recordings. Our findings have far reaching implications for the neurophysiological interpretation of spectral profiles, cross-frequency interactions, as well as for the unequivocal determination of oscillatory phase. Author summary The electrical activity in the human brain demonstrates oscillations of intricate complexity. Interestingly, such complex waveforms are primarily visible in invasive recordings but not so much when neuronal activity is recorded with non-invasive methods such as electroencephalography. Yet a specific waveform is informative about the postsynaptic processes which are at the core of our understanding of cortical excitability and information transfer in neuronal networks. In our study, we show with simulations and real EEG data, how temporal delays between different cortical sources can contribute to a more sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal shape of neuronal oscillations. We illustrate how, depending on the temporal delays, low- and high-frequency components of oscillations can be enhanced or attenuated to a different degree thus affecting the shape of oscillations and corresponding spectra which are often associated with specific functional consequences. We further show how this phenomenon can challenge our understanding of the link between neuronal oscillations and motor function, cognition and perception.

Finger Temperature: A Psychophysiological Assessment of the Attentional State	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; autonomic nervous activity; attention; finger temperature; oscillations	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; EEG; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; VARIABILITY; SUPPRESSION; REFLECT; FATIGUE; WARMTH	Attention is a key cognitive phenomenon that is studied to understand cognitive disorders or even to estimate workloads to prevent accidents. Usually, it is studied using brain activity, even though it has many psychophysiological correlates. In the present study, we aim to evaluate if finger temperature, as a surrogate of peripheral vasoconstriction, can be used to obtain similar and complementary information to electroencephalography (EEG) brain activity measurements. To conduct this, 34 participants were recruited and submitted to performing four tasks-one as a baseline, and three attentional tasks. These three attentional tasks measured sustained attention, resilience to distractors, and attentional resources. During the tasks, the room, forehead, tympanic, and finger temperatures were measured. Furthermore, we included a 32-channel EEG recording. Our results showed a strong monotonic association between the finger temperature and the Alpha and Beta EEG spectral bands. When predicting attentional performance, the finger temperature was complementary to the EEG spectral measurements, through the prediction of aspects of attentional performance that had not been assessed by spectral EEG activity, or through the improvement of the model's fit. We also found that during the baseline task (non-goal-oriented task), the spectral EEG activity has an inverted correlation, as compared to a goal-oriented task. Our current results suggest that the psychophysiological assessment of attention is complementary to classic EEG approach, while also having the advantage of easy implementation of analysis tools in environments of reducing control (workplaces, student classrooms).

The current study examines whether neonatal EEG is correlated with later atypical socioemotional behaviors or neurocognitive delays. Parental report developmental assessments were administered to families with children ages 24 to 36 months who had previously participated in a neonatal EEG study (N = 129). Significant associations were found between neonatal EEG (higher frequencies in the frontal polar, temporal, and parietal brain regions) and BITSEA ASD risk scores. Infants with lower EEG power in these brain areas were more likely to have higher risk of socioemotional problems. When examining sex differences, significant links were found for males but not for females. These results demonstrate some promising associations between early neural biomarkers and later risk for atypical behaviors, which may shape early neurobehavioral development and could lead to earlier identification and intervention.

The current study addressed the specific roles of alpha oscillations during memory encoding and retention, supporting the hypothesis that multiple functional mechanisms of alpha oscillations exist in parallel. Method We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 25 healthy young adults, who performed a variant of a Sternberg working memory task. A sequential list of five consonant letters was visually presented and was followed after a 2.0 s retention interval by a probe of a pair of two letters from the study list. Participants responded whether the probe pair was in same or reversed order in the list. Result Reaction time (RT) was shortest for the first letters in the list, increased with increasing serial position, and shorter for the last position. RT was substantially longer for the probe in reversed order. Time-frequency analysis of the MEG revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) of alpha oscillations during the encoding interval and an alpha power increase (ERS) during memory retention. Alpha ERD during encoding occurred at 10 Hz and ERS during retention at 12 Hz, suggesting different alpha mechanisms. Analysis of alpha coherence and alpha-gamma cross-spectral coupling, applied to MEG beamformer source activity, revealed connectivity across brain areas. Additionally, alpha-gamma coupling identified centers of local computation. The connectivity between occipital and frontotemporal areas was correlated with alpha ERS during memory retention. Cross-frequency coupling between alpha phase and gamma amplitude depicted a hierarchy of information flow from frontal to temporal and occipital brain areas. Conclusion Alpha decrease during encoding indicates an active state of visual processing, while subsequent ERS indicates inhibition of further visual input for protecting the memory, and phasic timing of temporal and occipital gamma oscillations is related to a long-range working memory networks.

Methods: All consecutive patients admitted in a tertiary cardiac arrest center between 2007 and 2016 still alive 48 h after admission with at least one EEG recorded during coma. EEG reactivity was defined as a reproducible waveform change in amplitude or frequency following standardized stimulation. Each EEG was classified based on American Clinical Neurophysiology Society nomenclatures and classified in highly malignant (including status epilepticus), malignant, or benign EEG. We assessed the predictive values of EEG reactivity and sedation effect for neurologic outcome at ICU discharge using the Cerebral Performance Category scale (with CPC 1-2 assumed as favorable outcome and CPC 3-4-5 considered as poor outcome). Results: Among 428 patients, a poor outcome was observed in 80% patients. The median time to EEG recording was 3 (1-4) days and 51% patients had a non-reactive EEG. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a non-reactive EEG to predict an unfavorable outcome was 97.1% (IC95% 93.6-98.9), increasing to 98.3% (IC9594.1-99.8) when the EEG had been performed without sedation. In multivariate analysis, a non-reactive EEG was associated with poor outcome (OR 12.6 IC95% 4.7-33.6; p 0.001). In multivariate analysis, concomitant sedation was not statistically associated with EEG nonreactivity. The PPV of a benign EEG to predict favorable outcome was 49.7% (IC95% 41.5-57.9), increasing to 66.2% (IC95% 54.3-76.8) when EEG was recorded earlier, with ongoing sedation. Conclusions: After cardiac arrest, absence of EEG reactivity was predictive of unfavorable outcome. By contrast, a benign EEG was slightly predictive of a favorable outcome. Reactivity assessment may have important implications in the neuroprognostication process after cardiac arrest and could be influenced by sedation.

It is often assumed that longer-lasting effects of TMS on brain function may be mediated by phasic interactions between TMS pulses and endogenous cortical oscillatory dynamics. The mechanisms by which TMS exerts its neuromodulatory effects, however, remain unknown. Here, we discuss evidence concerning the functional effects on synaptic plasticity of oscillatory cross-frequency coupling in cortical networks as a potential framework for understanding the neuromodulatory effects of TMS. We first discuss evidence for interactions between endogenous oscillatory brain dynamics and externally induced electromagnetic field activity. Alpha band (8-12 Hz) activities are of special interest here because of the wide application and therapeutic effectiveness of rhythmic TMS (rTMS) using a stimulus repetition frequency at or near 10 Hz. We discuss the large body of literature on alpha oscillations suggesting that alpha oscillatory cycles produce periodic inhibition or excitation of neuronal processing through phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of low-frequency oscillations with high-frequency broadband (or gamma) bursting. Such alpha-gamma coupling may reflect excitability of neuronal ensembles underlying neuroplasticity effects of TMS. We propose that TMS delivery with simultaneous EEG recording and near real-time estimation of source-resolved alpha-gamma PAC might be used to select the precise timing of TMS pulse deliveries so as to enhance the neuroplastic effects of TMS therapies.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the impact of cognitive load on sensorimotor-based attention and working memory processes during speech perception. Manipulations of set size and signal clarity were employed to alter cognitive load. Raw EEG data recorded from 42 subjects during accurate discrimination of CV syllable pairs were decomposed by Independent component analysis; identifying sensorimotor mu components from 37 subjects. Time-frequency analyses revealed event related desynchronization (ERD) across alpha and beta frequency bands during and following stimulus presentation in all conditions, reflecting working memory maintenance through covert articulatory rehearsal. No early attentional activity was observed, suggesting adaptation to tasks. However, modulation of late working memory activity was observed between degraded and non-degraded conditions. Weak and delayed alpha and beta ERD in degraded conditions were interpreted as evidence of delayed implementation of covert rehearsal due to the prolonged time necessary to extract a phonological representation from the auditory signal. Findings are interpreted within Analysis by Synthesis to characterize the multi-faceted and temporally distinct contributions of anterior sensorimotor regions to working memory in support of speech discrimination.

However, most of those applications are not adaptive to the real-time cognitive or subjectively experienced load placed on the trainee. In this paper, we explore a cognitively adaptive training system based on real-time measurement of task related alpha activity in the brain. This measurement was made by a 32-channel mobile Electroencephalography (EEG) system, and was used to adapt the task difficulty to an ideal level which challenged our participants, and thus theoretically induces the best level of performance gains as a result of training. Our system required participants to select target objects in VR and the complexity of the task adapted to the alpha activity in the brain. A total of 14 participants undertook our training and completed 20 levels of increasing complexity. Our study identified significant differences in brain activity in response to increasing levels of task complexity, but response time did not alter as a function of task difficulty. Collectively, we interpret this to indicate the brain's ability to compensate for higher task load without affecting behaviourally measured visuomotor performance.

But how confident are we that the simulation-derived high-resolution dynamics will reflect those of teams working with live patients? We have developed neurodynamic models of a neurosurgery team while they performed a peroneal nerve decompression surgery on a patient to approach this question. The models were constructed from EEG-derived measures that provided second-by-second estimates of the neurodynamic responses of the team and team members to task uncertainty. The anesthesiologist and two neurosurgeons developed peaks, often coordinated, of elevated neurodynamic organization during the patient preparation and surgery which were similar to those seen during simulation training, and which occurred near important episodes of the patient preparation and surgery. As the analyses moved down the neurodynamic hierarchy, and the simulation and live patient neurodynamics occurring during the intubation procedure were compared at progressively smaller time scales, differences emerged across scalp locations and EEG frequencies. The most significant was the pronounced suppression of gamma rhythms detected by the frontal scalp sensors during the live patient intubation which was absent in simulation trials of the intubation procedure. These results indicate that while profiles of the second-by-second neurodynamics of teams were similar in both the simulation and live patient environments, a deeper analysis revealed differences in the EEG frequencies and scalp locations of the signals responsible for those team dynamics. As measures of individual and team performance become more micro-scale and dynamic, and simulations become extended into virtual environments, these results argue for the need for parallel studies in live environments to validate the dynamics of cognition being observed.

Reduced left-lateralized pattern of event-related EEG oscillations in infants at familial risk for language and learning impairment	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Infants; Auditory processing; Language and learning impairment; EEG/ERP; Neural sources; Time-frequency analysis oscillations	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HEMISPHERIC-SPECIALIZATION; CEREBRAL LATERALIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; 2-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; GENETIC INFLUENCES	The ability to rapidly discriminate successive auditory stimuli within tens-of-milliseconds is crucial for speech and language development, particularly in the first year of life. This skill, called Rapid Auditory Processing (RAP), is altered in infants at familial risk for language and learning impairment (LLI) and is a robust predictor of later language outcomes. In the present study, we investigate the neural substrates of RAP, i.e., the underlying neural oscillatory patterns, in a group of Italian 6-month-old infants at risk for LLI (FH + , n = 24), compared to control infants with no known family history of LLI (FH - , n = 32). Brain responses to rapid changes in fundamental frequency and duration were recorded via high-density electroencephalogram during a non-speech double oddball paradigm. Sources of event-related potential generators were localized to right and left auditory regions in both FH + and FH - groups. Time-frequency analyses showed variations in both theta (theta) and gamma (gamma) ranges across groups. Our results showed that overall RAP stimuli elicited a more left-lateralized pattern of oscillations in FH - infants, whereas FH + infants demonstrated a more right-lateralized pattern, in both the theta and gamma frequency bands. Interestingly, FH + infants showed reduced early left gamma power (starting at 50 ms after stimulus onset) during deviant discrimination. Perturbed oscillatory dynamics may well constitute a candidate neural mechanism to explain group differences in RAP. Additional group differences in source location suggest that anatomical variations may underlie differences in oscillatory activity. Regarding the predictive value of early oscillatory measures, we found that the amplitude of the source response and the magnitude of oscillatory power and phase synchrony were predictive of expressive vocabulary at 20 months of age. These results further our understanding of the interplay among neural mechanisms that support typical and atypical rapid auditory processing in infancy.

Neurophysiological measures by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) could increase the accuracy of predicting sensorimotor upper limb recovery. New method: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current evidence for EEG/MEG-based measures to index neural activity after stroke and the relationship between abnormal neural activity and sensorimotor upper limb impairment. Relevant papers from databases EMBASE, CINHAL, MEDLINE and pubMED were identified. Methodological quality of selected studies was assessed with the Modified Downs and Black form. Data collected was reported descriptively. Results: Seventeen papers were included; 13 used EEG and 4 used MEG applications. Findings showed that: (a) the presence of somatosensory evoked potentials in the acute stage are related to better outcome of upper limb motor impairment from 10 weeks to 6 months post-stroke; (b) an interhemispheric imbalance of cortical oscillatory signals associated with upper limb impairment; and (c) predictive models including beta oscillatory cortical signal factors with corticospinal integrity and clinical measures could enhance upper limb motor prognosis. Comparing with existing method: The combination of neurological biomarkers with clinical measures results in higher statistical power than using neurological biomarkers alone when predicting motor recovery in stroke. Conclusions: Alterations in neural activity by means of EEG and MEG are demonstrated from the early post-stroke stage onwards, and related to sensorimotor upper limb impairment. Future work exploring cortical oscillatory signals in the acute stage could provide further insight about prediction of upper limb sensorimotor recovery.	[Triccas, L.

Resting-state prefrontal EEG biomarkers in correlation with MMSE scores in elderly individuals	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; DEMENTIA; POWER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SYNCHRONIZATION	We investigated whether cognitive decline could be explained by resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers measured in prefrontal regions that reflect the slowing of intrinsic EEG oscillations. In an aged population dwelling in a rural community (total = 496, males = 165, females = 331), we estimated the global cognitive decline using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and measured resting-state EEG parameters at the prefrontal regions of Fp1 and Fp2 in an eyes-closed state. Using a tertile split method, the subjects were classified as T3 (MMSE 28-30, N = 162), T2 (MMSE 25-27, N = 179), or T1 (MMSE <= 24, N = 155). The EEG slowing biomarkers of the median frequency, peak frequency and alpha-to-theta ratio decreased as the MMSE scores decreased from T2 to T1 for both sexes (-5.19 <= t-value <= -3.41 for males and -7.24 <= t-value <= -4.43 for females) after adjusting for age and education level. Using a double cross-validation procedure, we developed a prediction model for the MMSE scores using the EEG slowing biomarkers and demographic covariates of sex, age and education level. The maximum intraclass correlation coefficient between the MMSE scores and model-predicted values was 0.757 with RMSE = 2.685. The resting-state EEG biomarkers showed significant changes in people with early cognitive decline and correlated well with the MMSE scores. Resting-state EEG slowing measured in the prefrontal regions may be useful for the screening and follow-up of global cognitive decline in elderly individuals.

Event-related neural oscillation changes following reasoning training in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mild Cognitive Impairment; Cognitive training; EEG; Theta; Alpha; Go/NoGo	OLDER-ADULTS; INTERVENTION PROGRAMS; RESPONSE PRODUCTION; DIRECTED ATTENTION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; INHIBITION	Emerging evidence suggests cognitive training programs targeting higher-order reasoning may strengthen not only cognitive, but also neural functions in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). However, research on direct measures of training-induced neural changes, derivable from electroencephalography (EEG), is limited. The current pilot study examined effects of Gist Reasoning training (n = 16) compared to New Learning training (n = 16) in older adults with amnestic MCI on measures of event-related neural oscillations (theta and alpha band power) corresponding to Go/NoGo tasks during basic and superordinate semantic categorization. EEG data were recorded while participants performed the Go/NoGo task pre- and post-training, and power in theta and alpha frequency bands was examined. Both groups were comparable at pre-training on all measures and both groups showed greater event-related theta synchronization post-training. Furthermore, the Gist Reasoning group had enhanced event-related desynchronization in low-frequency alpha band (8-10 Hz)on response inhibition (NoGo) trials and high-frequency alpha band (11-13 Hz) on response execution (Go) trials during superordinate categorization, relative to the New Learning group. These findings suggest that Gist Reasoning training in MCI impacted neural processing linked to strategic processing of Go and NoGo trials during the more complex superordinate categorization task. Targeting higher-order top-down cognitive processing seems to better harness residual neuroplastic potential in MCI.

Brain computer interfaces (BCI) based on SSVEP have been shown to have consistent responses across most human subjects. We use this property for designing a two-state BCI switch. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to distinguish between the intentional control and the no control states of the switch. The traditional approach of using CCA for SSVEP detection uses the target frequencies only in the reference templates. This cannot be directly used to realize a BCI switch, since the templates do not incorporate the background EEG activity. To overcome this, we propose a template frequency selection method. The study is carried out on seven healthy participants. The proposed method achieves an average F1-Score of 0.95 (offline) and 0.85 (online). The mean activation time is found to be of 2.09 s (offline) and 3.01 s (online) across participants. These results indicate that the proposed system can be effectively used as a two-state BCI switch to enable control of external applications.

EEG predictors of dreaming outside of REM sleep	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						analysis; statistical methods; cognition; EEG; fMRI; memory; pain; sleep	NREM SLEEP; RECALL; BRAIN; MENTATION; DELTA; STATE; CONSCIOUSNESS; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCIES; ACTIVATION	The stream of human consciousness persists during sleep, albeit in altered form. Disconnected from external input, the mind and brain remain active, at times creating the bizarre sequences of thought and imagery that comprise "dreaming." Yet despite substantial effort toward understanding this unique state of consciousness, no reliable neurophysiological indicator of dreaming has been discovered. Here, we identified electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of dreaming using a within-subjects design to characterize the EEG preceding awakenings from sleep onset, REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and N2 (NREM Stage 2) sleep from which participants were asked to report their mental experience. During the transition into sleep, compared to periods during which participants reported thinking, emergence of dream imagery was associated with increased absolute power below 7 Hz. During later N2, dreaming conversely occurred during periods of decreased relative power below 1 Hz, accompanied by an increase in relative power above 4 Hz. No EEG predictors of dreaming were identified during REM. These observations suggest an inverted-U relationship between dreaming and the prevalence of low-frequency EEG rhythms, such that dreaming first emerges in concert with EEG slowing during the sleep-wake transition, but then disappears as high-amplitude slow oscillations come to dominate the recording during later N2 sleep.

Subjects (N = 22) were instructed to self-report perceptual fading using a button press. Relaxed wakefulness with closed eyes and viewing of a time-varying stimulus array served as control conditions. The power of parieto-occipital alpha rhythms during perceptual deprivation was midway between the eyes closed and eyes-open conditions, with a state-specific frequency acceleration. Oscillatory alpha power remained enhanced in the multimodal Ganzfeld relative to viewing time-varying signals, despite no indication of diminished brain arousal. Subjects experienced a range of perceptual phenomena while in the altered sensory environment and individuals with faster alpha oscillations self-reported a greater number of fading episodes. We suggest that alpha-band electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics signal internally oriented mentation in response to brief perceptual deprivation.

Specifically, theta (and gamma) oscillations correlate with movement, speed, distance, specific locations, and goal proximity to boundaries. In entorhinal cortex (EC), they exhibit hexadirectional modulation, which is putatively linked to grid cell activity. Understanding this mesoscopic neural code is crucial because information represented by oscillatory power and phase may complement the information content at other levels of brain organization. Mesoscopic neural oscillations help bridge the gap between single-neuron and macroscopic brain signals of spatial navigation and may provide a mechanistic basis for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to treat diseases causing spatial disorientation.

Test-retest reliability of time-frequency measures of auditory steady-state responses in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Auditory steady-state response (ASSR); Gamma; Electroencephalography (EEG); Schizophrenia; Reliability; Generalizability; Oscillations; Power; Phase angle	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; GAMMA RHYTHM; OSCILLATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; RECEPTORS; DEFICITS; NEURONS; MEG	Background: Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) paradigms have consistently demonstrated gamma band abnormalities in schizophrenia at a 40-Hz driving frequency with both electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Various time-frequency measures have been used to assess the 40-Hz ASSR, including evoked power, single trial total power, phase-locking factor (PLF), and phase-locking angle (PLA). While both EEG and MEG studies have shown power and PLF ASSR measures to exhibit excellent test-retest reliability in healthy adults, the reliability of these measures in patients with schizophrenia has not been determined. Methods: ASSRs were obtained by recording EEG data during presentation of repeated 20-Hz, 30-Hz and 40-Hz auditory click trains from nine schizophrenia patients (SZ) and nine healthy controls (HC) tested on two occasions. Similar ASSR data were collected from a separate group of 30 HC on two to three WA occasions. A subset of these HC subjects had EEG recordings during two tasks, passively listening and actively attending to click train stimuli. Evoked power, total power, PLF, and PLA were calculated following Morlet wavelet time-frequency decomposition of EEG data and test-retest generalizability (G) coefficients were calculated for each ASSR condition, time-frequency measure, and subject group. Results: G-coefficients ranged from good to excellent ( > 0.6) for most 40-Hz time-frequency measures and participant groups, whereas 20-Hz G-coefficients were much more variable. Importantly, test-retest reliability was excellent for the various 40-Hz ASSR measures in SZ, similar to reliabilities in HC. Active attention to click train stimuli modestly reduced G-coefficients in HC relative to the passive listening condition. Discussion: The excellent test-retest reliability of 40-Hz ASSR measures replicates previous EEG and MEG studies. PLA, a relatively new time-frequency measure, was shown for the first time to have excellent reliability, comparable to power and PLF measures. Excellent reliability of 40 Hz ASSR measures in SZ supports their use in clinical trials and longitudinal observational studies.

A systematic literature search with predefined search terms yielded N = 7 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed for all studies. In resting-state EEG, the beta activity was elevated in fronto-central regions in individuals with obesity and co-morbid BED. In food-cue conditions, both obese individuals with and without BED showed increased beta activity, suggesting increased awareness of food cues and a heightened attentional focus towards food stimuli. The level of beta activity was positively correlated with eating disorder psychopathology in resting and food-cue conditions. In individuals with BN, there was no evidence for altered EEG spectral power. The results indicate specific alterations in EEG-based brain activity in individuals with BED and obesity. More high-quality studies are needed to further confirm these findings and to transfer them into EEG-based interventions.

Visual Exploration of Dynamic Multichannel EEG Coherence Networks	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article						information visualization; visualization; medical imaging; visualization	EVOLUTION; TIME	Electroencephalography (EEG) coherence networks represent functional brain connectivity, and are constructed by calculating the coherence between pairs of electrode signals as a function of frequency. Visualization of such networks can provide insight into unexpected patterns of cognitive processing and help neuroscientists to understand brain mechanisms. However, visualizing dynamic EEG coherence networks is a challenge for the analysis of brain connectivity, especially when the spatial structure of the network needs to be taken into account. In this paper, we present a design and implementation of a visualization framework for such dynamic networks. First, requirements for supporting typical tasks in the context of dynamic functional connectivity network analysis were collected from neuroscience researchers. In our design, we consider groups of network nodes and their corresponding spatial location for visualizing the evolution of the dynamic coherence network. We introduce an augmented timeline-based representation to provide an overview of the evolution of functional units (FUs) and their spatial location over time. This representation can help the viewer to identify relations between functional connectivity and brain regions, as well as to identify persistent or transient functional connectivity patterns across the whole time window. In addition, we introduce the time-annotated FU map representation to facilitate comparison of the behaviour of nodes between consecutive FU maps. A colour coding is designed that helps to distinguish distinct dynamic FUs. Our implementation also supports interactive exploration. The usefulness of our visualization design was evaluated by an informal user study. The feedback we received shows that our design supports exploratory analysis tasks well. The method can serve as a first step before a complete analysis of dynamic EEG coherence networks.	[Ji, C.; van de Gronde, J. J.; Roerdink, J. B. T.

Here, we aimed to systematically and comprehensively assess the pattern of neural oscillations and connectivity characterizing the state of tonic experimental pain in humans. To this end, we applied 10-min heat pain stimuli consecutively to the right and left hand of 39 healthy participants and recorded electroencephalography. We systematically analyzed global and local measures of oscillatory brain activity, connectivity, and graph theory-based network measures during tonic pain and compared them to a nonpainful control condition. Local measures showed suppressions of oscillatory activity at alpha frequencies together with stronger connectivity at alpha and beta frequencies in sensorimotor areas during tonic pain. Furthermore, sensorimotor areas contralateral to stimulation showed significantly increased connectivity to a common area in the medial prefrontal cortex at alpha frequencies. Together, these observations indicate that the state of tonic experimental pain is associated with a sensorimotor-prefrontal network connected at alpha frequencies. These findings represent a step further toward understanding the brain mechanisms underlying long-lasting pain states in health and disease.

The devices are able to share their information for various applications including health care, security and monitoring. IOT facilitates patients to self-monitor their physiological states invariably and doctors to monitor their patients remotely. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a monitoring method to record such electrical activities of the brain using sensors. In this paper, we present an automatic age and gender prediction framework of users based on their neurosignals captured during eyes closed resting state using EEG sensor. Using EEG sensor, brain activities of 60 individuals with different age groups varying between 6 and 55 years and gender (i.e., male and female) have been recorded using a wireless EEG sensor. Discrete wavelet transform frequency decomposition has been performed for feature extraction. Next, random forest classifier has been applied for modeling the brain signals. Lastly, the accuracies have been compared with support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers. The performance of the system has been tested using user-independent approach with an accuracy of 88.33 and 96.66% in age and gender prediction, respectively. It has been analyzed that oscillations in beta and theta band waves show maximum age prediction, whereas delta rhythm leads to highest gender classification rates. The proposed method can be extended to different IOT applications in healthcare sector where age and gender information can be automatically transmitted to hospitals and clinics through Internet.

It is of clinical interest to relate the highly structured EEG data to scalar outcomes such as diagnostic status. In our motivating study, resting-state EEG is collected on both typically developing (TD) children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 2 to 12 years old. The peak alpha frequency (PAF), defined as the location of a prominent peak in the alpha frequency band of the spectral density, is an important biomarker linked to neurodevelopment and is known to shift from lower to higher frequencies as children age. To retain the most amount of information from the data, we consider the oscillations in the spectral density within the alpha band, rather than just the peak location, as a functional predictor of diagnostic status (TD vs ASD), adjusted for chronological age. A covariate-adjusted region-referenced generalized functional linear model is proposed for modeling scalar outcomes from region-referenced functional predictors, which utilizes a tensor basis formed from one-dimensional discrete and continuous bases to estimate functional effects across a discrete regional domain while simultaneously adjusting for additional nonfunctional covariates, such as age. The proposed methodology provides novel insights into differences in neural development of TD and ASD children. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is investigated through extensive simulation studies.

Coupling Between Leg Muscle Activation and EEG During Normal Walking, Intentional Stops, and Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						phase synchronization; non-linear coupling; time series analysis; EMG; EEG; Parkinson's disease; freezing of gait	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; BRAIN-HEART; SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; PROFILES	In this paper, we apply novel techniques for characterizing leg muscle activation patterns via electromyograms (EMGs) and for relating them to changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during gait experiments. Specifically, we investigate changes of leg-muscle EMG amplitudes and EMG frequencies during walking, intentional stops, and unintended freezing-of-gait (FOG) episodes. FOG is a frequent paroxysmal gait disturbance occurring in many patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). We find that EMG amplitudes and frequencies do not change significantly during FOG episodes with respect to walking, while drastic changes occur during intentional stops. Phase synchronization between EMG signals is most pronounced during walking in controls and reduced in PD patients. By analyzing cross-correlations between changes in EMG patterns and brain-wave amplitudes (from EEGs), we find an increase in EEG-EMG coupling at the beginning of stop and FOG episodes. Our results may help to better understand the enigmatic pathophysiology of FOG, to differentiate between FOG events and other gait disturbances, and ultimately to improve diagnostic procedures for patients suffering from PD.

However, the activity generated by the BCI makes measurements for objective fatigue evaluation very difficult, and the situation is further complicated due to different movement artefacts. The BCI performance could be increased if an online method existed to measure the fatigue objectively and accurately. While BCI-users are moving, a novel automatic online artefact removal technique is used to filter out these movement artefacts. The effects of this filter on BCI performance and mainly on peak frequency detection during BCI use were investigated in this paper. A successful peak alpha frequency measurement can lead to more accurately determining objective user fatigue. Fifteen subjects performed various imaginary and actual movements in separate tasks, while fourteen electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes were used. Afterwards, a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI speller was used, and the users were instructed to perform various movements. An offline curve fitting method was used for alpha peak detection to assess the effect of the artefact filtering. Peak detection was improved by the filter, by finding 10.91% and 9.68% more alpha peaks during simple EEG recordings and BCI use, respectively. As expected, BCI performance deteriorated from movements, and also from artefact removal. Average information transfer rates (ITRs) were 20.27 bit/min, 16.96 bit/min, and 14.14 bit/min for the (1) movement-free, (2) the moving and unfiltered, and (3) the moving and filtered scenarios, respectively.

Empirical Frequency Band Analysis of Nonstationary Time Series	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Frequency band estimation; Heart rate variability; Locally stationary; Spectrum analysis	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; MODE DECOMPOSITION; EEG; SPECTRUM; MEMORY; ALPHA	The time-varying power spectrum of a time series process is a bivariate function that quantifies the magnitude of oscillations at different frequencies and times. To obtain low-dimensional, parsimonious measures from this functional parameter, applied researchers consider collapsed measures of power within local bands that partition the frequency space. Frequency bands commonly used in the scientific literature were historically derived, but they are not guaranteed to be optimal or justified for adequately summarizing information from a given time series process under current study. There is a dearth of methods for empirically constructing statistically optimal bands for a given signal. The goal of this article is to provide a standardized, unifying approach for deriving and analyzing customized frequency bands. A consistent, frequency-domain, iterative cumulative sum based scanning procedure is formulated to identify frequency bands that best preserve nonstationary information. A formal hypothesis testing procedure is also developed to test which, if any, frequency bands remain stationary. The proposed method is used to analyze heart rate variability of a patient during sleep and uncovers a refined partition of frequency bands that best summarize the time-varying power spectrum. for this article are available online.

Loss-of-function mutation in inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) results in abnormal synchrony in resting-state EEG	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES			English	Article						Inosotol monophosphatase; IMPA1; Electroencephalography; EEG; Oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; LAYER 2; ATTENTION; POWER; DYNAMICS; LITHIUM; NEURONS; CORTEX	BackgroundDysregulation of the inositol cycle is implicated in a wide variety of human diseases, including developmental defects and neurological diseases. A homozygous frameshift mutation in IMPA1, coding for the enzyme inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPase), has recently been associated with severe intellectual disability (ID) in a geographically isolated consanguineous family in Northeastern Brazil (Figueredo et al., 2016). However, the neurophysiologic mechanisms that mediate the IMPA1 mutation and associated ID phenotype have not been characterized. To this end, resting EEG (eyes-open and eyes-closed) was collected from the Figueredo et al. pedigree. Quantitative EEG measures, including mean power, dominant frequency and dominant frequency variability, were investigated for allelic associations using multivariate family-based association test using generalized estimating equations.ResultsWe found that the IMPA1 mutation was associated with relative decreases in frontal theta band power as well as altered alpha-band variability with no regional specificity during the eyes-open condition. For the eyes-closed condition, there was altered dominant theta frequency variability in the central and parietal regions.ConclusionsThese findings represent the first human in vivo phenotypic assessment of brain function disturbances associated with a loss-of-function IMPA1 mutation, and thus an important first step towards an understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms of intellectual disability associated with the mutation that affects this critical metabolic pathway.

Differences occur in the theta (ca. 5Hz) and high-beta frequency-ranges (ca. 20Hz) of oscillations in response to negative and positive feedback, respectively. However, alpha (ca. 10Hz) and low-beta (ca. 15Hz) oscillations have also been shown to be involved in feedback processing. We hypothesized that additional alterations might occur in these frequency ranges in BPD. Eighteen patients with BPD and twenty-two healthy controls performed a gambling task while 64-channel-EEG was recorded. Induced oscillatory responses to positive (i.e. gain) and negative (i.e. loss) feedback in the alpha and low-beta frequency range were investigated. No significant differences were found in the alpha frequency range. Regarding the low-beta frequency range a significant Group (i.e. BPD vs. healthy controls) x Valence (i.e. gain vs. loss) interaction in the time frame between 600 and 700 milliseconds after feedback was found. This effect showed a significant correlation with symptom severity (assessed with the BSL-23). The results indicate that feedback processing in BPD could be more heavily altered than previously expected, with more severe symptomatology being linked to stronger alterations in oscillatory responses to feedback in the low-beta range.

More Is More: Potential Benefits of Characterizing High-Frequency Activity Over Long Durations Commentary	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							TEMPORAL-LOBE; OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY; RIPPLES; MEMORY; TERM	The rate of interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) is a promising biomarker of the seizure onset zone, though little is known about its consistency over hours to days. Here, we test whether the highest HFO-rate channels are consistent across different 10-minute segments of electroencephalography during sleep. An automated HFO detector and blind source separation are applied to nearly 3000 total hours of data from 121 subjects, including 12 control subjects without epilepsy. Although interictal HFOs are significantly correlated with the seizure onset zone, the precise localization is consistent in only 22% of patients. The remaining patients have one intermittent source (16%), different sources varying over time (45%), or insufficient HFOs (17%). Multiple HFO networks are found in patients with both one and multiple seizure foci. These results indicate that robust HFO interpretation requires prolonged analysis in context with other clinical data, rather than isolated review of short data segments.											17	0	0	0	0	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1535-7597	1535-7511		EPILEPSY CURR	Epilepsy Curr.

Functional MRI and EEG Index Complementary Attentional Modulations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; contrast response functions; EEG; fMRI	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; CONTRAST RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DIRECTED ATTENTION; STIMULUS SELECTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; PRIORITY MAPS	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are two noninvasive methods commonly used to study neural mechanisms supporting visual attention in humans. Studies using these tools, which have complementary spatial and temporal resolutions, implicitly assume they index similar underlying neural modulations related to external stimulus and internal attentional manipulations. Accordingly, they are often used interchangeably for constraining understanding about the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on neural modulations. To test this core assumption, we simultaneously manipulated bottom-up sensory inputs by varying stimulus contrast and top-down cognitive modulations by changing the focus of spatial attention. Each of the male and female subjects participated in both fMRI and EEG sessions performing the same experimental paradigm. We found categorically different patterns of attentional modulation on fMRI activity in early visual cortex and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG (e.g., the P1 component and steady-state visually-evoked potentials): fMRI activation scaled additively with attention, whereas evoked EEG components scaled multiplicatively with attention. However, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and oscillatory EEG signals in the alpha band revealed additive attentional modulation patterns like those observed with fMRI. These results challenge prior assumptions that fMRI and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured with EEG can be interchangeably used to index the same neural mechanisms of attentional modulations at different spatiotemporal scales. Instead, fMRI measures of attentional modulations are more closely linked with later EEG components and alpha-band oscillations. Considered together, hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals can jointly constrain understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting cognition.

Long-range functional coupling predicts performance: Oscillatory EEG networks in multisensory processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Oscillations; Multisensory; EEG; Phase locking value; Phase coupling; Phase-amplitude coupling; Attention	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; TOP-DOWN; VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTION SYSTEM; WORKING-MEMORY; BETA; ALPHA	The integration of sensory signals from different modalities requires flexible interaction of remote brain areas. One candidate mechanism to establish communication in the brain is transient synchronization of oscillatory neural signals. Although there is abundant evidence for the involvement of cortical oscillations in brain functions based on the analysis of local power, assessment of the phase dynamics among spatially distributed neuronal populations and their relevance for behavior is still sparse. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between remote brain areas by analyzing high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) data obtained from human participants engaged in a visuotactile pattern matching task. We deployed an approach for purely data-driven clustering of neuronal phase coupling in source space, which allowed imaging of large-scale functional networks in space, time and frequency without defining a priori constraints. Based on the phase coupling results, we further explored how brain areas interacted across frequencies by computing phase-amplitude coupling. Several networks of interacting sources were identified with our approach, synchronizing their activity within and across the theta (similar to 5 Hz), alpha (similar to 10 Hz), and beta (similar to 20 Hz) frequency bands and involving multiple brain areas that have previously been associated with attention and motor control. We demonstrate the functional relevance of these networks by showing that phase delays - in contrast to spectral power - were predictive of task performance. The data-driven analysis approach employed in the current study allowed an unbiased examination of functional brain networks based on EEG source level connectivity data. Showcased for multisensory processing, our results provide evidence that large-scale neuronal coupling is vital to long-range communication in the human brain and relevant for the behavioral outcome in a cognitive task.

Multiple mechanisms link prestimulus neural oscillations to sensory responses	ELIFE			English	Article							CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-RESET; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EVOKED-RESPONSES; MU RHYTHM; POWER; BAND	Spontaneous fluctuations of neural activity may explain why sensory responses vary across repeated presentations of the same physical stimulus. To test this hypothesis, we recorded electroencephalography in humans during stimulation with identical visual stimuli and analyzed how prestimulus neural oscillations modulate different stages of sensory processing reflected by distinct components of the event-related potential (ERP). We found that strong prestimulus alpha- and beta-band power resulted in a suppression of early ERP components (C1 and N150) and in an amplification of late components (after 0.4 s), even after controlling for fluctuations in 1/f aperiodic signal and sleepiness. Whereas functional inhibition of sensory processing underlies the reduction of early ERP responses, we found that the modulation of non-zero-mean oscillations (baseline shift) accounted for the amplification of late responses. Distinguishing between these two mechanisms is crucial for understanding how internal brain states modulate the processing of incoming sensory information.

The EEG of 36 individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (IWMUD) and 24 normal controls (NCs) were recorded, pre-processed and source-reconstructed using standardized low-resolution tomography (sLORETA). The brain FCNs of participants were constructed and between-group differences in network topological properties were investigated using graph theoretical analysis. IWMUD showed decreased characteristic path length, increased clustering coefficient and small-world index at delta and gamma frequency bands compared to NCs. Moreover, abnormal changes in inter-regional connectivity and network hubs were observed in all the frequency bands. The results suggest that the IWMUD and NCs have distinct FCNs at all the frequency bands, particularly at the delta and gamma bands, in which deviated small-world brain topology was found in IWMUD.

However, a significant challenge to the clinical use of HFOs is due to the time-consuming procedure of visually identifying them. A new methodology is presented in this paper for the automated detection of HFOs based on their 2D time-frequency map employing the short-time energy (STE) estimation and the convolutional neural network (CNN) classification algorithm. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method are evaluated using the clinical iEEG data acquired from five patients (28.4 +/- 13.0 years) with medically intractable epilepsy. The proposed methodology presents the following significant advantages: 1) compared with the recently reported HFOs detector based on the CNN using only the 1D temporal EEG signal, the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy using the deep CNN classifier on 2D time-frequency map of HFOs, of which the evaluated sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) for identifying ripples are 88.16% and 12.58%, respectively, and the corresponding sensitivity and FDR are 93.37% and 8.1% for detecting fast ripples, respectively; 2) it is capable of automatically extracting the shared features of HFOs events of different patients and would be much robust, unlike other automated methodologies proposed in the literature where the characteristics of HFOs were extracted manually on the basis of researchers' knowledge, which, probably, is prone to observer bias; and 3) with the proposed STE estimation, all suspicious ripples and fast ripples could be initially found out and transformed into time-frequency map for subsequently CNN-based classification, rather than transforming and classifying the raw data, thus requiring a lower computational resource. In addition, the time occurrence of each transient event of the HFOs can be identified to be potentially useful for further seizure analysis. In conclusion, this automated detection of the HFOs combing the STE and the CNN could allow analyzing large amounts of data in a short time while assuring a relatively higher accuracy and, thus, would potentially serve to provide a clinically useful tool.

Method: Forty adults with ADHD with an IQ >= 120 and 40 controls were recruited. Ecological EFs were measured, and eyes-closed Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals were recorded during a resting-state condition; EEG power and correlations with impaired EFs were analyzed. Results: Compared with controls, the ADHD group showed higher scores on all clusters of EF. The ADHD group showed globally increased theta, globally decreased alpha, and increased central beta activity. In the ADHD group, central beta power was significantly related to emotional control ratings, while no such correlation was evident in the control group. Conclusion: The results suggest that resting-state beta activity might be involved in the neuropathology of emotional control in adults with ADHD with high IQ.

A well-established BCI paradigm uses signal power modulations of fast rhythmic brain activity. Such power modulations are linked to a broad variety of sensorimotor, cognitive and perceptual tasks, and feedback for the user can be provided by different sensory modalities, so we decided to investigate whether different sensory modalities of feedback might differently modulate the electroencephalography (EEG) during a BCI task. Ten healthy volunteers performed BCI motor imagery session while controlling a hand exoskeleton. Participants received feedback with different sensory modalities: visual, somatosensory (using a hand exoskeleton) or auditory. As expected, we found that cortical oscillations of EEG in beta frequencies were modulated by movements. Our main finding was that modulation of beta band in EEG was strongly increased by somatosensory feedback using the exoskeleton, a finding with important implications for design and implementation of BCI experiments.

Studies have reported different sets of brain regions changing their oxygen consumption with waxing and waning alpha oscillations. Here, we hypothesize that these dissimilar activity patterns reflect different wakefulness-dependent brain states. Methods: We recorded BOLD signal changes and electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneously in 149 subjects at rest. Based on American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria, we selected subjects exhibiting wakefulness or light sleep (N1). We identified brain regions in which BOLD signal changes correlated with (i) clinical sleep stages, (ii) alpha band power and (iii) a multispectral EEG index, respectively. Results: During light sleep, we found increased BOLD activity in parieto-occipital regions. In wakefulness compared to light sleep, we revealed BOLD signal increases in the thalamus. The multispectral EEG-index revealed hippocampal activity changes in light sleep not reported before. Conclusion: Changes in alpha oscillations reflect different brain states associated with different levels of wakefulness and thalamic activity. We can link the previously described parieto-occipital pattern to drowsiness. Additionally, in that stage, we identify hippocampal activity fluctuations. Significance: Thalamic activity varies with early changes of wakefulness, which is important to consider in resting state experiments. The EEG-indexed activation of the hippocampus during light sleep suggests that memory encoding might already take place during this early stage of sleep.

J	Shen, L; Han, B; Chen, LH; Chen, Q				Shen, Lu; Han, Biao; Chen, Lihan; Chen, Qi			Perceptual inference employs intrinsic alpha frequency to resolve perceptual ambiguity	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; APPARENT MOTION; REACTION-TIME; DEFAULT-MODE; AREA MT; PHASE	The brain uses its intrinsic dynamics to actively predict observed sensory inputs, especially under perceptual ambiguity. However, it remains unclear how this inference process is neurally implemented in biasing perception of ambiguous inputs towards the predicted percepts. The process of perceptual inference can be well illustrated by the phenomenon of bistable apparent motion in the Ternus display, in which subjective perception spontaneously alternates between element motion (EM) and group motion (GM) percepts depending on whether two consecutively presented frames are grouped over time or not. The frequency of alpha-band oscillations has long been hypothesized to gate the temporal window of perceptual grouping over time. Under this hypothesis, variation in the intrinsic alpha frequency should predict perceptual outcome of the bistable Ternus display. Moreover, we hypothesize that the perception system employs this prior knowledge on intrinsic alpha frequency to resolve perceptual ambiguity, by shifting perceptual inference towards the predicted percepts. Using electroencephalography and intracranial recordings, we showed that both between and within subjects, lower prestimulus alpha frequencies (PAFs) predicted the EM percepts since the two frames fell in the same alpha cycle and got temporally integrated, while higher PAFs predicted the GM percepts since the two frames fell in different alpha cycles. Multivariate decoding analysis between the EM percepts with lower PAFs and the GM percepts with higher PAFs further revealed a representation of the subsequently reported bistable percept in the neural signals shortly before the actual appearance of the second frame. Therefore, perceptual inference, based on variation in intrinsic PAFs, biases poststimulus neural representations by inducing preactivation of the predicted percepts. In addition, enhanced prestimulus blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and network dynamics in the frontoparietal network, together with reduced prestimulus alpha power, upon perceiving the EM percepts suggest that temporal grouping is an attention-demanding process. Author summary Our subjective perception of the external world is constantly shaped not only by sensory inputs but also by the real-time internal status of our own brain. Upon facing an ambiguous sensory input, our brain employs its intrinsic dynamics to bias perception towards the predicted percept, resolving in this manner perceptual ambiguity. However, it remains poorly understood how this process is implemented in the brain. Using electroencephalogram and functional MRI in healthy participants and intracranial recordings in epileptic patients, we show that neural rhythms in the alpha frequency (8-13 Hz)one of the predominant neural oscillations in the visual systemgate the time window for perceptual grouping: two consecutively presented frames in a constant ambiguous dynamic visual scene will be temporally integrated if they fall in the same alpha cycle but spatially integrated if they fall in different alpha cycles. Moreover, our brain employs the real-time speed of its intrinsic alpha oscillations to actively predict the most possibly observed percepts by inducing preactivation of neural representations that resemble the one evoked by the actual stimuli, even before it is presented.

Since artifacts share frequencies with brain activity, filtering is insufficient. Blind source separation, mainly through independent component analysis ( ICA), is the gold-standard procedure for the identification of artifacts in multi-dimensional recordings. However, a classification of brain and artifactual independent components ( ICs) is still required. Since ICs exhibit recognizable patterns, classification is usually performed by experts' visual inspection. This procedure is time consuming and prone to errors. Automatic ICs classification has been explored, often through complex ICs features extraction prior to classification. Relying on deep-learning ability of self-extracting the features of interest, we investigated the capabilities of convolutional neural networks ( CNNs) for off-line, automatic artifact identification through ICs without feature selection. Methods: A CNN was applied to spectrum and topography of a large dataset of few thousand samples of ICs obtained from multi-channel EEG and MEG recordings acquired during heterogeneous experimental settings and on different subjects. CNN performances, when applied to EEG, MEG, and combined EEG and MEG ICs, were explored and compared with state-of-the-art feature-based automatic classification. Results: Beyond state-of-the-art automatic classification accuracies were demonstrated through cross validation ( 92.4% EEG, 95.4% MEG, 95.6% EEG+ MEG). Conclusion: High CNN classification performances were achieved through heuristical selection of machinery hyperparameters and through the CNN self-selection of the features of interest. Significance: Considering the large data availability of multi-channel EEG and MEG recordings, CNNs may be suited for classification of ICs of multi-channel brain electrophysiological recordings.

Human brain alertness level can be detected by direct measurement of electrical activity inside the brain using EEG Signals. These signals are acquired from electrodes placed on scalp. Such signal would be usually contaminated with various artifacts like muscle movements. Therefore the noise from the raw signals acquired from electrodes is removed using suitable band pass filter. Filtered signals are further subjected to discrete wavelet transform for isolating EEG rhythms. EEG rhythms include five frequency bands namely (delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (>30 Hz). Debauches DB8 wavelet transform is used for decomposing the signal in to eight levels and lower five frequency bands are considered for the analysis. For the proposed work sleep data sets from Physionet are used for analysis.	[Nissimagoudar, P. C.; Nandi, Anilkumar, V; Gireesha, H.

The advent of wireless electroencephalography (EEG) presents a solution to this problem by allowing for neural measurement with minimal motion artefacts. In the current study, we provide the first validation of a mobile wireless EEG system for capturing the neural dynamics associated with piano performance. First, we propose a novel method for synchronously recording music performance and wireless mobile EEG. Second, we provide results of several timing tests that characterize the timing accuracy of our system. Finally, we report EEG time domain and frequency domain results from N = 40 pianists demonstrating that wireless EEG data capture the unique temporal signatures of musicians' performances with fine-grained precision and accuracy. Taken together, we demonstrate that mobile wireless EEG can be used to measure the neural dynamics of piano performance with minimal motion constraints. This opens many new possibilities for investigating the brain mechanisms underlying music performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The better the feature extraction is used, the better the results of the classification. In the other hand, there is no definitive approach for feature extraction in emotion recognition based on EEG signal. In this paper, we use nine types of time frequency domains as features, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as dimension reduction method and Back-propagation Neural Network as classifiers. This method is implemented using a database that can be accessed by the public. The results of the experiment show that time frequency domain feature extraction and back propagation can achieve 63.75 % recognition rate.

In this paper, we describe deep learning models for diagnosis/prognosis derived from a few minutes of eyes-closed resting electroencephalography data (EEG) collected at baseline from idiopathic RBD patients (n = 121) and healthy controls (HC, n = 91). A few years after the EEG acquisition (4 +/- 2 years), a subset of the RBD patients were eventually diagnosed with either PD (n = 14) or Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), while the rest remained idiopathic RBD. We describe first a simple deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with a five-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG spectrograms from idiopathic patients and healthy controls. We treat the data as in audio or image classification problems where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. For comparison, we study a simple deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model using three stacked Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) cells or gated-recurrent unit (GRU) cells-with very similar results. The performance of these networks typically reaches 80% (+/- 1%) classification accuracy in the balanced HC vs. PD-conversion classification problem. In particular, using data from the best single EEG channel, we obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 87% (+/- 1%)-while avoiding spectral feature selection. The trained classifier can also be used to generate synthetic spectrograms using the DeepDream algorithm to study what time-frequency features are relevant for classification. We find these to be bursts in the theta band together with a decrease of bursting in the alpha band in future RBD converters (i.e., converting to PD or DLB in the follow up) relative to HCs. From this first study, we conclude that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, offering physiological insights and enabling the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers.

Challenges of P300 Modulation Using Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS)	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation; EEG; ERP; ERO; P300; P3b	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT; DELTA; DETERMINANTS; LATENCY; ADHD	The P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP) is a well investigated phenomenon in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) and has been related to stimulus processing and attentional mechanisms. Event-related oscillations (ERO) represent a potential mechanism responsible for generating the ERP. In particular, oscillatory activity in the delta and theta frequency range has been associated with the generation of the P300 component. Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) is capable of modulating oscillatory brain activity in a frequency-specific manner. In this study, we aimed to modulate P300 amplitude using tACS by stimulating the individual ERO involved in the generation of the P300 component. TACS was applied precisely in time to the target P300 occurring in a visual oddball task. In order to achieve an appropriate current distribution, we designed an electrode configuration consisting of two clusters of stimulation electrodes on central-parietal locations. We could not demonstrate a group difference in P300 amplitude after applying tACS in the stimulation condition (N = 17) vs. the sham condition (N = 11). TACS condition and sham condition did not differ regarding their reaction times in response to target stimuli or their event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) at stimulation frequency. Although a significant influence of stimulation could not yet be revealed on a statistical level, we suggest that the proposed method of using tACS for modulating EROs merits further investigation. Modulation of the P300 component in the ERP could help to gain further insights in the role of EROs generating ERPs and the functional relevance of the P300 component. In this study, we propose a novel approach of applying tACS and provide advice on using tACS for the modulation of EROs.

The capacity for identifying the auditory alarms in order to take the right action in our daily life is critical. In this work, we investigate how auditory alarms affect the neural networks of human inhibition. We used a famous stop-signal or go/no-go task to measure the effect of visual stimuli and auditory alarms on the human brain. In this experiment, go-trials used visual stimulation, via a square or circle symbol, and stop trials used auditory stimulation, via an auditory alarm. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals from twelve subjects were acquired and analyzed using an advanced EEG dipole source localization method via independent component analysis (ICA) and EEG-coherence analysis. Behaviorally, the visual stimulus elicited a significantly higher accuracy rate (96.35%) than the auditory stimulus (57.07%) during inhibitory control. EEG theta and beta band power increases in the right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG) were associated with human inhibitory control. In addition, delta, theta, alpha, and beta band increases in the right cingulate gyrus (rCG) and delta band increases in both right superior temporal gyrus (rSTG) and left superior temporal gyrus (lSTG) were associated with the network changes induced by auditory alarms. We further observed that theta-alpha and beta bands between lSTG-rMFG and lSTG-rSTG pathways had higher connectivity magnitudes in the brain network when performing the visual tasks changed to receiving the auditory alarms. These findings could be useful for further understanding the human brain in realistic environments.

Ictogenesis during sEEG evaluation after acute intracranial hemorrhage	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR CASE REPORTS			English	Article						Epileptogenesis; Traumatic brain hemorrhage; Stereo-EEG	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SEIZURES; EPILEPSY	We present a unique case of a patient with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) who developed an acute posttraumatic intracranial hemorrhage during monitoring, first detected by changes on sEEC. Our case demonstrates the evolution of electrographic changes at the time of initial hemorrhage to the development of ictal activity. We conducted spectral analysis of the sEEG data to illustrate the transition from an interictal to ictal state. Initially, delta power increased in the region of acute hemorrhage, followed by sustained regional reduction in frequency variability. Our findings provide further information on the development of epileptiform activity in acute hemorrhage. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Roach, Alexandra T.

They allow to investigate the changes in functionality depending on the environment and task performance process, and also to access the intensity of the brain activity in various locations of the cortex and its dependencies. Usually, the dynamics of activation of different brain areas during the cognitive tasks are being studied by spectral analysis based on power spectral density (PSD) estimation, and coherence analysis, which are de facto standard tools in quantitative characterization of brain activity. PSD and coherence reflect the strength of oscillations and similarity of the emergence of these oscillations in the brain, respectively, while the concept of stability of brain activity over time is not well defined and less formalized. We propose to employ the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as a measure of the EEG persistence over time, and use the DFA scaling exponent as its quantitative characteristics. We applied DFA to the study of the changes in activation in brain dynamics during mental calculations and united it with PSD and coherence estimation. In the experiment, EEGs during resting state and mental serial subtraction from 36 subjects were recorded and analyzed in four frequency ranges: theta 1 (4.1-5.8 Hz), theta 2 (5.9-7.4 Hz), beta 1 (13-19.9 Hz), and beta 2 (20-25 Hz). PSD maps to access the intensity of cortex activation and coherence to quantify the connections between different brain areas were calculated, the distribution of DFA scaling exponent over the head surface was exploited to measure the time characteristics of the dynamics of brain activity. Obtained arrangements of DFA scaling exponent suggest that normal functioning of the brain is characterized by long-term temporal correlations in the cortex. Topographical distribution of the DFA scaling exponent was comparable for theta and beta frequency bands, demonstrating the largest values of DFA scaling exponent during cognitive activation. The study shows that the long-term temporal correlations evaluated by DFA can be of great interest for diagnosis of the variety of brain dysfunctions of different etiology in the future.

Methods Data from 28 OSA subjects (Apnea-Hypopnea Index with 3% desaturation and/or with an associated arousal [AHI3A] > 15/hour; AHI3A = sum of all apneas and hypopneas with 3% O-2 desaturation and/or an EEG arousal, divided by total sleep time [TST]), who underwent three full in-lab nocturnal polysomnographies (NPSGs: chronic OSA, CPAP-treated OSA, and acute OSA), and 19 healthy sleepers were assessed. Four 20-minute PVTs were performed after each NPSG along with subjective and objective assessment of sleepiness. Three EEG metrics were calculated: K-complex (KC) Density (#/minute of N2 sleep), change in slow-wave activity in 1-second envelopes surrounding KCs (SWAK), and relative frontal slow-wave activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (%SWA). Results CPAP treatment of OSA resulted in a decrease in KC Density (chronic: 3.9 2.2 vs. treated: 2.7 +/- 1.1; p < 0.01; mean +/- SD) and an increase in SWAK (chronic: 2.6 +/- 2.3 vs. treated: 4.1 +/- 2.4; p < 0.01) and %SWA (chronic: 20.9 +/- 8.8 vs. treated: 26.6 +/- 8.6; p < 0.001). Cross-sectionally, lower SWAK values were associated with higher PVT Lapses (chronic: rho = -0.55, p < 0.01; acute: rho = -0.46, p = 0.03). Longitudinally, improvement in PVT Lapses with CPAP was associated with an increase in SWAK (chronic to treated: rho = -0.48, p = 0.02; acute to treated: rho = -0.5, p = 0.03). In contrast, OSA severity or global sleep quality metrics such as arousal index, NREM, REM, or TST were inconsistently associated with PVT Lapses. Conclusion Changes in EEG slow waves, in particular SWAK, explain inter-individual differences in PVT performance better than conventional NPSG metrics, suggesting that SWAK is a night-time correlate of next-day vigilance in OSA.

However, research examining the effect of negative mental states on these health professionals' cognitive performance is sparse. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the link between negative mental states and cognitive performance in nurses (n = 53). Negative mental state data was obtained using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, brain activity was measured using electroencephalography, and finally, cognitive performance was assessed using the Cognistat and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Significant negative correlations (p < .05) were observed between anxiety and attention, and all three negative mental states and memory performance. Electroencephatographic changes indicated that increases in anxiety were significantly associated (p < .05) with decreases in gamma reactivity at fronto-central sites. The current study suggests that higher levels of negative mental states are associated with domain-specific cognitive impairments, and variations in gamma reactivity: possibly reflecting less optimal cortical functioning.

Time-Frequency-Phase Analysis for Automatic Detection of Ocular Artifact in EEG Signal using S-Transform	MACHINE INTELLIGENCE AND SIGNAL ANALYSIS	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Machine Intelligence and Signal Processing (MISP)	DEC 22-24, 2017	Indian Inst Technol Indore, Indore, INDIA		Indian Inst Technol Indore		WAVELET; ICA	Artifacts are unwanted components in the EEG signals which may affect the EEG signal reading, thereby not allowing the signal to be interpreted properly. One of the most common artifacts is the ocular artifact. This artifact arises due to the movement of the eye including eye blink. In most cases, detection of ocular artifacts in EEG signals is done by skilled professionals who are small in number. This paper proposes a new approach of automatic detection of ocular artifacts using the phase information present in the S-transform (ST) of EEG signal. S-transform of a signal provides absolutely referenced phase information of the signal in addition to time-frequency information. A time delay exists between the signals recorded by electrodes placed at different distances from the point of origin of the artifact. This time delay translates to phase delay in the frequency domain. The phase information of the EEG signal recorded from different electrodes placed in the frontal region is used to detect the artifacts which are generated near the region where the eye is located.

It is unknown which psychological processes during resting state account for this. Increased theta and reduced beta power are observed during mind wandering (MW), and MW is related to decreased connectivity in the executive control network (ECN) and increased connectivity in the default mode network (DMN). The goal of this study was to test if MW-related fluctuations in TBR covary with such functional variation in ECN and DMN connectivity and if this functional variation is related to resting-state TBR. Data were analyzed for 26 participants who performed a 40-min breath-counting task and reported the occurrence of MW episodes while EEG was measured and again during magnetic resonance imaging. Frontal TBR was higher during MW than controlled thought and this was marginally related to resting-state TBR. DMN connectivity was higher and ECN connectivity was lower during MW. Greater ECN connectivity during focus than MW was correlated to lower TBR during focus than MW. These results provide the first evidence of the neural correlates of TBR and its functional dynamics and further establish TBR's usefulness for the study of executive control, in normal and potentially abnormal psychology.

To investigate brain abnormalities in adolescents with new-onset bipolar disorder (BD) during acute hypomanic and depressive episodes using electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis and to derive a computer-based method for diagnosis of the disorder. Methods. EEG spectral power and entropy of 21 adolescents with BD (included 11 patients in the hypomanic episode and 10 patients in the depressive episode) and 18 healthy adolescents were compared. Moreover, using significant differences and K-nearest-neighbors (KNN) classifier, it was attempted to distinguish the BD adolescents from normal ones. Results. The BD adolescents had higher values of spectral power in all frequency bands, particularly in the frontocentral, mid-temporal, and right parietal regions. Also, spectral entropy had significantly increased in delta, alpha, and gamma frequency bands for BD. A high accuracy of 95.8% was achieved by all significant differences in the alpha band in discriminating adolescents with BD. The depressive state showed higher values of spectral power and entropy in low-frequency bands (delta and theta) compared to the hypomanic state. Conclusion. Based on BD symptoms, especially inattention, increased alpha power is a rational finding which is associated with thalamus dysfunction. Thus, it seems that EEG alpha oscillation is the main source of abnormality in BD. Furthermore, EEG slowing in the depressive episode is related to inhibition of electrical activity and reduced cognitive functions.

Frequency of alpha oscillation predicts individual differences in perceptual stability during binocular rivalry	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						bistable perception; cognitive dynamics; electroencephalography; peak alpha frequency; visual perception	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; PEAK FREQUENCY; EEG ALPHA; INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; DOMINANCE DURATIONS; BISTABLE PERCEPTION; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS	When ambiguous visual stimuli have multiple interpretations, human perception can alternate between them, producing perceptual multistability. There is a large variation between individuals in how long stable percepts endure, on average, between switches, but the underlying neural basis of this individual difference in perceptual dynamics remains obscure. Here, we show that in one widely studied multistable paradigm-binocular rivalry-perceptual stability in individuals is predicted by the frequency of their neural oscillations within the alpha range (7-13 Hz). Our results suggest revising models of rivalry to incorporate effects of neural oscillations on perceptual alternations, and raise the possibility that a common factor may influence dynamics in many neural processes.

A Dementia Classification Framework Using Frequency and Time-Frequency Features Based on EEG Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Alzheimer's disease; machine learning; K-nearest neighbor; signal processing	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; CRITERIA	Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60%-70% of all dementia cases, and clinical diagnosis at its early stage is extremely difficult. As several new drugs aiming to modify disease progression or alleviate symptoms are being developed, to assess their efficacy, novel robust biomarkers of brain function are urgently required. This paper aims to explore a routine to gain such biomarkers using the quantitative analysis of electroencephalography (QEEG). This paper proposes a supervised classification framework that uses EEG signals to classify healthy controls (HC) and AD participants. The framework consists of data augmentation, feature extraction, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification, quantitative evaluation, and topographic visualization. Considering the human brain either as a stationary or a dynamical system, both the frequency-based and time-frequency-based features were tested in 40 participants. The results show that: 1) the proposed method can achieve up to a 99% classification accuracy on short (4s) eyes open EEG epochs, with the KNN algorithm that has best performance when compared with alternative machine learning approaches; 2) the features extracted using the wavelet transform produced better classification performance in comparison to the features based on FFT; and 3) in the spatial domain, the temporal and parietal areas offer the best distinction between healthy controls and AD. The proposed framework can effectively classify HC and AD participants with high accuracy, meanwhile offering identification and the localization of significant QEEG features. These important findings and the proposed classification framework could be used for the development of a biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in AD.

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can modulate brain oscillations and possibly impact on behaviour. Mapping of cortical activity (prevalent oscillatory frequency and topographic scalp distribution) may provide a personalized neurotherapeutic target and guide non-invasive brain stimulation. This is a cross-over, double blinded, randomized trial. Electroencephalogram (EEG) from participants with PD referred to Specialist Clinic, University Hospital, were recorded. TACS frequency and electrode position were individually defined based on statistical comparison of EEG power spectra maps with normative data from our laboratory. Stimulation frequency was set according to the EEG band displaying higher power spectra (with beta excess on EEG map, tACS was set at 4 Hz; with theta excess, tACS was set at 30 Hz). Participants were randomized to tACS or random noise stimulation (RNS), 5 days/week for 2-weeks followed by ad hoc physical therapy. EEG, motor (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor: UPDRS III), neuropsychological (frontal, executive and memory tests) performance and mood were measured before (T-0), after (T-1) and 4-weeks after treatment (T-2). A linear model with random effects and Wilcoxon test were used to detect differences. Main results include a reduction of beta rhythm in theta-tACS vs. RNS group at T-1 over right sensorimotor area (p = .014) and left parietal area (p = .010) and at T-2 over right sensorimotor area (p = .004) and left frontal area (p = .039). Bradykinesia items improved at T-1 (p = .002) and T-2 (p = .047) compared to T-0 in the tACS group. In the tACS group the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) improved at T-2 compared with T-1 = .049). Individualized tACS in PD improves motor and cognitive performance. These changes are associated with a reduction of excessive fast EEG oscillations.

Many studies suggest such pre-service fatigue can result in poor working performance and high casualty risks among construction workers. To ensure workers are well-rested before duties, contractors initiate various pre-service fatigue screening approaches. Traditional screening highly relies on the site managers' subjective judgment and workers' physical appearances due to the lack of practical, objective, and automated fatigue assessment tools. In addition, compared with physical fatigue, mental fatigue is even more difficult to be recognized merely through observation. This research proposes a novel screening method capable of measuring workers' mental fatigue with wearable electroencephalography (EEG) equipment. Through analyzing the EEG spectral parameters, such as gravity frequency and power spectral entropy, this study implemented four assessing indicators and developed a quantitative method to assess a subject's mental fatigue level. To verify the proposed method, an in-lab fatigue test was conducted. The experiment results reported that the screening targets can be successfully identified by comparing their test performance and reaction time.

The present study aims to identify the altered EEG resting-state functional connectivity patterns of depressed patients, which can be used to test the feasibility of distinguishing individuals with depression from healthy controls. In the present study, the phase lag index was employed to construct functional connectivity matrices. An altered Kendall rank correlation coefficient was used to identify the features with high discriminative power, and several classifiers were employed to classify a total of 27 depressed patients and 28 demographically matched healthy volunteers. Permutation tests were used to evaluate classifier performance. The best classification results demonstrate that more than 92% of subjects were correctly classified by binary linear SVM through leave-one-out cross-validation for the full frequency band, and the AUC was 0.98. Our findings suggest that the depression affects brain activity in nearly the whole cortex and that changes in brain oscillation patterns in the delta, theta, and beta frequency bands are more significant than those in the alpha frequency band. The current study sheds new light on the pathological mechanism of depression and suggests that EEG resting-state functional connectivity analysis may identify potentially effective biomarkers for its clinical diagnosis.

Only a few clinical applications presently exist for the management of drug-resistant epilepsy. Epilepsy surgery can be a life-changing procedure in the subset of millions of patients who are medically intractable. Recording of seizures and localization of the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) in the subgroup of "surgical" patients, who require intracranial-EEG (icEEG) evaluations, remain to date the best available surrogate marker of the epileptogenic tissue. icEEG presents certain risks and challenges making it a frontier that will benefit from optimization. Despite the presentation of several novel biomarkers for the localization of epileptic brain regions (HFOs-spikes vs. Spikes for instance), integration of most in practices is not at the prime time as it requires a degree of knowledge about signal and computation. The clinical care remains inspired by the original practices of recording the seizures and expert visual analysis of rhythms at onset. It is becoming increasingly evident, however, that there is more to infer from the large amount of EEG data sampled at rates in the order of less than 1 ms and collected over several days of invasive EEG recordings than commonly done in practice. This opens the door for interesting areas at the intersection of neuroscience, computation, engineering and clinical care. Brain-Computer interface (BCI) has the potential of enabling the processing of a large amount of data in a short period of time and providing insights that are not possible otherwise by human expert readers. Our practices suggest that implementation of BCI and Real-Time processing of EEG data is possible and suitable for most standard clinical applications, in fact, often the performance is comparable to a highly qualified human readers with the advantage of producing the results in real-time reliably and tirelessly. This is of utmost importance in specific environments such as in the operating room (OR) among other applications. In this review, we will present the readers with potential targets for BCI in caring for patients with surgical epilepsy.

Multi-sensor EEG of 7 newborns, comprised of seizure and background epochs, are analyzed using time-space, time-frequency, power maps and multi-sensor causality techniques. The outcomes of these methods are validated by medical insights and serve as a backbone for any assumptions and as performance benchmarks for the model to be evaluated against. The results obtained with the developed model show 85.7% averaged time-frequency correlation (which is the selected measure for similarity with real EEG) with 5.9% standard deviation, and the averaged error obtained is 34.6% with 8% standard deviation. The resulting performances indicate that the proposed model provides a suitable matching fit with real EEG in terms of their probability density function, inter-sensor attenuation and translation, and multi-sensor causality. They also demonstrate the model flexibility to generate new unseen samples by utilizing user-defined parameters, making it suitable for other relevant applications.

In Demand-Selection Tasks (DST), participants tend to choose the easy option over the hard one. The neural underpinnings of this effect, however, are not well understood. The current study is an initial approximation to adapt a DST to a format that allows measuring concurrent high-density electroencephalography. We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode conflict-related neural processes associated with congruent or incongruent events in a time-frequency resolved way and determined how different frequency bands contribute to the overall decoding accuracy. The decoding analysis involved the use of Support Vector Machines, a supervised learning algorithm that provides a theoretically elegant, computationally efficient, and very effective solution for many practical pattern recognition problems. Preliminary results show significant differences in activation patterns for congruent and incongruent trials, yielding 80% of decoding accuracy 400 ms after the stimulus onset. The results of frequency bands contribution analysis suggest that context-dependent proportion of congruency effect may rely on neural processes operating in Delta and Theta-band frequencies.

Larger methods, such as coherence and Granger causality (GC), have been used to describe the frequency band characteristics in the frequency domain, but they fail to account for the inherent complexity. Considering that the transfer entropy (TE) method as an information theory has advantages in complexity and direction, we extended it and proposed a novel method named transfer spectral entropy (TSE) to explore the local frequency band characteristics between two coupling signals. To verify this, we introduced a Henon model and a neural mass model to generate the simulation signals. We then applied the proposed method to explore the FCMC by analyzing the correlation between the EEG and EMG-signals during steady-state force output. Simulation results showed that the TSE method, compared with the GC method, not only described the information interaction in the local frequency band but also restrained the "false coupling." In addition, the results also revealed that the TSE method was sensitive to coupling strength but not to the data length. Further analysis of the experimental data showed that beta1 (15-25 Hz) and beta2 (25-35 Hz) bands were prominent in the FCMC for both EEG-to-EMG and EMG-to-EEG directions. In addition, the statistical analysis of the significant area indicated that the coupling in the EEG-to-EMG direction was higher at the beta1 and beta2 bands than that in the EMG-to-EEG direction, and the coupling in the EMG-to-EEG direction was higher at the gamma1 band (35-45 Hz) than that in the opposition. The FCMC results complementarily refined the previous studies that mainly focused on the beta band (15-35 Hz). The simulation and experimental data expound the effectiveness of the TSE model to describe the information interaction in the local frequency band between two time series, and this study extends the relative studies on FCMC.

Although the relationship between neuronal oscillations in the beta frequency range (15-30 Hz) and motor behaviour is well established, the electrophysio-logical mechanisms underlying individual differences in motor learning are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the degree to which measures of resting and movement-related beta power from sensorimotor cortex account for inter-individual differences in motor learning behaviour in the young and elderly. Twenty young (18-30 years) and twenty elderly (62-77 years) healthy adults were trained on a novel wrist flexion/extension tracking task and subsequently retested at two different time points (45-60 min and 24 h after initial training). Scalp EEG was recorded during a separate simple motor task before each training and retest session. Although short-term motor learning was comparable between young and elderly individuals, there was considerable variability within groups with subsequent analysis aiming to find the predictors of this variability. As expected, performance during the training phase was the best predictor of performance at later time points. However, regression analysis revealed that movement-related beta activity significantly explained additional variance in individual performance levels 45-60 min, but not 24 h after initial training. In the context of disease, these findings suggest that measurements of beta-band activity may offer novel targets for therapeutic interventions designed to promote rehabilitative outcomes.

The aim of this study was to determine whether heart rate variability (HRV) and variability in electroencephalographic (EEG) functional connectivity in the resting state are related to cognitive flexibility. Thirty-eight right-handed students completed the CAMBIOS test, and their heart and EEG activity was recorded during 6 min in the resting state with their eyes open. We calculated correlations, partial correlations and multiple linear regressions among HRV indices, functional brain connectivity variability and CAMBIOS scores. Furthermore, the sample was divided into groups according to CAMBIOS performance, and one-way ANOVA was applied to evaluate group differences. Our results show direct and inverse correlations among cognitive flexibility, connectivity (positive and negative task networks) and heartbeat variability. Partial correlations and multiple linear regressions suggest that the relation between HRV and CAMBIOS performance is mediated by neuronal oscillations. ANOVA confirms that HRV and variability in functional brain connectivity is related to cognitive performance. In conclusion, the levels of brain signal variability might predict cognitive flexibility in a cognitive task, while HRV might predict cognitive flexibility only when it is mediated by neuronal oscillations.

The authors investigate two similar CNNs: a single-input CNN with a form of 2-dimensional input from short time Fourier transform (STFT) combining time, frequency and location information, and a multiple-input CNN with 3-dimensional input which processes the electrodes as an independent dimension. Fisher discriminant analysis-type F-score based on band pass (BP) feature and power spectra density (PSD) feature are employed respectively to select the subject-optimal frequency bands. In the experiments, typical frequency bands related to motor imagery EEG signals, subject-optimal frequency bands and extension frequency bands are employed respectively as the frequency range of the input image of CNN. The better classification performance of extension frequency bands show that CNN can extract optimal feature from frequency information automatically. The classification result also demonstrates that the proposed approach is more competitive in prediction of left/right hand motor imagery task compared with other state-of-art approaches.

Our aim in this study was to follow the impact of a unilateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) lesion in rat on the cortical and hippocampal sleep architectures and their EEG microstructures, as well as the cortico-hippocampal synchronizations of EEG oscillations, and the SS and high voltage sleep spindle (HVS) dynamics during NREM and REM sleep. We performed unilateral SNpc lesions using two different concentrations/volumes of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 12 mu g/1 mu l or 12 mu g/2 mu l). Whereas the unilateral dopaminergic neuronal loss >50% throughout the overall SNpc rostro-caudal dimension prolonged the Wake state, with no change in the NREM or REM duration, there was a long-lasting theta amplitude augmentation across all sleep states in the motor cortex (MCx), but also in the CA1 hippocampus (Hipp) during both Wake and REM sleep. We demonstrate that SS are the hallmarks of NREM sleep, but that they also occur during REM sleep in the MCx and Hipp of the control rats. Whereas SS are always longer in REM vs. NREM sleep in both structures, they are consistently slower in the Hipp. The dopaminergic neuronal loss increased the density of SS in both structures and shortened them in the MCx during NREM sleep, without changing the intrinsic frequency. Conversely, HVS are the hallmarks of REM sleep in the control rats, slower in the Hipp vs. MCx, and the dopaminergic neuronal loss increased their density in the MCx, but shortened them more consistently in the Hipp during REM sleep. In addition, there was an altered synchronization of the EEG oscillations between the MCx and Hipp in different sleep states, particularly the theta and sigma coherences during REM sleep. We provide novel evidence for the importance of the SNpc dopaminergic innervation in sleep regulation, theta rhythm generation, and SS/HVS dynamics control. We suggest the importance of the underlying REM sleep regulatory substrate to HVS generation and duration and to the cortico-hippocampal synchronizations of EEG oscillations in hemiparkinsonian rats.

The field of human-robot interactions (HRI) will benefit from a broadened understanding of brain emotional encoding and thus, improve the capabilities of robots to fully engage with the user's emotional reactions. In this paper, a methodology for real-time emotion estimation aimed for its use in the field of HRI is proposed. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the lateralization produced in brain oscillations during emotional stimuli and the use of meaningful features related to intrinsic EEG patterns. In the validation procedure, both DEAP and SEED databases have been used.

According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people worldwide suffer from this disorder, being the leading cause of disability. The advancements in electroencephalography (EEG) make it a powerful tool for non-invasive studies on neurological disorders including depression. Scientific community has used EEG to better understand the mechanisms behind the disorder and find biomarkers, which are characteristics that can be precisely measured in order to identify or diagnose a disorder. This work presents a systematic mapping of recent studies ranging from 2014 to the end of 2018 which use non-invasive EEG to detect depression biomarkers. Our research has analyzed more than 250 articles and we discuss the findings and promising biomarkers of 42 studies, finding that the depressed brain appear to have a more random network structure, also finding promising features for diagnostic, such as, gamma band and signal complexity; among others which may detect specific depression-related symptoms such as suicidal ideation.

Sleep stages classification from EEG signal based on Stockwell transform	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION; SEIZURE DETECTION; BETA-FREQUENCY; FEATURES; GAMMA; IMAGE; ENTROPY; DOMAIN; POWER	Sleep has great effect on physical health and quality of life. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is used in studying sleep process and recently, time-frequency transforms are increasingly utilised in EEG signal analysis. This study proposes an efficient method for sleep stages classification based on a time-frequency transform, namely Stockwell transform. In the introduced method, at first, the Stockwell transform is used to map each 30 s epoch of EEG signal into the time-frequency domains, which results in a complex-valued matrix. Then, the frequency domain is divided into different non-overlapping segments, leading to several matrices. After that, entropy features are extracted from the obtained matrices. In order to determine the sleep stage of each epoch, the computed features are applied to classifier. Support vector machine, weighted K-nearest neighbour, and ensemble bagged tree classifiers are considered. The Pz-Oz and Fpz-Cz channels of EEG signal from Sleep-EDF data set and C3-A2 channel from ISRUC-Sleep data set are used in this research. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the recently introduced methods.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis is an important method for studying epilepsy. The nonlinear dynamics of epileptic EEG signals can be used as biomarkers for the prediction and diagnosis of epilepsy. However, how ultrasound modulates the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of EEG signals in TLE is still unclear. Here, we used low-intensity pulsed ultrasound to stimulate the CA3 region of kainite (KA)-induced TLE mice, simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFP) in the stimulation regions before, during, and after LIPUS. The nonlinear characteristics, including complexity, approximate entropy of different frequency bands, and Lyapunov exponent of the LFP, were calculated. Compared with the control group, the experimental group showed that LIPUS inhibited TLE seizure and the complexity, approximate entropy of the delta (0.5-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency bands, and Lyapunov exponent of the LFP significantly increased in response to ultrasound stimulation. The values before ultrasound stimulation were higher similar to 1.87 (complexity), similar to 1.39 (approximate entropy of delta frequency bands), similar to 1.13 (approximate entropy of theta frequency bands) and similar to 1.46 times (Lyapunov exponent) than that after ultrasound stimulation (p < 0.05). The above results demonstrated that LIPUS can alter nonlinear dynamic characteristics and provide a basis for the application of ultrasound stimulation in the treatment of epilepsy.

Frontal brain delta-beta correlation, salivary cortisol, and social anxiety in children	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Anxiety; child development; electroencephalography; shyness; social neuroscience; delta-beta correlation; salivary cortisol	EEG ASYMMETRY; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; OSCILLATIONS; STABILITY; SCREEN; TEMPERAMENT; MOTIVATION; EMOTION	Background Correlated activity of slow-wave (e.g. delta) and fast-wave (e.g. beta) frontal brain oscillations is thought to be an electrophysiological correlate of individual differences in neuroendocrine activity and anxiety in adult samples. We know, however, relatively little about the physiological and functional correlates of delta-beta coupling in children. Method We examined whether longitudinal patterns of children's basal salivary cortisol and social anxiety across two visits separated by 1 year were associated with frontal brain delta-beta correlation in children (M-age = 7.59 years, SD = 1.70). At Time 1 (T1), resting baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were collected from the children and delta and beta power was measured, and at both T1 and Time 2 (T2), basal salivary cortisol was measured, and parents reported on children's symptoms of social anxiety. Results Using latent class growth curve analysis, we found that children's salivary cortisol across visits was characterized by a high, stable class (53%), and a low, unstable class (47%), and children's social anxiety was characterized by a high, stable class (50%) and a low, stable class (50%). Using Fisher's r-to-z transformation, we found that frontal EEG delta-beta correlation was significantly stronger among children with high, stable salivary cortisol levels (compared to the low, unstable class; z = 2.11, p = .02), and among children with high, stable social anxiety levels (compared to the low, stable class; z = 1.72, p = .04). Conclusions These findings demonstrate that longitudinal patterns of neuroendocrine stress activity and social anxiety may be associated with the correlation of EEG power in slow and fast frontal brain oscillations as early as childhood.

Brain oscillations captured in electroencephalography (EEG) are thought to be disrupted as core ASD pathophysiology. We leverage longitudinal EEG power measurements from 3 to 36 months of age in infants at low- and high-risk for ASD to test how and when power distinguishes ASD risk and diagnosis by age 3-years. Power trajectories across the first year, second year, or first three years postnatally were submitted to data-driven modeling to differentiate ASD outcomes. Power dynamics during the first postnatal year best differentiate ASD diagnoses. Delta and gamma frequency power trajectories consistently distinguish infants with ASD diagnoses from others. There is also a developmental shift across timescales towards including higher-frequency power to differentiate outcomes. These findings reveal the importance of developmental timing and trajectory in understanding pathophysiology and classifying ASD outcomes.

In addition MEG has a unique sensitivity for tangential sources, resulting in a full picture of the brain activity when combined with EEG. It accurately allows to perform source imaging of focal epileptic activity and functional cortex and shows a specific high sensitivity for a source in the neocortex. In this paper the current evidence and practice for using magnetic source imaging of focal interictal and ictal epileptic activity during the presurgical evaluation of drug resistant patients is being reviewed.

Using medial temporal lobe (MTL) recordings from 96 neurosurgical patients, we show that time series models with volatility described by a multivariate stochastic latent-variable process and lagged interactions between signals in different brain regions provide new insights into the dynamics of brain function. The implied volatility inferred from our process positively correlates with high-frequency spectral activity, a signal that correlates with neuronal activity. We show that volatility features derived from our model can reliably decode memory states, and that this classifier performs as well as those using spectral features. Using the directional connections between brain regions during complex cognitive process provided by the model, we uncovered perirhinal-hippocampal desynchronization in the MTL regions that is associated with successful memory encoding.

We assessed agreement using intraclass correlation, described the band-power changes by time-frequency analysis, and correlated these measures with the rater annotations. Results: Interrater agreement on the duration of the postictal changes was moderate (0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.36-0.82). The interrater agreement for seizure termination was excellent (1.00). Median duration of the postictal interval of seizures with impaired awareness was significantly shorter than for seizures with retained awareness (p = 0.0004). Mean postictal duration was 16.4 min. Seizure duration did not predict duration of the postictal changes. We found a strong correlation of 0.8 between the median human rater and the duration of the decrease in spectral edge frequency. Conclusions: The agreement of neurophysiologists is moderate for duration of postictal changes and high for seizure termination. Rater determination of postictal duration is correlated with measures of EEG slowing. Significance: Disagreement between neurophysiologists on postictal duration need to be considered.

Recently, evidence that the global signal contains neurophysiologic information has been growing, but the global signal of electroencephalography (EEG) has never been determined. New methods: We developed a new method to obtain the EEG global signal. The EEG global signal was reconstructed by the reference electrode standardization technique and represented the outer cortical electrophysiological activity. To investigate its relationship with the global signal of resting-state fMRI, a simultaneous EEG-fMRI signal was recorded, and this was analyzed in 24 subjects. Results: We found that the global signal of resting-state fMRI showed a positive correlation with power fluctuations of the EEG global signal in the gamma band (30-45 Hz) and a negative correlation in the low-frequency band (4-20 Hz). Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with the global signal of fMRI, the global signal of EEG provides more temporal information about outer cortical neural activity. Conclusions: These results provide new evidence for the electrophysiology information of the global signal of resting-state fMRI. More importantly, due to its high correlation with the fMRI global signal, the EEG global signal may serve as a new biomarker for neurological disorders.

However, for self-paced movements, the variability of inter-trial duration limits its proper use. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a time-normalizing approach and test it on both simulated and experimental data recorded during elbow extension movements performed by a post-stroke subject. Results show that the proposed time-normalization improves both the consistency and the accuracy of time-frequency coherence calculation, detection and quantification. The proposed time-normalization overcomes a major limitation to generalization of coherence analysis and can be suggested as an essential step to perform for coherence in presence of high intra-subject variability in duration.

However, overt production produces sensory consequences that are absent during covert production. Thus, the purpose of the current study is to investigate differences in dorsal stream activity between these two production conditions across the time course of utterances. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 68 channels while 23 participants overtly (Op) and covertly (Cp) produced orthographically cued bisyllabic targets. Sensorimotor mu and auditory alpha components (from anterior and posterior aspects of the dorsal stream) were identified using independent component analysis (ICA). Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses identified changes in mu and alpha oscillatory power over time, while intercomponent phase coherence (IPC) measured anterior-posterior connectivity in the two conditions. Results showed greater beta (15-25Hz) suppression during speech planning across left and right hemisphere sensorimotor and temporal ICs for Op relative to Cp. By contrast, greater intrahemispheric beta coherence was observed for Cp compared to Op during speech planning. During execution, greater beta suppression was observed along with greater low frequency (<10Hz) power enhancement and intrahemispheric phase coherence in Op compared to Cp. The findings implicate low frequency sensorimotor and posterior temporal phase coherence in the integration of somatosensory and acoustic feedback in overt relative to covert execution. Findings are consistent with early frontal-temporal forward models involved in planning and execution with modulations depending on whether the task goal is internal or overt syllable production.

The ultimate goal would be to improve early diagnosis and to better understand seizure onset and propagation of EIMFS as compared to other early onset developmental epilepsy. Methods EEG of 7 EIMFS patients with KCNT1 mutations (115 seizures) and 17 patients with other early onset epilepsies (30 seizures) was included in this study. After detection of seizure onset and termination, spatiotemporal characteristics were quantified. Seizure propagation dynamics were analyzed using chronograms and phase coherence. Results In patients with EIMFS, seizures started and were localized predominantly in temporal and occipital areas, and evolved with a stable frequency (4-10 Hz). Inter- and intrahemispheric migrations were present in 60% of EIMFS seizures with high intraindividual reproducibility of temporospatial dynamics. Interhemispheric migrating seizures spread in 71% from temporal or occipital channels to the homologous contralateral ones, whereas intrahemispheric seizures involved mainly frontotemporal, temporal, and occipital channels. Causality links were present between ictal activities detected under different channels during migrating seizures. Finally, time delay index (based on delays between the different ictal onsets) and phase correlation index (based on coherence of ictal activities) allowed discrimination of EIMFS and non-EIMFS seizures with a specificity of 91.2% and a sensitivity of 84.4%. Significance We showed that the migrating pattern in EIMFS is not a random process, as suggested previously, and that it is a particular propagation pattern that follows the classical propagation pathways. It is notable that this study reveals specific EEG markers (time delay and phase correlation) accessible to visual evaluation, which will improve EIMFS diagnosis.

Effects of Diurnal Intermittent Fasting on Daytime Sleepiness Reflected by EEG Absolute Power	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Ramadan fasting; Fast Fourier transform; Spectral analysis; Sleep study; Circadian rhythm; Exercise	SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; THETA ACTIVITY; WAKING EEG; RAMADAN; PATTERNS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; WAKEFULNESS; CHRONOTYPE	Purpose: We hypothesized that diurnal intermittent fasting would not increase slow frequency EEG waves, which reflect increased sleepiness. Therefore, this study aimed at performing a quantitative EEG analysis of young healthy volunteers with and without diurnal intermittent fasting while controlling for potential confounders. Methods: Eight young healthy volunteers (mean age: 24.4 +/- 3.7 years) reported to the laboratory during the following five occasions: (1) adaptation, (2) 4 weeks before Ramadan while performing diurnal intermittent fasting (fasting from dawn to sunset) for 1 week (fasting outside Ramadan), (3) 1 week before Ramadan (nonfasting baseline), (4) during the second week of Ramadan while fasting (Ramadan), and (5) 2 weeks after Ramadan (recovery). Frontal, central, and occipital EEG signals were monitored four times (09: 15, 11: 15, 13: 15, and 15: 15 for 15 minutes each time) while the participants were awake to assess EEG spectral power of the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Results: During wakefulness, no difference in EEG slowing was observed between nonfasting baseline and fasting during and outside Ramadan. There were no differences in the mean absolute power of each band in any studied brain region in any of the four study periods. Moreover, there was no difference in EEG absolute powers in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands for any individual brain region during the four study periods. Conclusions: Spectral analysis of EEG power indicates that diurnal intermittent fasting does not increase sleepiness. Future larger studies are needed to confirm the current findings.

When cognitive impairment reaches a certain level, human errors occur and may even result in accidents. Previous research has shown that sensory gating is a basic mechanism in cognitive function, but only limited studies have so far reported how it is affected by sleep deprivation. This study aimed to analyze the effects of sleep deprivation on sensory gating and its cognitive and neural mechanisms. Thirty-six healthy subjects participated in our study. The resting-state, auditory P50-task electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) were performed at resting wakefulness (RW) and after 36 h of total sleep deprivation (TSD). Changes in P50 suppression before and after sleep deprivation were recorded, and the isolated effective coherence (iCoh) was employed for analyzing effective connectivity based on EEG data during the resting-state and P50 tasks. Subjects demonstrated reduced P50 suppression and prolonged PVT reaction time after TSD compared with RW. Effective connectivity analysis of resting-state EEG data showed that sleep deprivation decreased the connectivity from the right middle occipital gyrus (RMOG)/Rcuneus to left inferior/middle temporal gyrus (LITG/LMTG) and left parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus (LPH/LFG). EEG data analysis during the P50 task showed that, in addition to the aforementioned connectivity changes, the directed high-frequency effective connectivity from the left precuneus to the left superior/middle frontal gyrus (LSFG/LMFG), LITG/LMTG, LPH/LFG, and left middle occipital gyrus (LMOG)/Lcuneus increased. P50 suppression in Cz positively correlated with PVT reaction time. This study reveals that the precuneus is a key brain region in neural network correlates of sensory gating, and that changes in its effective connectivity with other regions (including LSFG/LMFG, LPH/LFG, LMOG/LCuneus, and LITG/LMTG) are important for decreasing sensory gating after TSD.

This study investigates which state of vigilance is the best to localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Thirty patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing stereo-EEG (SEEG)/sleep recording and subsequent open surgery were included; 13 patients (43.3%) had good surgical outcome (Engel class I). Sleep was scored following standard criteria. Multiple features based on the interictal EEG (interictal epileptiform discharges, high-frequency oscillations, univariate and bivariate features) were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) model to classify SEEG contacts placed in the EZ. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the mean area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) and positive predictive values (PPVs) across 10-minute sections of wake, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) stages N2 and N3, REM sleep, and their combination. Results: Highest AUCs were achieved in NREM sleep stages N2 and N3 compared to wakefulness and REM (P <.01). There was no improvement when using a combination of all four states (P >.05); the best performing features in the combined state were selected from NREM sleep. There were differences between good (Engel I) and poor (Engel II-IV) outcomes in PPV (P <.05) and AUC (P <.01) across all states. The SVM multifeature approach outperformed spikes and high-frequency oscillations (P <.01) and resulted in results similar to those of the seizure-onset zone (SOZ; P >.05). Significance: Sleep improves the localization of the EZ with best identification obtained in NREM sleep stages N2 and N3. Results based on the multifeature classification in 10 minutes of NREM sleep were not different from the results achieved by the SOZ based on 12.7 days of seizure monitoring. This finding might ultimately result in a more time-efficient intracranial presurgical investigation of focal epilepsy.

Adaptive Bayesian Time-Frequency Analysis of Multivariate Time Series	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Locally stationary process; Modified Cholesky decomposition; Nonstationary multivariate time series; Penalized splines; Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo; Spectral analysis	DEPENDENT SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; EL-NINO; DENSITY; LIKELIHOOD	This article introduces a nonparametric approach to multivariate time-varying power spectrum analysis. The procedure adaptively partitions a time series into an unknown number of approximately stationary segments, where some spectral components may remain unchanged across segments, allowing components to evolve differently over time. Local spectra within segments are fit through Whittle likelihood-based penalized spline models of modified Cholesky components, which provide flexible nonparametric estimates that preserve positive definite structures of spectral matrices. The approach is formulated in a Bayesian framework, in which the number and location of partitions are random, and relies on reversible jump Markov chain and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods that can adapt to the unknown number of segments and parameters. By averaging over the distribution of partitions, the approach can approximate both abrupt and slowly varying changes in spectral matrices. Empirical performance is evaluated in simulation studies and illustrated through analyses of electroencephalography during sleep and of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.

However, such real-life-like stimulation by videos or virtual-reality environments may serve as powerful means of creating specific cognitive or affective states and help to investigate dysfunctions in psychiatric and neurological disorders more efficiently. This study aims to develop a method to generate ERPs and EROs during watching videos. Repeated luminance changes were introduced on short video segments, while EEGs of 10 subjects were recorded. The ERP/EROs time-locked to these distortions were analyzed in time and time-frequency domains and tested for their cognitive significance through a long term memory test that included frames from the watched videos. For each subject, ERPs and EROs corresponding to video segments of recalled images with 25% shortest and 25% longest reaction times were compared. ERPs produced by transient luminance changes displayed statistically significant fluctuations both in time and time-frequency domains. Statistical analyses showed that a positivity around 450 ms, a negativity around 500 ms and delta and theta EROs correlated with memory performance. Few studies mixed video streams with simultaneous ERP/ERO experiments with discrete task-relevant or passively presented auditory or somatosensory stimuli, while the present study, by obtaining ERPs and EROs to task-irrelevant events in the same sensory modality as that of the continuous sensory input, produces minimal interference with the main focus of attention on the video stream.

The proposed method utilizes a model for multivariate modulated oscillations that is based on the presence of a joint or common frequency component among all channels of input data. We then formulate a variational optimization problem that aims to extract an ensemble of band-limited modes containing inherent multivariate modulated oscillations present in the data. The cost function to be minimized is the sum of bandwidths of all signal modes across all input data channels, which is a generic extension of the cost function used in standard VMD to multivariate data. Minimization of the resulting variational model is achieved through the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that yields an optimal set of multivariate modes in terms of narrow bandwidth and corresponding center frequencies. The proposed extension is elegant as it does not require any extra user-defined parameters for its operation i.e., it uses the same parameters as standard VMD. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through results obtained from extensive simulations involving test (synthetic) and real world multivariate data sets. Specifically, we highlight the utility of the proposed method in two real world applications which include the separation of alpha rhythms in multivariate electroencephalogram (EEG) data and the decomposition of bivariate cardiotocographic signals that consist of fetal heart rate and maternal uterine contraction (FHR-UC) as its two channels.

However, the possibility of neurovascular dissociations across physiological alterations is indicated in the literature. To examine the NVC stability across sleep-wake states, we used electroencephalography (EEG) as the index of neural activity and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as the measure of cerebrovascular response. Eight healthy adults were recruited for simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings in nocturnal sleep. We compared the cross-modality (EEG vs. fMRI) consistency of functional indices (spectral amplitude and functional connectivity) among five states of wakefulness and sleep (state effect). We also segregated the brain into three main partitions (anterior, middle and posterior) for spatial assessments (regional effect). Significant state effects were found on delta, alpha and fMRI indices and regional effects on the alpha and fMRI indices. However, the cross-state EEG changes in spectral amplitude and functional connectivity did not consistently match the changes in the fMRI indices across sleep-wake states. In spectral amplitude, the delta band peaked at the N3 stage for all brain regions, while the fMRI fluctuation amplitude peaked at the N2 stage in the central and posterior regions. In regional connectivity, the inter-hemispheric connectivity of the delta band peaked at the N3 stage for all regions, but the bilateral fMRI connectivity showed the state changes in the anterior and central regions. The cross-modality inconsistencies across sleep-wake states provided preliminary evidence that the neurovascular relationship may not change in a linear consistency during NREM sleep. Thus, caution shall be exercised when applying the NVC presumption to investigating sleep/wake transitions, even among healthy young adults.

Eight healthy volunteers participated in this study. The volunteers performed tasks inducing stress and mental fatigue for almost 4 minutes. Each experimental task consists of 72-seconds stress and fatigue inducing 1-position back, 2-position-color and 2-position-image test sessions and three evaluation sessions performed for task. During these sessions, the volunteers were assessed using EEG, Eye Tracker and Visual analogue scale (VAS). VAS was also used to evaluate perceived stress and mental fatigue before and after the N-back test. Power values of EEG signals from volunteers for different test modes were evaluated according to test scores in theta, alpha, beta, and low gamma bands. According to the obtained results, the power values in each subband of the EEG change according to the test mode and the test scores. Beta, alpha and theta frequency bands' power in the frontal cortex (AF7+AF8) increased with then back test score and difficulty level of the game. When the task gets harder, it shows that the heat map of eye tracking is spread over a wider area. The VAS scores for both mental fatigue and stress increased after the N-back test with low and high test scores. According to the graphical results obtained from EEG with subjective evaluation, stress and mental fatigue increased with N-back tests. These results help understanding of the physiological changes of stress and mental fatigue and contribute to improve new approaches to assess stress and mental fatigue.

An optimal balance between challenges and skills triggers the subjective experience of "flow," a focused motivation leading to a feeling of spontaneous joy. The present research investigates the behavioral and neural correlates of a paradigm aimed to assess the players' subjective experience during gameplay. Attentional engagement changes were assessed first at the behavioral level and in a second stage by means of EEG recordings. An auditory novelty oddball paradigm was implemented as a secondary task while subjects played in three conditions: boredom, frustration, and flow. We found higher reaction times and error rates in the flow condition. In a second stage, EEG time domain analysis revealed a significantly delayed response-locked frontocentral negative deflection during flow, likely signaling the reallocation of attentional resources. Source reconstruction analyses showed that the brain regions responsible for the genesis of this negativity were located within the medial frontal cortex. Frequency domain analyses showed a significant power increase only in the alpha band for the flow condition. Our results showed that this alpha power enhancement was correlated with faster reaction times. This suggests that frontal alpha changes recorded as maximal at the midfrontal lines during flow might be related to inhibitory top-down cognitive control processes.

A high-density EEG study of differentiation between two speeds and directions of simulated optic flow in adults and infants	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						development; EEG; ERPs; oscillation/time frequency analyses; visual processes	FUNCTIONAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; RANDOM VISUAL-MOTION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; WHITE-MATTER; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; NEURONS RESPOND; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION; MATURATION	A high-density EEG study was carried out to investigate cortical activity in response to forward and backward visual motion at two different driving speeds, simulated through optic flow. Participants were prelocomotor infants at the age of 4-5 months and infants with at least 3 weeks of crawling experience at the age of 8-11 months, and adults. Adults displayed shorter N2 latencies in response to forward as opposed to backward visual motion and differentiated significantly between low and high speeds, with shorter latencies for low speeds. Only infants at 8-11 months displayed similar latency differences between motion directions, and exclusively in response to low speed. The developmental differences in latency between infant groups are interpreted in terms of a combination of increased experience with self-produced locomotion and neurobiological development. Analyses of temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent amplitude changes) were also performed to investigate nonphase-locked changes at lower frequencies in underlying neuronal networks. TSE showed event-related desynchronization activity in response to visual motion for infants compared to adults. The poorer responses in infants are probably related to immaturity of the dorsal visual stream specialized in the processing of visual motion and could explain the observed problems in infants with differentiating high speeds of up to 50 km/h.

In this study, a novel channel projection-based canonical correlation analysis (CP-CCA) target identification method for steady-state visual evoked potential- (SSVEP-) based BCI system was proposed. The single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals of multiple trials were recorded when the subject is under the same stimulus frequency. The CCAs between single-channel EEG signals of multiple trials and sine-cosine reference signals were obtained. Then, the optimal reference signal of each channel was utilized to estimate the test EEG signal. To validate the proposed method, we acquired the training dataset with two testing conditions including the optimal time window length and the number of the trial of training data. The offline experiments conducted a comparison of the proposed method with the traditional canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and power spectrum density analysis (PSDA) method using a 5-class SSVEP dataset that was recorded from 10 subjects. Based on the training dataset, the online 3D-helicopter control experiment was carried out. The offline experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed the CCA and the PSDA methods in terms of classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR). Furthermore, the online experiments of 3-DOF helicopter control achieved an average accuracy of 87.94 +/- 5.93% with an ITR of 21.07 +/- 4.42 bit/min.

Appraisals of pain intensity from 10 other individuals were presented before the participants received identical electrical pain stimulation themselves. In reality, the presented other's pain appraisals, with either low or high in mean and variance, were generated by the experimenter, and were randomly paired with the subsequent electrical stimulation at either low or high intensity. Specifically, the mean and variance of others' pain appraisals were manipulated to induce participants' expectation and certainty to the upcoming pain. Subjective ratings of pain intensity and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to the electrical stimulation, as well as anticipatory EEG activities measured prior to the onset of electrical stimulation, were compared. Results showed that the mean and variance of others' pain appraisal modulated the subjective pain ratings and the affective-motivational P2 responses elicited by the electrical stimulation, as well as anticipatory sensorimotor alpha-oscillation measured before the onset of pain stimulation. When the mean of others' pain appraisal was low, higher variance suppressed the sensorimotor alpha-oscillations and enhanced subsequent pain perception. In contrast, when the mean was high, the higher variance enhanced sensorimotor alpha-oscillations and suppressed subsequent pain perception. These results demonstrated that others' pain appraisals can modulate both of the anticipation and perception of first-hand pain. It also suggested that the top-down modulation of others' pain appraisals on pain perception could be partially driven by the different brain states during the anticipation stage, as captured by the prestimulus sensorimotor alpha-oscillations.

This cognitive process is associated with self-referential processing. In this study, the self-referential memory (SRM) task was performed by 18 schizophrenia patients and 18 healthy controls. In the encoding stage of the SRM task, the behavioral experiment data and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded in three experimental conditions (self-referential condition, other-referential condition, and physical condition). For data analysis, the electrophysiological performance of the time-frequency distribution, phase lag index (PLI) strengths, phase synchronization connectivity, and brain-network properties were assessed in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. We found that schizophrenia patients exhibited abnormal alpha oscillation characteristics at the time of 100-300 ms poststimulus during the self-referential condition, which consisted of diminished time-frequency distributions over the prefrontal, parietal, and occipital regions; lower functional connectivity strengths of the PLI in the parietal and occipital areas; higher global efficiency and the lower characteristic path length; and nodal efficiency of local areas (increased nodal efficiency in temporal regions and decreased nodal efficiency in occipital region) for dynamic network topology properties. Furthermore, the evoked power of the alpha band during the self-referential condition was significantly correlated with the SRM bias score in the patients (r = 0.595, p = 0.009). These results provided electrophysiological evidence and supported the hypothesis that an abnormal alpha rhythm might be the principal factor of dysfunctional self-referential processing in schizophrenia patients.

Studying the full range of children with ASD introduces methodological challenges stemming from participants' difficulties tolerating the data collection process, leading to diminished EEG data retention and increased variability in participant 'state' during the recording. Quantifying state will improve data collection methods and aide in interpreting results. Objectives: Observationally quantify participant state during the EEG recording; examine its relationship to child characteristics, data retention and spectral power. Methods: Participants included 5-11 year-old children with ASD (N = 39) and age-matched TD children (N = 16). Participants were acclimated to the EEG environment using behavioral strategies. EEG was recorded while participants watched a video of bubbles. Participant 'state' was rated using a Likert scale (Perceived State Rating: PSR). Results: Participants with ASD had more elevated PSR than TD participants. Less EEG data were retained in participants with higher PSR scores, but this was not related to age or IQ. TD participants had higher alpha power compared with the ASD group. Within the ASD group, participants with high PSR had decreased frontal alpha power. Conclusions: Given supportive strategies, EEG data was collected from children with ASD across cognitive levels. Participant state influenced both EEG data retention and alpha spectral power. Alpha suppression is linked to attention and vigilance, suggesting that these participants were less 'at rest'. This highlights the importance of considering state when conducting EEG studies with challenging participants, both to increase data retention rates and to quantify the influence of state on EEG variables.

We conducted an ERP experiment with an oddball paradigm consisting of two types of deviant stimuli (easy and hard) and standard stimulus. A nonnegative Tucker tensor decomposition (NTD) was used to characterize differences in processing of stimuli using a time-frequency-spatial (multi-domain) features. We extracted the multi-domain features for a reliable representation of the underlying infant brain activity to analyze the processing of standard and deviant stimuli. The obtained results show significant differences in processing between standard and deviant stimuli and may be interpreted in terms of mismatch negativity (MMN) and acoustic change complex (ACC) evoked potentials. Moreover, these results serve as a proof-of-concept for application of tensor decomposition-based analyses for challenging infant EEG data.

We investigated if tSMS locally increased alpha power in the left or right prefrontal cortex, as the balance of left/right prefrontal alpha power (frontal alpha asymmetry) has been linked to emotional processing and mood disorders. Therefore, altering frontal alpha asymmetry with tSMS may serve as a novel treatment to psychiatric diseases. We performed a crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study to assess the effects of prefrontal tSMS on neural oscillations. Twenty-four right-handed healthy participants were recruited and received left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tSMS, right DLPFC tSMS, and sham tSMS in a randomized order. Electroencephalography data were collected before (2 min eyes-closed, 2 min eyes-open), during (10 min eyes-open), and after (2 min eyes-open) stimulation. In contrast with our hypothesis, neither left nor right tSMS locally increased frontal alpha power. However, alpha power increased in occipital cortex during left DLPFC tSMS. Right DLPFC tSMS increased post-stimulation fronto-parietal theta power, indicating possible relevance to memory and cognition. Left and right DLPFC tSMS increased post-stimulation left hemisphere beta power, indicating possible changes to motor behavior. Left DLPFC tSMS also increased post-stimulation right frontal beta power, demonstrating complex network effects that may be relevant to aggressive behavior. We concluded that DLPFC tSMS modulated the network oscillations in regions distant from the location of stimulation and that tSMS has region specific effects on neural oscillations.

J	Munia, TTK; Aviyente, S				Munia, Tamanna T.

The high temporal resolution provided by electroencephalography (EEG) enables the study of variation of oscillatory power and coupling across time. Various forms of neural synchrony across frequency bands have been suggested as the mechanism underlying neural binding. Recently, a considerable amount of work has focused on phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)- a form of cross-frequency coupling where the amplitude of a high frequency signal is modulated by the phase of low frequency oscillations. The existing methods for assessing PAC have some limitations including limited frequency resolution and sensitivity to noise, data length and sampling rate due to the inherent dependence on bandpass filtering. In this paper, we propose a new time-frequency based PAC (t-f PAC) measure that can address these issues. The proposed method relies on a complex time-frequency distribution, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID)-Rihaczek distribution, to estimate both the phase and the envelope of low and high frequency oscillations, respectively. As such, it does not rely on bandpass filtering and possesses some of the desirable properties of time-frequency distributions such as high frequency resolution. The proposed technique is first evaluated for simulated data and then applied to an EEG speeded reaction task dataset. The results illustrate that the proposed time-frequency based PAC is more robust to varying signal parameters and provides a more accurate measure of coupling strength.	[Munia, Tamanna T.

On the one hand, raw EEG signal is the timing signal of multiple electrodes, so it's impossible to extract local features like a picture using convolutional filters. On the other hand, EEG data collection is rather cumbersome, so the amount of EEG data is much smaller than some large datasets such as ImageNet, which leads to deeper network more prone to overfitting on EEG datasets. In this paper, we propose a method for processing resting state EEG signals, which uses Fourier transform to convert time-series EEG signals into frequency-domain signals, and construct a CNN model according to the characteristics of EEG signal. We applied this method to personal identification and classification of gender and age. For personal identification, we achieved an accuracy of 95.5% on our dataset, and the accuracy of gender and age classification was 62.7% and 51.2% respectively.

Using the resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) of 15 patients with ASD (aged between 5(similar to)18 years, mean age = 11.6 years, SD = 4.4 years) and 18 typical developing (TD) people (aged between 5 18 years, mean age = 8.9 years, SD = 2.4 years), we estimated the LRTCs of neuronal oscillations amplitude of 84 predefined cortical regions of interest using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) after confirming the presence of scale invariance. We found that the DFA exponents of instantaneous amplitude of beta and low-gamma oscillations were significantly attenuated in patients with ASD compared to TD participants. Moreover, the regions with attenuated DFA exponent were mainly located in social functions related cortical networks, including the default mode network (DMN), the mirror neuron system (MNS) and the salience network (SN). These findings suggest that ASD is associated with highly volatile neuronal states of electrocortical oscillations, which may be related to social and cognitive dysfunction in patients with ASD.

Electroencephalographic Signatures of the Neural Representation of Speech during Selective Attention	ENEURO			English	Article						cocktail-party problem; EEG; gamma rhythms; selective attention; speech coding; theta rhythms	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; ATTENDED SPEECH; COCKTAIL PARTY; BRAIN RHYTHMS; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; TIME; INTELLIGIBILITY	The ability to selectively attend to speech in the presence of other competing talkers is critical for everyday communication; yet the neural mechanisms facilitating this process are poorly understood. Here, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to study how a mixture of two speech streams is represented in the brain as subjects attend to one stream or the other. To characterize the speech-EEG relationships and how they are modulated by attention, we estimate the statistical association between each canonical EEG frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, low-gamma, and high-gamma) and the envelope of each of ten different frequency bands in the input speech. Consistent with previous literature, we find that low-frequency (delta and theta) bands show greater speech-EEG coherence when the speech stream is attended compared to when it is ignored. We also find that the envelope of the low-gamma band shows a similar attention effect, a result not previously reported with EEG. This is consistent with the prevailing theory that neural dynamics in the gamma range are important for attention-dependent routing of information in cortical circuits. In addition, we also find that the greatest attention-dependent increases in speech-EEG coherence are seen in the mid-frequency acoustic bands (0.5-3 kHz) of input speech and the temporal-parietal EEG sensors. Finally, we find individual differences in the following: (1) the specific set of speech-EEG associations that are the strongest, (2) the EEG and speech features that are the most informative about attentional focus, and (3) the overall magnitude of attentional enhancement of speech-EEG coherence.

While temporal context effects have been frequently studied in the laboratory, ecologically valid spatial context manipulations are difficult to implement in stationary conditions. We investigated whether the neural correlates of successful encoding (subsequent memory effect) can be captured in a real-world environment. An off-the-shelf Android smartphone was used for wireless mobile EEG acquisition and stimulus presentation. Participants encoded single words, each of which was presented at a different location on a university campus. Locations were approximately 10-12m away from each other, half of them with striking features (landmarks) nearby. We predicted landmarks would improve recall performance. After a first free recall task of verbal stimuli indoors, participants performed a subsequent recall outdoors, in which words and locations were recalled. As predicted, significantly more words presented at landmark locations as well as significantly more landmark than nonlandmark locations were recalled. ERP analysis yielded a larger posterior positive deflection during encoding for hits compared to misses in the 400-800ms interval. Likewise, time-frequency analysis revealed a significant difference during encoding for hits compared to misses in the form of stronger alpha (200-300ms) and theta (300-400ms) power increases. Our results confirm that a vibrant spatial context is beneficial in episodic memory processing and that the underlying neural correlates can be captured with unobtrusive smartphone EEG technology. The advent of mobile EEG technology promises to unveil the relevance of natural physical activity and natural environments on memory. This study is the first to use smartphone mobile EEG to capture neural correlates of successful memory formation in the real world. Participants encoded words at outdoor campus locations while on smartphone EEG recording. Crucially, our encoding setting closely resembled the day-to-day episodic memory experience, by providing a unique temporal and spatial context for every encoding stimulus, thereby overcoming the invariant spatial context of stationary laboratory settings. Further, we were able to explore the positive impact of feature-rich locations (landmarks) on episodic memory performance. The advent of mobile EEG technology promises to unveil the relevance of natural environments on memory.

Elucidating factors underlying variability in cognitive function can inform us about intellectual disability (ID) and may improve our understanding of factors associated with later cognitive decline. Increased neuronal inhibition has been posited to contribute to ID in DS. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) provides a non-invasive method for investigating excitatory/inhibitory mechanisms. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained from 36 adults with DS with no evidence of cognitive decline. Theta-alpha activity (4-13 Hz) was characterized in relation to general cognitive ability (raw Kaufmann's Brief Intelligence Test second Edition (KBIT-2) score). Higher KBIT-2 was associated with higher frontal alpha peak amplitude and higher theta-alpha band power across distributed regions. Modeling this association with DCM revealed intrinsic self-inhibition was the key network parameter underlying observed differences in 4-13 Hz power in relation to KBIT-2 and age. In particular, intrinsic self-inhibition in right V1 was negatively correlated with KBIT-2. Results suggest intrinsic self-inhibition within the alpha network is associated with individual differences in cognitive ability in adults with DS, and may provide a potential therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement.

Evidence for reinstatement has come from multiple modalities, including functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography (EEG). These EEG studies have shed light on the time course of reinstatement but have been limited to distinguishing between a few categories. The goal of this work was to use recently developed experimental and technical approaches, namely continuous report tasks and inverted encoding models, to determine which frequencies of oscillatory brain activity support the retrieval of precise spatial memories. In experiment 1, we establish that an inverted encoding model applied to multivariate alpha topography tracks the retrieval of precise spatial memories. In experiment 2, we demonstrate that the frequencies and patterns of multivariate activity at study are similar to the frequencies and patterns observed during retrieval. These findings highlight the broad potential for using encoding models to characterize long-term memory retrieval. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous EEG work has shown that category-level information observed during encoding is recapitulated during memory retrieval, but studies with this time-resolved method have not demonstrated the reinstatement of feature-specific patterns of neural activity during retrieval. Here we show that EEG alpha-band activity tracks the retrieval of spatial representations from long-term memory.

Recovering Brain Dynamics During Concurrent tACS-M/EEG: An Overview of Analysis Approaches and Their Methodological and Interpretational Pitfalls	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Review						Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); Brain oscillations; tACS-M; EEG integration; Online effects; MEG; EEG	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNALS; EEG	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is increasingly used as a tool to non-invasively modulate brain oscillations in a frequency specific manner. A growing body of neuroscience research utilizes tACS to probe causal relationships between neuronal oscillations and cognitive processes or explore its capability of restoring dysfunctional brain oscillations implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of action are yet poorly understood. Due to a massive electromagnetic artifact, overlapping with the frequency of interest, direct insights to effects during stimulation from electrophysiological signals (i.e. EEG/MEG) are methodologically challenging. In the current review, we provide an overview of analysis approaches to recover brain signals in M/EEG during tACS, detailing their underlying concepts as well as limitations and methodological and interpretational pitfalls. While different analysis strategies can achieve strong attenuation of the tACS artifact in M/EEG signals, a compete removal of it is not feasible so far. However, we argue that with a combination of careful experimental designs, robust outcome measures and appropriate control analyses, valid and important insights to online effects of tACS can be revealed, enriching our understanding of its basic underlying mechanisms.

However, few scientific evidence-based studies are currently available regarding the benefits of plants to humans. Our primary goal was to determine whether exposure to real ornamental plants during lay activities has psychophysiological relaxation effects in adults. Methods - Participants were instructed to perform a horticultural activity for 12 min (i.e., making a flower basket) using real ornamental plants or to handle artificial ornamental plants; the control activity and their psychophysiological responses were compared. Fifty Chinese females (mean age 20.14 +/- 1.47 years) participated in this experiment. Blood pressure and electroencephalography (EEG) were evaluated to determine physiological responses, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure the psychological responses. Results - According to the STAI data, the participants showed lower anxiety levels after performing the horticultural activity than after performing the control activity. In the EEG evaluation, variations in brainwaves were observed after both activities. Conclusion - In conclusion, horticultural activity using real ornamental plants can promote psychophysiological relaxation in adults.

However, the visual evaluation of EEG recordings is a demanding process, susceptible to error and bias due to the human factor involved. The development of EEG analysis methods coupled with data processing and mining techniques have assisted the feature extraction process from EEG recordings. In this paper, a novel method for classification of EEG signals based on features derived from the EEG morphology is proposed. The classification accuracy, as illustrated through experiment evaluation, shows that the proposed method can achieve adequate results and moreover the extracted features can be used collaboratively with commonly used features from time and time-frequency domain to increase the EEG signal's classification performance.

An EEG-based computer cursor control task is commonly used as a testbed for BCI applications. While traditional computer cursor control schemes are based on sensorimotor rhythm, a new scheme has recently been developed using imagined body kinematics (IBK) to achieve natural cursor movement in a shorter time of training. This article attempts to explore optimal decoding algorithms for an IBK paradigm using EEG signals with application to neural cursor control. The study is based on an offline analysis of 32 healthy subjects' training data. Various machine learning techniques were implemented to predict the kinematics of the computer cursor using EEG signals during the training tasks. Our results showed that a linear regression least squares model yielded the highest goodness-of-fit scores in the cursor kinematics model (70 in horizontal prediction and 40 in vertical prediction using a Theil-Sen regressor). Additionally, the contribution of each EEG channel on the predictability of cursor kinematics was examined for horizontal and vertical directions, separately. A directional classifier was also proposed to classify horizontal versus vertical cursor kinematics using EEG signals. By incorporating features extracted from specific frequency bands, we achieved 80 classification accuracy in differentiating horizontal and vertical cursor movements. The findings of the current study could facilitate a pathway to designing an optimized online neural cursor control.

In right-handers, greater MM occur in the right hand during movements of the non dominant left hand than conversely. However, it remains to know if such behavioural asymmetry of MM relies only on motor processes or if it is also related to attentional and executive processes. This study explores MM behavioural asymmetry and its cerebral correlates with electroencephalography in 14 right-handed healthy adults. We investigated the quantity and the intensity of MM and the associated task-related power changes in the beta band over central regions (motor processes), in the alpha band over the parietal regions (attentional processes) and in the theta band over frontal regions (executive processes). Behavioural results revealed greater MM in the right hand when the left hand was active than the reverse. This behavioural asymmetry was associated with asymmetry in the cortical activations over motor areas. Greater MM in the right hand correlated with activation over the contralateral left motor region, revealing that selective inhibition of one hand induced activation of the motor cortex leading to MM. In addition, increased cortical activations over parietal and frontomesial regions suggest that an increase of attentional and executive processes is required to inhibit one hand, independently of its side. All in all, this study highlights that side-specific motor and non-side-specific attentional and executive processes are associated to the MM asymmetry.

Using principal components analysis to examine resting state EEG in relation to task performance	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain dynamics; cognition; decision making; EEG; ERPs; principal components analysis (PCA)	CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; TIME VARIABILITY; ERP RESPONSES; INTRINSIC EEG; GO/NOGO TASK; BRAIN; DELTA; THETA	Brain dynamics research has highlighted the significance of the ongoing EEG in ERP genesis and cognitive functioning. Few studies, however, have assessed the contributions of the intrinsic resting state EEG to these stimulus-response processes and behavioral outcomes. Principal components analysis (PCA) has increasingly been used to obtain more objective, data-driven estimates of the EEG and ERPs. PCA was used here to reassess resting state EEG and go/no-go task ERP data from a previous study (Karamacoska et al., 2017) and the relationships between these measures. Twenty adults had EEG recorded with eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO), and as they completed an auditory go/no-go task. Separate EEG and ERP PCAs were conducted on each resting condition and stimulus type. For each state, seven EEG components were identified within the delta-beta frequency range, and six ERP components were obtained for go and no-go stimuli. Within the task, mean reaction time (RT) correlated positively with go P2 amplitude and negatively with P3b positivity. Regressions revealed that greater EC delta-1 amplitude predicted shorter mean RT, and larger alpha-3 amplitude predicted go P3b enhancement. These findings demonstrate the immediate P2 and P3b involvement in decision making and response control and the intrinsic EC delta-1 and alpha-3 amplitudes that underpin these processes. The brain's EEG state activity is a fundamental determinant of ERP and behavioral responses. Across brain dynamics studies, however, EEG has been assessed using predefined frequency ranges. Considered a more data-driven approach to decomposing electrophysiological data, principal components analysis was applied here to examine resting state EEG relations to performance. Resting state delta-1 amplitude was predictive of reaction time, and alpha-3 amplitude was directly related to go-type P3b amplitude. These findings enhance current understandings of how the intrinsic resting state EEG affects task performance.

Steady-state visual evoked potentials reveal enhanced neural responses to illusory surfaces during a concurrent visual attention task	CORTEX			English	Article						Modal completion; Illusory contours; Electroencephalography (EEG); Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs); Eriksen flanker task	PERCEPTUAL LOAD; CONTOURS; DYNAMICS; SHAPE; ORGANIZATION; COMPLETION; MECHANISMS; SIGNATURE; SELECTION; OBJECTS	Under natural viewing conditions, visual stimuli are often obscured by occluding surfaces. To aid object recognition, the visual system actively reconstructs the missing information, as exemplified in the classic Kanizsa illusion, a phenomenon termed "modal completion". Single-cell recordings in monkeys have shown that neurons in early visual cortex respond to illusory contours, but it has proven difficult to measure the neural correlates of modal completion in humans. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEPs) from disks with quarter segments removed to induce an illusory shape (or rotated to eliminate the illusory square in control trials). Opposing pairs of inducers were tagged with one of two flicker frequencies (2.5 or 4 Hz). During stimulus presentations, participants performed an attention task at fixation that required them to judge the orientation of a briefly flashed central bar while ignoring congruent (same orientation) or incongruent (different orientation) flanker bars that appeared on or off the illusory surface. Importantly, the occurrence of any illusory shape was never task relevant. Frequency-based analyses revealed that SSVEP amplitudes were reliably enhanced for trials in which an illusory square appeared, relative to control trials, at 4, 5 and 8 Hz and at an intermodulation frequency of 13 Hz. Participants' reaction times in the flanker task were significantly slower for incongruent versus congruent trials, and this distractor interference effect occurred only in the presence of an illusory surface and not in the control condition. Our results reveal a robust neural correlate of modal completion in the human visual system and provide evidence that visual completion can affect attentional control processes as deployed in a flanker task.

Methods: Forty-six participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 41 healthy controls balanced on age, gender, and WM ability completed a Sternberg verbal WM task with concurrent electroencephalography recording. Oscillatory activity was calculated for upper alpha, theta, and gamma frequency bands during WM encoding and maintenance. Results: WM performance did not differ between groups. When compared to healthy controls, depressed individuals displayed reduced frontal-midline theta power and increased occipital upper alpha power during WM encoding, and reductions in frontal-midline theta power and occipital gamma and upper alpha power during WM maintenance. Higher depression severity was associated with greater reductions upper alpha and gamma power during WM maintenance. Conclusions: Depressed individuals displayed prominent alterations in oscillatory activity during WM encoding and maintenance, indicating that the neural processes which support WM processing are altered in MDD even when no cognitive impairments are observed.

Although many studies have addressed the neural mechanisms underlying working memory, most of these studies have focused on the visual modality. Neurodynamics and functional connectivity related to auditory working memory are yet to be established. In this study, we explored the dynamic of high density (128-channel) electroencephalography (EEG) in a musical delayed match-tosample task (DMST), in which 36 participants were recruited and were instructed to recognize and distinguish the target melodies from similar distractors. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), event-related phase-amplitude couplings (ERPACs), and phase-locking values (PLVs) were used to determine the corresponding brain oscillations and connectivity. First, we observed that low-frequency oscillations in the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions were increased during the processing of both target and distracting melodies. Second, the cross-frequency coupling between lowfrequency phases and high-frequency amplitudes was elevated in the frontal and parietal regions when the participants were distinguishing between the target from distractor, suggesting that the phase-amplitude coupling could be an indicator of neural mechanisms underlying memory retrieval. Finally, phase-locking, an index evaluating brain functional connectivity, revealed that there was fronto-temporal phase-locking in the theta band and fronto-parietal phase-locking in the alpha band during the recognition of the two stimuli. These findings suggest the existence of functional connectivity and the phase-amplitude coupling in the neocortex during musical memory retrieval, and provide a highly resolved timeline to evaluate brain dynamics. Furthermore, the inter-regional phase-locking and phase-amplitude coupling among the frontal, temporal and parietal regions occurred at the very beginning of musical memory retrieval, which might reflect the precise timing when cognitive resources were involved in the retrieval of targets and the rejection of similar distractors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first EEG study employing a naturalistic task to study auditory memory processes and functional connectivity during memory retrieval, results of which can shed light on the use of natural stimuli in studies that are closer to the real-life applications of cognitive evaluations, mental treatments, and brain-computer interface.

This study applied the electroencephalogram (EEG) technique to investigate the emotion recognition ability in 31 deaf children and 30 hearing controls with facial emotion recognition task. Results from behavioral task showed that deaf children exhibited lower accuracy compared to hearing controls. As for EEG analysis, results showed that deaf children showed diminished activation in the early (N1, P1), middle (N170) and late stages (late positive potential, LPP) compared to hearing controls. In addition, for brain oscillation, alpha band (400-800 ms) also revealed a reduced desynchronization in deaf children. The present findings seem to indicate that the deficit during facial emotion recognition ability among deaf children might be due to the impairments in visual processing, attention and emotional semantic distribution ability during facial emotion recognition processing.

Filter theory is part of a scientist's training, yet the impact of filters on interpreting data is not always fully appreciated. This paper reviews the issue and explains what a filter is, what problems are to be expected when using them, how to choose the right filter, and how to avoid filtering by using alternative tools. Time-frequency analysis shares some of the same problems that filters have, particularly in the case of wavelet transforms. We recommend reporting filter characteristics with sufficient details, including a plot of the impulse or step response as an inset.

Estimating EEG Source Dipole Orientation Based on Singular-value Decomposition for Connectivity Analysis	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; Source space activity; Dipole orientation; Visual evoked potentials; Epilepsy	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; FACE PERCEPTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; OBJECT; PARCELLATION; INFORMATION; CORTEX; EPILEPSY	In the last decade, the use of high-density electrode arrays for EEG recordings combined with the improvements of source reconstruction algorithms has allowed the investigation of brain networks dynamics at a sub-second scale. One powerful tool for investigating large-scale functional brain networks with EEG is time-varying effective connectivity applied to source signals obtained from electric source imaging. Due to computational and interpretation limitations, the brain is usually parcelled into a limited number of regions of interests (ROIs) before computing EEG connectivity. One specific need and still open problem is how to represent the time- and frequency-content carried by hundreds of dipoles with diverging orientation in each ROI with one unique representative time-series. The main aim of this paper is to provide a method to compute a signal that explains most of the variability of the data contained in each ROI before computing, for instance, time-varying connectivity. As the representative time-series for a ROI, we propose to use the first singular vector computed by a singular-value decomposition of all dipoles belonging to the same ROI. We applied this method to two real datasets (visual evoked potentials and epileptic spikes) and evaluated the time-course and the frequency content of the obtained signals. For each ROI, both the time-course and the frequency content of the proposed method reflected the expected time-course and the scalp-EEG frequency content, representing most of the variability of the sources (similar to 80%) and improving connectivity results in comparison to other procedures used so far. We also confirm these results in a simulated dataset with a known ground truth.	[Rubega, M.; Carboni, M.; Seeber, M.; Michel, C.

Classical conditioning (as a typical case of associative learning) and electroencephalography together provide a good framework for expanding our knowledge about fast learning-related cortical changes. In our experiment, we employed a novel paradigm in which classical conditioning was combined with passive oddball. Nineteen subjects participated in the first experiment (aversive conditioning with painful shock as unconditioned stimulus (US) and neutral tones as conditioned stimulus (CS)), and 22 subjects in the second experiment (with a subject's own name as US). We used event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency analyses to explore the CS-US interaction. We found a learning-induced increment of P3a in the first experiment and the late positive potential (LPP) in both experiments. These effects may be related to increased attentional and emotional significance of conditioned stimuli. We showed that the LPP and P3a effects, earlier found only in visual paradigms, generalize to the auditory sensory system. We also observed suppression of the low beta activity to CS+ in aversive conditioning over the hemisphere contralateral to expected electrical shocks, presumably indicating preparation of the somatosensory system to the expected nociceptive US.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides full brain coverage with limited temporal resolution, while electroencephalography (EEG), estimates cortical activity with high temporal resolution. Combining them may provide improved network characterization. New Method: We examined relationships between EEG spatiospectral pattern timecourses and concurrent fMRI BOLD signals using canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) with 1st and 2nd temporal derivatives in voxel-wise general linear models (GLM). HRF shapes were derived from EEG-fMRI time courses during "resting-state", visual oddball and semantic decision paradigms. Results: The resulting GLM F-maps self-organized into several different large-scale brain networks (LSBNs) often with different timing between EEG and fMRI revealed through differences in GLM-derived HRF shapes (e.g., with a lower time to peak than the canonical HRF). We demonstrate that some EEG spatiospectral patterns (related to concurrent fMRI) are weakly task-modulated. Comparison with existing method(s): Previously, we demonstrated 14 independent EEG spatiospectral patterns within this EEG dataset, stable across the resting-state, visual oddball and semantic decision paradigms. Here, we demonstrate that their time courses are significantly correlated with fMRI dynamics organized into LSBN structures. EEG-fMRI derived HRF peak appears earlier than the canonical HRF peak, which suggests limitations when assuming a canonical HRF shape in EEG-fMRI. Conclusions: This is the first study examining EEG-fMRI relationships among independent EEG spatiospectral patterns over different paradigms. The findings highlight the importance of considering different HRF shapes when spatiotemporally characterizing brain networks using EEG and fMRI.

This retrospective study now investigated whether BIS EEG tracings can predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest (CA).MethodsBilateral BIS monitoring (BIS VISTA, Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. Norwood, USA) was started following intensive care unit admission. Six, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48h after targeted temperature management (TTM) at 33 degrees C was started, BIS EEG tracings were extracted and reviewed by two neurophysiologists for the presence of slow diffuse rhythm, burst suppression, cerebral inactivity and epileptic activity (defined as continuous, monomorphic, >2Hz generalized sharp activity or continuous, monomorphic, <2Hz generalized blunt activity). At 180days post-CA, neurological outcome was determined using cerebral performance category (CPC) classification (CPC1-2: good and CPC3-5: poor neurological outcome).ResultsSixty-three out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were enrolled for data analysis of whom 32 had a good and 31 a poor neurological outcome. Epileptic activity within 6-12h predicted CPC3-5 with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%. Epileptic activity within time frames 18-24 and 36-48h showed a PPV for CPC3-5 of 90 and 93%, respectively. Cerebral inactivity within 6-12h predicted CPC3-5 with a PPV of 57%. In contrast, cerebral inactivity between 36 and 48h predicted CPC3-5 with a PPV of 100%. The pattern with the worst predictive power at any time point was burst suppression with PPV of 44, 57 and 40% at 6-12h, at 18-24h and at 36-48h, respectively. Slow diffuse rhythms at 6-12h, at 18-24h and at 36-48h predicted CPC1-2 with PPV of 74, 76 and 80%, respectively.ConclusionBased on simplified BIS EEG, the presence of epileptic activity at any time and cerebral inactivity after the end of TTM may assist poor outcome prognostication in successfully resuscitated CA patients. A slow diffuse rhythm at any time after CA was indicative for a good neurological outcome.

Sensorimotor Oscillatory Phase-Power Interaction Gates Resting Human Corticospinal Output	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						electroencephalography; motor control; motor cortex; motor evoked potentials; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EEG OSCILLATIONS; REACTION-TIME; MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN-STIMULATION; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; EXCITABILITY; MECHANISMS; PLASTICITY	Oscillatory activity within sensorimotor networks is characterized by time-varying changes in phase and power. The influence of interactions between sensorimotor oscillatory phase and power on human motor function, like corticospinal output, is unknown. We addressed this gap in knowledge by delivering transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the human motor cortex during electroencephalography recordings in 20 healthy participants. Motor evoked potentials, a measure of corticospinal excitability, were categorized offline based on the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillatory phase and power at the time of TMS. Phase-dependency of corticospinal excitability was evaluated across a continuous range of power levels using trial-by-trial linear mixed-effects models. For mu, there was no effect of PHASE or POWER (P > 0.51), but a significant PHASE x POWER interaction (P = 0.002). The direction of phase-dependency reversed with changing mu power levels: corticospinal output was higher during mu troughs versus peaks when mu power was high while the opposite was true when mu power was low. A similar PHASE x POWER interaction was not present for beta oscillations (P > 0.11). We conclude that the interaction between sensorimotor oscillatory phase and power gates human corticospinal output to an extent unexplained by sensorimotor oscillatory phase or power alone.

Beta oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex correlate with disease and remission in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						BECTS; beta rhythms; biomarker; electrical source imaging; high density EEG; rolandic epilepsy	MINIMUM-NORM ESTIMATION; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; SLEEP STAGE; EEG; CHILDREN; MEG; LOCALIZATION; MATURATION; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Introduction Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is a common form of childhood epilepsy with the majority of those afflicted remitting during their early teenage years. Seizures arise from the lower half of the sensorimotor cortex of the brain (e.g. seizure onset zone) and the abnormal epileptiform discharges observed increase during NREM sleep. To date no clinical factors reliably predict disease course, making determination of ongoing seizure risk a significant challenge. Prior work in BECTS have shown abnormalities in beta band (14.9-30 Hz) oscillations during movement and rest. Oscillations in this frequency band are modulated by state of consciousness and thought to reflect intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms. Methods We used high density EEG and source localization techniques to examine beta band activity in the seizure onset zone (sensorimotor cortex) in a prospective cohort of children with BECTS and healthy controls during sleep. We hypothesized that beta power in the sensorimotor cortex would be different between patients and healthy controls, and that beta abnormalities would improve with resolution of disease in this self-limited epilepsy syndrome. We further explored the specificity of our findings and correlation with clinical features. Statistical testing was performed using logistic and standard linear regression models. Results We found that beta band power in the seizure onset zone is different between healthy controls and BECTS patients. We also found that a longer duration of time spent seizure-free (corresponding to disease remission) correlates with lower beta power in the seizure onset zone. Exploratory spatial analysis suggests this effect is not restricted to the sensorimotor cortex. Exploratory frequency analysis suggests that this phenomenon is also observed in alpha and gamma range activity. We found no relationship between beta power and the presence or rate of epileptiform discharges in the sensorimotor cortex or a test of sensorimotor performance. Conclusion These results provide evidence that cortical beta power in the seizure onset zone may provide a dynamic physiological biomarker of disease in BECTS.

This study applied electroencephalogram (EEG) technique to investigate the emotional interference inhibitory control ability in 25 LD children and 22 non-LD controls with face-word emotional Stroop task. Results from behavioral tasks showed that LD children exhibited lower accuracy and longer reaction times. The EEG analysis showed that the non-LD children displayed significant interference effects both in the ERP components, with N2, N450 and SP exhibiting a larger activation in incongruent condition than the congruent condition, and brain oscillation, with early and late alpha demonstrating a larger desynchronization in the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. However, all these interference effects were absent in the LD children except the SP component. The present findings seem to indicate that the deficit during emotional interference control ability among children with LD might be due to the impaired attention allocation ability during emotional conflict detection process. Future research is needed to replicate these results and to explore the biochemical mechanisms between the impaired emotional interference inhibitory control ability and impaired attentional control ability.

Further, individuals with an ultra-high risk for psychosis also show abnormal functional connectivity-related cognitive impairment, especially in the alpha rhythm. Thus, the identification of functional networks is essential to our understanding of the disorder. We investigated the resting-state functional connectivity of the alpha rhythm measured by electroencephalography (EEG) to reveal the relation between functional network and clinical symptoms. The participants included 28 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES), 28 individuals with ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR), and 28 healthy controls (HC). After the professional clinical symptoms evaluation, all the participants were instructed to keep eyes closed for 3-min resting-state EEG recording. The 3-min EEG data were segmented into artefact-free epochs (the length was 3 s), and the functional connectivity of the alpha phase was estimated using the phase lag index (PU), which measures the phase differences of EEG signals. The FES and UHR groups displayed increased resting-state PLI connectivity compared with the HC group [F(2,74) = 10.804, p < 0.001]. Significant increases in the global efficiency, the local efficiency, and the path length were found in the FES and UHR groups compared with those of the HC group. FES and UHR showed an increased degree of connectivity compared with HC. The degree of the left occipital lobe area was higher in the UHR group than in the FES group. The hypothesis of disconnection is confirmed. Furthermore, differences between the UHR and FES group were found, which is valuable for producing clinical significance before the onset of schizophrenia.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, > 80 Hz) are promising biomarkers of the EZ that are typically localized using intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG). The goal of this study was to localize the cortical generators of HFOs non-invasively using high-density (HD) EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) and validate the localization against the gold-standard given by the icEEGdefined HFO-zone. Methods: We analyzed simultaneous HDEEG and MEG data from six children with MRE who underwent icEEG and surgery. We detected interictal HFOs (80-160 Hz) on HD-EEG and MEG separately, using an inhouse automatic detector followed by visual human review, and distinguished between HFOs with and without spikes. We localized the cortical generators of each HFO on HD-EEG or MEG using the wavelet Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM). For the HFOs localized in the brain area covered by icEEG, we estimated the localization error (E-loc) with respect to the gold-standard, and classified them as either concordant (E-loc <= 15mm) or not. Results: We found that: (i) HD-EEG presented a higher rate of HFOs than MEG (1 vs 0.5 HFOs/min, p=0.031); (ii) HFOs without spikes were more likely to be localized outside the brain regions of interest (i.e. covered by icEEG) than HFOs with spikes; and (iii) both HD-EEG and MEG showed high precision to the gold-standard (92% and 96%). Conclusion: We reported quantitative evidence that HDEEG and MEG can localize the HFO cortical generators with high precision to the icEEG gold-standard in children with MRE, suggesting that they may possibly limit the need for icEEG prior to surgery. We also showed that HFOs with spikes on HD-EEG/MEG are more likely to be epileptogenic than those independent from spikes, which may represent physiological events from normal brain.

Methods: Ten patients were assigned auditory naming and picture naming tasks during extraoperative intracranial EEG recording in a tertiary epilepsy center. Time-frequency analysis determined at what electrode sites and at what time windows during each task the amplitude of high-gamma activity (65-95 Hz) was modulated. Results: The superior-temporal gyrus on each hemisphere showed high-gamma augmentation during sentence listening, whereas the left middle-temporal and inferior-frontal gyri showed high-gamma augmentation peaking around stimulus offset. Auditory naming-specific high-gamma augmentation was noted in the bilateral superior-temporal gyri as well as left frontal-parietal-temporal perisylvian network regions, whereas picture naming-specific augmentation was noted in the occipital-fusiform regions, bilaterally. The inferior pre- and postcentral gyri on each hemisphere showed modality-common high-gamma augmentation time-locked to overt responses. Conclusions: The spatiotemporal dynamics of auditory and picture naming-related high-gamma augmentation in Japanese-speaking patients were qualitatively similar to those previously reported in studies of English-speaking patients. Significance: The cortical dynamics for auditory sentence recognition are at least partly shared by cohorts speaking two distinct languages. Multicenter studies regarding the clinical utility of high-gamma language mapping across Eastern and Western hemispheres may be feasible.

Modeling the Ongoing Dynamics of Short and Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Broadband EEG During Movement	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Long-Range Temporal Correlation (LRTC); Short-Range Dependence (SRD); Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA); electroencephalography (EEG); Brain Computer Interface (BCI); movement intention; broadband; single trial	COMPUTER INTERFACE BCI; TIME-SERIES; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SCALING BEHAVIOR; BRAIN; DEPENDENCE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; EXPONENTS	Electroencephalogram (EEG) undergoes complex temporal and spectral changes during voluntary movement intention. Characterization of such changes has focused mostly on narrowband spectral processes such as Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor rhythms because EEG is mostly considered as emerging from oscillations of the neuronal populations. However, the changes in the temporal dynamics, especially in the broadband arrhythmic EEG have not been investigated for movement intention detection. The Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) are ubiquitously present in several neuronal processes, typically requiring longer timescales to detect. In this paper, we study the ongoing changes in the dynamics of long- as well as short-range temporal dependencies in the single trial broadband EEG during movement intention. We obtained LRTC in 2 s windows of broadband EEG and modeled it using the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) model which allowed simultaneous modeling of short- and long-range temporal correlations. There were significant (p < 0.05) changes in both broadband long- and short-range temporal correlations during movement intention and execution. We discovered that the broadband LRTC and narrowband ERD are complementary processes providing distinct information about movement because eliminating LRTC from the signal did not affect the ERD and conversely, eliminating ERD from the signal did not affect LRTC. Exploring the possibility of applications in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), we used hybrid features with combinations of LRTC, ARFIMA, and ERD to detect movement intention. A significantly higher (p < 0.05) classification accuracy of 88.3 +/- 4.2% was obtained using the combination of ARFIMA and ERD features together, which also predicted the earliest movement at 1 s before its onset. The ongoing changes in the long- and short-range temporal correlations in broadband EEG contribute to effectively capturing the motor command generation and can be used to detect movement successfully. These temporal dependencies provide different and additional information about the movement.

To investigate whether these features imply functional cortical network alterations and their evolution with age, we studied spontaneous slow oscillations, activity that integrates cellular and network properties. We quantified different parameters of the emergent slow oscillations-alternating Up and Down states-and of the embedded beta-gamma rhythms of 3xTg-AD and wild-type mice at 7 and 20 months of age. Most group differences occurred at 20 months of age: 3xTg-AD mice presented lower oscillatory frequency, higher cycle variability, and reduced relative (Up/Down) firing rate with respect to controls. The high-frequency analysis revealed a shift toward lower frequencies in older 3xTg-AD animals, reminiscent of one of the electroencephalography hallmarks of patients with AD. This first systematic characterization of the cortical emergent rhythms in 3xTg-AD strain provides insights into the network mechanisms underlying associated network activity alterations.

This study aims to enhance the EEG features via an visual feedback training process by improving the visual feedback training paradigm design, EEG signal acquisition and EEG signal analysis, etc. We presented a novel feature extraction method in order to systematically improve the effective of feature selection, in which the coupling properties of EEG were combined with multi-level dynamic features including the time, frequency and spatial characteristics of EEG. Four subjects were guided to perform the Motor Imagery(MI) experiment with visual feedback training. Then, the integral value, Autoregressive (AR) model coefficients, avelet energy spectrum, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and mutual information were calculated as indices to quantify the enhancement of EEG characteristics before and after training. Statistical analysis revealed that the classification accuracy of EEG signals after training was significantly improved.

Recent electrophysiological studies suggest that this dysconnectivity is present not only at a spatial level but also at a temporal level, operationalized as long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). Previous research suggests that alpha and beta frequency bands have weaker temporal stability in people with SCZ. This study sought to replicate these findings with high-density electroencephalography (EEG), enabling a spatially more accurate analysis of LRTC differences, and to test associations with characteristic SCZ symptoms and cognitive deficits. A 128-channel EEG was used to record eyes-open resting state brain activity of 23 people with SCZ and 24 matched healthy controls (HCs). LRTCs were derived for alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-25 Hz) frequency bands. As an exploratory analysis, LRTC was source projected using sLoreta. People with SCZ showed an area of significantly reduced beta-band LRTC compared with HCs over bilateral posterior regions. There were no between-group differences in alpha-band activity. Individual symptoms of SCZ were not related to LRTC values nor were cognitive deficits. The study confirms that people with SCZ have reduced temporal stability in the beta frequency band. The absence of group differences in the alpha band may be attributed to the fact that people had, in contrast to previous studies, their eyes open in the current study. Taken together, our study confirms the utility of LRTC as a marker of network instability in people with SCZ and provides a novel empirical perspective for future examinations of network dysfunction salience in SCZ research.

This paper presents a structural time-series analysis to capture and characterize the dynamic behavior of EEG signals, and develops a method to detect the EEG change points. For a given EEG signal, the proposed method is operated as follows: 1) a sub-band pass filter is fist designed to capture those frequency components that can characterize the dynamic behavior of the data, and the so-called power spectrum is extracted as the EEG features; 2) together with a sliding-window technique, an automatic 'segment-to-segment' analysis of EEG signal, is developed with a null hypothesis testing for decision making. In particular, the main challenge of the proposed method is to design an appropriate distance metric that is compatible with our considered data/problem. To achieve this end, we first collect a variety of metrics from other areas that would be potentially available for our problem, and then compare them for the considered EEG change point detection. Experiments are conducted on two different data sets. Results show the Bhattacharyya distance achieves the best detection result among all investigated metrics. Meanwhile, comparison with state-of-the-arts demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in real applications.

Functional Connectivity in Term Neonates With Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Undergoing Therapeutic Hypothermia	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Coherence; Oscillations; Phase lag; Voltage correlations	BRAIN	Background: We investigated whether therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming impact functional connectivity using electroencephalography (EEG) as a measure in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. We hypothesized that EEG coherence and voltage correlations would be lower and phase lag greater in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy than control subjects and that functional connectivity would evolve during therapeutic hypothermia with the greatest improvement occurring during rewarming. Methods: This study was a retrospective study of 14 term neonates (greater than 37 weeks) with moderate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy who underwent therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming. Continuous EEG and video monitoring was conducted for 96 hours during therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming. The primary quantitative EEG measures of functional connectivity were coherence, phase lag, and voltage correlations. These EEG parameters were compared with a cohort of normal agematched neonates. Results: Neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy had marked decreases in power, coherences, and voltage correlation and increases in phase lag when compared with control neonates. However, there were no significant changes in these measures between therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming. Conclusions: Neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy demonstrate significant abnormalities in functional connectivity compared with control subjects. These abnormalities persist through therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming and are not altered after rewarming. Although hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is associated with impaired functional brain connectivity, there is no evidence, using quantitative EEG measures, that therapeutic hypothermia or rewarming either improves or exacerbates these abnormalities in connectivity.

For example, the perceptual temporal asynchrony observed when passively reporting changes in visual object attributes (e.g., colour and position) was found to disappear virtually when the changes resulted from a voluntary motor action. Although the spatio-temporal constraints of sensory binding by action have been broadly investigated, the underlying neural correlates are still largely unknown. In the present study, participants performed temporal order judgments of changes in the colour and position of a visual stimulus, while adapting to a 750 ms delay between a sound (perceptual condition) or the end of a manual reaching action (motor condition), and the visual changes. Behavioural observations indicated that temporal asynchrony (-30.2 ms) decreased in the motor condition (2.7 ms), as a result of sensorimotor adaptation, but not in the perceptual condition (-29.6 ms). EEG-evoked potentials on posterior visual regions showed that early components were altered by sensorimotor adaptation, with in particular a broad reduction in the amplitude of the early P1 component. Furthermore, time-frequency analysis of EEG signals during the 350 ms period preceding the visual changes revealed an increase of the 15-25 Hz frequency band amplitude in the central region and a decrease of the 8-12 Hz frequency band amplitude in the posterior region. Overall the results suggest that sensory binding by action depends on an early top-down modulation of the visual regions by the motor system - in agreement with the pre-activation theory of action-perception coupling - associated with an increase of attentional resources.

Intra-individual stability of NREM sleep quantitative EEG measures in obstructive sleep apnea	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						agreement; Bland-Altman analysis; electroencephalography; obstructive sleep apnea; power spectral analysis; test-retest reliability	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SPINDLES; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTORS	Electroencephalography is collected routinely during clinical polysomnography, but is often utilised to simply determine sleep time to calculate apnea-hypopnea indices. Quantitative analysis of these data (quantitative electroencephalogram) may provide trait-like information to predict patient vulnerability to sleepiness. Measurements of trait-like characteristics need to have high test-retest reliability. We aimed to investigate the intra-individual stability of slow-wave (delta power) and spindle frequency (sigma power) activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. We recorded sleep electroencephalograms during two overnight polysomnographic recordings in 61 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (median days between studies 47, inter-quartile range 53). Electroencephalograms recorded at C3-M2 derivation were quantitatively analysed using power spectral analysis following artefact removal. Relative delta (0.5-4.5 Hz) and sigma (12-15 Hz) power during non-rapid eye movement sleep were calculated. Intra-class correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between nights. Intra-class correlation coefficients demonstrated good-to-excellent agreement in the delta and sigma frequencies between nights (intra-class correlation coefficients: 0.84, 0.89, respectively). Bland-Altman analysis of delta power showed a mean difference close to zero (-0.4, 95% limits of agreement -9.4, 8.7) and no heteroscedasticity with increasing power. Sigma power demonstrated heteroscedasticity, with reduced stability as sigma power increased. The mean difference of sigma power between nights was close to zero (0.1, 95% limits -1.6, 1.8). We have demonstrated the stability of slow-wave and spindle frequency electroencephalograms during non-rapid eye movement sleep within patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The electroencephalogram profile during non-rapid eye movement sleep may be a useful biomarker for predicting vulnerability to daytime impairment in obstructive sleep apnea and responsiveness to treatment.

Fear Extinction Recall Modulates Human Frontomedial Theta and Amygdala Activity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						fear conditioning; fear extinction; frontal-midline theta; simultaneous EEG-fMRI; threat processing	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; CONDITIONED FEAR; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXTINGUISHED FEAR; ANIMAL-MODELS; EEG; ACQUISITION; EXPRESSION	Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, as well as animal studies, indicate that the amygdala and frontomedial brain regions are critically involved in conditioned fear and that frontomedial oscillations in the theta range (4-8 Hz) may support communication between these brain regions. However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS-E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS-N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS-) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.

Viewership and social media engagement have become standard indices of programming success. However, accurately predicting individual episode success or future show performance using traditional metrics remains a challenge. Here we examine whether TV viewership and Twitter activity can be predicted using electroencephalography (EEG) measures, which are less affected by reporting biases and which are commonly associated with different cognitive processes. 331 participants watched an hour-long episode from one of nine prime-time shows (similar to 36 participants per episode). Three frequency-based measures were extracted: fronto-central alpha/beta asymmetry (indexing approach motivation), fronto-central alpha/theta power (indexing attention), and fronto-central theta/gamma power (indexing memory processing). All three EEG measures and the composite EEG score significantly correlated across episode segments with the two behavioral measures of TV viewership and Twitter volume. EEG measures explained more variance than either of the behavioral metrics and mediated the relationship between the two. Attentional focus was integral for both audience retention and Twitter activity, while emotional motivation was specifically linked with social engagement and program segments with high TV viewership. These findings highlight the viability of using EEG measures to predict success of TV programming and identify cognitive processes that contribute to audience engagement with television shows.

Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent ('old'), matched two antecedents ('ambiguous'), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features ('partial-match'), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, 'new'). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an 'old/new' judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.

CR-19-0950: Event-related responses to alcohol-related stimuli in Mexican-American young adults: Relation to age, gender, comorbidity and "dark side" symptoms	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Mexican American; Event-related oscillations; Alcohol-related stimuli; Comorbidity	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; VOLTAGE ALPHA EEG; USE DISORDERS; HIGH-RISK; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; ACCULTURATION STRESS; POTENTIAL RESPONSES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ANXIETY DISORDERS; SELECT POPULATION	Background: Electrophysiological variables may represent sensitive biomarkers of vulnerability to or endophenotypes for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Methods: Young adults (age 18-30 yrs, n = 580) of Mexican American heritage were assessed with the Semi Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism and event-related oscillations (EROS) generated in response to a task that used pictures of objects, food, and alcohol-related and non-alcohol-related drinks as stimuli. Results: Decreases in energy in the alpha and beta frequencies and higher phase synchrony within cortical brain areas were seen in response to the alcohol-related as compared to the non-alcohol-related stimuli. Differences in ERO energy and synchrony responses to alcohol-related stimuli were also found as a function of age, sex, AUD status and comorbidity. Age-related decreases in energy and increases in synchrony were found. Females had significantly higher energy and lower synchrony values than males. Participants with AUD had higher synchrony values specifically in the beta frequencies, whereas those with a lifetime diagnosis of conduct disorder and/or antisocial personality disorder had lower alpha power and synchrony, and those with any affective disorder had lower ERO energy in the beta frequencies. Those with substance-associated affective "dark-side" symptoms had slower reaction times to the task, lower energy in the beta frequencies, lower local synchrony in the theta frequencies, and higher long-range synchrony in the delta and beta frequencies. Conclusions: These findings suggest that EROs recorded to alcohol-related stimuli may be biomarkers of co-morbid risk factors, symptoms and disorders associated with AUD that also can differentiate those with "dark side symptoms".

However, further research is needed to better understand the multiple interactions occurring among electroencephalographic (EEG) features and respiratory and cardiovascular (CV) outputs modulated by the ANS during sleep. Here, we developed new methods to study EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep with respect to the phases of peripheral oscillations. EEG, respiration, and continuous blood pressure signals recorded from 20 participants were analyzed. Digital filters, designed to decompose the signals into different frequency bands, and the Hilbert transform were applied to estimate the instantaneous phases and frequencies of the peripheral oscillations. The peripheral oscillations were categorized into four phases representing up and down states. EEG delta power (synchronized SWA) was computed and compared across these phases during NREM sleep. Results show that EEG delta power is higher during down phases of slow and respiratory frequency components of blood pressure and during up phases of respiration, suggestive of CNS-ANS coupling during NREM sleep. The developed techniques provide the preliminary framework to further analyze and interpret complex interactions between cortical and cardiac oscillations and their synchrony.

However, the recognition accuracy of such methods is not ideal. Deep learning methods such as CNN and RNN have become the research hotspots in the field of EEG analysis. However, due to the high structural risk of the deep learning model, the model is prone to poor generalization ability, long training time, over-fitting, and poor real-time performance. In addition, current EEG data acquisition devices generally require dozens of signal channels to provide a data foundation for accurate analysis of subsequent brain signals, which not only brings high hardware costs, but also is not portable enough to be popularized in daily life. However, due to the weak and susceptible interference of the EEG signal, reducing the number of signal channels under the premise of using the above method may further lead to a worse analysis effect. In order to solve these problems, we propose a new lightweight EEG classification model based on a small number of channel EEG sensors, called Armaiti. Armaiti first uses the 5-channel EEG signal collected by the portable EEG acquisition device to perform blind source signal separation to obtain data from multiple sources, including noise signals such as EOG. Instead of identifying and screening these signals, we use a combination of EEG, EOG and other signals. Then Armaiti performs wavelet packet transform on each signal source, decomposes the signal into different frequency bands, and then inputs it into the lightweight convolutional neural network model designed in this paper to obtain five classifiers. Finally, Armaiti uses the ensemble learning to get the final classification results. In order to verify the performance and practicability of the model, from September 2018 to June 2019, we used 5 channel portable EEG acquisition equipment to collect data on EEG in different scenarios, and built fatigue data sets and applications. The prototype system analyzes the accuracy, training time, loss, precision, recall, ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) and other indicators. The experimental results show that Armaiti exhibits better performance: according to the characteristics of manual extraction, K-means is used for clustering, and the final accuracy rate is 65.6% according to the centroid. The final accuracy rate using SVM to classify is 74.7%. Using the convolutional neural network to analyze EEG signals, the accuracy rate was 80.1%, while the accuracy of Armaiti was 96.4%. In addition, the traditional CNN model has 5.8 times the average training time per round compared to Armaiti.

These effects on brain activity could be quantified by EEG and open the path to analyze the efficiency of services during the learning process. Many studies reported the appearance of EEG alpha desynchronization during the attention period, resulting in better cognitive performance. Motivation was also found to be reflected in EEG. This study investigated the effect of intrinsic motivation on the alpha desynchronization pattern in terms of the complexity of time series data. The sample entropy method was used to quantify the complexity of event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) of EEG data. We found that when participants can remember the stimulus, ERSP was significantly less complex than when they cannot. However, the effect of intrinsic motivation cannot be defined by using sample entropy directly. ERSP's main effect showed that motivation affects the complexity of ERSP data; longer continuous alpha desynchronization patterns were found when participants were motivated. Therefore, we introduced an algorithm to identify the longest continuous alpha desynchronization pattern. The method allowed us to understand that intrinsic motivation has an effect on recognition at the frontal and left parietal area directly.

In this approach, functional time series are assigned to the vertices of the underlying weighted graph and GSP analysis is performed in each time point of the signal. Here we used GSP to study local brain connectivity changes in patients with disorders of consciousness based on resting state high density electroencephalography (hdEEG) recordings. Total variation of the graph signals is a measure of signal smoothness over the underlying graph. In this study, we constructed the underlying graph based on the geometrical distances between each electrode pairs in such a way that local smoothness of the signal can be studied. Total variation analysis in alpha-band showed that in the pathological states of altered consciousness, local short range communication of brain regions in this frequency band is stronger than in healthy states which shows that information is segregated in local regions in patients with disorders of consciousness.

Eigenspace Time Frequency Based Features for Accurate Seizure Detection from EEG Data	IRBM			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); EEG signals classification; Time frequency analysis; Singular value decomposition; Seizure detection; Machine leaming based classifiers	WAVELET TRANSFORM; ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; PATTERNS	Background: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects over 2% of the world population. Epilepsy patients suffer from recurring seizures that can be very harmful. The unpredictability of seizures is a major concern for medical practitioners because uncontrollable seizures can lead to sudden death and morbidity. A system that could warn patients and doctors alike about the impending seizure event would dramatically enhance the quality of life for patients. Methods: While most previous research works focused on using signal processing tools appropriate for stationary signals, we propose here to use time and frequency (TF) analysis to extract features capable of discriminating normal from abnormal EEG traces (both ictal and interictal). The features are extracted using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the EEG signal Time Frequency matrix. The left singular vectors of the time frequency matrix are used to obtain robust feature vectors. In contrast to existing techniques, the proposed TF-based technique can be used to detect the specific moments of seizure occurrences in time so that this information is used to discriminate interictal from ictal EEG traces. Instead of extracting the features directly from the TF matrix, we transform the left eigenvectors obtained from the SVD of the TF matrix into a feature vector that behaves like to a probability density function. Results: We show that almost all classical classification techniques achieve excellent seizure detection results when used with the proposed TF features, irrespective of the classifier used. Contrary to existing works, we test our approach across several real-life scenarios covering 2, 3, and 5 possible classes of data. Our tests provided consistent results across different scenarios. The results, under different scenarios, outperformed existing ones achieving consistently more than 97.3% and up to 99.5% in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Conclusion: Experimental results show that the novel features have successfully represented the characteristics of the underlying disease phenomenon from EEG data. Also, we conclude that learning based classifiers are better suited for this application, compared to Bayesian classifiers that have difficulty in adapting to the varying nature of the features' probability distribution function.

In this study, we used electroencephalography to investigate brain activity while participants watched a preferred player win a competitive game (Rock-Paper-Scissors game). In the experimental task, movie clips showed right hand of the two players and played Rock-Paper-Scissors game. We asked participants to explicitly support or "cheer" for a specific player, and then examined brain activity associated with vicarious reward. For the observed hand movement, previous findings showed that the event-related desynchronization of mu band (8-14 Hz) appeared at the contra-lateral central electrode to the observed hand (If someone sees the right-hand movement, the left central electrode shows the event-related desynchronization of mu-band). During observation of the player, we detected event-related desynchronization of mu band activity in the contra-lateral central electrode as well as mid-frontal beta band (15-22 Hz) activation when the preferred player won. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed a strong phase synchronization between the contra-lateral central electrode and mid-frontal electrode in the mu band when participants received the vicarious reward. Cross-frequency coupling analysis revealed functional integration between the mu and beta bands at mid-frontal electrode. These results indicate the interaction of mu band observed at contra-lateral electrode and beta band observed at mid-frontal electrode coupling, suggesting a link between the mirror neuron system and the reward system during vicarious reward.

We constructed a novel dual-layer EEG electrode system to isolate electrocortical signals, and then validated the system using an electrical head phantom and robotic motion platform. We collected data from young healthy subjects walking and running on a treadmill while they encountered unexpected obstacles to step over. Supplementary motor area and premotor cortex had spectral power increases within similar to 200 ms after object appearance in delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands (3-13 Hz). That activity was followed by similar posterior parietal cortex spectral power increase that decreased in lag time with increasing locomotion speed. The sequence of activation suggests that supplementary motor area and premotor cortex interrupted the gait cycle, while posterior parietal cortex tracked obstacle location for planning foot placement nearly two steps ahead of reaching the obstacle. Together, these results highlight advantages of adopting dual-layer mobile EEG, which should greatly facilitate the study of human brain dynamics in physically active real-world settings and tasks.

Most of these studies have employed subjective rating scales to assess processes and outcomes of exposure to nature, while only few of them have used physiological measures to assess the neural correlates of these benefits. The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore how the brain engages in processing of images of natural vs. urban scenery. During EEG recording, the participants (n = 32) were presented with a series of photos depicting urban or natural scenery. Participants rated the sceneries for their subjective relaxing value. Images of natural scenery were rated as more relaxing compared to the images of urban scenery. Event related potentials suggested a lower attentional demand for images of natural scenery compared to urban ones. Signal spectral analyses revealed differences in brain activity level and cognitive demand between natural and urban scenery. Our data suggest that the visual perception of natural environments calls for less attentional and cognitive processing, compared with urban ones.

VR has been a tool to study emotion in psychology. At the same time, the study of emotion requires an objective indicator to avoid subjective judgment. One of the methods is to measure the EEG of humans, which reflects the real situation of the brain. In order to study the effects of VR on fear emotion, we conducted EEG data collection based on the VR roller coaster scene to stimulate fear. However, there exists severe artifacts in EEG data especially when the tester is opening eyes, which blocks the correct analysis of EEG. In this paper, we propose a new artifacts removal algorithm, named WpdAI-ICA, which performs better than relevant methods. With the recovered EEG data, we compare and analyze it in time and frequency domains, and show how VR affect emotion.

Although its efficacy in clinical effects has been reported, it is yet to be uncovered whether or how a specific band activity is controllable. Here, we examined EEG spectral profiles along with conditioning training of a specific brain activity, theta band (4 8 Hz) amplitude, in rats. Methods: During training, the experimental group received electrical stimulation to the medial forebrain bundle contingent to suppression of theta activity, while the control group received stimulation non-contingent to its own band activity. Results: In the experimental group, theta activity gradually decreased within the training session, while there was an increase of theta activity in the control group. There was a significant difference in theta activity during the sessions between the two groups. The spectral theta peak, originally located at 7 Hz, shifted further towards higher frequencies in the experimental group. Conclusion: Our results showed that an operant conditioning technique could train rats to control their specific EEG activity indirectly, and it may be used as an animal model for studying how neuronal systems work in human neurofeedback.

In order to analyze the EEG in real time, we have proposed an EEG analysis model using a nonlinear oscillator with one degree of freedom and minimum required parameters. Our method identifies EEG model parameters experimentally. The purpose of this study is to examine the specific characteristic of model parameters. Validation of the method and investigation of characteristic of model parameters were conducted based on alpha frequency EEG data in both relax state and stress state. The results of the parameter identification with the time sliding window for 1 second show almost all of the identified parameters have a normal distribution spread around the average. The model outputs can closely match the complicated experimental EEG data. The results also showed that the existence of nonlinear term in the EEG analysis is crucial and the linearity parameter shows a certain tendency as the nonlinearity increases. Furthermore, the activities of EEG become linear on the mathematical model when suddenly change from the relax state to the stress state. The results indicate that our method may provide useful information in various field including the quantification of human mental or psychological state, diagnosis of brain disease such as epilepsy and design of brain machine interface.

NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MODEL OF ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS INDUCED BY BREATHING TECHNIQUES	COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Breathing techniques; Pranayama; Slow breathing; Nasal breathing; Olfactory epithelium; Consciousness; States of consciousness; Psychophysiology; Neurophysiology	NASAL RESPIRATION; OLFACTORY SYSTEM; NETWORK ACTIVITY; MEDITATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; STRESS; MINDFULNESS; MODULATION	This paper is based on recent research on animal and human models related to the physiology of respiration. It aims at building an initial neurophysiological model of breathing practices, in order to explain how these techniques induce altered states of consciousness in humans. Confirming traditional long-term knowledge from the East, we suggest that air-induced mechanical nasal stimulation is crucial for reaching meditative states of consciousness during breathing practices. In a time of rapidly emerging data about higher-order functions of respiration, we speculate that the fine-tuned modulation driven by breathing on the interaction between brain and peripheric systems is possible only if it is associated with rhythmic oscillations from the olfactory bulb, dependent on nasal mechanical stimulation. We therefore consider the complex interactions between the modulation of the respiratory frequency, the training of voluntary top-down focused attention, and the specific breathing route involved, as a critical triad associated to meditative states of consciousness induced by breathing techniques. Further studies should investigate this hypothesis and the functional correlates involved in breathing techniques, adopting EEG and fMRI techniques, as well as new methods for phenomenological analysis of subjective experience.

Differing rates of hemispheric maturation could be linked to the proposed functional specialization of the hemispheres in which the left auditory cortex engages in analysis of precise timing information whereas the right auditory cortex focuses on analysis of sound frequency. Here the auditory change detection process for rapidly presented tone-pairs was examined in a longitudinal sample of infants at the age of 6 and 12 months using EEG. The ERP response related to change detection of a frequency contrast, its estimated source strength in the auditory areas, as well as time-frequency indices showed developmental effects. ERP amplitudes, source strength, spectral power and inter-trial phase locking decreased across age. A differential lateralization pattern emerged between 6 and 12 months as shown by inter-trial phase locking at 2-3 Hz; specifically, a larger developmental change was observed in the right as compared to the left hemisphere. Predictive relationships for the change in source strength from 6 months to 12 months were found. Six-month predictors were source strength and phase locking values at low frequencies. The results show that the infant change detection response in rapidly presented tone pairs is mainly determined by low frequency power and phase-locking with a larger phase-locking response at 6 months predicting greater change at 12 months. The ability of the auditory system to respond systematically across stimuli is suggested as a marker of maturational change that leads to more automatic and fine-tuned cortical responses.

In this study, a comparison was drawn between the brain waves of individuals living near high-voltage transmission towers and those of people living outside of these zones. The levels of stress and attention were also assessed based on the brain activity of the participants. First, a general questionnaire is completed by the volunteers, and the predisposed samples are included in the research following the screening process. Two 10-member groups (average age of 27years) of adult males were selected for the research. In one of the groups, the participants are not exposed to high-voltage electric fields. The homes of the members of the second group are located beneath or near high-voltage transmission towers (at a maximum distance of 20m). Using a 14-channel EEG system, the brain waves of each participant were recorded 5 times over 2days in the eyes-open resting state while the participants were looking at a white screen. (Ten records of data were obtained per person.) The saliva samples of each participant were also obtained to assess the basal cortisol hormone. The mean EEG stress and attention indices were obtained based on the data on each person, and the mean cortisol level of each group was compared to that of the other group. The investigation and comparison results proved that the mean EEG attention indices of people exposed to high-voltage electric fields were lower than those of the ordinary people. On the other hand, the mean levels of basal EEG stress and salivary cortisol hormone were higher in the people exposed to high-voltage electric fields than the ordinary people. Given the variations of the mean indices of stress and attention in the EEGs and salivary samples of the participants as a result, self-efficacy decreases over time.

On the Relative Contribution of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for SSVEP-Based Bio-Signal Decoding in BCI Speller Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; deep convolutional neural network; electroencephalography; steady state visual evoked potential; calibrationless; BCI; DCNN; CNN; EEG; SSVEP		Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) harnessing steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) manipulate the frequency and phase of visual stimuli to generate predictable oscillations in neural activity. For BCI spellers, oscillations are matched with alphanumeric characters allowing users to select target numbers and letters. Advances in BCI spellers can, in part, be accredited to subject-specific optimization, including; 1) custom electrode arrangements; 2) filter sub-band assessments; and 3) stimulus parameter tuning. Here, we apply deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) demonstrating cross-subject functionality for the classification of frequency and phase encoded SSVEP. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data are collected and classified using the same parameters across subjects. Subjects fixate forty randomly cued flickering characters (5x8 keyboard array) during concurrent wet-EEG acquisition. These data are provided by an open source SSVEP dataset. Our proposed DCNN, PodNet, achieves 86% and 77% offline accuracy of classification across-subjects for two data capture periods, respectively, 6-seconds (information transfer rate = 40 bpm) and 2-seconds (information transfer rate = 101 bpm). Subjects demonstrating suboptimal (<70%) performance are classified to similar levels after a short subject-specific training period. PodNet outperforms filter-bank canonical correlation analysis for a low volume (3-channel) clinically feasible occipital electrode configuration. The networks defined in this study achieve functional performance for the largest number of SSVEP classes decoded via DCNN to date. Our results demonstrate PodNet achieves cross-subject, calibrationless classification and adaptability to sub-optimal subject data, and low-volume EEG electrode arrangements.

This study investigated listener sex as an additional variable. Raw EEG data were collected as 21 males and 21 females discriminated /ba/ and /da/ in quiet and noisy backgrounds. Independent component analyses of data from accurately discriminated trials identified sensorimotor mu components with characteristic alpha and beta peaks from 16 members of each sex. Time-frequency decompositions showed that in quiet discrimination, females displayed stronger early mu-alpha synchronization, whereas males showed stronger mu-beta desynchronization. Findings indicate that early attentional mechanisms for speech discrimination were characterized by sensorimotor inhibition in females and predictive sensorimotor activation in males. Both sexes showed stronger early sensorimotor inhibition in noisy discrimination conditions versus in quiet, suggesting sensory gating of the noise. However, the difference in neural activation between quiet and noisy conditions was greater in males than females. Though sex differences appear unrelated to behavioral accuracy, they suggest that males and females exhibit early sensorimotor processing for speech discrimination that is fundamentally different, yet similarly adaptable to adverse conditions. Findings have implications for understanding variability in neuroimaging data and the male prevalence in various neurodevelopmental disorders with inhibitory dysfunction.

These patterns occur during the development of absence-epilepsy before fully-formed epileptic seizures. In the paper we analyze EEG signals of WAG/Rij rats with continuous wavelet transform to find particular features of proepileptic patterns in time-frequency domain. Then we develop new method for automated detection of proepileptic activity on EEG signals. We analyze results of method's performance and its efficiency.

In the current study, we obtained quantitative EEG (QEEG) recordings of 51 children aged between 6 and 12 years before the initiation of methylphenidate treatment. The relationship between changes in the scores of ADHD symptoms and initial QEEG features (power/power ratios values) were assessed. In addition, the children were classified as responder and nonresponder according to the ratio of their response to the medication (>25% improvement after medication). Logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the accuracy of QEEG features for predicting responders. The findings indicate that patients with increased delta power at F8, theta power at Fz, F4, C3, Cz, T5, and gamma power at T6 and decreased beta powers at F8 and P3 showed more improvement in ADHD hyperactivity symptoms. In addition, increased delta/beta power ratio at F8 and theta/beta power ratio at F8, F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, P3, and T5 showed negative correlations with Conners' score difference of hyperactivity as well. This means, those with greater theta/beta and delta/beta powers showed more improvement in hyperactivity following medication. Theta power at Cz and T5 and theta/beta power ratios at C3, Cz, and T5 have significantly classified responders and nonresponders according to the logistic binary regression analysis. The results show that slow and fast oscillations may have predictive value for treatment response in ADHD. Future studies should seek for more sensitive biomarkers.

Extinction-resistant attention to long-term conditioned threat is indexed by selective visuocortical alpha suppression in humans	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EXTINGUISHED FEAR; BRAIN DYNAMICS; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; ANXIETY; BIASES; FACE; DISENGAGEMENT; PERCEPTION	Previous electrophysiological studies in humans have shown rapid modulations of visual attention after conditioned threat vs. safety cues (<500 ms post-stimulus), but it is unknown whether this attentional prioritization is sustained throughout later time windows and whether it is robust to extinction. To investigate sustained visual attention, we assessed visuocortical alpha suppression in response to conditioned and extinguished threat. We reanalysed data from N = 87 male participants that had shown successful long-term threat conditioning and extinction in self reports and physiological measures in a two-day conditioning paradigm. The current EEG time-frequency analyses on recall test data on Day 2 revealed that previously threat-conditioned vs. safety cues evoked stronger occipital alpha power suppression from 600 to 1200 ms. Notably, this suppression was resistant to previous extinction. The present study showed for the first time that threat conditioning enhances sustained modulation of visuocortical attention to threat in the long term. Long-term stability and extinction resistance of alpha suppression suggest a crucial role of visuocortical attention mechanisms in the maintenance of learned fears.

Which areas may top-down regulate such cross-regional integration is largely unknown. We previously found that the moment-to-moment strength of high-a band (10-12 Hz) phase synchrony co-varies with activity in a fronto-parietal (FP) network. This network is critical for adaptive cognitive control functions such as cognitive flexibility required during set-shifting. Using electroencephalography (EEG) in 23 patients with focal frontal lobe lesions (resected tumors), we tested the hypothesis that the FP network is necessary for modulation of high-alpha band phase synchrony. Global phase-synchrony was measured using an adaptation of the phase-locking value (PLV) in a sliding window procedure, which allowed for measurement of changes in EEG-based resting-state functional connectivity across time. As hypothesized, the temporal modulation (range and standard deviation) of high-alpha phase synchrony was reduced as a function of FP network lesion extent, mostly due to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) lesions. Furthermore, patients with dlPFC lesions exhibited reduced cognitive flexibility as measured by the Trail-Making Test (set-shifting). Our findings provide evidence that the FP network is necessary for modulatory control of high-alpha band long-range phase synchrony, and linked to cognitive flexibility.

In this study, we propose a robust and simple automated multivariate empirical wavelet transform (MEWT) algorithm for the decoding of different MI tasks. The main contributions of this study are four-fold. First, the multiscale principal component analysis method is utilized in the preprocessing module to obtain robustness against noise. Second, a novel automated channel selection strategy is proposed and then is further verified with comprehensive comparisons among three different strategies for decoding channel combination selection. Third, a sub-band alignment method by utilizing MEWT is adopted to obtain joint instantaneous amplitude and frequency components for the first time in MI applications. Four, a robust correlation-based feature selection strategy is applied to largely reduce the system complexity and computational load. Extensive experiments for subject-specific and subject independent cases are conducted with the three-benchmark datasets from BCI competition III to evaluate the performances of the proposed method by employing typical machine-learning classifiers. For subject-specific case, experimental results show that an average sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy of 98% was achieved by employing multilayer perceptron neural networks, logistic model tree and least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers, respectively for three datasets, resulting in an improvement of upto 23.50% in classification accuracy as compared with other existing method. While an average sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy of 93%, 92.1% and 91.4% was achieved for subject independent case by employing LS-SVM classifier for all datasets with an increase of up to 18.14% relative to other existing methods. Results also show that our proposed algorithm provides a classification accuracy of 100% for subjects with small training size in subject-specific case, and for subject independent case by employing a single source subject. Such satisfactory results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed MEWT algorithm for practical MI EEG signals classification.

Waking qEEG to assess psychophysiological stress and alertness during simulated on-call conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Arousal; On-call; Shiftwork; Quantitative EEG; Stress; KDT; Inverted-U	EEG THETA/BETA RATIO; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; ALPHA; ATTENTION; VARIABILITY; BIOMARKER; BRAIN; APNEA	Introduction On-call schedules are associated with stress and disrupted sleep. In a recent study, under non-sleep deprived conditions, low and high-stress on-call conditions did not significantly impact sleep quality but did impact next day performance. Our aim was to determine whether quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) would reflect changes in cortical activity in on-call conditions, predicting that the high-stress condition would display faster qEEG frequencies compared with the control and low-stress condition. Methods: Twenty-four healthy male participants (age: 26.5 +/- 4.0 yrs) spent four nights in a time-isolated sleep laboratory. The within-subjects, repeated measures experimental design assessed waking EEG, via the Karolinska Drowsiness Test (KDT) during four time-points across a control day and two experimental (on-call) days. Experimental days comprised a low-stress (LS - reading task) and high-stress (HS - speech task) condition and were counterbalanced. Mixed-models analysis was used to assess condition and time by EEG biomarkers: Alpha Attenuation Coefficient (AAC), Slowing Ratio (SR) and Scaling Exponent (SE). Results: Main effects were found for all three biomarkers by condition, with pairwise analysis reported. There was a significant difference in AAC between the LS condition (M = 1.26 +/- = 1.24) and HS condition (M = 1.01 +/- 0.76 p =.02) indicating decreased alertness between LS and HS. A significant increase in SR between control (M = 7.1 +/- 4.3) and LS (M = 10.1 +/- 8.5 p =.0001), and a significant increase between the LS and HS (M = 7.8 +/- 6.8 p =.018) showing greatest EEG slowing in the LS condition, reflecting of a passive, sleepier brain state. The SE was significantly higher in the LS (M = 1.09, +/- 0.17) condition compared with control (M = 1.0, +/- 0.11 p =.001) indicating decreased alertness in the LS task. Discussion Using qEEG biomarkers, in contrast with our initial hypothesis, the current study found that compared with control, the LS condition resulted in greater EEG slowing.

Recently, the resection of brain tissue exhibiting coupling between the amplitude of HFOs and the phase of low frequencies demonstrated a more favorable surgical outcome. Here we compare the predictive value of ictal HFOs and four methods for quantifying the ictal phase-amplitude coupling, namely mean vector length, phase-locked high gamma, phase locking value, and modulation index (MI). We analyzed 32 seizures from 16 patients to identify the channels that exhibit HFOs and phase-locked HFOs during seizures. We compared the resection ratio, defined as the percentage of channels exhibiting coupling located in the resected tissue, with the postsurgical outcome. We found that the MI is the only method to show a significant difference between the resection ratios of patients with good and poor outcomes. We further show that the whole seizure, not only the onset, is critical to assess epileptogenicity using the phase-locked HFOs. We postulate that the superiority of MI stems from its capacity to assess coupling of discrete HFO events and its independence from the HFO power. These results confirm that quantitative analysis of HFOs can boost presurgical evaluation and indicate the paramount importance of algorithm selection for clinical applications.

We investigated whether learners participating in self-controlled practice exhibit increased neuro-cognitive engagement compared to externally controlled practice. Two groups (self-controlled and yoked) of 16 participants practiced and performed a golf putting task over 3 days. Working memory engagement, central executive activity, and cortical activation were assessed via electroencephalography as indicators of neuro-cognitive engagement. The self-controlled group exhibited more consistent working memory engagement, and greater central executive activity, compared to the yoked group during practice. Relationships were also observed between neuro-cognitive engagement during self-controlled practice and performance improvement, indicating that self-controlled practice uniquely benefitted from increased neuro-cognitive engagement.

Developmental differences in the neural correlates supporting semantics and syntax during sentence processing	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						development; EEG; ERP; neural oscillations; semantics; syntax	THETA-POWER INCREASES; LANGUAGE-DEVELOPMENT; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; EEG-THETA; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; POTENTIALS; CHILDREN; REVEAL	School-aged and adolescent children continue to demonstrate improvements in how they integrate and comprehend real-time, auditory language over this developmental time period, which can have important implications for academic and social success. To better understand developmental changes in the neural processes engaged during language comprehension in this age group, we use electroencephalography to investigate how 8-9 year old, 12-13 year olds, and adults process semantics and syntax in naturally paced, auditory sentences. Participants listened to semantically and syntactically correct and incorrect sentences and were asked to complete an acceptability judgment task. When processing a semantic error, developmental differences were observed in theta, but not the N400, suggesting that the N400 may be too gross a measure to identify more subtle aspects of semantic development that occur in the school years. For the syntactic task, errors resulted in a larger P600 and greater beta decrease than correct sentences, but the amplitude and location of the P600 and amplitude of beta decreases differed as a function of age, suggesting specialization of syntactic skills is ongoing through adolescence. The current findings shed new light on the development of the neural oscillations supporting language comprehension and suggest that the neural substrates underlying semantic processing reach adult-like levels at a younger age than those underlying syntactic processing.

We recently showed reduced frontal cortical oscillations in chronic schizophrenia (SCZ). Here we investigated the oscillatory activity of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients after TMS of a frontal area, the motor cortex. Compared to healthy controls, FEP patients had significantly reduced beta/low gamma oscillations, which were associated to worse clinical symptoms. Altogether, this study demonstrates that TMS/EEG recordings: 1) are feasible in acute, early-course psychotic patients; and 2) reveal intrinsic oscillatory deficits at illness onset, which may help design more effective, early interventions in SCZ.

Parameter estimation and identifiability in a neural population model for electro-cortical activity	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							SPECTRAL EDGE FREQUENCY; STRUCTURAL IDENTIFIABILITY; DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SLOPPINESS; ROBUSTNESS; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; NETWORKS	Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive measure of brain electrical activity. Neural population models, where large numbers of interacting neurons are considered collectively as a macroscopic system, have long been used to understand features in EEG signals. By tuning dozens of input parameters describing the excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, these models can reproduce prominent features of the EEG such as the alpha-rhythm. However, the inverse problem, of directly estimating the parameters from fits to EEG data, remains unsolved. Solving this multi-parameter non-linear fitting problem will potentially provide a real-time method for characterizing average neuronal properties in human subjects. Here we perform unbiased fits of a 22-parameter neural population model to EEG data from 82 individuals, using both particle swarm optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We estimate how much is learned about individual parameters by computing Kullback-Leibler divergences between posterior and prior distributions for each parameter. Results indicate that only a single parameter, that determining the dynamics of inhibitory synaptic activity, is directly identifiable, while other parameters have large, though correlated, uncertainties. We show that the eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix are roughly uniformly spaced over a log scale, indicating that the model is sloppy, like many of the regulatory network models in systems biology. These eigenvalues indicate that the system can be modeled with a low effective dimensionality, with inhibitory synaptic activity being prominent in driving system behavior. Author summary Electroencephalography (EEG), where electrodes are used to measure electric potential on the outside of the scalp, provides a simple, non-invasive way to study brain activity. Physiological interpretation of features in EEG signals has often involved use of collective models of neural populations. These neural population models have dozens of input parameters to describe the properties of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Being able to estimate these parameters by direct fits to EEG data holds the promise of providing a real-time non-invasive method of inferring neuronal properties in different individuals. However, it has long been impossible to fit these nonlinear, multi-parameter models effectively. Here we describe fits of a 22-parameter neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 different subjects, all exhibiting alpha-oscillations. We show how only one parameter, that describing inhibitory dynamics, is constrained by the data, although all parameters are correlated. These results indicate that inhibitory synaptic activity plays a central role in the generation and modulation of the alpha-rhythm in humans.

Characterizing peaks in the EEG power spectrum	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						EEG; power spectrum; oscillations; brain; alpha oscillation; spectral density; peak detection	ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; MONKEYS	The EEG is an important noninvasive brain signal measured from scalp electrodes with the potential for application in the diagnosis of neurological and mental health disorders. In this context analysis of the spectral properties of the EEG are an important aspect of understanding the signal. One characteristic of the signal that has been observed is the presence of intermittent periodicity or regular oscillatory activity under certain conditions. Typically, though not always, this periodicity occurs at similar to 10 Hz (called alpha oscillations) and is observed most reliably under eyes closed conditions as a peak in the power spectrum. In the literature the alpha oscillation is generally characterized by the power in the relevant band of the power spectrum. However, since it occurs embedded within a background of nonperiodic activity with a 1/f(gamma) spectral envelope, this approach does not separate the oscillation from the background nonperiodic activity and therefore provides an imprecise view that is largely determined by the spectral decay rather than the embedded periodicity. Here we present an approach to assess periodicity in the EEG signal that is robust to distortions by changes in the 1/f background nonperiodic activity and is particularly suited for detection of small peaks where the band is overwhelmed by the background decay. The method utilizes the second order derivative of the FFT of the signal autocorrelation to define the resulting metric 'Oscillation Energy' (or E-alpha for alpha oscillations). We demonstrate its performance compared to several variants of traditional power spectrummeasures with simulated signals and show its application to example EEG signals. We believe a more precise metric to characterize peaks arising from periodicity like this will enable researchers in the field to develop a clearer understanding of this feature of the signal and its relation to behaviors.

J	Tognoli, E				Tognoli, Emmanuelle			More than Meets the Mind's Eye? Preliminary Observations Hint at Heterogeneous Alpha Neuromarkers for Visual Attention	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						EEG; alpha; xi; Posner; covert attention	SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; HUMAN EEG; POWER; OSCILLATIONS; SPOTLIGHT; PHASE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DYNAMICS; BIAS	With their salient power distribution and privileged timescale for cognition and behavior, brainwaves within the 10 Hz band are special in human waking electroencephalography (EEG). From the inception of electroencephalographic technology, the contribution of alpha rhythm to attention is well-known: Its amplitude increases when visual attention wanes or visual input is removed. However, alpha is not alone in the 10 Hz frequency band. A number of other 10 Hz neuromarkers have function and topography clearly distinct from alpha. In small pilot studies, an activity that we named xi was found over left centroparietal scalp regions when subjects held their attention to spatially peripheral locations while maintaining their gaze centrally ("looking from the corner of the eyes"). I outline several potential functions for xi as a putative neuromarker of covert attention distinct from alpha. I review methodological aids to test and validate their functional role. They emphasize high spectral resolution, sufficient spatial resolution to provide topographical separation, and an acute attention to dynamics that caters to neuromarkers' transiency.

Dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation requirements in an autistic rat model	KOREAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						Autism; Dexmedetomidine; GABA(A); Glutamate; Propofol	SLEEP; BEHAVIOR; SENSITIVITY; ANESTHESIA; VALPROATE; CHILDREN; AGONIST; CORTEX; ACID	Background: Autism is a challenging neurodevelopmental disorder. Previous clinical observations have suggested altered sedation requirements for children with autism. Our study aimed to test this observation experimentally in an animal model and to explore its possible mechanisms. Methods: Eight adult pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups. Four were injected with intraperitoneal sodium valproate on gestational day 12 and four were injected with normal saline. On postnatal day 28, the newborn male rats were subjected to the open-field test to confirm autistic features. Each rat was injected intra-peritoneally with a single dose of propofol (50 mg/kg) or dexmedetomidine (0.2 mg/kg). The times to loss of righting reflex (LORR) and to return of righting reflex (RORR) were recorded. On the following day, all rats were re-sedated and underwent electroencephalography (EEG). Thereafter, the rats were euthanized and their hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) and glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor gene expressions were assessed. Results: Autistic rats showed significantly longer LORR times and shorter RORR times than did the controls (median LORR times: 12.0 versus 5.0 min for dexmedetomidine and 22.0 versus 8.0 min for propofol; P < 0.05). EEG showed a low-frequency, high-amplitude wave pattern 2 min after LORR in the control rats. Autistic rats showed a high-frequency, low-amplitude awake pattern. Hippocampal GABA(A) receptor gene expression was significantly lower and NMDA gene expression was greater in autistic rats. Conclusions: This study supports the clinical observations of increased anesthetic sedative requirements in children with autism and our biochemical analyses using GABA(A) and glutamate receptor gene expression highlight possible underlying mechanisms.

For comparison, we have taken into account different frequency bands related to sensorimotor stimuli and time segmentation in order to overcome the nonstationarity of the EEG signal. In addition, we have used a threshold algorithm to reduce the dimension of the connectivity matrix, conserving the connections that are most important for both methodologies. The results obtained from the BCI competition IV-2a database show that the variable can be measured between two different measurement spaces, using the Euclidean distance, conserving spatial zones with more meaningful physiological interpretation.

This investigation had the objective of record the brain electrical activity (EEG) in attention tasks (sustained and selective) in a group of polyconsumers. Employment a retrospective ex post-facto design with a quasi-control group with 46 adolescents between 12-17 years old: 23 polyconsumers and 23 quasi-controls. For the recording of brain electrical activity, it was used a equipment BCI (Brain Control Interface) research grade 14 Channel Mobile EEG and applied the Brain Training Virtual Program "Brain HQ" module "focus my attention" to evaluate the attention. The results showed an increase in beta-beta (13-30 Hz), theta-theta (4-7 Hz) and delta-delta (3-4 Hz) brain waves in frontal and prefrontal areas in adolescent polyonsumers versus the quasi-control group in attention tasks. Likewise, identified a significant difference with respect to the response time between adolescents consuming psychoactive substances in relation to the quasi-control group in both types of attentional tasks.

While the pain experience requires the integration of sensory and contextual processes, the cortical oscillations have been suggested to play a crucial role in pain processing and integration. The present study is aimed at identifying the abnormalities of spontaneous cortical oscillations among patients with SPD, thus for a better understanding of the ongoing brain states in these patients. Spontaneous electroencephalography data during a resting state with eyes open were recorded from SPD patients and healthy controls, and their cortical oscillations as well as functional connectivity were compared using both electrode-level and source-level analysis. Compared with healthy controls, SPD patients exhibited greater resting-state alpha oscillations (8.5-12.5Hz) at the parietal region, as reflected by both electrode-level spectral power density and exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) cortical current density. A significant correlation between parietal alpha oscillation and somatization severity was observed in SPD patients, after accounting for the influence of anxiety and depression. Functional connectivity analysis further revealed a greater frontoparietal connectivity of the resting-state alpha oscillations in SPD patients, which was indexed by the coherence between pairs of electrodes and the linear connectivity between pairs of eLORETA cortical sources. The enhanced resting-state alpha oscillation in SPD patients could be relevant with attenuated sensory information gating and excessive integration of pain-related information, while the enhanced frontoparietal connectivity could be reflecting their sustained attention to bodily sensations and hypervigilance to somatic sensations.

Compared to complex sleep analysis devices, automatic sleep stage classification methods using single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) records benefit from the convenience of wearing and less interference in the sleep, thus are appropriate for home-based sleep analysis. In these methods, the design of representative features for classification plays the most important role in determining the performance. Previous works have not achieved satisfactory outcomes for ignoring several kinds of effective features. In this work, a novel multimodal signal decomposition and feature extraction strategy is presented to obtain effective features for sub-band signals. Meanwhile, a rule-free refinement process based on hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed to optimize the classification results automatically. Experimental results show the superior classification performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art works, wherein the rule-free refinement also outperforms previous rule-based correction algorithms. This sleep stage classification method is expected to contribute to the design of home-based sleep monitoring and analyzing system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To address this issue, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to record infant neural responses at 6.5 and 9.5 months during observation of an adult either turning to look at the same object as the infant (congruent actor), or turning to look at a different object (incongruent actor). We also used a preferential looking paradigm to investigate whether infants would demonstrate a preference for the congruent versus incongruent actor. Greater suppression of alpha band activity in the congruent compared to incongruent condition was revealed at both ages in central and parietal regions. However, the effect of congruency on alpha suppression was stronger at 9.5 months, and only at this age did infants demonstrate a preference towards looking at the congruent actor. Together, these results suggest that although infants are sensitive to others' gaze following from early on, important neural and behavioural developments occur between 6.5 and 9.5 months.

The features used for classifier input play an important role in the classification results, while there is no exact method for defining the best feature for a classifier. In this paper, we use nine types of time frequency domains as features. We also use some feature selection methods to select the best feature for classification. We compare the results of classifications from each method of feature selection. This method is implemented using a DEAP (Dataset for emotion analysis using psychological signal) dataset. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the time-frequency domain feature extraction shows the best performance when using PCA feature selection and the k-NN classifier with a 60.68% recognition rate. This experiment also shows that there is no significant result between k-NN and weighted k-NN classification for each feature selection. In this case, we can conclude that the DEAP data needs a more reliable feature selection method.

This study analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics and body skin temperature as markers of attentional fluctuations in non-sleep deprived subjects during a 45 min Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Independent Component Analysis and time-frequency analysis were used to evaluate the EEG data. Results showed a positive association between distal and distal-to-proximal gradient (DPG) temperatures and reaction time (RT); increments in EEG power in alpha-, theta- and beta-band frequencies in parieto-occipital, central-medial and frontal components, were associated with poor performance (slower RT) in the task. This generalized power increment fits with an increased activity in the default mode network, associated with attention lapses. This study highlights the potential use of the PVT as a tool to obtain individual physiological indices of vigilance and fatigue that could be applied to other vigilance tasks typically performed in occupational settings.

Here, we used multiscale entropy (MSE) of electroencephalography (EEG)-a measure of brain signal complexity-to address this issue. Young males were randomly assigned to either a 20-day dual n-back training following aerobic exercise or the same training regimen following a reading. A feature binding working memory task with concurrent EEG recording was used to test for transfer effects. Although results revealed weak-to-moderate evidence for exercise-induced facilitation on cognitive training, the combination of cognitive training with exercise resulted in greater transfer gains on conditions involving greater attentional demanding, together with greater increases in cognitive modulation on MSE, compared with the reading condition. Overall, our findings suggest that the addition of antecedent physical exercise to brain training regimen could enable wider, more robust improvements.

Association of Perceived Maternal Stress During the Perinatal Period With Electroencephalography Patterns in 2-Month-Old Infants	JAMA PEDIATRICS			English	Article							EARLY-LIFE STRESS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; EEG; BRAIN; EXPERIENCES; CHILDREN; POWER; CHILDHOOD; MATURATION; BEHAVIOR	IMPORTANCE Variation in child responses to adversity creates a clinical challenge to identify children most resilient or susceptible to later risk for disturbances in cognition and health. Advances in establishing scalable biomarkers can lead to early identification and mechanistic understanding of the association of early adversity with neurodevelopment. OBJECTIVES To examine whether maternal reports of stress are associated with patterns in resting electroencephalography at 2 months of age and whether unique electroencephalographic profiles associated with risk and resiliency factors can be identified. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this cohort study, a population-based sample of 113 mother-infant dyads was recruited from January 1, 2016, to March 1, 2018, during regularly scheduled pediatric visits before infants were 2 months of age from 2 primary care clinics in Boston, Massachusetts, and Los Angeles, California, that predominantly serve families from low-income backgrounds. Data are reported from a single time point, when infants were aged 2 months, of an ongoing cohort study longitudinally following the mother-infant dyads. EXPOSURES Maternal reported exposure to stressful life events and perceived stress. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Spectral power (absolute and relative) in different frequency bands (Delta, theta, low and high alpha, beta, and gamma) from infant resting electroencephalography (EEG) and EEG profiles across frequency bands determined by latent profile analysis. RESULTS Of 113 enrolled infants, 70 (mean [SD] age, 2.42 [0.37] months; 35 girls [50%]) provided usable EEG data. In multivariable hierarchical linear regressions, maternal perceived stress was significantly and negatively associated with absolute beta (beta = -0.007; 95% CI, -0.01 to -0.001; semipartial r = -0.25) and. power (beta = -0.008; 95% CI, -0.01 to -0.002; semipartial r = -0.28). Maternal educational level was significantly and positively associated with power in high alpha, beta, and gamma bands after adjusting for covariates (high school: gamma: beta = 0.108; 95% CI, 0.014-0.203; semipartial r = -0.236; associate's degree or higher: high alpha: beta = 0.133; 95% CI, 0.018-0.248; semipartial r = 0.241; beta: beta = 0.167; 95% CI, 0.055-0.279; semipartial r = 0.309; and gamma: beta = 0.183; 95% CI, 0.066-0.299; semipartial r = 0.323). Latent profile analysis identified 2 unique profiles for absolute and relative power. Maternal perceived stress (beta = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.25; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28) and maternal educational level (high school: beta = 3.00; 95% CI, 0.35-5.65; AOR, 20.09; 95% CI, 1.42-283.16; associate's degree or higher: beta = 4.12; 95% CI, 1.45-6.79; AOR, 61.56; 95% CI, 4.28-885.01) were each associated with unique profile membership. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that unique contributions of caregiver stress and maternal educational level on infant neurodevelopment are detectable at 2 months; EEG might be a promising tool to identify infants most susceptible to parental stress and to reveal mechanisms by which neurodevelopment is associated with adversity. Additional studies validating subgroups across larger cohorts with different stressors and at different ages are required before use at the individual level in clinical settings.

Despite the effective application of deep learning (DL) in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, the successful execution of this technique, especially for inter-subject classification, in cognitive BCI has not been accomplished yet. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the attentive mental state from single-channel raw electroencephalography (EEG) data. Approach. We develop an end-to-end deep CNN to decode the attentional information from an EEG time series. We also explore the consequences of input representations on the performance of deep CNN by feeding three different EEG representations into the network. To ensure the practical application of the proposed framework and avoid time-consuming re-training, we perform inter-subject transfer learning techniques as a classification strategy. Eventually, to interpret the learned attentional patterns, we visualize and analyse the network perception of the attention and non-attention classes. Main results. The average classification accuracy is 79.26%, with only 15.83% of 120 subjects having an accuracy below 70% (a generally accepted threshold for BCI). This is while with the inter-subject approach, it is literally difficult to output high classification accuracy. This end-to-end classification framework surpasses conventional classification methods for attention detection. The visualization results demonstrate that the learned patterns from the raw data are meaningful. Significance. This framework significantly improves attention detection accuracy with inter-subject classification. Moreover, this study sheds light on the research on end-to-end learning; the proposed network is capable of learning from raw data with the least amount of pre-processing, which in turn eliminates the extensive computational load of time-consuming data preparation and feature extraction.

We investigated whether the regularity of interictal GOs is a biomarker of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) using multistate entropy analysis. Methods: We quantified the regularity of interictal GOs using intracranial EEG data from 1164 electrodes in 13 patients with FCD who were seizure-free postoperatively. The regularity of interictal GOs was quantified as entropy values. Low entropy represents high regularity. We standardized entropy values using Z values for each SOZ, resection area (RA), and the region outside the RA. The cutoff Z values, sensitivity, and specificity for detecting each area were calculated using area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs). Results: Low Z values represent higher regularity of GOs. The cutoff Z value of <=-2.09 for the SOZ had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97.1% (AUC = 0.992 0.002). The cutoff Z value of <=- 0.12 for the RA had a sensitivity of 54.2% and specificity of 73.8% (AUC = 0.673 +/- 0.019). The cutoff Z value of >=-0.11 for the region outside the RA had a sensitivity of 73.8% and specificity of 54.2% (AUC = 0.673 +/- 0.019). Conclusions: Low entropy of interictal GOs was a reliable biomarker for the SOZ. Maintained high entropy of interictal GOs may be an auxiliary biomarker for nonepileptogenic regions. Significance: Low entropy of interictal GOs may be a biomarker for the SOZ in FCD type II. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent behavioral studies indicated that children with ADHD are more likely to fail to show the orienting effect in response to human eye gaze. The present study aimed to identify the neurophysiological bases of attention deficits directed by social human eye gaze in children with ADHD, focusing on the relationship between alpha modulations and ADHD symptoms. The electroencephalography data were recorded from 8-13 year-old children (typically developing (TD): n = 24; ADHD: n = 21) while they performed a cued visuospatial covert attention task. The cues were designed as human eyes that might gaze to the left or right visual field. The results revealed that TD children showed a significant alpha lateralization in response to the gaze of human eyes, whereas children with ADHD showed an inverse pattern of alpha modulation in the left parieto-occipital area. Importantly, the abnormal alpha modulation in the left hemisphere predicted inattentive symptom severity and behavioral accuracy in children with ADHD. These results suggest that the dysfunction of alpha modulation in the left hemisphere in response to social cues might be a potential neurophysiologic marker of attention deficit in children with ADHD.

Time-Frequency Delta Activity to Social Feedback Demonstrates Differential Associations With Depression and Social Anxiety Symptoms	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						time-frequency; delta; theta; social feedback processing; social anxiety; depression	BLUNTED NEURAL RESPONSE; MONETARY REWARDS; EEG DYNAMICS; THETA; VALIDATION; POSITIVITY; REACTIVITY; BEHAVIOR; EMOTION; SYSTEMS	Social feedback is highly salient and particularly relevant when investigating the pathophysiology of depression and social anxiety. A bourgeoning body of research has demonstrated an association between reward-related delta activity and psychopathology. However, a critical limitation is that these findings are derived from neural responses to monetary feedback, and time-frequency representation of social feedback remains unexplored. In addition, no study has isolated the differential/unique associations of positive valence and the intrinsic rewarding experience of being correct with reward-related neural activity. In the present study, 204 participants underwent electroencephalography (EEG) while they completed a novel paradigm comprised of monetary and social feedback tasks that were matched in trial structure, timing, and feedback stimuli. For each task, participants were instructed to correctly identify one of two doors that would provide positive feedback (monetary win behind the door) or one of two peers who would provide positive feedback (social like); or to correctly identify the door or peer that would provide negative feedback (money loss behind the door/social dislike). A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the time-frequency data and revealed two factors in the delta and one factor in the theta frequency ranges. Results indicated that the lower-frequency delta factor (delta-low) was greater to correct vs. incorrect feedback, more so for social vs. monetary tasks, while the higher-frequency delta factor (delta-high) was greater to correct vs. incorrect feedback for social like, social dislike, and monetary win tasks, but not the monetary loss task. In contrast, the theta factor was greater to incorrect relative to correct feedback in negative valence (lose money/social dislike) but not positive valence (win money/social like) tasks. Furthermore, greater delta-high activity for social feedback was associated with greater social anxiety symptoms, whereas lesser delta-high activity for social feedback was associated with greater depressive symptoms. Finally, greater theta activity to monetary feedback was associated with greater depressive symptoms. The present study provides novel evidence demonstrating unique social vs. monetary feedback-related delta and theta activity, and differential associations between delta activity with depression and social anxiety symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of investigating feedback-related neural responses in the social domain.

Sleep deprivation (SD) strongly affects both wake and sleep EEG, but a description of the topographical EEG power spectra and oscillatory activity during the wake-sleep transition after a period of prolonged wakefulness is still missing. The increased homeostatic sleep pressure should induce an earlier onset of sleep-related EEG oscillations. The aim of the present study was to assess the spatiotemporal EEG pattern at SO following SD. A dataset of a previous study was analyzed. We assessed the spatiotemporal EEG changes (19 cortical derivations) during the SO (5 min before vs. 5 min after the first epoch of Stage 2) of a recovery night after 40 h of SD in 39 healthy subjects, analyzing the EEG power spectra (fast Fourier transform) and the oscillatory activity [better oscillation (BOSC) detection method]. The spatiotemporal pattern of the EEG power spectra mostly confirmed the changes previously observed during the wake-sleep transition at baseline. The comparison between baseline and recovery showed a wide increase of the post- vs. pre-SO ratio during the recovery night in the frequency bins <= 10 Hz. We found a predominant alpha oscillatory rhythm in the pre-SO period, while after SO the theta oscillatory activity was prevalent. The oscillatory peaks showed a generalized increase in all frequency bands from delta to sigma with different predominance, while beta activity increased only in the fronto-central midline derivations. Overall, the analysis of the EEG power replicated the topographical pattern observed during a baseline night of sleep but with a stronger intensity of the SO-induced changes in the frequencies <= 10 Hz, and the detection of the rhythmic activity showed the rise of several oscillations at SO after SD that was not observed during the wake-sleep transition at baseline (e.g., alpha and frontal theta in correspondence of their frequency peaks). Beyond confirming the local nature of the EEG pattern at SO, our results show that SD has an impact on the spatiotemporal modulation of cortical activity during the falling-asleep process, inducing the earlier emergence of sleep-related EEG oscillations.

Theta-band power derived from scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG), which may be associated with dopamine levels in frontal cortex, has also been shown to be atypical in ASD. The present study examined spontaneous eye-blink rate (EBR), an indirect, non-invasive measure of central dopaminergic activity, and theta power in children with ASD to determine: 1) whether ASD may be associated with atypical DA levels, and 2) whether dopaminergic dysfunction may be associated with aberrant theta-band activation. Method: Participants included thirty-two children with ASD and thirty-two age-, IQ-, and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children. Electroencephalography and eye-tracking data were acquired while participants completed an eyes-open resting-state session. Blinks were counted and EBR was determined by dividing blink frequency by session duration and theta power (4-7.5 Hz) was extracted from midline leads. Results: Eye-blink rate and theta-band activity were significantly reduced in children with ASD as compared to their TD peers. For all participants, greater midline theta power was associated with increased EBR (related to higher DA levels). Conclusions: These results suggest that ASD may be associated with dopaminergic hypo-activity, and that this may contribute to atypical theta-band power. Lastly, EBR may be a useful tool to non-invasively index dopamine levels in ASD and could potentially have many clinical applications, including selecting treatment options and monitoring treatment response.

Combat exposure increases an individual's chance of developing PTSD, making veterans especially susceptible to the disorder. PTSD is characterized by dysregulated emotional networks, memory deficits, and a hyperattentive response to perceived threatening stimuli. Recently, there have been a number of imaging studies that show structural and functional abnormalities associated with PTSD; however, there have been few studies utilizing electroencephalography (EEG). The goal of this study was to characterize **EEG brain dynamics in individuals with PTSD, in order to better understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of some of the salient features of PTSD, such as threat-processing bias. Veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom/Iraqi Freedom completed an implicit visual threat semantic memory recognition task with stimuli that varied on both category (animals, items, nature, and people) and feature (threatening and nonthreatening) membership, including trauma-related stimuli. Combat veterans with PTSD had slower reaction times for the threatening stimuli relative to the combat veterans without PTSD (VETC). There were trauma-specific effects in frontal regions, with theta band EEG power reductions for the threatening combat scenes in the PTSD patients compared to the VETC group. Additionally, a moderate negative correlation was observed between trauma-specific frontal theta power and hyperarousal symptoms as measured by clinically administered PTSD scale. These findings complement and extend current models of cortico-limbic dysfunction in PTSD. The moderate negative correlation between frontal theta power and hyperarousal endorsements suggests the utility of these measures as therapeutic markers of symptomatology in PTSD patients.

It is a dual task consisting of a distractor subtask and a memory subtask. Though multiple studies have utilized complex span tasks, the electrophysiological correlates underlying the encoding and retrieval processes in working memory span task remain uninvestigated. One previous study that assessed electroencephalographic (EEG) measures utilizing complex span task found no significant difference between its working memory loads, a typical index observed in other working memory tasks (e.g., n-back task and digital span task). The following design constructs of the paradigm might have been the reason. (1) The fixed-time limit of the distractor subtask may have hindered the assessment of individual WMC precisely. (2) Employing a linear-system-favoring EEG data analysis method for a non-linear system such as the human brain. In the current study, the participants perform the Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAMP) task on 1 day and the symmetry span (Sspan) task on the other. Prior to the formal Sspan task, the participants were instructed to judge 15 simple symmetry questions as quickly as possible. A participant-specific time-limit is chartered from these symmetry questions. The current study utilizes the Sspan task sequential to a distractor subtask. Instead of the fixed time-limit exercised in the previous study, the distractor subtask of the current study was equipped with the participant-specific time-limit obtained from the symmetry questions. This could provide a precise measure of individual WMC. This study investigates if the complex span task resonates EEG patterns similar to the other working memory tasks in terms of working memory-load by utilizing ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) of Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Prior expectations were to observe a decrement in the P300 component of event-related mode (ERM) and a decrement in the power of alpha and beta band frequency with increasing working memory-load. We observed a significantly higher P300 amplitude for the low-load condition compared to the high-load condition over the circumscribed brain network across F4 and C4 electrodes. Time-frequency analysis revealed a significant difference between the high- and low-load conditions at alpha and beta band over the frontal, central, and parietal channels. The results from our study demonstrate precise differences in EEG data pertaining to varied memory-load differences in the complex span task. Thus, assessing complex span tasks with the HHT-based analysis may aid in achieving a better signal to noise ratio and effect size for the results in working memory EEG studies.

Variations of such connectivity patterns between different cognitive tasks can be evaluated using pairwise synchronization measures applied to electrophysiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). However, connectivity-based task recognition approaches achieving viable recognition performance have been lacking from the literature. By using several synchronization measures, we identify time lags between channel pairs during different cognitive tasks. We employed mutual information, cross correntropy, cross correlation, phase locking value, cosine similarity and nonlinear interdependence measures. In the training phase, for each type of cognitive task, we identify the time lags that maximize the average synchronization between channel pairs. These lags are used to calculate pairwise synchronization values with which we construct the train and test feature vectors for recognition of the cognitive task carried out using Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) analysis. We tested our framework in a motor imagery activity recognition scenario on PhysioNet Motor Movement/Imagery and BCI Competition-III IVa datasets. For PhysioNet dataset, average performance results ranging between % 51 and % 61 across 20 subjects. For BCI Competition-III dataset, we achieve an average recognition performance of % 76 which is above the minimum reliable communication rate (% 70). We achieved an average accuracy over the minimum reliable communication rate on the BCI Competition-III dataset. Performance levels were lower on the PhysioNet dataset. These results indicate that a viable task recognition system is achievable using pairwise synchronization measures evaluated at the proper task specific lags.	[Olcay, B.

J	Zama, T; Takahashi, Y; Shimada, S				Zama, Takuro; Takahashi, Yoshiyuki; Shimada, Sotaro			Simultaneous EEG-NIRS Measurement of the Inferior Parietal Lobule During a Reaching Task With Delayed Visual Feedback	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; near-infrared spectroscopy; simultaneous measurement; psychophysiological interaction; event-related (de)synchronization; inferior parietal lobule; visual feedback delay	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; RUBBER HAND ILLUSION; HUMAN BRAIN; ACTION ORGANIZATION; ALPHA-BAND; MU-RHYTHM; MOTOR; OSCILLATIONS	We investigated whether the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) responds in real-time to multisensory inconsistency during movement. The IPL is thought to be involved in both the detection of inconsistencies in multisensory information obtained during movement and that obtained during self-other discrimination. However, because of the limited temporal resolution of conventional neuroimaging techniques, it is difficult to distinguish IPL activity during movement from that during self-other discrimination. We simultaneously conducted electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with the goal of examining IPL activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution during single reaching movements. Under a visual feedback-delay condition, gamma event-related synchronization (gamma-ERS), i.e., an increase in gamma (31-47 Hz) EEG power occurred during reaching movements. This gamma-ERS is considered to reflect processing of information about prediction errors. To integrate this temporal information with spatial information from the NIRS signals, we developed a new analysis technique that enabled estimation of the regions that show a hemodynamic response characterized by EEG fluctuation present in the visual feedback-delay condition. As a result, IPL activity was explained by gamma-ERS specific to visual feedback delay during movements. Thus, we succeeded in demonstrating real-time activation of the IPL in response to multisensory inconsistency. However, we did not find any correlation between either IPL activity or gamma-ERS with the sense of agency. Therefore, our results suggest that while the IPL is influenced by prediction error signals, it does not engage in direct processing underlying the conscious experience of making a movement, which is the foundation of self-other discrimination.

In neuroimaging studies, investigations on extraversion in face-to-face verbal interactions are still scarce. This study presents an electroencephalography (EEG)-based investigation of the extraversion personality trait in relation to eye contact during face-to-face interactions, as this is a vital signal in social interactions. A sample of healthy male participants were selected (consisting of sixteen more extraverted and sixteen less extraverted individuals) and evaluated with the Eysenck's Personality Inventory (EPI) and Big Five Inventory (BFI) tools. EEG alpha oscillations in the occipital region were measured to investigate extraversion personality trait correlates of eye contact during a face-to-face interaction task and an eyes-open condition. The results revealed that the extraversion personality trait has a significant positive correlation with EEG alpha coherence in the occipital region, presumably due to its relationship with eye contact during the interaction task. Furthermore, the decrease in EEG alpha power during the interaction task compared to the eyes-open condition was found to be greater in the less extraverted participants; however, no significant difference was observed between the less and more extraverted participants. Overall, these findings encourage further research towards the understanding of neural mechanism correlates of the extraversion personality trait-particularly in social interaction.

Assessing Feedback Response With a Wearable Electroencephalography System	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						applied neuroscience; EEG; P3; N2; FRN; brain computer interfaces	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; WIRELESS EEG; REWARD; OSCILLATIONS; NEGATIVITY; STIMULI	Background: Event related potential (ERP) components, such as P3, N2, and FRN, are potential metrics for assessing feedback response as a form of performance monitoring. Most research studies investigate these ERP components using clinical or research-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems. Wearable EEGs, which are an affordable alternative, have the potential to assess feedback response using ERPs but have not been sufficiently evaluated. Feedback-related ERPs also have not been scientifically evaluated in interactive settings that are similar to daily computer use. In this study, a consumer-grade wearable EEG system was assessed for its feasibility to collect feedback-related ERPs through an interactive software module that provided an environment in which users were permitted to navigate freely within the program to make decisions. Methods: The recording hardware, which costs <$1,500 in total, incorporated the OpenBCI Cyton Board with Daisy chain, a consumer-grade EEG system that costs $949 USD. Seventeen participants interacted with an oddball paradigm and an interactive module designed to elicit feedback-related ERPs. The features of interests for the oddball paradigm were the P3 and N2 components. The features of interests for the interactive module were the P3, N2, and FRN components elicited in response to positive, neutral, and two types of negative feedback. The FRN was calculated by subtracting the positive feedback response from the negative feedback responses. Results: The P3 and N2 components of the oddball paradigm indicated statistically significant differences between infrequent targets and frequent targets which is in line with current literature. The P3 and N2 components elicited in the interactive module indicated statistically significant differences between positive, neutral, and negative feedback responses. There were no significant differences between the FRN types and significant interactions with channel group and FRN type. Conclusion: The OpenBCI Cyton, after some modifications, shows potential for eliciting and assessing P3, N2, and FRN components, which are important indicators for performance monitoring, in an interactive setting.

Objectives: Identifying potential differences between children with mild and sever ASD based on EEG analysis using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and second-order difference plot (SODP) models, and determining the accuracy of such model outcome measures to distinguish ASD severity levels. Methods: Resting-state EEG data recorded for 36 children, who divided equally into two matched groups of mild and sever ASD. EMD analysis was applied to their EEG data to identify intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) features, SODP patterns, elliptical area and central tendency measure (CTM) values. Artificial neural network then used to determine the accuracy of this models outcome measures in distinguishing between the two ASD groups. Results: Children with sever ASD showed smaller, less twitches and oscillation of IMFs features, more stochastic SODP plotting, less CTM values, and higher ellipse area values compared to the children with mild ASD, which indicates their greater EEG variabilities and their greater inability to suppress their improper behavior. ANN ended with model sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 94.7%, respectively, and 97.2% overall accuracy of distinguishing between ASD groups. Conclusion: Children with sever and mild ASD had different IMFs features, SODP plotting, elliptical area and CTM values. In addition, these EMD outcome measures could serve as a sensitive automated tool to distinguish different severity levels in children with ASD.

Pharmaco-electroencephalographic responses in the rat differ between active and inactive locomotor states	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amphetamine; d-cycloserine; diazepam; DOI; ketamine	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; D-CYCLOSERINE; DIZOCILPINE MK-801; FIELD POTENTIALS; MOUSE MODELS; KETAMINE; GAMMA	Quantitative electroencephalography from freely moving rats is commonly used as a translational tool for predicting drug-effects in humans. We hypothesized that drug-effects may be expressed differently depending on whether the rat is in active locomotion or sitting still during recording sessions, and proposed automatic state-detection as a viable tool for estimating drug-effects free of hypo-/hyperlocomotion-induced effects. We aimed at developing a fully automatic and validated method for detecting two behavioural states: active and inactive, in one-second intervals and to use the method for evaluating ketamine, DOI, d-cycloserine, d-amphetamine, and diazepam effects specifically within each state. The developed state-detector attained high precision with more than 90% of the detected time correctly classified, and multiple differences between the two detected states were discovered. Ketamine-induced delta activity was found specifically related to locomotion. Ketamine and DOI suppressed theta and beta oscillations exclusively during inactivity. Characteristic gamma and high-frequency oscillations (HFO) enhancements of the NMDAR and 5HT(2A) modulators, speculated associated with locomotion, were profound and often largest during the inactive state. State-specific analyses, theoretically eliminating biases from altered occurrence of locomotion, revealed only few effects of d-amphetamine and diazepam. Overall, drug-effects were most abundant in the inactive state. In conclusion, this new validated and automatic locomotion state-detection method enables fast and reliable state-specific analysis facilitating discovery of state-dependent drug-effects and control for altered occurrence of locomotion. This may ultimately lead to better cross-species translation of electrophysiological effects of pharmacological modulations.

Correlation analysis of EEG alpha rhythm is related to golf putting performance	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Golf putting; Electroencephalography(EEG); Inertial mocap; Correlation	POWER CHANGES; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMPRESSION	It is aimed at finding the correlation between golfer's performance and EEG signals from the successful and unsuccessful putts. To address this issue, the inertial motion capture(mocap) system and wireless Emotiv equipment have been introduced to collect simultaneously the golfer's performance data and EEG signals in 6 right-handed expert golfers and 6 right-handed amateur golfers. Inertial mocap modules were placed on right arm, right leg of subjects and the club-head. Subjects stood upright on a golf green simulator while playing 80 golf putts with Emotiv recording simultaneously. Then, wavelet packet decomposition(WPD) was used for extracting the alpha wave: low-frequency(8-10 Hz) and high-frequency(10-12 Hz). The correlation of alpha rhythm power spectral in two electrodes should be estimated to analyze the relationship between successful and unsuccessful putts and EEG signals. The results of the statistical variance indicated that AF3-AF4(left ahead frontal-right ahead frontal areas) and O1-O2(left occipital-right occipital areas) had a higher spectral correlation of alpha rhythm in successful putts than that in unsuccessful putts. Alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) in the successful putts was higher than that in the unsuccessful condition and fluctuated obviously. F3-AF3(frontal-ahead frontal areas), F3-O2(left frontal-occipital areas), F4-F8, F4-O2(right frontal-occipital areas) and F4-AF3 had a higher negative correlation of successful putts from -2 s to zero time than that from the -5 s to -2 s of the putting time. P7-AF3(parietal-ahead frontal areas) had a higher negative correlation of both successful putts and unsuccessful putts from -2 s to zero time than that from the -5 s to -2 s of the putting time. P7-O2(parietal-occipital areas) had a higher negative correlation of successful putts from -2 s to zero time than that from the -5 s to -2 s of the putting time. P8-AF3 and P8-O2 had a higher negative correlation of the successful putts from -2 s to zero time than that from the -5 s to -2 s of the putting time. Experimental results of the club-head putting acceleration showed that the putting acceleration of overall high-skilled golfer was more stable than that of amateur golfers', that had a higher successful rate of putts. Statistical results of putting acceleration of the professional players and amateur players indicated that professional players had a higher successful and stable putts than others. Experimental results demonstrated that alpha rhythm plays a major role in cognition, judgment, sensory and motor. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Ji, L.; Wang, H.; Zheng, T. Q.; Hua, C.

Functional neuroimaging studies investigated brain dysfunction during motor task or resting state and primarily have shown altered patterns of activation and connectivity for motor areas. L-dopa administration relatively normalized these functional alterations. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of L-dopa administration on functional connectivity in early-stage PD, as revealed by simultaneous recording of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Six patients with diagnosis of probable PD underwent EEG-fMRI acquisitions (1.5 T MR scanner and 64-channel cap) before and immediately after the intake of L-dopa. Regions of interest in the primary motor and sensorimotor regions were used for resting state fMRI analysis. From the EEG data, weighted partial directed coherence was computed in the inverse space after the removal of gradient and cardioballistic artifacts. fMRI results showed that the intake of L-dopa increased functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network, and between motor areas and both attention and default mode networks. EEG connectivity among regions of the motor network did not change significantly, while regions of the default mode network showed a strong tendency to increase their outflow toward the rest of the brain. This pilot study provided a first insight into the potentiality of simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions in PD patients, showing for both techniques the analogous direction of increased connectivity after L-dopa intake, mainly involving motor, dorsal attention and default mode networks.

The brain activity of patients suffering from epilepsy is monitored through electroencephalography (EEG). The multivariate nature of features from time domain, frequency domain, complexity and wavelet entropy based, and the statistical features were extracted from healthy and epileptic subjects using the Bonn University database and seizure and non-seizure intervals using the CHB MIT database. The robust machine learning regression methods based on regression, support vector regression (SVR), regression tree (RT), ensemble regression, Gaussian process regression (GPR) were employed for detecting and predicting epileptic seizures. Performance was measured in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), squared error, mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Moreover, detailed optimization was performed using a RT to predict the selected features from each feature category. A deeper analysis was conducted on features and tree regression methods where optimal RMSE and MSE results were obtained. The best optimal performance was obtained using the ensemble boosted regression tree (BRT) and exponential GPR with an RMSE of 0.47, an MSE (0.22), an R Square (RS) (0.25) and an MAE (0.30) using the Bonn University database and support vector machine (SVM) fine Gaussian with RMSE (0.63634), RS (0.03), MSE (040493) and MAE (0.31744); squared exponential GPR and rational quadratic GPR with an RMSE of 0.63841, an RS (0.03), an MSE (0.40757) and an MAE (0.3472) was obtained using the CHB MIT database. A further deeper analysis for the prediction of selected features was performed on an RT to compute the optimal feasible point, observed and estimated function values, function evaluation time, objective function evaluation time and overall elapsed time.

To address this issue, we used a multimodal imaging approach (voxel-based morphometry, diffusion-tensor imaging, electroencephalography) to test the contribution of brain structures and neural oscillations in an elderly population. Thirty-one healthy elderly participants performed a change-detection task with different load conditions. As expected, accuracy decreased with increasing WM load, reflected by power modulations in the theta-alpha band (5-12 Hz). Importantly, these power changes were directly related to the tract strength between parahippocampus and parietal cortex. Furthermore, between-subject variance in gray matter volume of the parahippocampus and dorsal striatum predicted WM accuracy. Together, our findings provide new evidence that WM performance critically depends on parahippocampal and striatal integrity, while theta-alpha oscillations may provide a mechanism to bind the nodes within the WM network.

The aim of this study was to examine the neural dynamics of inhibitory control in demographically matched groups of young, healthy adults (N = 61) who reported engaging in binge (BD) or light drinking patterns (LD). Electroencephalography signal was recorded during a fast-paced visual Go/NoGo paradigm probing the ability to inhibit prepotent responses. No group differences were found in task performance. BDs showed attenuated event-related theta (4-7 Hz) on inhibition trials compared to LDs, which correlated with binge episodes and alcohol consumption but not with measures of mood or disposition including impulsivity. A greater overall decrease of early beta power (15-25 Hz) in BDs may indicate deficient preparatory "inhibitory brake" before deliberate responding. The results are consistent with deficits in the inhibitory control circuitry and are suggestive of allostatic neuroadaptive changes associated with binge drinking.

Athletic performance is affected by emotional state. Athletes may underperform in competition due to poor emotion regulation. Movement speed plays an important role in many competition events. Flexible control of movement speed is critical for effective athletic performance. Although behavioral evidence showed that negative emotion can influence movement speed, the nature of the relationship remains controversial. Thus, the present study investigated how negative emotion affects movement speed and the neural mechanism underlying the interaction between emotion processing and movement control. Methods. The present study combined electroencephalography (EEG) technology with a cued-action task to investigate the effect of negative emotion on movement speed. In total, 21 undergraduate students were recruited for this study. Participants were asked to perform six consecutive action tasks after viewing an emotional picture. Pictures were presented in two blocks (one negative and one neutral). After the participants completed a set of tasks (neutral of negative), they were subjected to complete a 9-point self-assessment manikin scale. Participants underwent EEG while performing the tasks. Results. At the behavior level, there was a significant main effect of emotional valence on movement speed, with participants exhibiting significantly slower movements in the negative emotional condition than in the neutral condition. EEG data showed increased theta oscillation and larger P1 amplitude in response to negative than to neural images suggesting that more cognitive resources were required to process negative than neutral images. EEG data also showed a larger late CNV area in the neutral condition than in the negative condition, which suggested that there was a significant decrease in brain activation during action tasks in negative emotional condition than in the neural. While the early CNV did not reveal a significant main effect of emotional valence. Conclusion. The present results indicate that a negative emotion can slow movement, which is largely due to negative emotional processing consuming more resources than non-emotional processing and this interference effect mainly occurred in the late movement preparation phase.

This ability is affected by the progressive cognitive decline observed in aging. The aims of this study were to shed light on the neural spectral dynamics involved in interference control and to investigate age-dependent differences in these dynamics. For these reasons two samples of participants of different ages (23 younger and 20 older adults, age range = [18 35] and [66 82], respectively) were recruited and administered a spatial Stroop task while recording electroencephalographic activity. Scalp- and source-based time-frequency analyses revealed a main role of theta and beta frequencies in interference control. Specifically, for the theta band, we found age-dependent differences both for early event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) Stroop effects at the source level - which involved dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices - and for related brain-behaviour correlations. This ERSP Stroop effect in theta was greatly reduced in magnitude in the older group and, differently from what observed in younger participants, it was not correlated with behavioural performance. These results suggest an age-dependent impairment of the theta-related mechanism signalling the need of cognitive control, in line with existing findings. We also found age-related differences in ERSP and source spectral activity involving beta frequencies. Indeed, younger participants showed a specific ERSP Stroop effect in beta - with the main involvement of left prefrontal cortex - whereas the pattern of older participants was delayed in time and spread bilaterally over the scalp. This study shows clear age-related differences in the neural spectral correlates of cognitive control. These findings open new questions about the causal involvement of specific oscillations in different cognitive processes and may inspire future interventions against age-related cognitive decline.

A comprehensive discussion of the data from electroencephalographic studies in DS humans and transgenic/trisomic mouse models is provided, as well as data from signals collected from local field potentials (LFP) and intracellular recordings in DS mouse models. The first sections focus specially on the alpha phenotype consistently observed in DS subjects, as well as its description in DS childhood and aging. Subsequently, a review of the data reported in DS mouse models is presented with the aim to deepen on the mechanisms underlying altered rhythmic patterns. Further sections situate the state-of-the-art of the field, with a discussion on the possible circuit alterations that may underlie impaired alpha and gamma oscillatory activity. A further aim is to highlight the importance of studying network oscillatory activity in mouse models to infer alterations in the underlying circuits related to cognition, such as in intellectual disability. In this direction, a view of alpha and gamma rhythms generated by the cerebral cortex as a tool for evaluating an unbalance between excitation and inhibition in DS is claimed, which points out toward an over-inhibited network. A final aim is to situate oscillatory activity as a key phenomenon that may be used as a biomarker for monitoring as well the effect of novel therapeutic strategies.

Neural correlates of the DMT experience assessed with multivariate EEG	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; DOSE-RESPONSE; N,N-DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE; UNDERLIES; AYAHUASCA; HUMANS; STATES	Studying transitions in and out of the altered state of consciousness caused by intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT - a fast-acting tryptamine psychedelic) offers a safe and powerful means of advancing knowledge on the neurobiology of conscious states. Here we sought to investigate the effects of IV DMT on the power spectrum and signal diversity of human brain activity (6 female, 7 male) recorded via multivariate EEG, and plot relationships between subjective experience, brain activity and drug plasma concentrations across time. Compared with placebo, DMT markedly reduced oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands and robustly increased spontaneous signal diversity. Time-referenced and neurophenomenological analyses revealed close relationships between changes in various aspects of subjective experience and changes in brain activity. Importantly, the emergence of oscillatory activity within the delta and theta frequency bands was found to correlate with the peak of the experience - particularly its eyes-closed visual component. These findings highlight marked changes in oscillatory activity and signal diversity with DMT that parallel broad and specific components of the subjective experience, thus advancing our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of immersive states of consciousness.

Absence epileptic seizures are neurological disorders which are manifested as abnormal EEG patterns. Matching pursuit algorithm is able to decompose a signal into components with specific time-frequency characteristics. It is a robust technique especially when there is complex, multicomponent signal. In the present study, a clinical dataset containing 40 annotated absence seizures in long-term EEG recordings from pediatric epileptic patients (with age 6.0 +/- 2.9 years) was analyzed. The extracted MP features fed an automatic classification schema which achieved a time window based discrimination accuracy of 98.5%. As indicated by the study's results, the proposed features and analysis methods can be a promising addition to the area of automatic absence seizures detection.

Sensorimotor beta power reflects the precision-weighting afforded to sensory prediction errors	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT; CEREBELLUM; INFERENCE; MODEL	It has been proposed that accurate motor control relies on Bayesian inference that integrates sensory input with prior contextual knowledge (Bays and Wolpert 2007; Kording and Wolpert, 2004; Wolpert et al., 1995). Recent evidence has suggested that modulations in beta power (similar to 12-30 Hz) measured over sensorimotor cortices using electroencephalography (EEG) may represent parameters of Bayesian inference. While the well characterised post-movement beta synchronisation has been shown to correlate with prediction error (H. Tan, Jenkinson, & Brown, 2014; Huiling Tan, Wade, & Brown, 2016), recent evidence suggests that beta power may also represent uncertainty measures (Tan et al., 2016; Tzagarakis et al., 2015). The current study aimed to measure the neurophysiological correlates of uncertainty mediating Bayesian updating during a visuomotor adaptation paradigm in healthy human participants. In particular, sensory uncertainty was directly modulated to measure its effect on sensorimotor beta power. Participant's behaviour was modelled using the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) in order to extract the latent variables involved in learning actions required by the task and correlate these with the measured EEG. We found that sensorimotor beta power correlated with inverse uncertainty afforded to sensory prediction errors both prior to and following a movement. This suggests that sensorimotor beta oscillations may more readily represent relative uncertainty within the sensorimotor system rather than error. Neurophysiological models describing the generation of beta oscillations offer a potential mechanism by which this neural signature may encode latent uncertainty parameters. This is essential for understanding how the brain controls behaviour.

(b) To develop a new statistical method to follow bout-to-bout dynamics. Method: Wistar rats (n = 6) had been equipped with electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) electrodes. Following their recovery and habituation after the surgery, the animals were injected with vehicle and 5- and 10-mg/kg AM-251 intraperitoneally and EEG, EMG, and motor activity were analyzed for the subsequent 3 h. Results: AM-251 induced a dose-and time-dependent increase in the number of bouts in active wake (AW), and it decreased this number in all other vigilance states except in passive wake (PW). In contrast, the bout duration in PW compensatory decreased. The effect of AM-251 on the sleep transition dynamics was monitored with a new tool we call "transition heatmap." The analysis of bout trajectories with transition heatmaps reveals a highly organized pattern. Conclusion: AM-251 selectively influences the frequency of vigilance state transitions, but it has no direct impact on the state lengths. AM-251 markedly changed the state transition dynamics, which was visualized with the help of state transition heatmaps.

While research has strongly linked parietal P3 amplitude reduction (P3AR) to genetic risk for problematic substance use, few studies have tested whether prefrontal EEG measures are sensitive to this genetic liability. In addition to P3, oddball target detection tasks elicit medial frontal theta power, reflecting attentional allocation, and parietal delta, indexing decision making or stimulus-response link updating. Midfrontal theta and parietal delta may index neurocognitive processes relevant to PSU beyond P3AR. The present investigation examined the etiological relationship between PSU and P3, frontal theta, and parietal delta in a large twin sample (N = 754). EEG was recorded during a visual oddball task. Greater PSU was associated with reduced target P3 amplitude and midfrontal theta/parietal delta power, and increased mean reaction time and reaction time variability (RTV; indexing attentional fluctuations). P3, theta, and RTV, but not delta or mean RT, explained unique variance in PSU (R-2 = 0.04). Twin biometric modeling indicated a genetic relationship between PSU and P3, theta, and RTV. Theta accounted for distinct genetic variance in PSU beyond P3 and RTV. Together, 23% of the total additive genetic variance in PSU was explained by the three endophenotypes. Results replicate P3AR as an endophenotype and provide support for additional behavioral (RTV) and neurophysiological (midfrontal theta) endophenotypes of PSU. Reduced theta and greater RTV may reflect variations in a prefrontal attentional network that confers genetic risk for substance use problems.

Our method is devised to detect possibly subtle disruptions in normal brain functioning that precede the onset of an epileptic seizure. Moreover, it is able to capture the evolution of seizure spread from one region (or channel) to another. The proposed frequency-specific change-point detection method (FreSpeD) deploys a cumulative sum-type test statistic within a binary segmentation algorithm. We demonstrate the theoretical properties of FreSpeD and show its robustness to parameter choice and advantages against two competing methods. Furthermore, the FreSpeD method produces directly interpretable output. When applied to epileptic seizure EEG data, FreSpeD identifies the correct brain region as the focal point of seizure and the timing of the seizure onset. Moreover, FreSpeD detects changes in cross-coherence immediately before seizure onset which indicate an evolution leading up to the seizure. These changes are subtle and were not captured by the methods that previously analyzed the same EEG data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

However, the effects of rTMS-MT on inter-hemispheric lateralization remain unclear. Nineteen healthy volunteers were recruited. The volunteers were randomized to receive 2 weeks of rTMS-MT or MT to improve the motor function of the nondominant hand. Hand dexterity was tested by the Nine-Hole Peg Test. Resting motor threshold ( RMT), motor evoked potentials (MEP) and electroencephalography (EEG) in the resting state with eyes closed were recorded, to calculate inter-hemispheric lateralization before and after rTMS-MT or MT. rTMS-MT and MT improved the dexterity and MEP amplitude of the nondominant hand. Furthermore, there were significant changes in the lateralization of not only power spectral density, but also information transmission efficiency between regions following rTMS-MT, especially between the central cortices of both hemispheres. However, although the lateralization change of the power spectral density between the central cortices was observed following MT, there was no such change for information transmission efficiency between any cortices. These results suggested that rTMS-MT could modulate inter-hemispheric lateralization.

However, recent studies have suggested a more nuanced perspective in which alpha oscillations also facilitate processes of cognitive control and perceptual stability. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over occipitoparietal cortex at 10 Hz (alpha-tACS) can selectively enhance EEG alpha power. To assess the contribution of alpha oscillations to attention, we delivered alpha-tACS across 4 experiments while 178 participants performed sustained attention tasks. Poor performance on all visual tasks was previously associated with increased EEG alpha power. We therefore predicted initially that alpha-tACS would consistently impair visual task performance. However, alpha-tACS was instead found to prevent deteriorations in visual performance that otherwise occurred during sham-and 50 Hz-tACS. This finding was observed in 2 experiments, using different sustained attention tasks. In a separate experiment, we also found that alpha-tACS limited improvements on a visual task where learning was otherwise observed. Consequently, alpha-tACS appeared to exert a consistently stabilizing effect on visual attention. Such effects were not seen in an auditory control task, indicating specificity to the visual domain. We suggest that these results are most consistent with the view that alpha oscillations facilitate processes of top-down control and attentional stability.

Insights into the brain mechanisms of chronic pain promise to advance the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and might help to develop disease markers and novel treatments. Here, we systematically exploited the potential of electroencephalography to determine abnormalities of brain function during the resting state in chronic pain. To this end, we performed state-of-the-art analyses of oscillatory brain activity, brain connectivity, and brain networks in 101 patients of either sex suffering from chronic pain. The results show that global and local measures of brain activity did not differ between chronic pain patients and a healthy control group. However, we observed significantly increased connectivity at theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (>60 Hz) frequencies in frontal brain areas as well as global network reorganization at gamma frequencies in chronic pain patients. Furthermore, a machine learning algorithm could differentiate between patients and healthy controls with an above-chance accuracy of 57%, mostly based on frontal connectivity. These results suggest that increased theta and gamma synchrony in frontal brain areas are involved in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Although substantial challenges concerning the reproducibility of the findings and the accuracy, specificity, and validity of potential electroencephalography-based disease markers remain to be overcome, our study indicates that abnormal frontal synchrony at theta and gamma frequencies might be promising targets for noninvasive brain stimulation and/or neurofeedback approaches.

Frequency-Dependent Changes in Resting State Electroencephalogram Functional Networks after Traumatic Brain Injury in Piglets	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						EEG; functional network; pediatric brain injury; porcine; resting state	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; ROTATIONAL HEAD-INJURY; POSTCONCUSSIONAL-SYNDROME; QUANTITATIVE EEG; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SLEEP EEG; CONNECTIVITY; ISOFLURANE; NEWBORN; OXYGEN	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern in children, as it can cause chronic cognitive and behavioral deficits. The lack of objective involuntary metrics for the diagnosis of TBI makes prognosis more challenging, especially in the pediatric context, in which children are often unable to articulate their symptoms. Resting state electroencephalograms (EEG), which are inexpensive and non-invasive, and do not require subjects to perform cognitive tasks, have not yet been used to create functional brain networks in relation to TBI in children or non-human animals; here we report the first such study. We recorded resting state EEG in awake piglets before and after TBI, from which we generated EEG functional networks from the alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (16.5-25 Hz), broad (1-35 Hz), delta (1-3.5 Hz), gamma (30-35 Hz), sigma (13-16 Hz), and theta (4-7.5 Hz) frequency bands. We hypothesize that mild TBI will induce persistent frequency-dependent changes in the 4-week-old piglet at acute and chronic time points. Hyperconnectivity was found in several frequency band networks after TBI. This study serves as proof of concept that the study of EEG functional networks in awake piglets may be useful for the development of diagnostic metrics for TBI in children.

Active touch, which involves tactile and proprioceptive sensing under the control of movement, is the dominant tactile exploration mechanism compared to passive touch (being touched). This paper investigates the role of friction stimulation objectively and quantitatively in active touch tasks, in a real human-computer interaction on a touch-screen device. In this study, 24 participants completed an active touch task involved stroking the virtual strings of a guitar on a touch-screen device while recording the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. Statistically significant differences in beta and gamma oscillations in the middle frontal and parietal areas at the late period of the active touch task are found. Furthermore, stronger beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) and rebound in the presence of friction stimulation in the contralateral parietal area are observed. However, in the ipsilateral parietal area, there is a difference in beta oscillation only at the late period of the motor task. As for implicit emotion communication, a significant increase in emotional responses for valence, arousal, dominance, and satisfaction is observed when the friction stimulation is applied. It is argued that the friction stimulation felt by the participants' fingertip in a touch-screen device further induces cognitive processing compared to the case when no friction stimulation is applied. This study provides objective and quantitative evidence that friction stimulation is able to affect the bottom-up sensation and cognitive processing.

We investigated the neural dynamics of this decision process by analyzing the neural electrical signals acquired from electroencephalography (EEG) during a value-based action-selection task. In particular, we determined whether sensorimotor beta oscillations, traditionally studied in the context of motor control, are also involved in value-based decision making for actions. Additionally, we examined the involvement of this beta signal relative to other neural signals such as the ERP components P2 and P3, which have been previously identified in reward processing and value computations. Our results from healthy young adults (N = 31), showed a significant decrease in sensorimotor beta power during a decision phase without any motor response, in addition to an action phase when a response was made. The decision-phase beta signal was preceded by the P2/P3b components, and all of these neural signals reliably dissociated the different reward and risk levels, suggesting the encoding of decision variables. Importantly, while the beta signal during both the action and decision phase predicted behavioral performance (i.e., response time) in the action phase, the preceding P2/P3b had no such predictive association with the behavior. Collectively, these results demonstrate a unique contribution of the motor system in value-based decision making for actions, via the translation of motivational information into a motor signal across time.

The goal is to identify how the EEG features of a visual learner differ from those of a non-visual learner. The idea is to measure the students' EEGs during the resting states (eyes open and eyes closed conditions) and when performing learning tasks. For this purpose, 34 healthy subjects are recruited. The subjects have no background knowledge of the animated learning content. The subjects are shown the animated learning content in a video format. The experiment consists of two sessions and each session comprises two parts: (1) Learning task: the subjects are shown the animated learning content for an 8-10 min duration. (2) Memory retrieval task The EEG signals are measured during the leaning task and memory retrieval task in two sessions. The retention time for the first session was 30 min, and 2 months for the second session. The analysis is performed for the EEG measured during the memory retrieval tasks. The study characterizes and differentiates the visual learners from the non-visual learners considering the extracted EEG features, such as the power spectral density (PSD), power spectral entropy (PSE), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The PSD and DWT features are analyzed. The EEG PSD and DWT features are computed for the recorded EEG in the alpha and gamma frequency bands over 128 scalp sites. The alpha and gamma frequency band for frontal, occipital, and parietal regions are analyzed as these regions are activated during learning. The extracted PSD and DWT features are then reduced to 8 and 15 optimum features using principal component analysis (PCA). The optimum features are then used as an input to the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier using the Mahalanobis distance metric, with 10-fold cross validation and support vector machine (SVM) classifier using linear kernel, with 10-fold cross validation. The classification results showed 97% and 94% accuracies rate for the first session and 96% and 93% accuracies for the second session in the alpha and gamma bands for the visual learners and non-visual learners, respectively, for k-NN classifier for PSD features and 68% and 100% accuracies rate for first session and 100% accuracies rate for second session for DWT features using k-NN classifier for the second session in the alpha and gamma band. For PSD features 97% and 96% accuracies rate for the first session, 100% and 95% accuracies rate for second session using SVM classifier and 79% and 82% accuracy for first session and 56% and 74% accuracy for second session for DWT features using SVM classifier. The results showed that the PSDs in the alpha and gamma bands represent distinct and stable EEG signatures for visual learners and non-visual learners during the retrieval of the learned contents.

Sleep staging is an important basis for the diagnosis of sleep disorders and other related diseases. The process of automatic staging of sleep is mainly divided into three core steps: data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Accurate analysis of the features of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is not only helpful to improve the accuracy of sleep staging, but also help people to understand their sleep status. Methods: This paper focuses on the analysis of EEG features during sleep staging, and reviews many feature extraction methods and classification methods for sleep staging and sums up these algorithms used in literatures and its staging results. Besides, this paper lists a total of 22 features based on time domain, time-frequency, and nonlinear analysis methods, including kurtosis, skewness, Hjorth parameters, and standard deviations, wavelets energy; sample entropy (SampEn), fuzzy entropy, Tsallis entropy, fractal dimension (FD), complexity. The data set comes from EDF database. Wavelet transform (WT) and support vector machine (SVM) are used to achieve the sleep staging based on single-channel EEG signal. And the characteristic feature data was analyzed by ANOVA. Results: By comparison, the SampEn, fuzzy entropy, FD and complexity can achieve ideal sleep staging. The highest accuracy of sleep staging is 85.93%. The FD and complexity are simpler than the entropy value, but their accuracies are lower. Furthermore, the distribution of these methods in different sleep period is more significant than others, which is content with the results of sleep staging. Conclusion: In a word, due to the non-stationary and non-linear characteristics of EEG signals, time domain and time-frequency analysis methods all have some limitations. Nonlinear analysis was more effective and practical for the analysis of sleep EEG. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the use of EEG algorithmic complexity derived metrics for its prognosis. We analyzed resting state EEG data collected from 114 idiopathic RBD patients and 83 healthy controls in a longitudinal study forming a cohort in which several RBD patients developed PD or dementia with Lewy bodies. Multichannel data from similar to 3 min recordings was converted to spectrograms and their algorithmic complexity estimated using Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression. Complexity measures and entropy rate displayed statistically significant differences between groups. Results are compared to those using the ratio of slow to fast frequency power, which they are seen to complement by displaying increased sensitivity even when using a few EEG channels. Poor prognosis in RBD appears to be associated with decreased complexity of EEG spectrograms stemming in part from frequency power imbalances and cross-frequency amplitude algorithmic coupling. Algorithmic complexity metrics provide a robust, powerful and complementary way to quantify the dynamics of EEG signals in RBD with links to emerging theories of brain function stemming from algorithmic information theory.

Neurofeedback impacts cognition and quality of life in pediatric focal epilepsy: An exploratory randomized double-blinded sham-controlled trial	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Cognition; Quality of life; Pediatric focal epilepsy; Placebo effect	SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; SELF-REGULATION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; ATTENTION; PLACEBO; COMORBIDITIES; BIOFEEDBACK; DISORDERS; CORTEX; SCALE	Objective: Children with epilepsy experience cognitive deficits and well-being issues that have detrimental effects on their development. Pharmacotherapy is the standard of care in epilepsy: however, few interventions exist to promote cognitive development and to mitigate disease burden. We aimed to examine the impact of two different modalities of neurofeedback (NFB) on cognitive functioning and quality-of-life (QOL) measurements in children and adolescents with controlled focal epilepsy. The study also explored the effects of NFB on dinical outcomes and electroencephalography (EEG) quantitative analysis. Methods: Participants (n = 44) with controlled focal epilepsy were randomized to one of three arms: sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) NFB (n = 15), slow cortical potentials (SCP) NFB (n = 16), or sham NFB (n = 13). All participants received 25 sessions of intervention. The attention switching task (AST), Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS), seizure frequency (SF), EEG power spectrum, and coherence were measured at baseline, postintervenlion, and at 3-month follow-up. Results: In children and adolescents with controlled focal epilepsy, SMR training significantly reduced reaction time in the AST (p = 0.006), and this was correlated with the difference of change for theta power on EEG (p = 0.03); only the SMR group showed a significant decrease in beta coherence (p = 0.03). All groups exhibited improvement in QOL (p = <0.05). Conclusions: This study provides the first data on two NFB modalities (SMR and SCP) including cognitive, neurophysiological, and clinical outcomes in pediatric epilepsy. Sensorimotor rhythm NFB improved cognitive functioning, while all the interventions showed improvements in QOL, demonstrating a powerful placebo effect in the sham group. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although there are neurophysiological changes 24-48 hours before migraine attacks, so far, they have not been used in patients' management. This study evaluates the applicability and the ability to identify pre-attack changes of daily "at home" electroencephalography obtained with a portable system for migraine patients. Methods Patients with episodic migraine fulfilling ICHD-3 beta criteria used a mobile system composed of a wireless EEG device (BrainStation (R), Neuroverse (R), Inc., USA) and mobile application (BrainVitals(M)(R), Neuroverse (R), Inc., USA) to self-record their neural activity daily at home while resting and while performing an attention task, over the course of 2 weeks. Standard EEG spectral analysis and event-related brain potentials (ERP) methods were used and recordings were grouped by time from migraine attacks (i.e. "Interictal day", "24 h Before Migraine", "Migraine day" and "Post Migraine"). Results Twenty-four patients (22 women) recorded an average of 13.3 +/- 1.9 days and had 2 +/- 0.9 attacks. Twenty-four hours before attack onset, there was a statistically significant modulation of relative power in the delta (decrease) and beta (increase) frequency bands, at rest, and a significant reduction of the amplitude and inter-trial coherence measures of an attention event-related brain potential (P300). Conclusions This proof-of-concept study shows that brain state monitoring, utilising an easy-to-use wearable EEG system to track neural modulations at home, can identify physiological changes preceding a migraine attack enabling valuable pre-symptom prediction and subsequent early intervention.

Automated feature learning using deep convolutional auto-encoder neural network for clustering electroencephalograms into sleep stages	2019 9TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE/EMBS International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAR 20-23, 2019	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMBS			QUANTITATIVE EEG; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS	Deep neural networks have emerged as popular machine learning tools due to their ability to automatically learn feature representations from raw input data. An auto-encoder neural network is a special network that can be trained in an unsupervised manner for automated feature learning. Unsupervised analysis of EEG signals is highly desirable since supervised analysis requires manual labeling of EEG signals which can be labor intensive and time consuming given the large amount of EEG data collected. We present a deep convolutional auto-encoder neural network to automatically learn feature representations from raw EEG signals in an unsupervised manner. We use the features extracted from the auto-encoder neural network for clustering EEG signals into sleep stages. For clustering, we test two algorithms: K-means -- which is a single-membership model, and the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model -- which is a mixed membership model. Results are presented demonstrating an improvement in clustering performance using auto-encoder features compared to standard manually extracted features.

Scalp recorded spike ripples predict seizure risk in childhood epilepsy better than spikes	BRAIN			English	Article						high frequency oscillations; HFO; BECTS; EEG biomarker; high density EEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; STATISTICAL TURING TEST; BENIGN EPILEPSY; CENTROTEMPORAL SPIKES; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; DRUG-TREATMENT; CHILDREN; EEG; MONOTHERAPY	In the past decade, brief bursts of fast oscillations in the ripple range have been identified in the scalp EEG as a promising non-invasive biomarker for epilepsy. However, investigation and clinical application of this biomarker have been limited because standard approaches to identify these brief, low amplitude events are difficult, time consuming, and subjective. Recent studies have demonstrated that ripples co-occurring with epileptiform discharges ('spike ripple events') are easier to detect than ripples alone and have greater pathological significance. Here, we used objective techniques to quantify spike ripples and test whether this biomarker predicts seizure risk in childhood epilepsy. We evaluated spike ripples in scalp EEG recordings from a prospective cohort of children with a self-limited epilepsy syndrome, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and healthy control children. We compared the rate of spike ripples between children with epilepsy and healthy controls, and between children with epilepsy during periods of active disease (active, within 1 year of seizure) and after a period of sustained seizure-freedom (seizure-free, > 1 year without seizure), using semi-automated and automated detection techniques. Spike ripple rate was higher in subjects with active epilepsy compared to healthy controls (P = 0.0018) or subjects with epilepsy who were seizure-free ON or OFF medication (P = 0.0018). Among epilepsy subjects with spike ripples, each month seizure-free decreased the odds of a spike ripple by a factor of 0.66 [95% confidence interval (0.47, 0.91), P = 0.021]. Comparing the diagnostic accuracy of the presence of at least one spike ripple versus a classic spike event to identify group, we found comparable sensitivity and negative predictive value, but greater specificity and positive predictive value of spike ripples compared to spikes (P = 0.016 and P = 0.006, respectively). We found qualitatively consistent results using a fully automated spike ripple detector, including comparison with an automated spike detector. We conclude that scalp spike ripple events identify disease and track with seizure risk in this epilepsy population, using both semi-automated and fully automated detection methods, and that this biomarker outperforms analysis of spikes alone in categorizing seizure risk. These data provide evidence that spike ripples are a specific non-invasive biomarker for seizure risk in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and support future work to evaluate the utility of this biomarker to guide medication trials and tapers in these children and predict seizure risk in other at-risk populations.

BCI systems based on Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) are widely used in recent decades. Different feature extraction methods have been introduced in the literature to estimate SSVEP responses to BCI applications. Methods: In this study, the new algorithms, including Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), L1-regularized Multi-way CCA (L1-CCA), Multi-set CCA (MsetCCA), Common Feature Analysis (CFA), and Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) are compared using proper statistical methods to determine which one has better performance with the least number of EEG electrodes. Results: It was found that MLR, MsetCCA, and CFA algorithms provided the highest performances and significantly outperformed CCA, LASSO, and L1-CCA algorithms when using 8 EEG channels. However, when using only 1 or 2 EEG channels d, CFA method provided the highest F-scores. This algorithm not only outperformed MLR and MsetCCA when applied on different electrode montages but also provided the fastest computation time on the test set. Conclusion: Although MLR method has already demonstrated to have higher performance in comparison with other frequency recognition algorithms, this study showed that in a practical SSVEP-based BCI system with 1 or 2 EEG channels and short-time windows, CFA method outperforms other algorithms. Therefore, it is proposed that CFA algorithm is a promising choice for the expansion of practical SSVEP-based BCI systems.

For instance, during the preictal phase, migraineurs experience symptoms and signs of altered pain perception as well as other well-known premonitory CNS-symptoms. In the present study we measured EEG-activation to non-painful motor and sensorimotor tasks in the different phases of the migraine cycle by longitudinal measurements of beta event related desynchronization (beta-ERD).MethodsWe recorded electroencephalography (EEG) of 41 migraine patients and 31 healthy controls. Each subject underwent three EEG recordings on three different days with classification of each EEG recording according to the actual migraine phase. During each recording, subjects performed one motor and one sensorimotor task with the flexion-extension movement of the right wrist.ResultsMigraine patients had significantly increased beta-ERD and higher baseline beta power at the contralateral C3 electrode overlying the primary sensorimotor cortex in the preictal phase compared to the interictal phase. We found no significant differences in beta-ERD or baseline beta power between interictal migraineurs and controls.ConclusionIncreased preictal baseline beta activity may reflect a decrease in pre-activation in the sensorimotor cortex. Altered pre-activation may lead to changes in thresholds for inhibitory responses and increased beta-ERD response, possibly reflecting a generally increased preictal cortical responsivity in migraine. Cyclic fluctuations in the activity of second- and third-order afferent somatosensory neurons, and their associated cortical and/or thalamic interneurons, may accordingly also be a central part of the migraine pathophysiology.

However, it remains unknown how the prefrontal and parietal cortices collaborate to accomplish RGDC. To this end, a novel experimental design was used that presented Chinese characters in a chunking task, testing eighteen undergraduate students (9 females, mean age = 22.4 years) while recoding the electroencephalogram (EEG). In the experiment, radical-level chunking was accomplished in a timely stringent way (RT = 1485 ms, SD = 371 ms), whereas the stroke-level chunking was accomplished less coherently (RT = 3278 ms, SD = 1083 ms). By comparing the differences between radical-level chunking vs. stroke-level chunking, we were able to dissociate the chunking processes in the radical-level chunking condition within the analyzed time window (-200 to 1300 ms). The chunking processes resulted in an early increase of gamma band synchronization over parietal and occipital cortices, followed by enhanced power in the beta-gamma band (25-38 Hz) over frontal areas. We suggest that the posterior rhythmic activities in the gamma band may underlie the processes that are directly associated with perceptual manipulations of chunking, while the subsequent beta-gamma activation over frontal areas appears to reflect a post-evaluation process such as reinforcement of the selected rules over alternative solutions, which may be an important characteristic of goal-directed chunking.

Electroencephalography correlates of transcranial direct-current stimulation enhanced surgical skill learning: A replication and extension study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						tDCS; EEG; Motor learning; Surgery; Performance; Neuromodulation	HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY; MOTOR CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; ACQUISITION; EEG; MOVEMENT; TDCS; FUNDAMENTALS; OSCILLATIONS	Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), an increasingly applied form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can augment the acquisition of motor skills. Motor learning investigations of tDCS are limited to simple skills, where mechanisms are increasingly understood. Investigations of meaningful, complex motor skills possessed by humans, such as surgical skills, are limited. This replication and extension of our previous findings used elec-troencephalography (EEG) to determine how tDCS and complex surgical training alters electrical activity in the sensorimotor network to enhance complex surgical skill acquisition. In twenty-two participants, EEG was recorded during baseline performance of simulation-based laparoscopic surgical skills. Participants were randomized to receive 20 min of primary motor cortex targeting anodal tDCS or sham concurrent to 1 h of surgical skill training. EEG was reassessed following training, during a post-training repetition of the surgical tasks. Our results replicated our previous study suggesting that compared to sham, anodal tDCS enhanced the acquisition of unimanual surgical skill. Surgical training modulated delta frequency band activity in sensorimotor regions. Next, the performance of unimanual and bimanual skills evoked unique EEG profiles, primarily within the beta frequency-band in parietal regions. Finally, tDCS-paired surgical training independently modulated delta and alpha frequency-bands in sensorimotor regions. Application of tDCS during surgical skill training is feasible, safe and tolerable. In conclusion, we are the first to explore electrical brain activity during performance of surgical skills, how electrical activity may change during surgical training and how tDCS alters the brain to enhance skill acquisition. The results provide preliminary evidence of neural markers that can be targeted by neuromodulation to optimize complex surgical training.

In the present study, we evaluated the characteristics of resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in patients with gambling disorder. In addition, we explored the association between the EEG characteristics of the patients and the stages of change in a transtheoretical model. Methods: All participants were men who visited a gambling disorder clinic in Seoul, Korea. At the assessment, questionnaires, including the Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ), were administered and resting-state EEGs were carried out. Participants were grouped based on Ward's method for cluster analysis. Independent sample t-tests were used to evaluate group differences. To assess the relationship between the clinical data and the EEG recordings, we used Pearson's partial correlation analysis. Results: Overall, 63 male participants were enrolled. Cluster analysis of the alpha activity revealed two clusters. No significant differences were observed in the demographic or clinical data between the two groups except for the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We found that the precontemplation score of the RCQ was positively correlated with the z-score of the relative alpha power in almost all cortical regions. Conclusion: This study suggests that EEG parameters, particularly alpha activity, could inform us about the subtypes or stages of change in gambling disorder. Alpha power is the predominant EEG rhythm in a relaxed, alert person; thus, alpha power serves as an index of relaxation. We expect that the level of alpha activity could be utilized as an additional parameter to help clinicians assess and treat patients with gambling disorder.

An improvement on BCIs could be achieved by enhancing brain signals from the source via subject intention-based modulation. In this work, we aim to investigate the effects of task complexity on performance of motor imagery (MI) based BCIs. In specific, we studied the effects of motor imagery of a complex task versus a simple task on discriminability of brain activation patterns using EEG. The results show an increase of up to 7.25% in BCI classification accuracy for motor imagery of the complex task in comparison to the simple task. Furthermore, spectral power analysis in low frequency bands, alpha and beta, shows a significant decrease in power value for the complex task. However, high frequency gamma band analysis unveils a significant increase for the complex task. These findings may lead to designing better BCIs with high performance.	[Mashat, M.

This article presents some of the benefits of using psycho-physiological data in analyzing consumer valuation and choice. Eye-tracking, facial expressions, and electroencephalography (EEG) data were used to construct three non-conventional choice models, namely, eye-tracking, emotion and brain model. The predictive performance of the non-conventional models was compared to a baseline model, which was based entirely on conventional data. While the emotion and brain models proved to be as good as conventional data in explaining and predicting consumer choice, the eye-tracking model generated superior predictions. Moreover, we document a significant increase in predictive power when biometric data from different sources were combined into a mixed model. Finally, we utilize a machine learning technique to sparse the data and enhance out-of-sample prediction, thus showcasing the compatibility of biometric data with well-established statistical and econometric methods.

A notable number of neuroscientific studies have been conducted applying magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEEG) in resting state paradigms to elucidate neural correlates of tinnitus. In these studies, recordings were usually performed without particular instructions to the participant. Thus, it remains unclear whether resulting MEEG measures may have been affected by attention on the actual tinnitus percept. In order to investigate this potential source of variance in tinnitus MEEG resting state results, we investigated the difference between non-instructed resting state (RS) and active listening to tinnitus (AL) using questionnaires as well as EEG power analysis (n = 45). Questionnaire scores for the two conditions resulted in significant increases in tinnitus distress and presence during AL. Beyond that, no differences in EEG band power were found between the conditions both on the sensor and source levels. Results point to an expected increased tinnitus presence and distress in the AL condition on the behavioral level. These behavioral changes are not reflected in changes in EEG oscillatory power, which is especially surprising when looking at the alpha band related to general external and internal attentional processes. Furthermore, no changes in other frequency bands (delta, theta, beta, gamma) attributed to aspects of tinnitus distress, loudness, and maintenance were observed. In conclusion, the absence of EEG power changes between conditions may be in support of a chronic and invariant state of altered MEEG signatures in tinnitus. Further studies are needed to better elucidate MEEG resting state paradigms in tinnitus.

This condition, which is associated with an increased risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease, has no known definitive treatment at present. In this open-label pilot study we explored the possible benefits of neurofeedback for subjects with MCI. Eleven participants diagnosed with MCI were trained to increase the power of their individual upper alpha band of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal over the central parietal region. This was achieved using an EEG-based neurofeedback training protocol. Training comprised ten 30-min sessions delivered over 5weeks. Cognitive and electroencephalographic assessments were conducted before and after training and at 30 days following the last training session. A dose-dependent increase in peak alpha frequency was observed throughout the period of training. Memory performance also improved significantly following training, and this improvement was maintained at 30-day follow-up, while peak alpha frequency returned to baseline at this evaluation. Our findings suggest that neurofeedback may improve memory performance in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and this benefit may be maintained beyond the training period.

Electrophysiological Phenotype in Angelman Syndrome Differs Between Genotypes	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Angelman syndrome; Biomarkers; EEG; GABA; GABRB3-GABRA5-GABRG3 gene cluster; UBE3A	GABA(A) RECEPTOR; BETA(3) SUBUNIT; MATERNAL LOSS; EEG; UBE3A; DIAGNOSIS; GENE; EXPRESSION; PLASTICITY; MUTATIONS	BACKGROUND: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by either disruptions of the gene UBE3A or deletion of chromosome 15 at 15q11-q13, which encompasses UBE3A and several other genes, including GABRB3, GABRA5, GABRG3, encoding gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunits (beta 3, alpha 5, gamma 3). Individuals with deletions are generally more impaired than those with other genotypes, but the underlying pathophysiology remains largely unknown. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to test the hypothesis that genes other than UBE3A located on 15q11-q13 cause differences in pathophysiology between AS genotypes. METHODS: We compared spectral power of clinical EEG recordings from children (1-18 years of age) with a deletion genotype (n = 37) or a nondeletion genotype (n = 21) and typically developing children without Angelman syndrome (n = 48). RESULTS: We found elevated theta power (peak frequency: 5.3 Hz) and diminished beta power (peak frequency: 23 Hz) in the deletion genotype compared with the nondeletion genotype as well as excess broadband EEG power (1-32 Hz) peaking in the delta frequency range (peak frequency: 2.8 Hz), shared by both genotypes but stronger for the deletion genotype at younger ages. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide strong evidence for the contribution of non-UBE3A neuronal pathophysiology in deletion AS and suggest that hemizygosity of the GABRB3-GABRA5-GABRG3 gene cluster causes abnormal theta and beta EEG oscillations that may underlie the more severe clinical phenotype. Our work improves the understanding of AS pathophysiology and has direct implications for the development of AS treatments and biomarkers.

J	Jusas, V; Samuvel, SG				Jusas, Vacius; Samuvel, Sam Gilvine			Classification of Motor Imagery Using a Combination of User-Specific Band and Subject-Specific Band for Brain-Computer Interface	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						Motor Imagery; feature extraction; user specific band; subject specific band	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; EEG; SELECTION; FEATURES	The essential task of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is to extract the motor imagery features from Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) signals for classifying the thought process. It is necessary to analyse these obtained signals in both the time domain and frequency domains. It is observed that the combination of multiple algorithms increases the performance of the feature extraction process. This paper identifies combinations that have not been attempted previously and improves the accuracy of the overall process, although other authors implemented different combinations of the techniques. The focus is given more on the feature extraction process and frequency bands, which are user-specific and subject-specific frequency bands. In both time and frequency domains, after analysing EEG signals with the time domain parameter, we select the frequency band and the timing while using the Fisher ratio of the time domain parameter (TDP). We used Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA)-type F-score to simultaneously select the frequency band and time segment for multi-class classification. We extracted subject-specific TDP features from the training trials to train the classifier when optimal time-frequency areas were selected for each subject. In this paper, various methods are explored for obtaining the features, which are Time Domain Parameters (TDP), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), R-2, Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF), Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and Intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD). After the extraction process, PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. An efficient result was obtained with the combination of TDP, FFT, and PCA. We used the multi-class Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as the classifier, which was in line with the FDA-type F-score. It is observed that the combination of feature extraction techniques to the frequency bands that were selected by the Fisher ratio and FDA type F-score along with Fisher's LDA classifier had higher accuracy than the results obtained other researches. A kappa coefficient accuracy of 0.64 is obtained for the proposed technique. Our method leads to better classification performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods. The novelty of the approach is based on the combination of frequency bands and two feature extraction methods.

However, little is known about the role of cognitive control dysregulation within reward contexts in BDs, particularly during adolescence. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we explored alterations in cognitive control processes and approach motivation in 99 adolescents with (n=53) and without (n=46) BD during reward striving (target anticipation) and reward attainment (feedback) phases of a monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Time-frequency analysis yielded frontal theta and frontal alpha asymmetry as indices of cognitive control and approach motivation, respectively. Multilevel mixed models examined group differences, as well as age, sex, and other effects, on frontal theta and frontal alpha asymmetry during both phases of the task and on performance accuracy and reaction times. Healthy adolescent girls exhibited lower frontal theta than both adolescent girls with BD and adolescent boys with and without BD during reward anticipation and feedback. Across groups, adolescent boys displayed greater relative left frontal alpha activity than adolescent girls during reward anticipation and feedback. Behaviorally, adolescents with BD exhibited faster responses on both positively and negatively motivated trials versus neutral trials, whereas healthy adolescents had faster responses only on positively motivated trials; adolescents with BD were less accurate in responding to neutral trials compared to healthy controls. These findings shed light on normative and BD-specific involvement of approach motivation and cognitive control during different stages of reward processing in adolescence and, further, provide evidence of adolescent sex differences in these processes.

Our objective was to compare electroencephalographic spectra of patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea syndrome to those of patients with sleep apnea syndrome alone during pre-sleep wakefulness and the N1 and R sleep periods. Method We performed electroencephalography and polysomnography on 10 patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea and 10 with only sleep apnea. Electroencephalography spectra analysis was performed for absolute power in clinical bands in six derivations. Results Compared to sleep apnea patients, comorbid patients had lower sleep efficiency and total sleep time, higher beta-1 power in the left frontal and central derivations during pre-sleep wakefulness, higher delta power in the left frontal and central derivations during the N1 stage, and higher beta-2 power in the left frontal and central, and right central derivations during the R stage. Conclusions Data suggest that patients with insomnia and sleep apnea, compared to patients with only sleep apnea, presented higher left high-frequency rhythms during pre-sleep wakefulness and R sleep stage, and may be for increased emotional and cognitive-related activity, while in stage N1, presented higher left delta power, which suggest some slowing after sleep deprivation.

Several studies indicate that sleep spindle characteristics are correlates of general cognitive ability with a possible sexual dimorphism, but most of the literature consists of small studies with heterogeneous results. In order to clarify these findings, we conducted the largest study into this topic (N = 176) in a birth cohort of 17 year old adolescents using all-night polysomnography and two different sleep spindle detectors. We failed to find significant associations between sleep spindle parameters and general cognitive ability. There was no evidence for a sexual dimorphism. Our findings suggest that previous small studies with limited statistical power and probability to sampling error may have detected sporadic associations which were not confirmed in this study. Large studies and meta-analyses, still somewhat uncommon in the quantitative EEG studies of psychological phenotypes, are necessary to evaluate the existing literature.

Many studies have analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to gain new insights about how the brain reacts to both short- and long-term stressful stimuli. Although most of them have only considered linear methods, the heterogeneity and complexity of the brain has recently motivated an increasing use of nonlinear metrics. Nonetheless, brain dynamics reflected in EEG recordings often exhibit a multiscale nature and no study dealing with this aspect has been developed yet. Hence, in this work two nonlinear indices for quantifying regularity and predictability of time series from several time scales are studied for the first time to discern between visually elicited emotional states of calmness and negative stress. The obtained results have revealed the maximum discriminant ability of 86.35% for the second time scale, thus suggesting that brain dynamics triggered by negative stress can be more clearly assessed after removal of some fast temporal oscillations. Moreover, both metrics have also been able to report complementary information for some brain areas.

Emerging results from young adult studies suggest that the neural activity during the time preceding stimulus presentation is sensitive to episodic memory performance. It is unknown whether age-related declines in episodic memory are due solely to changes in the recruitment of processes elicited by stimuli during encoding or also in processes recruited in anticipation of these stimuli. Here, we recorded oscillatory electroencephalography while young and old participants encoded visual and auditory words that were preceded by cues indicating the stimulus modality. Individual differences in alpha oscillatory activity preceding, and following, stimulus onset was predictive of subsequent memory performance similarly across age. Poststimulus theta power correlated positively with episodic memory performance for old but not young adults, potentially reflecting older adults' tendency to self-generate associations during encoding. Collectively, these results suggest that the preparatory mobilization of neural processes before encoding that benefits episodic memory performance is not affected by age but instead dependent on the individual's propensity to preemptively mobilize task-specific processes.

The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers based on EEG power values and spindle characteristics during sleep that occur in the early stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older adults. Methods: This study was a case-control cross-sectional study with 1-year follow-up of cases. Patients with isolated subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) or MCI were recruited in the Bordeaux Memory Clinic (MEMENTO cohort). Cognitively normal controls were recruited. All participants were recorded with two successive polysomnography 1 year apart. Delta, theta, and sigma absolute spectral power and spindle characteristics (frequency, density, and amplitude) were analyzed from purified EEG during NREM and REM sleep periods during the entire second night. Results: Twenty-nine patients (8 males, age = 71 +/- 7 years) and 29 controls were recruited at T0. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that age-related cognitive impairment were associated with a reduced delta power (odds ratio (OR) 0.072, P < 0.05), theta power (OR 0.018, P < 0.01), sigma power (OR 0.033, P < 0.05), and spindle maximal amplitude (OR 0.002, P < 0.05) during NREM sleep. Variables were adjusted on age, gender, body mass index, educational level, and medication use. Seventeen patients were evaluated at 1-year follow-up. Correlations showed that changes in self-reported sleep complaints, sleep consolidation, and spindle characteristics (spectral power, maximal amplitude, duration, and frequency) were associated with cognitive impairment (P < 0.05). Conclusion: A reduction in slow-wave, theta and sigma activities, and a modification in spindle characteristics during NREM sleep are associated very early with a greater risk of the occurrence of cognitive impairment. Poor sleep consolidation, lower amplitude, and faster frequency of spindles may be early sleep biomarkers of worsening cognitive decline in older adults.

However, little is known about the EEG correlates of DR in elderly people. Only an investigation found differences between recall and non-recall conditions during NREM sleep EEG in older adults, while-surprisingly-no EEG predictor of DR was found for what concerns REM sleep. Considering REM sleep as a privileged scenario to produce mental sleep activity related to cognitive processes, our study aimed to investigate whether specific EEG topography and frequency changes during REM sleep in elderly people may predict a subsequent recall of mental sleep activity. Twenty-one healthy older volunteers (mean age 69.2 +/- 6.07 SD) and 20 young adults (mean age 23.4 +/- 2.76 SD) were recorded for one night from 19 scalp derivations. Dreams were collected upon morning awakenings from REM sleep. EEG signals of the last 5 min were analyzed by the Better OSCillation algorithm to detect the peaks of oscillatory activity in both groups. Statistical comparisons revealed that older as well as young individuals recall their dream experience when the last segment of REM sleep is characterized by frontal theta oscillations. No Recall (Recall vs. Non-Recall) x Age (Young vs. Older) interaction was found. This result replicated the previous evidence in healthy young subjects, as shown in within-and between-subjects design. The findings are completely original for older individuals, demonstrating that theta oscillations are crucial for the retrieval of dreaming also in this population. Furthermore, our results did not confirm a greater presence of the theta activity in healthy aging. Conversely, we found a greater amount of rhythmic theta and alpha activity in young than older participants. It is worth noting that the theta oscillations detected are related to cognitive functioning. We emphasize the notion that the oscillatory theta activity should be distinguished from the non-rhythmic theta activity identified in relation to other phenomena such as (a) sleepiness and hypoarousal conditions during the waking state and (b) cortical slowing, considered as an EEG alteration in clinical samples.

We examined heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) during four blocks of repetitive sleep restriction and sequential nights of recovery sleep. Twenty-one healthy participants completed the 22-day in-hospital protocol. Following three nights of 8-hr sleep, they were assigned to a repetitive sleep restriction condition. Participants had two additional 8-hr recovery sleep periods at the end of the protocol. Sleep EEG, HRV, and BRS were compared for the baseline, the four blocks of sleep restriction, and the second (R2) and third (R3) nocturnal recovery sleep periods following the last sleep restriction block. Within the first hour of each sleep period, vagal activation, as indexed by increase in high frequency (HF; HRV spectrum analysis), showed a rapid increase, reaching its 24-hr peak. HF was more pronounced (rebound) in R2 than during baseline (p < 0.001). The BRS increased within the first hour of sleep and was higher across all sleep restriction blocks and recovery nights (p = 0.039). Rebound rapid eye movement sleep was observed during both R2 and R3 (p = 0.004), whereas slow-wave sleep did not differ between baseline and recovery nights (p > 0.05). Our results indicate that the restoration of autonomic homeostasis requires a time course that includes at least three nights, following an exposure to multiple nights of sleep curtailed to about half the normal nightly amount.

Here, we investigate electrophysiological signatures of proactive control. Previously, the contingent negative variation (CNV) in the ERPs and oscillatory power in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha band (8-14 Hz) have been suggested as signatures of control implementation. However, experimental designs did not always separate control implementation from motor preparation. Critically, we used a mental calculation task to investigate effects of proactive control implementation on the CNV and on theta and alpha power, in absence of motor preparation. In the period leading up to task onset, we found a more negative CNV, increased theta power, and decreased alpha power for hard versus easy calculations, showing increased proactive control implementation when a difficult task was expected. These three measures also correlated with behavioral performance, both across trials and across subjects. In addition to scalp EEG in healthy participants, we collected intracranial local field potential recordings in an epilepsy patient. We observed a slow-drift component that was more pronounced for hard trials in a hippocampal location, possibly reflecting task-specific preparation for hard mental calculations. The current study thus shows that difficulty information triggers proactive control in absence of motor preparation and elucidates its neurophysiological signatures.

PACt-MD Study Grp	Changes in Theta but not Alpha Modulation Are Associated with Impairment in Working Memory in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alpha power; Alzheimer's disease; electroencephalography; mild cognitive impairment; theta power; working memory	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; DIRECTED ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; POWER; ACTIVATION; TASK; LOAD; BAND; PERFORMANCE	While several studies have found that neural oscillations play a key role in the functioning of working memory, the nature of aberrant oscillatory activity underlying working memory impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains largely unexplored. These individuals often display structural alterations in brain regions and pathways involved in working memory processes and therefore may also display altered oscillatory activity during memory activation. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded during the N-back working memory task in three groups: AD (n = 29), MCI (n = 100), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 40). Theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (7.5-12 Hz) modulation was measured in response to the stimulus presentation during correct and incorrect responses. This modulation represents the change in EEG activity associated with the stimulus onset and was measured as a ratio of post stimulus power to pre stimulus power. We also assessed the relationship between change in oscillatory power and working memory performance. Compared to HCs, the AD group demonstrated the lowest working memory accuracy and a smaller theta ratio for correct responses on the 2-back condition; the MCI group demonstrated a smaller theta ratio for correct responses on the 3-back condition. Finally, we observed that the theta ratio, but not the alpha ratio, was a significant predictor of working memory performance in the three groups for all conditions. Taken together, these behavioral and electrophysiological results suggest that in addition to impairments in working memory performance, modulation of theta, but not alpha power, may be impaired in MCI and AD.

This impairment could be due to task switching which involves activation of the present task and the inhibition of the previous task. However, the relative contributions of these processes and their brain activity have not yet been studied. We addressed this gap by asking participants to discriminate the orientation of an oncoming human shape in a virtual environment while they were: i) walking on a treadmill, or ii) texting while walking on a treadmill. Participants' performance (i.e., correctly identifying if a walker would pass them to their left or right) and electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected. Unsurprisingly, we found that participants performed better while they were only walking than when texting while walking. However, we also found that the diminished performance is differently related to task set inhibition and task set activation in the two conditions. The alpha oscillations, which can be used as an index of task inhibition, have a significantly different relation to performance in the two conditions, the relation being negative when subjects are texting. This may indicate that the more inhibition is needed, the more the performance is affected by texting. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the brain signature of task switching in texting while walking. This finding is the first step in identifying the source of impaired judgment in texting pedestrians and in finding viable solutions to reduce the risks.

One of the methods frequently applied for assessing interoceptive sensitivity is the heartbeat discrimination task, where individuals judge whether the timing of external stimuli (e.g., tones) are synchronized to their own heartbeat. Despite its extensive use in research, the neural dynamics underlying the temporal matching between interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli in this task have remained unclear. The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neural responses of healthy participants who performed a heartbeat discrimination task. We analyzed the differences between EEG responses to tones, which were likely to be perceived as "heartbeat-synchronous" (200 ms delayed from the R wave) or "heartbeat-asynchronous" (0 ms delayed). Possible associations of these neural differentiations with task performance were also investigated. Compared with the responses to heartbeat-asynchronous tones, heartbeat-synchronous tones caused a relative decrease in early gamma-band EEG response and an increase in later P2 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude. Condition differences in the EEG/ERP measures were not significantly correlated with the behavioral measures. The mechanisms underlying the observed neural responses and the possibility of electrophysiological measurement of interoceptive sensitivity are discussed in terms of two perspectives: the predictive coding framework and the cardiac-phase-dependent baroreceptor function.

J	Shen, YW; Lin, YP				Shen, Yi-Wei; Lin, Yuan-Pin			Challenge for Affective Brain-Computer Interfaces: Non-stationary Spatio-spectral EEG Oscillations of Emotional Responses	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						affective brain-computer interface; EEG; intra-individual difference; inter-individual difference; independent component analysis	MUSIC PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; RECOGNITION; CONNECTIVITY; ASYMMETRY; SYNCHRONY; PLEASANT; FATIGUE; CORTEX; MOTOR	Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) have been attracting ever-growing interest and research resources. Whereas most previous neuroscience studies have focused on single-day/-session recording and sensor-level analysis, less effort has been invested in assessing the fundamental nature of non-stationary EEG oscillations underlying emotional responses across days and individuals. This work thus aimed to use a data-driven blind source separation method, i.e., independent component analysis (ICA), to derive emotion-relevant spatio-spectral EEG source oscillations and assess the extent of non-stationarity. To this end, this work conducted an 8-day music-listening experiment (i.e., roughly interspaced over 2 months) and recorded whole-scalp 30-ch EEG data from 10 subjects. Given the large size of the data (i.e., from 80 sessions), results indicated that EEG non-stationarity was clearly revealed in the numbers and locations of brain sources of interest as well as their spectral modulation to the emotional responses. Less than half of subjects (two to four) showed the same relatively day-stationary (source reproducibility >6 days) spatio-spectral tendency towards one of the binary valence and arousal states. This work substantially advances the previous work by exploiting intra- and inter-individual EEG variability in an ecological multiday scenario. Such EEG non-stationarity may inevitably present a great challenge for the development of an accurate, robust, and generalized emotion-classification model.

In this context, the application of new technologies to monitor driver's conditions becomes essential to detect anomalous driver behaviour and to identify near miss accidents. Near miss accidents are unplanned events that did not result in injury, illness, or damage but had the potential to do so. In dangerous goods transport by road, few accidents are reported but their consequences may be very relevant. So, the automatic detection of near miss accident may constitute an important resource to improve risk analysis. Specifically, the fundamental hypothesis of our research is that in a near miss accident, the driver's physiological conditions vary. Among them, due to either the emotion or the fear due to a miss accident, the driver's brain shows a variation which could be detected in real time. In this paper, an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based driver control system (EEG-DCS) is presented to monitor the driver brain activities. This study investigates the driver's behaviour and reaction when he/she is exposed to unexpected acoustic or visual external event which perturbs a car driving session in a virtual simulated scenario. The EEG Enobio cap with eight electrodes is used to perform EEG driver's monitoring. Signals related to alpha waves in the EEG signals have been evaluated in time and frequency domain The analysis has clearly demonstrated that the changes in driver's brain wave activities, visualized in the EEG, are significantly correlated to external events causing an unexpected fear to the driver.

Evoked potential and EEG study of the neurotoxicity of hydramethylnon in rats	RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Hydramethylnon; Amdro; Brainstem auditory evoked response; Somatosensory evoked potential; Visual evoked potential; EEG spectral analysis		The objective of the study was to assess the neurotoxicity, using electrodiagnostic tests, of hydramethylnon (Amdro, AC 217,300), an insecticide marketed for the treatment of red imported fire ants, cockroaches, and other insects. Animals were male Fisher 344 albino rats and Long-Evans hooded rats. Brainstem auditory, visual, and somatosensory evoked potentials (BAER, VEP, SEP) and electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded from implanted screw electrodes before and at multiple time points through day 10 after a single oral dose of hydramethylnon (at 50% or 75% of the LD50) plus vehicle, or vehicle alone. No evidence of nervous system toxicity was detected with either BAER, VEP, or SEP recordings. Spectral analysis of EEGs recorded over 7 days demonstrated a time-limited increase in power at low frequencies and decrease at high frequencies, reflecting a sedative effect. A dose-dependent weight loss was observed. Single-exposure poisonings with AC 217,300 can be expected to produce anorexia and CNS depression, but not lethality.

MCI diagnosis is instrumental in preventing Alzheimer's; however, its manifestations are complicated (i.e. distinguishing the symptoms is not easy) and MCI is often confused with the normal consequences of aging. To have an accurate and reliable Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based screening tool for MCI diagnosis, we are developing a new supervised dictionary-learning based analysis of EEG signals, namely Correlation -based Label Consistent K-SVD (CLC-KSVD), which would solve the non-repeatability problem of conventional K-SVD. The proposed method is applied on both time and frequency domains, i.e. 1) the extracted patches from EEG signals recorded at resting state with eyes closed, and 2) the extracted spectral features from these EEG signals. The final label for each EEG signal (in different channels and zones) is obtained by voting between the labels of the whole of time and spectral patches. The evaluation results for the EEG signals of 61 subjects illustrate that CLC-KSVD outperforms other methods (the best accuracy of 88.9% was obtained in F7, T3 channels and the left temporal zone). Furthermore, the results are investigated using the volumetric analysis of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, indicating that the most significant difference between healthy and MCI groups were in the superior temporal and pars triangularis in the left hemisphere. Such location matching between EEG and MR images demonstrates that the results of CLC-KSVD are anatomically interpretable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Animals treated with cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonists display a dissociated state characterized by behavioral wakefulness (W) associated with high amplitude slow oscillations and spindles in the electroencephalogram (EEG), similar to those that occur during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Oscillations in the gamma frequency band (approximate to 40 Hz) of the EEG also play a critical role during W and cognition. Hence, the present study was conducted to determine the effect of muscarinic antagonists on the EEG gamma band power and coherence. Five cats were implanted with electrodes in different cortices to monitor the EEG. The effects of atropine and scopolamine on power and coherence within the low gamma frequency band (30-45 Hz) from pairs of EEG recordings were analyzed and compared to gamma activity during sleep and W. Muscarinic antagonists induced a NREM sleep-like EEG profile that was accompanied by a large increase in gamma power and coherence. The values of gamma coherence were similar to that occurring during alert W (AW), and greater than in quiet W, NREM and REM sleep. We conclude that under atropine or scopolamine, functional interactions between cortical areas in the gamma frequency band remain high, as they are during AW. This significant functional connectivity at high frequency may explain why the animals remain awake in spite of the presence of slow waves and spindles.

According to the world health organization, epilepsy is characterized by repetitive seizures and more electrical discharge in a group of brain neurons results in sudden physical actions. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new method to classify epileptic phases based on Fourier synchro-squeezed transform (FSST) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. FSST is a time-frequency (TF) analysis and provides sharper TF estimates than the conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Absolute of FSST of EEG signal is computed and segmented into five non-overlapping frequency sub-bands as delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha (alpha), beta (beta), and gamma (gamma). Each sub-band is considered as a gray-scale image and then we propose to obtain the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of each sub-band as features. We concatenate the features of different sub-bands to obtain the final feature vector. After selecting informative features by infinite latent feature selection (ILFS) method, the support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers are used separately to classify EEG signals. We use the EEG signals from Bonn University database and different combinations of its sets are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed method efficiently classifies the EEG signals and can be used to determine the phase of epilepsy.

EEG power spectral slope differs by ADHD status and stimulant medication exposure in early childhood	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; electroencephalography; power spectrum; spectral slope; theta/beta ratio	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; CHILDREN; ALPHA; EXCITATION/INHIBITION; METHYLPHENIDATE; RELIABILITY; PREVALENCE	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness. Efforts toward the development of a biologically based diagnostic test have identified differences in the EEG power spectrum; most consistently reported is an increased ratio of theta to beta power during resting state in those with the disorder, compared with controls. Current approaches calculate theta/beta ratio using fixed frequency bands, but the observed differences may be confounded by other relevant features of the power spectrum, including shifts in peak oscillation frequency and altered slope or offset of the aperiodic 1/f-like component of the power spectrum. In the present study, we quantify the spectral slope and offset, peak alpha frequency, and band-limited and band-ratio oscillatory power in the resting-state EEG of 3- to 7-yr-old children with and without ADHD. We found that medication-naive children with ADHD had higher alpha power, greater offsets, and steeper slopes compared with typically developing children. Children with ADHD who were treated with stimulants had comparable slopes and offsets to the typically developing group despite a 24-h medication-washout period. We further show that spectral slope correlates with traditional measures of theta/beta ratio, suggesting the utility of slope as a neural marker over and above traditional approaches. Taken with past research demonstrating that spectral slope is associated with executive functioning and excitatory/inhibitory balance, these results suggest that altered slope of the power spectrum may reflect pathology in ADHD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article highlights the clinical utility of comprehensively quantifying features of the EEG power spectrum. Using this approach, we identify, for the first time, differences in the aperiodic components of the EEG power spectrum in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and provide evidence that spectral slope is a robust indictor of an increase in low- relative to high-frequency power in ADHD.

Thus, ARSG can offer important, new insights into learning-related neural plasticity. However, little research has examined how the brain allocates cognitive resources in ARSG. By analyzing power spectrums and electroencephalograph (EEG) functional connectivity (FC) networks, this study compared multiple conditions (resting, movie watching, ARSG, and Life simulation gaming - LSG) in two experiments. Consistent with previous research, we found that brain waves appeared to be de-assimilated after activation. Furthermore, results showed that ARSG was associated with higher activation and workload as indicated by theta-waves, and required higher attention as reflected by beta-waves. Furthermore, as participants began ARSG, the allocation of cognitive resource gradually prioritized the frontal area, which controls attention, decision-making, monitoring, and mnemonic processing, while participants also showed an enhanced ability to process information under the ARSG condition as indicated by network characteristics. These electrophysiological changes observed in ARSG were not found under LSG. Thus, this study applied both power spectrum and EEG FC networks analyses to ARSG research, revealing characteristics of brain waves in typical areas and how the brain gradually changes from low-working load states to high-working load states based on real-time EEG recordings.

The rate of this buildup crucially depends on the amount of evidence favoring the selection of each action choice in the visual environment. Though numerous studies have characterized how sensory evidence drives motor activity when processed consciously, very little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie the integration of implicit sources of information. Here, we used electroencephalography to investigate the impact of implicit visual cues on response-locked potentials and oscillatory activity in the motor cortex during decision-making. Subjects were required to select between left and right index finger responses according to the motion direction of a cloud of dots presented in one of three possible colors. Unbeknown to the participants, the color cue could bring evidence either in favor of or against the selection of the correct response. Implicit color cues tuned choice-selective oscillatory activity in the low beta range (16-25 Hz), boosting the buildup of contralateral activity when evidence favored the selection of the correct action, while weakening it when evidence biased against the correct response. This modulation of oscillatory activity influenced the speed at which the correct action was eventually chosen. Implicit cues also altered oscillatory activity in a non-selective way in the low frequency oscillation (1-7 Hz) and high beta ranges (25-35 Hz), impacting both contralateral and ipsilateral activity. The current findings yield a critical extension of prior observations by indicating that the integration of both explicit and implicit sources of evidence tunes oscillatory motor activity during decision-making.

Emotional Responses: Evidence from Pupillometry and Electroencephalography Measures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES; PUPIL SIZE; EEG; RECOGNITION; ASYMMETRY; OSCILLATION; ATTITUDES; ANTERIOR; SIGNALS; VALENCE	The design of humanoid robots? emotional behaviors has attracted many scholars? attention. However, users? emotional responses to humanoid robots? emotional behaviors which differ from robots? traditional behaviors remain well understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of a humanoid robot?s emotional behaviors on users? emotional responses using subjective reporting, pupillometry, and electroencephalography. Five categories of the humanoid robot?s emotional behaviors expressing joy, fear, neutral, sadness, or anger were designed, selected, and presented to users. Results show that users have a significant positive emotional response to the humanoid robot?s joy behavior and a significant negative emotional response to the humanoid robot?s sadness behavior, indicated by the metrics of reported valence and arousal, pupil diameter, frontal middle relative theta power, and frontal alpha asymmetry score. The results suggest that humanoid robot?s emotional behaviors can evocate users? significant emotional response. The evocation might relate to the recognition of these emotional behaviors. In addition, the study provides a multimodal physiological method of evaluating users? emotional responses to the humanoid robot?s emotional behaviors.

In particular, a considerable number of publications have described spectral alterations in several pathologies using this time-frequency approach. However, ERD is not capable of specifically showing nonphase (induced) activity related to the presentation of stimuli. Recent studies have described an evoked and induced activity in the early phases (first 200 ms) of stimulus processing. However, scarce studies have analyzed induced and evoked modulations in longer latencies (>200 ms) and their potential roles in cognitive processing. The main goal of the present study was to analyze diverse evoked and induced modulations in response to visual stimuli. Thus, 58-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 21 healthy subjects during the performance of a visual attention task, and analyses were performed for both target and standard stimuli. The initial result showed that phase-locked and nonphase locked activities coexist in the early processing of target and standard stimuli as has been reported by previous studies. However, more modulations were evident in longer latencies in both evoked and induced activities. Correlation analyses suggest that similar maps were present for evoked and induced activities at different timepoints. In the discussion section, diverse proposals will be stated to define the potential roles of these modulations in the information processing for this cognitive task. As a general conclusion, induced activity enables the observation of cognitive mechanisms that are not visible by ERD or ERP modulations.

J	Mousavi, S; Afghah, F; Acharya, UR				Mousavi, Sajad; Afghah, Fatemeh; Acharya, U. Rajendra			SleepEEGNet: Automated sleep stage scoring with sequence to sequence deep learning approach	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; CHANNEL; SYSTEM	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a common base signal used to monitor brain activities and diagnose sleep disorders. Manual sleep stage scoring is a time-consuming task for sleep experts and is limited by inter-rater reliability. In this paper, we propose an automatic sleep stage annotation method called SleepEEGNet using a single-channel EEG signal. The SleepEEGNet is composed of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract time-invariant features, frequency information, and a sequence to sequence model to capture the complex and long short-term context dependencies between sleep epochs and scores. In addition, to reduce the effect of the class imbalance problem presented in the available sleep datasets, we applied novel loss functions to have an equal misclassified error for each sleep stage while training the network. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method on different single-EEG channels (i.e., Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz EEG channels) from the Physionet Sleep-EDF datasets published in 2013 and 2018. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved the best annotation performance compared to current literature, with an overall accuracy of 84.26%, a macro F1-score of 79.66% and kappa = 0.79. Our developed model can be applied to other sleep EEG signals and aid the sleep specialists to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. The source code is available at https://github.com/SajadMo/SleepEEGNet.

Results: Visual analyses suggest that a brief breath awareness mediation was consistently associated with increased alpha power when compared to the active control. Less consistent effects were found with theta, beta, and high gamma activity. Nonparametric tests provided additional support for this finding. Conclusions: Acquiring intracranial EEG patterns during a meditative state may provide more insight into the physiology of meditation with less contamination of high-frequency muscle activity. While access to intracranial EEG during meditation is rarely available, single case design studies are considered adaptations of interrupted time-series designs and can provide an experimental evaluation of intervention effects	[Colgan, Dana Dharmakaya; Memmott, Tab; Klee, Dan; Ernst, Lia; Han, Seunggu J.; Oken, Barry] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, 3181 Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Colgan, Dana Dharmakaya; Memmott, Tab; Klee, Dan; Ernst, Lia; Han, Seunggu J.; Oken, Barry] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol Surg, 3181 Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97201 USA		Colgan, DD (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, 3181 Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97201 USA.	colgand@ohsu.edu		Han, Seunggu Jude/0000-0002-6944-3745; Klee, Daniel/0000-0003-2992-7662; Colgan, Dana Dharmakaya/0000-0002-6806-1542; Ernst, Lia de Leon/0000-0001-8496-5464	Oregon Health and Science University; NIH [T32 AT002688]; National Center for Complementary & Integrative Health [T32AT002688] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER	Oregon Health and Science University; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Center for Complementary & Integrative Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)	The authors would like to acknowledge and offer gratitude the participant who made this study possible.

However, observation of these seizures is difficult and time-consuming. Fourier-based approaches are not suitable for the nonlinear and nonstationary nature of EEG. For this reason, empirical methods such as multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) are used in the analysis of epileptic EEG signals. This study compares MEMD with Hilbert vibration decomposition method (HVD) in the classification of EEG signals in terms of epileptic status. Frequency and entropy-based attributes were obtained from subcomponents obtained by these two methods and classification was made by convolutional neural network, random forest and support vector machine classifiers. As the result of the study, the HVD method showed higher performance than the MEMD method and reached 100% classification accuracy.

This study used a within-subjects experience-sampling design to test whether episodes of mind-wandering during a demanding cognitive task are associated with increases in EEG alpha power. Alpha refers to cyclic oscillations in EEG activity at 8-12 Hz, and has been previously correlated with internally rather than externally directed cognition. Participants completed a speeded performance task with more than 800 trials while EEG was recorded. Intermittent experience-sampling probes asked participants to indicate whether their mind was wandering or on-task. Participants reported mind-wandering in response to approximately half of the probes. EEG alpha power was significantly higher preceding probes to which participants reported mind-wandering, compared with probes to which participants reported being on task. These findings imply that dynamic changes in alpha power may prove a valuable tool in studying momentary fluctuations in mind-wandering.

Mu rhythm desynchronization is specific to action execution and observation: Evidence from time-frequency and connectivity analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Mu rhythm; Occipital alpha; Motor cortex; Mirroring system; Functional connectivity	MIRROR NEURON ACTIVITY; EEG EVIDENCE; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MOTOR ACTIVATION; HAND AREA; INFANTS; MECHANISMS; PERCEPTION; IMITATION; DYNAMICS	Mu desynchronization is the attenuation of EEG power in the alpha frequency range recorded over central scalp locations thought to reflect motor cortex activation. Mu desynchronization during observation of an action is believed to reflect mirroring system activation in humans. However, this notion has recently been questioned because, among other reasons, the potential contamination of mu rhythm and occipital alpha activity induced by attention processes following presentation of visual stimuli in observation conditions. This study examined the validity of mu desynchronization as a measure of mirroring system activation in infants and further investigated the pattern of functional connectivity between the central and occipital regions during execution and observation of movement. EEG was recorded while 46 9-month-old infants executed grasping actions and observed an experimenter grasping. Current source density (CSD) was applied to EEG data and, time-frequency and connectivity analyses were performed in CSD transformed data. Mu desynchronization was evident over central regions during both execution and observation of movements. Independent alpha desynchronization over occipital region was also present in both conditions. The connectivity analyses revealed that central-occipital areas were functionally more connected compared to other areas of the brain during observation of movements. Collectively, the results demonstrate the validity of mu desynchronization as an index of infant mirroring system activity and support the proposal of a functional connection between distinct mirroring and attention processes during observation of action.

Methods We retrospectively investigated the intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) of patients who became seizure free after subsequent surgery. We marked HFOs during 1 hour of recordings. We calculated the time delay between pairs of channels as the median delay between their HFOs and constructed a time line of the delay of each channel with respect to the earliest channel (first source channel). A network was defined when a temporal order could be established among the channels based on the existence of statistically significant delays. Results Fifteen patients with good surgical outcome were included. We found ripple networks in all patients, and fast ripple networks in 9. For ripples, first source channels were found in a higher proportion in the SOZ than the rest of the network channels (15 of 27 [56%] versus 93 of 262 [35%]; p = 0.04). For both ripples and fast ripples, first source channels were resected more often that the rest of the network channels (ripples: 13 of 27 [48%] versus 65 of 262 [25%]; p = 0.01; fast ripples: 8 of 9 [89%] versus 17 of 40 [43%]; p = 0.002); channels with the highest rates of ripples and fast ripples were resected in a similar proportion. Interpretation These results demonstrate that interictal HFOs are organized in networks and indicate a possible need for the resection of first source channels. However, resecting them is not superior to resecting channels with highest rates of HFOs.

J	Singh, B; Wagatsuma, H				Singh, Balbir; Wagatsuma, Hiroaki			Two-stage wavelet shrinkage and EEG-EOG signal contamination model to realize quantitative validations for the artifact removal from multiresource biosignals	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Undecimated wavelet decomposition; Electroencephalograph (EEG); Electro-oculography (EOG); Wavelet shrinkage; EEG-EOG contamination model	SIMULTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL EEG; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; AUTOMATIC REMOVAL; SEIZURE DETECTION; SCALP EEG; DECOMPOSITION; MECHANISMS; EXTRACTION; MOVEMENTS; EPILEPSY	Electroencephalogram (EEG) data inevitably contain large amounts of noise, particularly from ocular potentials in tasks with eye movements, known as electro-oculography (EOG) artifact, which has been a crucial issue in brain-computer-interface studies. This time-frequency characteristic has been substantially dealt with in previous proposed denoising algorithms that relied on a consistent assumption based on the single-noise component model. However, the traditional model is not applicable for biomedical signals that consist of multiple signal components, such as weak EEG signals that are easily recognized as noise because of the signal amplitude with respect to the EOG signal. In consideration of the realistic signal contamination, we designed a novel EEG-EOG signal contamination model to quantitatively validate artifact removal from EEGs. We then proposed the two-stage wavelet shrinkage method with the decomposition of the undecimated wavelet transform (UDWT), which is suitable for signal structure. Open-source clinical intracranial EEGs with the hundred dataset in each behavioral condition were introduced to the validation as "true EEG" before the contamination of artificial EOGs. The quality of the reconstructed EEG signal has evaluated in the frequency spectrum, which represents how much the original specific brain-state characteristic can be reconstructed. Numerical analyses demonstrated that the first stage pursued abrupt changes with high amplitudes provided by assumed EOGs, and the second stage provided the EEG frequency spectrum as observed in the original signal. What the performance exceeded the conventional shrinkage suggests that threshold values is required to be set properly depending on individual amplitudes of contaminated bio-signal sources as our proposed method demonstrated. This result focused on the actual amplitude-frequency structure in the polygenetic signal. It not only provided the decomposition performance, but also revealed how bio-signals are mixed together by using a new standard model for robust validation in the EEG-EOG signal contamination.

Based on acoustoelectric (AE) effect, acoustoelectric brain imaging (ABI) is a novel neuroimaging technique for mapping brain electrical activity, which is potential of high resolution in both space and time domains. This study proposes a source signal modulation mechanism with pulse focused ultrasound (pFU) for ABI. First, spectral analysis of AE signal is implemented at different pulse repetition frequencies (PRF), including 100Hz, 200Hz, 500Hz and 1kHz. Results of amplitude spectrum indicate that obvious high amplitude response of AE signal is observed at each PRF and corresponding harmonic frequencies. Besides, the modulation relationship between AE signal and PRF is investigated in detail. For each source signal of 10Hz and 30Hz, the oscillation frequency of AE signal is consistent with the corresponding PRF. What's more, for different PRFs, the envelope of AE signal is of the same frequency and phase with the source signal. These experiment results demonstrate that pulse focused ultrasound has a modulation mechanism on source signal at PRF and confirm the feasibility of restoring source signal from the modulated AE signal.

Abnormal Phase Coupling in Parkinson's Disease and Normalization Effects of Subthreshold Vestibular Stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; electrical vestibular stimulation; EEG; phase locking value; cortical oscillations; sample entropy; sparse discriminant analysis	OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; MOVEMENT-RELATED CHANGES; BASAL GANGLIA; RESTING-STATE; EEG ALPHA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BETA OSCILLATIONS	The human brain is a highly dynamic structure requiring dynamic coordination between different neural systems to perform numerous cognitive and behavioral tasks. Emerging perspectives on basal ganglia (BG) and thalamic functions have highlighted their role in facilitating and mediating information transmission among cortical regions. Thus, changes in BG and thalamic structures can induce aberrant modulation of cortico-cortical interactions. Recent work in deep brain stimulation (DBS) has demonstrated that externally applied electrical current to BG structures can have multiple downstream effects in large-scale brain networks. In this work, we identified EEG-based altered resting-state cortical functional connectivity in Parkinson's disease (PD) and examined effects of dopaminergic medication and electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS), a non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technique capable of stimulating the BG and thalamus through vestibular pathways. Resting EEG was collected from 16 PD subjects and 18 age-matched, healthy controls (HC) in four conditions: sham (no stimulation), EVS1 (4-8 Hz multisine), EVS2 (50-100 Hz multisine) and EVS3 (100-150 Hz multisine). The mean, variability, and entropy were extracted from time-varying phase locking value (PLV), a non-linear measure of pairwise functional connectivity, to probe abnormal cortical couplings in the PD subjects. We found the mean PLV of Cz and C3 electrodes were important for discrimination between PD and HC subjects. In addition, the PD subjects exhibited lower variability and entropy of PLV (mostly in theta and alpha bands) compared to the controls, which were correlated with their clinical characteristics. While levodopa medication was effective in normalizing the mean PLV only, all EVS stimuli normalized the mean, variability and entropy of PLV in the PD subject, with the exact extent and duration of improvement a function of stimulus type. These findings provide evidence demonstrating both low- and high-frequency EVS exert widespread influences on cortico-cortical connectivity, likely via subcortical activation. The improvement observed in PD in a stimulus-dependent manner suggests that EVS with optimized parameters may provide a new non-invasive means for neuromodulation of functional brain networks.

Neural oscillations, especially gamma-oscillations, have been proposed as a potential mechanism to solve this problem. However, since gamma-oscillations usually reflect local neural activity, how to implement feature binding involving a large-scale brain network remains largely unknown. Here, combining electroencephalogram (EEG) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), we employed a bistable color-motion binding stimulus to probe the role of neural oscillations in feature binding. Subjects' perception of the stimulus switched between its physical binding and its illusory (active) binding. The active binding has been shown to involve a large-scale network consisting of spatially distant brain areas. alpha-Oscillations presumably reflect the dynamics of such large-scale networks, especially due to volume conduction effects in EEG. We found that, relative to the physical binding, the alpha-power decreased during the active binding. Additionally, individual alpha-power was negatively correlated with the time proportion of the active binding. Subjects' perceptual switch rate between the 2 bindings was positively correlated with their individual alpha-frequency. Furthermore, applying tACS at individual alpha-frequency decreased the time proportion of the active binding. Moreover, delivering tACS at different temporal frequencies in the alpha-band changed subjects' perceptual switch rate through affecting the active binding process. Our findings provide converging evidence for the causal role of alpha-oscillations in feature binding, especially in active feature binding, thereby uncovering a function of alpha-oscillations in human cognition.

Unified dynamics of interictal events and absence seizures	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							LATERALIZED EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; CORTICALLY GENERATED SEIZURES; SPIKE-WAVE COMPLEXES; MEAN-FIELD MODEL; GENERALIZED SEIZURES; FAST COMPONENTS; BRAIN SYSTEMS; EPILEPSY; EEG; TRANSITION	The dynamics of interictal events between absence seizures and their relationship to seizures themselves are investigated by employing a neural field model of the corticothalamic system. Interictal events are modeled as being due to transient parameter excursions beyond the seizure threshold, in the present case by sufficiently temporally varying the connection strength between the cerebral cortex and the thalamus. Increasing connection strength drives the system into similar to 3-Hz seizure oscillations via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation once the linear instability threshold is passed. Depending on the time course of the excursion above threshold, different interictal activity event dynamics are seen in the time series of corticothalamic fields. These resemble experimental interictal time series observed via electroencephalography. It is found that the morphology of these events depends on the magnitude and duration of the excursion above threshold. For a large-amplitude excursion of short duration, events resemble interictal spikes, where one large spike is seen, followed by small damped oscillations. For a short excursion with long duration, events like observed interictal periodic sharp waves are seen. When both amplitude and duration above threshold are large, seizure oscillations are seen. Using these outcomes, proximity to seizure can be estimated and tracked.	[Deeba, F.] Dhaka Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Phys, Gazipur 1700, Bangladesh; [Deeba, F.; Sanz-Leon, P.; Robinson, P.

Experiment was conducted to study correlations between EEG frequency bands and subjective perception as well as task performance. Machine learning-based EEG pattern recognition methods as feedback mechanisms were also investigated. Results showed that EEG theta band (4-8 Hz) correlated with subjective perceptions, and EEG alpha band (8-13 Hz) correlated with task performance. These EEG indices could be utilized as more objective metrics in addition to questionnaire and task-based metrics. For the machine learning-based EEG pattern recognition methods, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers can classify mental states under different indoor air quality conditions with high accuracy. In general, the EEG theta and alpha bands as more objective indices and the machine learning-based EEG pattern recognition methods as real-time feedback mechanisms have good potential to improve the human-building interaction.

Different from the traditional psychological relaxation therapy methods that using images, audios and videos, VR-based relaxation therapy is a promising way as the interaction of the VR system and dynamics of virtual environment affect the effectiveness of relax through more immersive and authentic audio-visual scenes. It makes the patient's emotion adjust to the normal state by generating a simulated environment in a VR system to comfort the subject and relieve subject mental stress. This paper presents a novel VR relaxation scenes design and evaluation framework where subject sensitive tourism VR videos were selected and combined with alpha wave induced background music. The relaxation effectiveness of VR scenes were evaluated by SAM scale, relaxation questionnaire and frontal EEG signals. A number of frontal EEG features from various analysis domains were explored to obtain the best stress-relevant features and to establish a stress-frontal EEG correlation model for stress evaluation, including time, frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc. 13 students aged between 20 and 30 were recruited in the evaluation experiment of 6 newly designed VR relaxation scenes. During which subjects frontal EEG signals were recorded as well as the SAM scale and questionnaire, the features that demonstrate an significant difference before and after watching VR scenes were identified, such as Energy, Energy ratio, the mean square root of frequency, frequency domain symmetry, Energy entropy and Shannon entropywhere frequency bands of delta, theta, low alpha and high alpha were considered. Finally, the features that demonstrate an significant difference before and after watching VR scenes were identified. The best stress-relevant features were selected to establish a stress-frontal EEG correlation model for stress evaluation which could be used to validate the effectiveness of VR relaxation scenes.

Efficacy of binaural auditory beats in cognition, anxiety, and pain perception: a meta-analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; HEMISPHERIC-SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PUBLICATION BIAS; FUNNEL PLOTS; EEG ACTIVITY; FREQUENCY; EXTROVERSION; STIMULATION; ALPHA	Binaural auditory beats are a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when presenting separately to each ear two tones that slightly differ in their frequency. It has been suggested that binaural beats can influence cognition and mental states among others. The objective of this meta-analysis was to study the effect of binaural beats on memory, attention, anxiety, and analgesia. Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. The results, based on 35 effect sizes, showed an overall medium, significant, consistent effect size (g = 0.45). Meta-regression results indicated that it does not seem to be necessary to mask binaural beats with white noise or pink noise in terms of effectiveness, obtaining similar effects with unmasked binaural beats. Moreover, the findings suggest that binaural-beat exposure before, and before and during the task produces superior results than exposure during the task. Time under exposure contributed significantly to the model indicating that longer periods are advisable to ensure maximum effectiveness. Our meta-analysis adds to the growing evidence that binaural-beat exposure is an effective way to affect cognition over and above reducing anxiety levels and the perception of pain without prior training, and that the direction and the magnitude of the effect depends upon the frequency used, time under exposure, and the moment in which the exposure takes place.

Predicting task-general mind-wandering with EEG	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Mind-wandering; Spontaneous thought; Single-trial ERP; EEG; Support vector machine; Sustained attention to response task; Alpha oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM; THOUGHT; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; FLUCTUATIONS; MECHANISM; NETWORK; STATES; THETA	Mind-wandering refers to the process of thinking task-unrelated thoughts while performing a task. The dynamics of mind-wandering remain elusive because it is difficult to track when someone's mind is wandering based only on behavior. The goal of this study is to develop a machine-learning classifier that can determine someone's mind-wandering state online using electroencephalography (EEG) in a way that generalizes across tasks. In particular, we trained machine-learning models on EEG markers to classify the participants' current state as either mind-wandering or on-task. To be able to examine the task generality of the classifier, two different paradigms were adopted in this study: a sustained attention to response task (SART) and a visual search task. In both tasks, probe questions asking for a self-report of the thoughts at that moment were inserted at random moments, and participants' responses to the probes were used to create labels for the classifier. The 6 trials preceding an off-task response were labeled as mind-wandering, whereas the 6 trials predicting an on-task response were labeled as on-task. The EEG markers used as features for the classifier included single-trial P1, N1, and P3, the power and coherence in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8.5-12 Hz) bands at PO7, Pz, PO8, and Fz. We used a support vector machine as the training algorithm to learn the connection between EEG markers and the current mind-wandering state. We were able to distinguish between on-task and off-task thinking with an accuracy ranging from 0.50 to 0.85. Moreover, the classifiers were task-general: The average accuracy in across-task prediction was 60%, which was above chance level. Among all the extracted EEG markers, alpha power was most predictive of mind-wandering.

However, how intrinsic brain activity (iBA) changes over a short time remains unknown. To uncover the brain dynamics' theoretic underpinning, electrophysiological relevance, and neuromodulation, we identified iBA dynamics on simulated data, electroencephalogram-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) data, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) fMRI data using sliding-window analysis. The temporal variability (dynamics) of iBA were quantified using the variance of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) over time. We first used simulated fMRI data to examine the effects of various parameters including window length, and step size on dynamic ALFF. Second, using EEG-fMRI data, we found that the heteromodal association cortex had the most variable dynamics while the limbic regions had the least, consistent with previous findings. In addition, the temporal variability of dynamic ALFF depended on EEG power fluctuations. Moreover, using rTMS fMRI data, we found that the temporal variability of dynamic ALFF could be modulated by rTMS. Taken together, these results provide evidence about the theory, relevance, and adjustability of iBA dynamics.

Recently, TMS has been proposed to synchronise neural oscillators and to thereby increase the detectability of corresponding oscillations at the population level. As oscillations in the human brain are known to interact within nested hierarchies via phase-amplitude coupling, TMS might also be able to increase the macroscopic detectability of such coupling. In a concurrent TMS-electroencephalography study, we therefore examined the technique's influence on theta-gamma, alpha-gamma, and beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling by delivering single-pulse TMS (sTMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the left motor cortex and right visual cortex of healthy participants. The rTMS pulse trains were of 5Hz, 11Hz, and 23Hz for the three coupling variations, respectively. Relative to sham stimulation, all conditions showed transient but significant increases in phase-amplitude coupling at the stimulation site. In addition, we observed enhanced coupling over various other cortical sites, with a more extensive propagation during rTMS than during sTMS. By indicating that scalp-recorded phase-amplitude coupling can be effectively probed with TMS, these findings open the door to the technique's application in manipulative dissections of such coupling during human cognition and behaviour in healthy and pathological conditions.

The feature extraction method is based on the wavelet transform of the raw EEG signal. Furthermore, the logarithms of wavelet coefficients are processed using the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The DCT coefficients from each wavelet band are used to form the feature vectors for classification. As an application in the biometrics scenario, the effectiveness of the electrode locations on person recognition is also investigated, and suggestions are made for electrode positioning to improve performance. The effectiveness of the proposed feature was investigated in both identification and verification scenarios. The identification results of 98.24% and 93.28% were obtained using the EEG Motor movement/imagery dataset (MM/I) and the UCI EEG database dataset, respectively, which compares favorably with other published reports while using a significantly smaller number of electrodes. The performance of the proposed system also showed substantial improvements in the verification scenario, when compared with some similar systems from the published literature. A multi-session analysis is simulated using with eyes open and eyes closed recordings from the MM/I database. It is found that the proposed feature is less influenced by time separation between training and testing compared with a conventional feature based on power spectral analysis.

The EEG power in this frequency range (slow-wave activity, SWA) parallels changes in cortical connectivity (i.e., synaptic density) during development. In patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), prefrontal cortical development was shown to be delayed and global gray matter volumes to be smaller compared to healthy controls. Using data of all-night recordings assessed with high-density sleep EEG of 50 children and adolescents with ADHD (mean age: 12.2 years, range: 8-16 years, 13 female) and 86 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age: 12.2 years, range: 8-16 years, 23 female), we investigated if ADHD patients differ in the level of SWA. Furthermore, we examined the effect of stimulant medication. ADHD patients showed a reduction in SWA across the whole brain (-20.5%) compared to healthy controls. A subgroup analysis revealed that this decrease was not significant in patients who were taking stimulant medication on a regular basis at the time of their participation in the study. Assuming that SWA directly reflects synaptic density, the present findings are in line with previous data of neuroimaging studies showing smaller gray matter volumes in ADHD patients and its normalization with stimulant medication.

Though gait impairments in Parkinson's disease have been extensively described in terms of spatiotemporal gait parameters, little is known regarding associated patterns of cortical activity. The objective of the present study is to test if interhemispheric synchronization differs between participants with PD and healthy elderly controls (NPD). We analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded during bilateral movements, i.e., locomotion and hand tapping. Methods: Fifteen participants with PD ('OFF' their anti-parkinsonian medications) and eight NPD were assessed during quiet standing, straight-line walking, turning, and hand tapping tasks. Using a 32-electrode EEG array, we quantified the synchronization in periodic cortical activation between the brain hemispheres (interhemispheric phase synchronization; inter-PS). Theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands were evaluated. Results: In all bands, inter-PS was significantly higher for the PD group as compared with the NPD group during standing and walking (p < 0.001) and during bimanual tasks (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Persons with PD exhibit increased inter-PS as compared with NPD participants. These findings support previous evidence from animal studies, that bilateral cortical hypersynchronization emerges from the asymmetric neural degeneration that is at the base of the disease. Future studies should elucidate the long-term temporal development of this hypersynchronization and its clinical relevance (e.g., can it 'serve' as prodromal marker?).

Pallikonda			An empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based scheme for alcoholism identification	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						ElectroEncephaloGram; k-Nearest-neighbour; Independent component analysis; Empirical mode decomposition	AMERICAN YOUNG-ADULTS; HISPANIC-AMERICAN; FAMILY-HISTORY; USE DISORDERS; EEG SIGNALS; FOCAL EEG; DIAGNOSIS; RISK; CONSUMPTION; ACCURACY	Alcohol addiction can severely affect the brain structure and function. The brain state is usually determined with the help of the ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals, which consist of different neuronal activities that are recorded from the different regions of the brain. These signals have varying characteristics and low magnitudes (mu V). All these factors can hinder the human interpretation of these signals and make it time-consuming. Furthermore, these different EEG signals are also prone to several inter/intra variability errors. On the other hand, they exhibit some non-stationary and non-linear characteristics. As a result, a lot of effort is needed for deciphering the signals with the use of linear frequency and time-domain processes. The nonlinear parameters, in addition to the time-frequency scale domain processes, help in detecting the signal variations. Here, the researchers have proposed a novel technique for identifying the effect of alcoholism with the help of an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method that extracts the relevant features from the EEG signals. These features were derived from the EEG band spectra, which was directly affected by alcohol. An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was applied for the feature reduction, which was followed by the weighted k-Nearest-Neighbour (wk-NN) technique for classifying the normal and the alcoholic EEG signals. For ensuring the reliability of the classification system, the researchers adopted a 10-fold cross-validation approach. This system generated results with a 98.91% mean accuracy, 99.02% mean sensitivity and a 99.24% specificity, indicating the robustness and the dependability of the system, which makes it effective under different environmental conditions.

J	Dora, C; Biswal, PK				Dora, Chinmayee; Biswal, Pradyut Kumar			Efficient detection and correction of variable strength ECG artifact from single channel EEG	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; ECG; Modified S-Transform; Modified EAS	AUTOMATED DETECTION; S-TRANSFORM; REMOVAL; SUPPRESSION; ELIMINATION	The electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes are susceptible to electrocardiogram (ECG) artifacts, misleading the analysis and diagnosis from the EEG recording. This paper mainly focuses on detection and correction of contaminating ECG artifact of various strengths, from a single channel EEG in the absence of a reference ECG channel. The algorithm involves two stages i.e. detection of ECG artifacts and correction of those artifacts. For detection of ECG artifact, modified S-transform (MST) is used on the bandpass filtered contaminated EEG to localize the higher energy QRS segments in time scale. For improved energy concentration of MST around the instantaneous frequency, artifact detection proximity in time scale is.05s. To correct ECG artifacts from EEG, a modified ensembled average subtraction is proposed, which restrict the overcompensation of the EEG in the correction process. The proposed algorithm is tested on MIT/BIH Polysomnography dataset and synthetic data set with various contamination strength, together more than 45 hours of EEG data. The proposed method achieves mean positive predictive value (PPV) and failed detection rate (FDR) of 97.87% and 2.13% respectively for MIT/BIH Polysomnography EEG recordings. The mean PPV and FDR for the CAP sleep EEG recordings with various contamination levels of ECG are found to be 98.77% and 1.22% respectively. The proposed algorithm is compared against existing Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Empirical ensembled mode decomposition (EEMD) based algorithms where the proposed algorithm found to be performing better in terms of spike to energy ratio (SER), spike to background energy ratio (SBR), correlation factors, Mutual information (MI), Mean absolute error (MAE) and Mean square error (MSE) along with a lower change in power spectral density (APSD) in various brain frequency bands.

Methods: EEG data from 13 people with iRBD (mean age, 66.3 years; men, 84.6%) and 10 controls (mean age, 62.3 years; men, 70%) were analyzed. We selected thirty 3 s miniepochs of both tonic and phasic REM sleep. We estimated relative power for six frequency bands. For functional connectivity analysis, we calculated weighted phase lag index (wPLI) and conducted pairwise comparisons between the two groups. Results: EEG power spectral analysis revealed significant interactions between the REM sleep state (phasic vs. tonic) and group at sigma (p = 0.009) and beta (p = 0.002) bands. Sigma-and beta-power decrease during phasic REM sleep was more pronounced and extensive in people with iRBD than in controls. Regarding functional connectivity, there were significant interactions between the REM sleep state and group at alpha (p = 0.029), sigma (p = 0.047), beta (p = 0.015), and gamma (p = 0.046) bands. The average wPLI was significantly higher during phasic REM sleep than during tonic REM sleep, which was observed in people with iRBD but not in controls. The altered functional connections mainly involved the frontal and parietal regions at beta and gamma bands. Conclusions: Our findings provide neurophysiological evidence for pathological motor cortex activation during phasic REM sleep which may be associated with generation of dream-enacting behaviors in iRBD.

Characterization of Young and Old Adult Brains: An EEG Functional Connectivity Analysis	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						functional connectivity; machine learning; aging; resting-state; electroencephalography	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR NETWORK; ALPHA; GAMMA	Brain connectivity studies have reported that functional networks change with older age. We aim to (1) investigate whether electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used to distinguish between individual functional networks of young and old adults; and (2) identify the functional connections that contribute to this classification. Two eyes-open resting-state EEG recording sessions with 64 electrodes for each of 22 younger adults (19-37 years) and 22 older adults (63-85 years) were conducted. For each session, imaginary coherence matrices in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands were computed. A range of machine learning classification methods were utilized to distinguish younger and older adult brains. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was 93% accurate in classifying the brains by age group. We report decreased functional connectivity with older age in delta, theta, alpha and gamma bands, and increased connectivity with older age in beta band. Most connections involving frontal, temporal, and parietal electrodes, and more than half of connections involving occipital electrodes, showed decreased connectivity with older age. Slightly less than half of the connections involving central electrodes showed increased connectivity with older age. Functional connections showing decreased strength with older age were not significantly different in electrode-to-electrode distance than those that increased with older age. Most of the connections used by the classifier to distinguish participants by age group belonged to the alpha band. Findings suggest a decrease in connectivity in key networks and frequency bands associated with attention and awareness, and an increase in connectivity of the sensorimotor functional networks with aging during a resting state.

Epilepsy surgery foremost requires the identification of the epileptogenic zone (EZ), defined as the brain area indispensable for seizure generation. The current gold standard for identification of the EZ is the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). The fact, however that surgical outcomes are unfavorable in 40-50% of well-selected patients, suggests that the SOZ is a suboptimal biomarker of the EZ, and that new biomarkers resulting in better postsurgical outcomes are needed. Research of recent years suggested that high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of the EZ, with a potential to improve surgical success in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy without the need to record seizures. Nonetheless, in order to establish HFOs as a clinical biomarker, the following issues need to be addressed. First, evidence on HFOs as a clinically relevant biomarker stems predominantly from retrospective assessments with visual marking, leading to problems of reproducibility and reliability. Prospective assessments of the use of HFOs for surgery planning using automatic detection of HFOs are needed in order to determine their clinical value. Second, disentangling physiologic from pathologic HFOs is still an unsolved issue. Considering the appearance and the topographic location of presumed physiologic HFOs could be immanent for the interpretation of HFO findings in a clinical context. Third, recording HFOs non-invasively via scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is highly desirable, as it would provide us with the possibility to translate the use of HFOs to the scalp in a large number of patients. This article reviews the literature regarding these three issues. The first part of the article focuses on the clinical value of invasively recorded HFOs in localizing the EZ, the detection of HFOs, as well as their separation from physiologic HFOs. The second part of the article focuses on the current state of the literature regarding non-invasively recorded HFOs with emphasis on findings and technical considerations regarding their localization.

The role of midfrontal oscillations in preparatory conflict adjustments	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Cognitive control; Conflict processing; Motor inhibition; Neural oscillations	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; ALPHA-EEG DYNAMICS; INHIBITORY CONTROL; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; UNEXPECTED EVENTS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN NETWORKS; BAND ACTIVITY; CORTEX	Successful motor control during behavioral conflicts relies on neural adjustments that can occur reactively (i.e., after conflict occurrence) and proactively (i.e., in preparation prior to conflicts). While midfrontal delta/theta oscillations are known to play a role for reactive control, their relevance for proactive control is unclear. Using EEG, we investigated the role of midfrontal oscillations during conflict preparation in a motor conflict task, where a predictive cue either indicated no or an increased likelihood for an action conflict. During conflict preparation, increased conflict likelihood led to a proactive modulation of neural oscillations related to both motor processing (central beta) and sensory processing (posterior alpha). While midfrontal control oscillations significantly increased during conflict occurrence, increased conflict likelihood did not change midfrontal oscillatory activity during conflict preparation.

A universal automated tool for reliable detection of seizures in rodent models of acquired and genetic epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						automated seizure detection; genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg; post-status epilepticus model; posttraumatic epilepsy; traumatic brain injury; Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk	ABSENCE EPILEPSY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; WAVE DISCHARGES; BRAIN-INJURY; RATS; SPIKE; EEG	Objective Prolonged electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring in chronic epilepsy rodent models has become an important tool in preclinical drug development of new therapies, in particular those for antiepileptogenesis, disease modification, and treating drug-resistant epilepsy. We have developed an easy-to-use, reliable, computational tool for automated detection of electrographic seizures from prolonged EEG recordings in rodent models of epilepsy. Methods We applied a novel method based on advanced time-frequency analysis that detects EEG episodes with excessive activity in certain frequency bands. The method uses an innovative technique of short-term spectral analysis, the Similar Basis Function algorithm. The method was applied for offline seizure detection from long-term EEG recordings from four spontaneously seizing, chronic epilepsy rat models: the fluid percussion injury (n = 5 rats, n = 49 seizures) and post-status epilepticus models (n = 119 rats, n = 993 seizures) of acquired epilepsy, and two genetic models of absence epilepsy, Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg and Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk (n = 41 and 14 rats, n = 8733 and 825 seizures, respectively). Results Our comparative analysis revealed that the EEG amplitude spectra of these four rat models are remarkably similar during epileptiform activity and have a single expressed peak within the 17- to 25-Hz frequency range. Focusing on this band, our computer program detected all seizures in the 179 rats. A quick semiautomated user inspection of the EEGs for the period of each identified event allowed quick rejection of artifact events. The overall processing time for 12-day-long recordings varied from a few minutes (5-10) to 30 minutes, depending on the number of artifact events, which was strongly correlated with the signal quality of the raw EEG data. Significance Our automated seizure detection tool provides high sensitivity, with acceptable specificity, for long- and short-term EEG recordings from both acquired and genetic chronic epilepsy rat models. This tool has the potential to improve the efficiency and rigor of preclinical research and therapy development using these models.

Distinct lines of research propose that sleep promotes local strengthening of information-bearing synapses (plasticity) and global downscaling of synaptic strength (stability) in neural networksprerequisites for adaptive behavior in a changing environment. However, the potential orchestration of these processes, particularly in humans, needs to be further characterized. Here, we use electrophysiological, behavioral, and molecular indices to noninvasively study cortical plasticity and network stability in humans. We observe indices of local strengthening of prior induced long-term potentiation-like plasticity (paired associative stimulation induced change in motor-evoked potential) and global network stabilization (homeostatic regulation of wake EEG theta activity) after brief periods of nonrapid eye movement sleep compared with wakefulness. The interplay of local sleep slow oscillations and spindle activity, previously related to synaptic refinements during sleep, is identified as a potential mechanism. Our findings are consistent with the notion that sleep-specific brain activity patterns reduce the plasticity-stability dilemma by orchestrating local plasticity and global stability of neural assemblies in the human cortex. Future studies are needed to further decipher the neural mechanisms underlying our indirect observations.

Complex temporal patterns processing by a neural mass model of a cortical column	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Nonlinear time series analysis; Deterministic nonlinear dynamics; Information processing; Neural mass model; Brain dynamics	SPATIOTEMPORAL FIRING PATTERNS; BINDING PROTEIN PARVALBUMIN; NONLINEAR DYNAMICS; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPIKE TRAINS; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS	It is well known that neuronal networks are capable of transmitting complex spatiotemporal information in the form of precise sequences of neuronal discharges characterized by recurrent patterns. At the same time, the synchronized activity of large ensembles produces local field potentials that propagate through highly dynamic oscillatory waves, such that, at the whole brain scale, complex spatiotemporal dynamics of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals may be associated to sensorimotor decision making processes. Despite these experimental evidences, the link between highly temporally organized input patterns and EEG waves has not been studied in detail. Here, we use a neural mass model to investigate to what extent precise temporal information, carried by deterministic nonlinear attractor mappings, is filtered and transformed into fluctuations in phase, frequency and amplitude of oscillatory brain activity. The phase shift that we observe, when we drive the neural mass model with specific chaotic inputs, shows that the local field potential amplitude peak appears in less than one full cycle, thus allowing traveling waves to encode temporal information. After converting phase and amplitude changes obtained into point processes, we quantify input-output similarity following a threshold-filtering algorithm onto the amplitude wave peaks. Our analysis shows that the neural mass model has the capacity for gating the input signal and propagate selected temporal features of that signal. Finally, we discuss the effect of local excitatory/inhibitory balance on these results and how excitability in cortical columns, controlled by neuromodulatory innervation of the cerebral cortex, may contribute to set a fine tuning and gating of the information fed to the cortex.

The current study used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess how inflammation affected three different distinct attentional processes: alerting, orienting and executive control. In a double-blinded placebo-controlled within-subjects design (20 healthy males, mean age = 24.5, SD = 3.4), Salmonella typhoid vaccination (0.025 mg; Typhim Vi, Sanofi Pasteur) was used to induce transient mild inflammation, while a saline injection served as a placebo-control. Participants completed the Attention Network Test with concurrent EEG recorded 6 h post-injection. Analyses focused on behavioral task performance and on modulation of oscillatory EEG activity in the alpha band (9-12 Hz) for alerting as well as orienting attention and frontal theta band (4-8 Hz) for executive control. Vaccination induced mild systemic inflammation, as assessed by interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. While no behavioral task performance differences between the inflammation and placebo condition were evident, inflammation caused significant alterations to task-related brain activity. Specifically, inflammation produced greater cue-induced suppression of alpha power in the alerting aspect of attention and individual variation in the inflammatory response was significantly correlated with the degree of alpha power suppression. Notably, inflammation did not affect orienting (i.e., alpha lateralization) or executive control (i.e., frontal theta activity). These results reveal a unique neurophysiological sensitivity to acute mild inflammation of the neural network that underpins attentional alerting functions. Observed in the absence of performance decrements, these novel findings suggest that acute inflammation requires individuals to exert greater cognitive effort when preparing for a task in order to maintain adequate behavioral performance.

But with the elapse of time duration it may changes the mood of human being. In this paper, age based mood changes of human being will be analyzed with music stimulated potentials based on power spectral density (PSD). Music of different languages Bengali, English and Tamil are taken as chosen as stimuli. Rock, POP and Metal songs which are categorized with PSD are considered as music genre. Three age groups are selected as subjects and the EEG signals are taken while listening different music genres. Wavelet transformation is performed to denoise the signal and extract different EEG bands according to their frequency level. Stress and relax state of brain is determined from activation of alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) EEG bands based on their power spectral density (PSD) while listening music. Stress is caused by the exposure of distinct genre of songs and languages. It is shown that while listening music at small time interval pressure is relieved but the increment of time changes the mood towards stress. Topographic plots are rendered to exhibit the active regions for alpha band activation. Tamil songs are less tempted to create relax whereas native language Bengali creates relax at beginning and leading to stress over time.

Previous studies have reported that eye movements are associated with which scientific concepts are retrieved correctly. Moreover, other studies have also suggested that eye movements involve the cooperative activity of the human brain's fronto-parietal circuits. Less research has been conducted to investigate whether fronto-parietal EEG oscillations are associated with the retrieval processing of scientific concepts. Our findings in this study demonstrated that the fronto-parietal network is indeed crucial for successful memory retrieval. In short, significantly lower theta augmentation in the frontal midline and lower alpha suppression in the right parietal region were observed at the 5th eye fixation for physics concepts that were correctly retrieved than for those that were incorrectly retrieved. Moreover, the visual cortex in the occipital lobe exhibits a significantly greater theta augmentation followed by an alpha suppression following each eye fixation, while a right frontoparietal asymmetry was also found for the successful retrieval of presentations of physics concepts. In particular, the study results showed that eye fixation-related frontal midline theta power and right parietal alpha power at the 5th eye fixation have the greatest predictive power regarding the correctness of the retrieval of physics concepts.

It is conventionally studied with mass-bivariate measures utilizing either sensor-to-sensor or voxel-to-voxel signals. However, none of these approaches aims at maximizing synchronization, especially when two multichannel datasets are present. Examples include cortico-muscular coherence (CMC), cortico-subcortical interactions or hyperscanning (where electroencephalographic EEG/magnetoencephalographic MEG activity is recorded simultaneously from two or more subjects). For all of these cases, a method which could find two spatial projections maximizing the strength of synchronization would be desirable. Here we present such method for the maximization of coherence between two sets of EEG/MEG/EMG (electromyographic)/LFP (local field potential) recordings. We refer to it as canonical Coherence (caCOH). caCOH maximizes the absolute value of the coherence between the two multivariate spaces in the frequency domain. This allows very fast optimization for many frequency bins. Apart from presenting details of the caCOH algorithm, we test its efficacy with simulations using realistic head modelling and focus on the application of caCOH to the detection of cortico-muscular coherence. For this, we used diverse multichannel EEG and EMG recordings and demonstrate the ability of caCOH to extract complex patterns of CMC distributed across spatial and frequency domains. Finally, we indicate other scenarios where caCOH can be used for the extraction of neuronal interactions.

Larger motor-evoked responses are obtained in a hand muscle when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is synchronized to the phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm. In this study we further showed that TMS applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the mu-rhythm is associated with higher absolute amplitude of the evoked EEG potential at 100 ms after stimulation. This demonstrates that cortical responses are sensitive to excitability fluctuation with brain oscillations Our results indicate that brain state-dependent stimulation is a new useful technique for the investigation of stimulus-related cortical dynamics. Oscillatory brain activity coordinates the response of cortical neurons to synaptic inputs in a phase-dependent manner. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human primary motor cortex elicits larger motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) when applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm recorded with EEG, demonstrating that this phase represents a state of higher excitability of the cortico-spinal system. Here, we investigated the influence of the phase of the mu-rhythm on cortical responses to TMS as measured by EEG. We tested different stimulation intensities above and below resting motor threshold (RMT), and a realistic sham TMS condition. TMS at 110% RMT applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the mu-rhythm was associated with higher absolute amplitudes of TMS-evoked potentials at 70 ms (P70) and 100 ms (N100). Enhancement of the N100 was confirmed with negative peak-triggered 90% RMT TMS, while phase of the mu-rhythm did not influence evoked responses elicited by sham TMS. These findings extend the idea that TMS applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the endogenous mu-oscillation recruits a larger portion of neurons as a function of stimulation intensity. This further corroborates that brain oscillations determine fluctuations in cortical excitability and establishes phase-triggered EEG-TMS as a sensitive tool to investigate the effects of brain oscillations on stimulus-related cortical dynamics.

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in drug addiction. However, the mechanism underlying systems-level neuroadaptations in PFC during abstinence has not been fully characterized. The objective of our study was to determine what neural oscillatory activity contributes to the chronic effect of opiate exposure and whether the activity could be coupled to neurovascular information in the PFC. We employed resting-state functional connectivity to explore alterations in 8 patients with heroin dependency who stayed abstinent (>3 months; HD) compared with 11 control subjects. A non-invasive neuroimaging strategy was applied to combine electrophysiological signals through electroencephalography (EEG) with hemodynamic signals through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The electrophysiological signals indicate neural synchrony and the oscillatory activity, and the hemodynamic signals indicate blood oxygenation in small vessels in the PFC. A supervised machine learning method was used to obtain associations between EEG and fNIRS modalities to improve precision and localization. HD patients demonstrated desynchronized lower alpha rhythms and decreased connectivity in PFC networks. Asymmetric excitability and cerebrovascular injury were also observed. This pilot study suggests that cerebrovascular injury in PFC may result from chronic opiate intake.

However, few studies have focused on the relationship between food preferences and oscillatory brain activity during the anticipatory stage of swallowing. Therefore, to clarify the effect of individual food preferences on oscillatory brain activity, we investigated the relationship between food preferences and oscillatory brain activity during the observation of food images. Methods: Here we examined this relationship using visual food stimuli and electroencephalography (EEG). Nineteen healthy participants were presented 150 images of food in a random order and asked to rate their subjective preference for that food on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (don't want to eat) to 4 (want to eat). Oscillation analysis was performed using a Hilbert transformation for bandpass-filtered EEG signals. Results: The results showed that the oscillatory beta band power on C3 significantly decreased in response to favorite foods compared to disliked food. Conclusion: This result suggests that food preferences may impact oscillatory brain activity related to swallowing during the anticipatory stage of swallowing. This finding may lead to the development of new swallowing rehabilitation techniques for patients with dysphagia by applying food preferences to modulate oscillatory brain activity.

These signals also exhibit highly non-stationary characteristics and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As a result, there is often poor task detection accuracy and high error rates in designed brain-computer interfacing (BCI) systems. In this paper, a novel preprocessing method is proposed to automatically reconstruct the EEG signal by selecting the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on a median frequency measure. Multivariate empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose the EEC signals into a set of IMFs. The reconstructed EEG signal has high SNR and contains only information correlated to a specific motor imagery task. The common spatial pattern is used to extract features from the reconstructed EEC signals. The linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine have been utilized in order to classify the features into left hand motor imagery and right hand motor imagery tasks. Our experimental results on the BCI competition IV dataset 2A show that the proposed method with fifteen channels outperforms bandpass filtering with 22 channels (> 1%) and by > 9 % (p = 0.0078) with raw EEG signals, > 13% (p = 0.0039) with empirical mode decomposition-based filtering and > 17 % ( p = 0.0039) with discrete wavelet transform-based filtering.

Laughing gas (N2O), another NMDA-R (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) blocker, has been reported to bring antidepressant effects rapidly upon drug discontinuation. We took advantage of the exceptional pharmacokinetic properties of N2O to investigate EEG (electroencephalogram) alterations and molecular determinants of antidepressant actions during and immediately after NMDA-R blockade. Effects of the drugs on brain activity were investigated in C57BL/6 mice using quantitative EEG recordings. Western blot and qPCR were used for molecular analyses. Learned helplessness (LH) was used to assess antidepressant-like behavior. Immediate-early genes (e.g., bdnf) and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinasemarkers of neuronal excitabilitywere upregulated during N2O exposure. Notably, phosphorylation of BDNF receptor TrkB and GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) became regulated only gradually upon N2O discontinuation, during a brain state dominated by slow EEG activity. Subanesthetic ketamine and flurothyl-induced convulsions (reminiscent of electroconvulsive therapy) also evoked slow oscillations when their acute pharmacological effects subsided. The correlation between ongoing slow EEG oscillations and TrkB-GSK3 signaling was further strengthened utilizing medetomidine, a hypnotic-sedative agent that facilitates slow oscillations directly through the activation of (2)-adrenergic autoreceptors. Medetomidine did not, however, facilitate markers of neuronal excitability or produce antidepressant-like behavioral changes in LH. Our results support a hypothesis that transient cortical excitability and the subsequent regulation of TrkB and GSK3 signaling during homeostatic emergence of slow oscillations are critical components for rapid antidepressant responses.

Its focus is on changes in electrical signals, including summated generator potentials that occur after nasal or oral stimulation. In the first part of the review, we describe tools available to the clinician for assessing olfactory and nasotrigeminal function, including modern electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of brain responses both in the time domain and in the time-frequency (TF) domain. Particular attention is paid to chemosensory event- related potentials (CSERPs) and their potential use in medical-legal cases. Additionally, we focus on the changes of summated generator potentials from the olfactory and respiratory nasal epithelium that could provide new diagnostic insights. In the second part, we describe gustatory event-related potentials (gCSERPs) obtained using a relatively new computer controlled gustometer. A device for presenting different pulses of electrical current to the tongue is also described, with weaker pulses likely reflecting gCSERPs and stronger ones trigeminal CSERPs. Finally, summated generator potentials from the surface of the tongue during gustatory stimulation are described that may prove useful for examining peripheral taste function.

It has its undisputed value in clinical diagnosis, particularly (but not exclusively) in the identification of epilepsy and sleep disorders and in the evaluation of dysfunctions in sensory transmission pathways. With the advancement of digital technologies, the analysis of EEG has moved from pure visual inspection of amplitude and frequency modulations over time to a comprehensive exploration of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the recorded signals. Today, EEG is accepted as a powerful tool to capture brain function with the unique advantage of measuring neuronal processes in the time frame in which these processes occur, namely in the sub-second range. However, it is generally stated that EEG suffers from a poor spatial resolution that makes it difficult to infer to the location of the brain areas generating the neuronal activity measured on the scalp. This statement has challenged a whole community of biomedical engineers to offer solutions to localize more precisely and more reliably the generators of the EEG activity. High-density EEG systems combined with precise information of the head anatomy and sophisticated source localization algorithms now exist that convert the EEG to a true neuroimaging modality. With these tools in hand and with the fact that EEG still remains versatile, inexpensive and portable, electrical neuroimaging has become a widely used technology to study the functions of the pathological and healthy human brain. However, several steps are needed to pass from the recording of the EEG to 3-dimensional images of neuronal activity. This review explains these different steps and illustrates them in a comprehensive analysis pipeline integrated in a stand-alone freely available academic software: Cartool. The information about how the different steps are performed in Cartool is only meant as a suggestion. Other EEG source imaging software may apply similar or different approaches to the different steps.

In this study, a multi-domain hybrid feature pool is designed to identify most of the important information from the signal. The hybrid feature pool contains features from two types of analysis: (a) statistical parametric analysis from the time domain, and (b) wavelet-based bandwidth specific feature analysis from the time-frequency domain. Then, a wrapper-based feature selector, Boruta, is applied for ranking all the relevant features from that feature pool instead of considering only the non-redundant features. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is used for final classification. The proposed model yields an overall accuracy of 73.38% for the total considered dataset. To validate the performance of the proposed model and highlight the necessity of designing a hybrid feature pool, the model was compared to non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, as well as those without feature ranking.

To address this issue, cortical activity was investigated in this study using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 19 scalp locations, in 15 healthy young adults (5 females; mean age = 27 +/- 4.09 years) during quiet bipedal standing, under different insole conditions (textured versus smooth), with and without vision. Compared to smooth insoles (SIs), TIs significantly reduced postural sway in two measures; anterior-posterior range and standard deviation. In the EEG data, whole-head analyses showed cortical activity in the upper alpha power band was significantly reduced for textured compared to SIs. Exploratory analyses revealed this effect was significant both with and without vision, and was more pronounced over the parietal, compared to central regions, and over central compared to frontal regions. This trend was observed in low alpha and theta bands, but the effect of insole type was not significant. Textured insoles thus appear to affect not only balance outcomes but also cortical activity. The cortical activity adaptation may represent greater information becoming readily available at the cortical level, enhancing the representation of the body in space.	[Kenny, Ryan P.

This basically follows either a feature-level or decision-level strategy. In all likelihood, while features from several modalities may enhance the classification performance, they might exhibit high dimensionality and make the learning process complex for the most used machine learning algorithms. To overcome issues of feature extraction and multi-modal fusion, hybrid fuzzy-evolutionary computation methodologies are employed to demonstrate ultra-strong capability of learning features and dimensionality reduction. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal emotion aware system by fusing speech with EEG modalities. Firstly, a mixing feature set of speaker-dependent and independent characteristics is estimated from speech signal. Further, EEG is utilized as inner channel complementing speech for more authoritative recognition, by extracting multiple features belonging to time, frequency, and time-frequency. For classifying unimodal data of either speech or EEG, a hybrid fuzzy c-means-genetic algorithm-neural network model is proposed, where its fitness function finds the optimal fuzzy cluster number reducing the classification error. To fuse speech with EEG information, a separate classifier is used for each modality, then output is computed by integrating their posterior probabilities. Results show the superiority of the proposed model, where the overall performance in terms of accuracy average rates is 98.06%, and 97.28%, and 98.53% for EEG, speech, and multi-modal recognition, respectively. The proposed model is also applied to two public databases for speech and EEG, namely: SAVEE and MAHNOB, which achieve accuracies of 98.21% and 98.26%, respectively.

The detection and analysis of interictal and ictal epileptiform spikes are of major importance for identifying this area. The "irritative zone" of the cortex with interictal spikes is usually revealed intraoperatively during acute electrocorticography (ECoG). Since ECoG recordings cannot be completely visually reviewed in a reasonable amount of time, computer algorithms for the automatic detection of seizures and spikes were developed. We proposed the spike detection algorithm based on the definition of the physical properties of the sought spikes (duration and amplitude). The parameters are easily interpreted by neurophysiologists. The detection sensitivity was 93%, and the precision was 99%. In addition, based on the number of spikes detected on individual electrodes, it is possible to draw the "frequency of spike occurrence" map. The algorithm proved to be so effective in analyzing ECoG records, as it is allowed to be used in practice.

We enrolled 17 patients with ES/TS who underwent CC before 20 years of age. Post-CC Engel's classification was as follows: I in 7 patients, II in 2, III in 4, and IV in 4. Welch's t-test was used to analyse the correlation between ictal HVSs and CC outcomes based on the following three symmetrical indices: (1) negative peak delay: interhemispheric delay between negative peaks; (2) amplitude ratio: interhemispheric ratio of amplitude values for the highest positive peaks; and (3) duration ratio: interhemispheric ratio of slow wave duration. Ages at CC ranged from 17-237 months. Four to 15 ictal EEGs were analysed for each patient. The negative peak delay, amplitude ratio and duration ratio ranged from 0-530 ms, 1.00-7.40 and 1.00-2.74, respectively. The negative peak delay, amplitude ratio and duration ratio were significantly higher in the seizure residual group (p = 0.017, <0.001, <0.001, respectively). Symmetry of ictal HVSs may predict favourable outcomes following CC for ES/TS.

Noninvasive electromagnetic signals measured with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) typically contain less signal power in high frequencies than invasive recordings. Particularly, noninvasive detection of gamma-band activity (>30 Hz) is challenging since coherently active source areas are small at such frequencies and the available imaging methods have limited spatial resolution. Compared to EEG and conventional SQUID-based MEG, on-scalp MEG should provide substantially improved spatial resolution, making it an attractive method for detecting gamma-band activity. Using an on-scalp array comprised of eight optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) and a conventional whole-head SQUID array, we measured responses to a dynamic visual stimulus known to elicit strong gamma-band responses. OPMs had substantially higher signal power than SQUIDs, and had a slightly larger relative gamma-power increase over the baseline. With only eight OPMs, we could obtain gamma-activity source estimates comparable to those of SQUIDs at the group level. Our results show the feasibility of OPMs to measure gamma-band activity. To further facilitate the noninvasive detection of gamma-band activity, the on-scalp OPM arrays should be optimized with respect to sensor noise, the number of sensors and intersensor spacing.

However, disturbances, such as impulse noise, can result in a mode-splitting effect, in which one physically meaningful component is split into two or more intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). In this paper, we propose a novel method, minimum arclength EMD (MA-EMD), to robustly decompose time series data with impulse-like noises. The idea is to apply a minimum arclength criterion to adjust the knot positions of impulses during the sifting process in EMD. In this way, the impulse-like artifact is extracted with the first IMF, and the mode splitting effect of the latter decomposition is alleviated. Furthermore, when the first IMF contains the desired information, we separate the spikes and the first IMF by adding a pair of masking signals. For using this masking-aided MA-EMD (MAMA-EMD) method, we also mathematically derived the appropriate ranges of the frequency and the amplitude of the masking signal. The MAMA-EMD is utilized to deal with the simulated Duffing wave and four real-world data, including electrical current, vibration signals, the cyclic alternating pattern in sleep EEG (electroencephalography), and circadian of core body temperature. The results show that the MA-EMD and MAMA-EMD have a sound improvement when encountering impulse noises.

Extended GLM model can replace baseline correction while lifting its limits	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						analysis; statistical methods; EEG; ERPs; oscillation; time frequency analyses	HIGH-PASS FILTERS; REGRESSION-BASED ESTIMATION; INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS; POWER CALCULATIONS; LANGUAGE; RELIABILITY; ARTIFACTS; FALLACY	Baseline correction plays an important role in past and current methodological debates in ERP research (e.g., the Tanner vs. Maess debate in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods), serving as a potential alternative to strong high-pass filtering. However, the very assumptions that underlie traditional baseline also undermine it, implying a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio. In other words, traditional baseline correction is statistically unnecessary and even undesirable. Including the baseline interval as a predictor in a GLM-based statistical approach allows the data to determine how much baseline correction is needed, including both full traditional and no baseline correction as special cases. This reduces the amount of variance in the residual error term and thus has the potential to increase statistical power.

Drowsy driving is one of the leading causes of accidents in transportation sector. An on-board warning system which helps drivers with essential feedback about the onset of drowsiness by continuously monitoring divers' psychophysiological state can help to reduce the drowsy driving related accidents. Physiological signals are found to be most effective for continuous monitoring and better detection of drowsiness. Among all the frequently used physiological signals, Electroencephalogram (EEG), a record of the electrical activities of the brain, showed the strongest relation with drowsiness. Hence, EEG is widely considered as a reliable measure for drowsiness, fatigue, and performance evaluation. In this paper, EEG analysis for drowsiness studies, current findings and future directions of this field are briefly reviewed. Power spectral density (PSD) based features are found to be the most commonly used features for EEG based drowsiness studies. EEG low-frequency bands (delta, theta, and alpha), especially alpha band, shows an increase in band power during the drowsy state compared to alert state. In contrast, high-frequency bands (beta and gamma), specifically beta band shows a decrease in band power during drowsiness. In terms of brain regions, frontal, parietal, and occipital are suggestively informative, especially, alpha from occipital and beta from frontal are two potential indicators. Therefore, identifying informative brain regions with specific frequency bands will help to reduce the number of electrodes required to develop an effective EEG based drowsiness detection and warning system.

The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as a flexible hub mediating behavioral as well as local and distributed neural effects of social support context on pain: A Theta Burst Stimulation and TMS-EEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Social support; Pain; Theta burst stimulation; TMS-EEG; Connectivity	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; CORTICAL REACTIVITY; GAMMA-POWER; HUMAN BRAIN; MOTOR; MODULATION; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK; CONNECTIVITY	Increasing evidence points to an analgesic influence of social support context, in which the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) may play a key role. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has the capacity to causally modulate brain activity. This study was designed to investigate the potential role of dmPFC in orchestrating the behavioral and neural effects of social context during pain. Twenty-three healthy participants underwent a three-session cross-over, single-blinded, sham-controlled protocol in which they received Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) (facilitatory intermittent TBS, suppressive continuous TBS, or Sham) delivered to the dmPFC. In each session, participants underwent cold pain while viewing an image of a romantic partner or a stranger. Effects of TBS to the dmPFC were assessed using a measure of pain perception, neural activity and network connectivity using electroencephalography (EEG) and TMS-EEG. In the stranger condition, pain experience increased following iTBS. This was associated with increased connectivity between central regions and fronto-parietal regions. In contrast, in the romantic partner condition, iTBS increased connectivity only between frontal and occipital regions and did not modulate pain experience. In line with recent studies, neither cTBS nor Sham stimulation elicited neural or behavioral changes. Together these findings suggest that the dmPFC has the capacity to causally modulate pain-related information integration and network configuration in a context-dependent manner.

The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.

J	Yue, K; Wang, DL				Yue, Kang; Wang, Danli			EEG-Based 3D Visual Fatigue Evaluation Using CNN	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						EEG; visual fatigue; CNN	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DISPLAYS; FMRI	Visual fatigue evaluation plays an important role in applications such as virtual reality since the visual fatigue symptoms always affect the user experience seriously. Existing visual evaluation methods require hand-crafted features for classification, and conduct feature extraction and classification in a separated manner. In this paper, we conduct a designed experiment to collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of various visual fatigue levels, and present a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture named MorletInceptionNet to detect visual fatigue using EEG as input, which exploits the spatial-temporal structure of multichannel EEG signals. Our MorletInceptionNet adopts a joint space-time-frequency features extraction scheme in which Morlet wavelet-like kernels are used for time-frequency raw feature extraction and inception architecture are further used to extract multi-scale temporal features. Then, the multi-scale temporal features are concatenated and fed to the fully connected layer for visual fatigue evaluation using classification. In experiment evaluation, we compare our method with five state-of-the-art methods, and the results demonstrate that our model achieve overally the best performance better performance for two widely used evaluation metrics, i.e., classification accuracy and kappa value. Furthermore, we use input-perturbation network-prediction correlation maps to conduct in-depth analysis into the reason why the proposed method outperforms other methods. The results suggest that our model is sensitive to the perturbation of beta (14-30 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) bands. Furthermore, their spatial patterns are of high correlation with that of the corresponding power spectral densities which are used as evaluation features traditionally. This finding provides evidence of the hypothesis that the proposed model can learn the joint time-frequency-space features to distinguish fatigue levels automatically.

However, the reliability of these networks and their characteristics has not been established. We evaluated the reliability of these networks and their characteristics in 10-month-old infants. Methods: Data were obtained during two EEG sessions 1 week apart and was subsequently analyzed at delta (0.5-3 Hz), theta (3-6 Hz), alpha1 (6-9 Hz), alpha2 (9-12 Hz), beta (12-25 Hz), and low gamma (25-45 Hz) frequency bands. Connectivity matrices were created by calculating the phase lag index between all channel pairs at given frequency bands. To determine the reliability of these connectivity matrices, intraclass correlations were calculated of global connectivity, local connectivity, and several graph characteristics. Results: Comparing both sessions, global connectivity, as well as global graph characteristics (characteristic path length and average clustering coefficient) are highly reliable across multiple frequency bands; the alpha1 and theta band having the highest reliability in general. In contrast, local connectivity characteristics were less reliable across all frequency bands. Conclusions: We conclude that global connectivity measures are highly reliable over sessions. Local connectivity measures show lower reliability over sessions. This research therefore underlines the possibility of these global network characteristics to be used both as biomarkers of neurodevelopmental disorders, but also as important factors explaining development of typical behavior.

The literature published mainly between 2000 and 2017 was reviewed with an emphasis on approaches emerging after 2000, in particular on oscillatory dynamics, connectivity studies, and deep brain stimulation. Eighty-five articles were reviewed. The main observations were a general slowing of background activity, excessive synchronization of beta activity, and disturbed movement-related gamma oscillations in the BG and in the cortico-subcortical and cortico-cortical motor loops, suppressible by dopaminergic medication as well as by high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS). Non-motor symptoms are related mainly to changes in the alpha frequency range. EEG parameters can be useful in defining the risk of dementia in PD. Further progress was reported recently using advanced analytical technologies and high-performance computing (graph theory). Detailed knowledge of LFPs in PD enabled progress particularly in DBS therapy, which requires optimizing the clinical effect and minimizing adverse side effects. The neurocognitive networks and their dysfunction in PD and DBS therapy are promising targets for future research. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Nakayama, R; Motoyoshi, I				Nakayama, Ryohei; Motoyoshi, Isamu			Attention Periodically Binds Visual Features As Single Events Depending on Neural Oscillations Phase-Locked to Action	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						action; attention; behavioral oscillations; EEG; feature binding; neural oscillations	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; STEADY-STATE; ALPHA; CORTEX; PERCEPTION; INTEGRATION; PREDICTS; RESET; GAMMA; MECHANISMS	Recent psychophysical studies have demonstrated that periodic attention in the 4-8Hz range facilitates performance on visual detection. The present study examined the periodicity of feature binding, another major function of attention, in human observers (3 females and 5 males for behavior, with 7 males added for the EEG experiment). In a psychophysical task, observers reported a synchronous pair of brightness (light/dark) and orientation (clockwise/counterclockwise) patterns from two combined brightness-orientation pairs presented in rapid succession. We found that temporal binding performance exhibits periodic oscillations at similar to 8 Hz as a function of stimulus onset delay from a self-initiated button press in conditions where brightness-orientation pairs were spatially separated. However, as one would expect from previous studies on pre-attentive binding, significant oscillations were not apparent in conditions where brightness-orientation pairs were spatially superimposed. EEG results, while fully compatible with behavioral oscillations, also revealed a significant dependence of binding performance across trials on prestimulus neural oscillatory phases within the corresponding band. The peak frequency of this dependence was found to be correlated with intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) around the timing of button press in parietal sensors. Moreover, the peak frequency of the ITPC was found to predict behavioral frequency in individual observers. Together, these results suggest that attention operates periodically (at similar to 8 Hz) on the perceptual binding of multimodal visual information and is mediated by neural oscillations phase-locked to voluntary action.

This lack of cross-modal synchrony is the unavoidable consequence of different light and sound speeds, and their different neural transmission times in the corresponding sensory pathways. Hence, cross-modal synchrony must be reconstructed during perception. It has been suggested that spontaneous fluctuations in neural excitability might be involved in the temporal organisation of sensory events during perception and account for variability in behavioural performance. Here, we addressed the relationship between ongoing brain oscillations and the perception of cross-modal simultaneity. Participants performed an audio-visual simultaneity judgement task while their EEG was recorded. We focused on pre-stimulu activity, and found that the phase of neural oscillations at 13 +/- 2 Hz 200 ms prior to the stimulus correlated with subjective simultaneity of otherwise identical sound-flash events. Remarkably, the correlation between EEG phase and behavioural report occurred in the absence of concomitant changes in EEG amplitude. The probability of simultaneity perception fluctuated significantly as a function of pre-stimulus phase, with the largest perceptual variation being accounted for phase angles nearly 180o apart. This pattern was strongly reliable for sound-flash pairs but not for flash-sound pairs. Overall, these findings suggest that the phase of ongoing brain activity might underlie internal states of the observer that influence cross-modal temporal organisation between the senses and, in turn, subjective synchrony.

We previously showed that a gentle rocking stimulation (0.25 Hz), during an afternoon nap, facilitates wake-sleep transition and boosts endogenous brain oscillations (i.e., EEG spindles and slow oscillations [SOs]). Here, we tested the hypothesis that the rhythmic rocking stimulation synchronizes sleep oscillations, a neurophysiological mechanism referred to as "neural entrainment.'' We analyzed EEG brain responses related to the stimulation recorded from 18 participants while they had a full night of sleep on a rocking bed. Moreover, because sleep oscillations are considered of critical relevance for memory processes, we also investigated whether rocking influences overnight declarative memory consolidation. We first show that, compared to a stationary night, continuous rocking shortened the latency to nonREM (NREM) sleep and strengthened sleep maintenance, as indexed by increased NREM stage 3 (N3) duration and fewer arousals. These beneficial effects were paralleled by an increase in SOs and in slow and fast spindles during N3, without affecting the physiological SO-spindle phase coupling. We then confirm that, during the rocking night, overnight memory consolidation was enhanced and also correlated with the increase in fast spindles, whose co-occurrence with the SO up-state is considered to foster cortical synaptic plasticity. Finally, supporting the hypothesis that a rhythmic stimulation entrains sleep oscillations, we report a temporal clustering of spindles and SOs relative to the rocking cycle. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that a continuous rocking stimulation strengthens deep sleep via the neural entrainment of intrinsic sleep oscillations.

Automatic sleep classification using adaptive segmentation reveals an increased number of rapid eye movement sleep transitions	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						automatic classification; data-driven segmentation; electroencephalography; REM sleep stability; sleep stage switching	EEG SIGNALS; IDENTIFICATION; AGREEMENT	The reference standard for sleep classification uses manual scoring of polysomnography with fixed 30-s epochs. This limits the analysis of sleep pattern, structure and, consequently, detailed association with other physiologic processes. We aimed to improve the details of sleep evaluation by developing a data-driven method that objectively classifies sleep in smaller time intervals. Two adaptive segmentation methods using 3, 10 and 30-s windows were compared. One electroencephalographic (EEG) channel was used to segment into quasi-stationary segments and each segment was classified using a multinomial logistic regression model. Classification features described the power in the clinical frequency bands of three EEG channels and an electrooculographic (EOG) anticorrelation measure for each segment. The models were optimised using 19 healthy control subjects and validated on 18 healthy control subjects. The models obtained overall accuracies of 0.71 +/- 0.09, 0.74 +/- 0.09 and 0.76 +/- 0.08 on the validation data. However, the models allowed a more dynamic sleep, which challenged a true validation against manually scored hypnograms with fixed epochs. The automated classifications indicated an increased number of stage transitions and shorter sleep bouts using models with smaller window size compared with the hypnograms. An increased number of transitions from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was likewise expressed in the model using 30-s windows, indicating that REM sleep has more fluctuations than captured by today's standard. The models developed are generally applicable and may contribute to concise sleep structure evaluation, research in sleep control and improved understanding of sleep and sleep disorders. The models could also contribute to objective measuring of sleep stability.	[Koch, Henriette; Jennum, Poul; Christensen, Julie A.

Whether such neurobehavioral benefits can also arise from tactually sensing the speech envelope on the skin is unclear. We hypothesized that tactile speech envelopes can improve neural tracking of auditory speech and thereby facilitate intelligibility. To test this, we applied continuous auditory speech and vibrotactile speech-envelope-shaped stimulation at various asynchronies to the ears and index fingers of normally-hearing human listeners while simultaneously assessing speech-recognition performance and cortical speech-envelope tracking with electroencephalography. Results indicate that tactile speech-shaped envelopes improve the cortical tracking, but not intelligibility, of degraded auditory speech. The cortical speech-tracking benefit occurs for tactile input leading the auditory input by 100 ms or less, emerges in the EEG during an early time window (similar to 0-150 ms), and in particular involves cortical activity in the delta (1-4 Hz) range. These characteristics hint at a predictive mechanism for multisensory integration of complex slow time-varying inputs that might play a role in tactile speech communication.

For the first time, the goal is to study the possibility of diagnosing, identifying specific signs and stages of development of CGP based on the registration of bioelectric activity of the brain. METHODS In patients with chronic generalized periodontitis (CGP), an analysis of the global cerebral bioelectrical activity was performed. A standard Neuron-Spectrum-1 electroencephalograph and a specialized narrow-band spectral analysis software in frequency range of 0.1 to 27 Hz and integration time of 160 seconds, allocation of 8400 spectral harmonics were used. RESULTS A number of distinguishing characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrum envelope function was revealed in the studied patients, and 4 decisive characters were identified. For CGP, diagnostic Characters 1 and 2 marked by synchronization of hemispheres and significant pronounced decrease in the amplitude of the spectral estimate in frequency range of 0.91 to 0.95 Hz and 7.26 to 8.0 Hz, were identified. Character 3 was associated with increased synchronization of hemispheres and increased amplitude of the spectral estimate in the frequency range of 3.72 to 4.03 Hz. Hemispheric desynchronization in diagnostic Character 4 was detected in frequency range of 0.96 to 1.01 Hz. The amplitude of spectrum asymmetry for Character 4 was specific to separate patients with CGP by severity levels. CONCLUSIONS The revealed changes in spectrograms are supposed to be used to clarify the pathogenesis, for early non-invasive diagnosis and to assess the severity of patients with CGP.

J	Watanabe, H; Tanaka, H; Sakti, S; Nakamura, S				Watanabe, Hiroki; Tanaka, Hiroki; Sakti, Sakriani; Nakamura, Satoshi			Neural Oscillation-Based Classification of Japanese Spoken Sentences During Speech Perception	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electroencephalogram (EEG); neural decoding; neural oscillations; phase-locking	BRAIN-WAVE RECOGNITION; PHASE PATTERNS	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used by users to convey their intentions directly with brain signals. For example, a spelling system that uses EEGs allows letters on a display to be selected. In comparison, previous studies have investigated decoding speech information such as syllables, words from single-trial brain signals during speech comprehension, or articulatory imagination. Such decoding realizes speech recognition with a relatively short time-lag and without relying on a display. Previous magnetoencephalogram (MEG) research showed that a template matching method could be used to classify three English sentences by using phase patterns in theta oscillations. This method is based on the synchronization between speech rhythms and neural oscillations during speech processing, that is, theta oscillations synchronized with syllabic rhythms and low-gamma oscillations with phonemic rhythms. The present study aimed to approximate this classification method to a BCI application. To this end, (1) we investigated the performance of the EEG-based classification of three Japanese sentences and (2) evaluated the generalizability of our models to other different users. For the purpose of improving accuracy, (3) we investigated the performances of four classifiers: template matching (baseline), logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. In addition, (4) we propose using novel features including phase patterns in a higher frequency range. Our proposed features were constructed in order to capture synchronization in a low-gamma band, that is, (i) phases in EEG oscillations in the range of 2-50 Hz from all electrodes used for measuring EEG data (all) and (ii) phases selected on the basis of feature importance (selected). The classification results showed that, except for random forest, most classifiers perform similarly. Our proposed features improved the classification accuracy with statistical significance compared with a baseline feature, which is a phase pattern in neural oscillations in the range of 4-8 Hz from the right hemisphere. The best mean accuracy across folds was 55.9% using template matching trained by all features. We concluded that the use of phase information in a higher frequency band improves the performance of EEG-based sentence classification and that this model is applicable to other different users.

Effect of levodopa on electroencephalographic biomarkers of the parkinsonian state	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalography; levodopa; Parkinson's disease; phase-amplitude coupling	HIGH-FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BETA OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR IMPAIRMENT; DISEASE; STIMULATION; BRAIN; MODULATION; POWER	The objective of this study was to evaluate proposed electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD) and test their correlation with motor impairment in a new, well-characterized cohort of PD patients and controls. Sixty-four-channel EEG was recorded from 14 patients with rigid-akinetic PD with minimal tremor and from 14 age-matched healthy controls at rest and during voluntary movement. Patients were tested off and on medication during a single session. Recordings were analyzed for phase-amplitude coupling over sensorimotor cortex and for pairwise coherence from all electrode pairs in the recording montage (distributed coherence). Phase-amplitude coupling and distributed coherence were found to be elevated Off compared with On levodopa, and their reduction was correlated with motor improvement. In the Off medication state, phase-amplitude coupling was greater in sensorimotor contacts contralateral to the most affected body part and reduced by voluntary movement. We conclude that phase-amplitude coupling and distributed coherence are cortical biomarkers of the parkinsonian state that are detectable noninvasively and may be useful as objective aids for management of dopaminergic therapy. Several analytic methods may be used for noninvasive measurement of abnormal brain synchronization in PD. Calculation of phase-amplitude coupling requires only a single electrode over motor cortex. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Several EEG biomarkers of the parkinsonian state have been proposed that are related to abnormal cortical synchronization. We report several new findings in this study: correlations of EEG markers of synchronization with specific motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD), and demonstration that one of the EEG markers, phase-amplitude coupling, is more elevated over the more clinically affected brain hemisphere. These findings underscore the potential utility of scalp EEG for objective, noninvasive monitoring of medication state in PD.

Reduced frontal gamma power at 24 months is associated with better expressive language in toddlers at risk for autism	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); language; infants; cognitive neuroscience; children	SEX-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; SPECTRUM; INFANTS; CHILDREN; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; TRAJECTORIES; SKILLS	Frontal gamma power has been associated with early language development in typically developing toddlers, and gamma band abnormalities have been observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as high-risk infant siblings (those having an older sibling with ASD), as early as 6 months of age. The current study investigated differences in baseline frontal gamma power and its association with language development in toddlers at high versus low familial risk for autism. Electroencephalography recordings as well as cognitive and behavioral assessments were acquired at 24 months as part of prospective, longitudinal study of infant siblings of children with and without autism. Diagnosis of autism was determined at 24-36 months, and data were analyzed across three outcome groups-low-risk without ASD (n = 43), high-risk without ASD (n = 42), and high-risk with ASD (n = 16). High-risk toddlers without ASD had reduced baseline frontal gamma power (30-50 Hz) compared to low-risk toddlers. Among high-risk toddlers increased frontal gamma was only marginally associated with ASD diagnosis (P = 0.06), but significantly associated with reduced expressive language ability (P = 0.007). No association between gamma power and language was present in the low-risk group. These findings suggest that differences in gamma oscillations in high-risk toddlers may represent compensatory mechanisms associated with improved developmental outcomes.

Lay Summary This study looked at differences in neural activity in the gamma range and its association with language in toddlers with and without increased risk for ASD. At 2 years of age, gamma power was lower in high-risk toddlers without ASD compared to a low-risk comparison group. Among high-risk toddlers both with and without later ASD, reduced gamma power was also associated with better language outcomes, suggesting that gamma power may be a marker of language development in high-risk children.

Methods: The Geweke's spectral measure is combined with the time-varying autoregressive with exogenous input (TVARX) modeling approach, which uses multiwavelet-based ultra-regularized orthogonal least squares (UROLS) algorithm, aided by adjustable prediction error sum of squares (APRESS), to obtain high-resolution time-varying CGC representations. The UROLS-APRESS algorithm, which adopts both the regularization technique and the ultra-least squares criterion to measure not only the signal themselves, but also the weak derivatives of them, is a novel powerful method in constructing time-varying models with good generalization performance, and can accurately track smooth and fast changing causalities. The generalized measurement based on CGC decomposition is able to eliminate indirect influences in multivariate systems. Results: The proposed method is validated on two simulations, and then applied to source level motor imagery (MI) EEGs, where the predicted distributions are well recovered with high TF precision, and the detected connectivity patterns of MI-EEGs are physiologically interpretable and yield new insights into the dynamical organization of oscillatory cortical networks. Conclusion: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the TF-CGC method in tracking rapidly varying causalities of EEG-based oscillatory networks. Significance: The novel TF-CGC method is expected to provide important information of neural mechanisms of perception and cognition.

Simultaneously recorded intracranial and scalp high frequency oscillations help identify patients with poor postsurgical seizure outcome	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Refractory epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; Epilepsy surgery; Spikes; Seizure onset	FAST RIPPLES; TEMPORAL-LOBE; ONSET ZONE; 80-500 HZ; EEG; SPIKES; EPILEPSY; MACROELECTRODES; IDENTIFICATION; DETECTABILITY	Objective: High frequency oscillations (HFO) between 80-500 Hz are markers of epileptic areas in intracranial and maybe also scalp EEG. We investigate simultaneous recordings of scalp and intracranial EEG and hypothesize that scalp HFOs provide important additional clinical information in the presurgical setting. Methods: Spikes and HFOs were visually identified in all intracranial scalp EEG channels. Analysis of correlation of event location between intracranial and scalp EEG as well as relationship between events and the SOZ and zone of surgical removal was performed. Results: 24 patients could be included, 23 showed spikes and 19 HFOs on scalp recordings. In 15/19 patients highest scalp HFO rate was located over the implantation side, with 13 patients having the highest scalp and intracranial HFO rate over the same region. 17 patients underwent surgery, 7 became seizure free. Patients with poor post-operative outcome showed significantly more regions with HFO than those with seizure free outcome. Conclusions: Scalp HFOs are mostly located over the SOZ. Widespread scalp HFOs are indicative of a larger epileptic network and associated with poor postsurgical outcome. Significance: Analysis of scalp HFO add clinically important information about the extent of epileptic areas during presurgical simultaneous scalp and intracranial EEG recordings.

J	Iwata, S; Sanuki, M; Ozaki, M				Iwata, Shihoko; Sanuki, Michiyoshi; Ozaki, Makoto			Falsely high patient state index during cardiopulmonary bypass with intra-aortic balloon pumping: a case report	JA CLINICAL REPORTS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Patient state index; Cardiopulmonary bypass; Intra-aortic balloon pumping; Diagnostic error; Artifact	INCREASED BISPECTRAL INDEX; VALUES	Background The patient state index (PSI) is a parameter of a four-channel electroencephalography (EEG)-derived variable used to assess the depth of anesthesia. A PSI value of 25-50 indicates adequate state of hypnosis, and a value of 100 indicates a fully awake state. Due to reduced interference from electronic devices like electrocautery, falsely high intraoperative PSI values are rarely reported. However, this case report cautions about falsely high PSI during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). Case presentation A 68-year-old man was scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery with IABP. General anesthesia was maintained using sevoflurane. Initial PSI was between 30 and 50 before CPB. Propofol was administered during CPB, and IABP provided pulsatile flow. IABP was stopped soon after the initiation of CPB, and the ascending aorta was partially clamped to anastomose the saphenous vein graft to the ascending aorta. The PSI value decreased drastically, but with resumption of IABP, the value increased to approximately 80, despite increasing the dose of anesthetics. Meanwhile, the EEG waveform was nearly flat. After discontinuing CPB, the PSI value returned to being extremely low. There was no evidence of intraoperative awareness or instrument trouble. After reviewing the anesthesia record, the high PSI value was almost consistent with ongoing IABP during CPB. We suspect that the oscillation noise created by IABP during CPB erroneously influences the PSI algorithm, resulting in a falsely high PSI. Conclusions Anesthesiologists should note that adherence to pEEG-derived values without discretion may cause errors when monitoring the depth of anesthesia.

Large-Scale Communication in the Human Brain Is Rhythmically Modulated through Alpha Coherence	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							STABLE FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; TEMPORAL STRUCTURES; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BAND; POWER; ATTENTION; PHASE; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISM	Recent evidence has suggested that coherent neuronal oscillations may serve as a gating mechanism for flexibly modulating communication between brain regions. For this to occur, such oscillations should be robust and coherent between brain regions that also demonstrate time-locked correlations, with time delays that match the phase delays of the coherent oscillations. Here, by analyzing functional connectivity in both the time and frequency domains, we demonstrate that alpha oscillations satisfy these constraints and are well suited for modulating communication over large spatial scales in the human brain. We examine intracranial EEG in the human temporal lobe and find robust alpha oscillations that are coherent between brain regions with center frequencies that are consistent within each individual participant. Regions demonstrating coherent narrowband oscillations also exhibit time-locked broadband correlations with a consistent time delay, a requirement for an efficient communication channel. The phase delays of the coherent alpha oscillations match the time delays of the correlated components, and importantly, both broadband correlations and neuronal spiking activity are modulated by the phase of the oscillations. These results are specific to the alpha band and build upon emerging evidence suggesting that alpha oscillations may play an active role in cortical function. Our data therefore provide evidence that large-scale communication in the human brain may be rhythmically modulated by alpha oscillations.

EEG signals are mainly used for the detection and visualization of many neurological disorders. It is also used for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a chronic disease and 1% of the world's population is affected. Epilepsy results in seizures associated with loss of consciousness, including long-term loss of consciousness and affecting patient quality of life. It is possible to determine the detection of epilepsy from EEG data. However, there are some difficulty to detect epilepsy because of the length and complexity of EEG. There are many studies for the classification and detection of epilepsy. Most of these studies are realized with artificial neural networks and machine learning. In this study, epilepsy detection was performed by using machine learning over EEG data with the features obtained by time-frequency domain analysis during seizure. As a result of the study, Logistic Regression classifier gave the best training results for 23 different EEG channels and tested. In the test results; 87.5% accuracy, 75.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity values were obtained.

Previous researches on this topic using either isolated words or phrases found that the word length and familiarity could affect the latent time of speech planning. However, in continuous sentence processing, semantic prediction was found to be more influential from our previous eye movement investigation. To probe further into the underlying neural causes, this study combined eye movement and EEG techniques to analyze the behavior-locked brain activities during the speech planning process in a sentence reading task. The results showed that the latent time decreases gradually with ongoing reading process as the context information got richer. And the subjects tend to look ahead prior to the articulation of the current word. Functional network analyses for the visual and semantic processing were consistent with the behavior results and suggested that the look-ahead phenomenon is a companying effect of speech coarticulation, and as speech prediction becomes easier, the latent time for speech planning tend to be shortened.

J	Gupta, V; Chopda, MD; Pachori, RB				Gupta, Vipin; Chopda, Mayur Dahyabhai; Pachori, Ram Bilas			Cross-Subject Emotion Recognition Using Flexible Analytic Wavelet Transform From EEG Signals	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Human emotions; EEG; FAWT; random forest; SVM	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; FEATURES; ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION; DIAGNOSIS; MUSIC	Human emotion is a physical or psychological process which is triggered either consciously or unconsciously due to perception of any object or situation. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be used to record ongoing neuronal activities in the brain to get the information about the human emotional state. These complicated neuronal activities in the brain cause non-stationary behavior of the EEG signals. Thus, emotion recognition using EEG signals is a challenging study and it requires advanced signal processing techniques to extract the hidden information of emotions from EEC signals. Due to poor generalizability of features from EEG signals across subjects, recognizing cross-subject emotion has been difficult. Thus, our aim is to comprehensively investigate the channel specific nature of EEG signals and to provide an effective method based on flexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT) for recognition of emotion. FAWT decomposes the EEG signal into different sub-band signals. Furthermore, we applied information potential to extract the features from the decomposed sub-band signals of EEG signal. The extracted feature values were smoothed and fed to the random forest and support vector machine classifiers that classified the emotions. The proposed method is applied to two different publicly available databases which are SJTU emotion EEG dataset and database for emotion analysis using physiological signal. The proposed method has shown better performance for human emotion classification as compared to the existing method. Moreover, it yields channel specific subject classification of emotion EEG signals when exposed to the same stimuli.

Video services are commonly interrupted by an initial delay, especially in cases of network instability, dramatically degrading the user experience. However, little is known about how and to what extent the human brain reacts to an initial video delay. In this letter, we developed a series of experiments to study the influence of an initial video delay on the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of viewers. The EEG signals of 10 volunteers were recorded and analyzed. We aimed to find common features in the EEG signals caused by initial video delays. The results show that alpha- and beta-band oscillations around the parietal lobe increased in almost every subject; and that these oscillations were associated with negative emotions. Additionally, we found that the average selected oscillatory activity began approximately at 450 ms post stimulus, indicating, that initial video delays longer than 450 ms would arouse negative emotions in most people.

Improved Detection of Vowel Envelope Frequency Following Responses Using Hotelling's T-2 Analysis	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Auditory steady state responses; EEG; Envelope frequency following responses; Natural speech response detection; Objective response detection; Simulation	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; CHILDHOOD HEARING IMPAIRMENT; OBJECTIVE DETECTION; SPEECH; REPRESENTATION; SIGNAL; ALGORITHM; CHILDREN; ADULTS	Objectives: Objective detection of brainstem responses to natural speech stimuli is an important tool for the evaluation of hearing aid fitting, especially in people who may not be able to respond reliably in behavioral tests. Of particular interest is the envelope frequency following response (eFFR), which refers to the EEG response at the stimulus' fundamental frequency (and its harmonics), and here in particular to the response to natural spoken vowel sounds. This article introduces the frequency-domain Hotelling's T-2 (HT2) method for eFFR detection. This method was compared, in terms of sensitivity in detecting eFFRs at the fundamental frequency (HT2_F0), to two different single-channel frequency domain methods (F test on Fourier analyzer (FA) amplitude spectra [FA-F-Test] and magnitude-squared coherence [MSC]) in detecting envelope following responses to natural vowel stimuli in simulated data and EEG data from normal-hearing subjects. Sensitivity was assessed based on the number of detections and the time needed to detect a response for a false-positive rate of 5%. The study also explored whether a single-channel, multifrequency HT2 (HT2_3F) and a multichannel, multifrequency HT2 (HT2_MC) could further improve response detection. Design: Four repeated words were presented sequentially at 70 dB SPL LAeq through ER-2 insert earphones. The stimuli consisted of a prolonged vowel in a /hVd/ structure (where V represents different vowel sounds). Each stimulus was presented over 440 sweeps (220 condensation and 220 rarefaction). EEG data were collected from 12 normal-hearing adult participants. After preprocessing and artifact removal, eFFR detection was compared between the algorithms. For the simulation study, simulated EEG signals were generated by adding random noise at multiple signal to noise ratios (SNRs; 0 to -60dB) to the auditory stimuli as well as to a single sinusoid at the fluctuating and flattened fundamental frequency (f(0)). For each SNR, 1000 sets of 440 simulated epochs were generated. Performance of the algorithms was assessed based on the number of sets for which a response could be detected at each SNR. Results: In simulation studies, HT2_3F significantly outperformed the other algorithms when detecting a vowel stimulus in noise. For simulations containing responses only at a single frequency, HT2_3F performs worse compared with other approaches applied in this study as the additional frequencies included do not contain additional information. For recorded EEG data, HT2_MC showed a significantly higher response detection rate compared with MSC and FA-F-Test. Both HT2_MC and HT2_F0 also showed a significant reduction in detection time compared with the FA-F-Test algorithm. Comparisons between different electrode locations confirmed a higher number of detections for electrodes close to Cz compared to more peripheral locations. Conclusion: The HT2 method is more sensitive than FA-F-Test and MSC in detecting responses to complex stimuli because it allows detection of multiple frequencies (HT2_F3) and multiple EEG channels (HT2_MC) simultaneously. This effect was shown in simulation studies for HT2_3F and in EEG data for the HT2_MC algorithm. The spread in detection time across subjects is also lower for the HT2 algorithm, with decision on the presence of an eFFR possible within 5min.

The effectiveness of CSP is highly affected by the frequency band and time window of EEG segments. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize the spectral bands of CSP, most of them selected the time window in a heuristic way. This is likely to result in a suboptimal feature extraction since the time period when the brain responses to the mental tasks occurs may not be accurately detected. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern (TSGSP), for the simultaneous optimization of filter bands and time window within CSP to further boost classification accuracy of MI EEG. Specifically, spectrum-specific signals are first derived by bandpass filtering from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping filter bands. Each of the spectrum-specific signals is further segmented into multiple subseries using sliding window approach. We then devise a joint sparse optimization of filter bands and time windows with temporal smoothness constraint to extract robust CSP features under a multitask learning framework. A linear support vector machine classifier is trained on the optimized EEG features to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, BCI Competition IV datasets IIa, and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb) to validate the effectiveness of TSGSP in comparison to several other competing methods. Superior classification performance (averaged accuracies are 88.5%, 83.3%, and 84.3% for the three datasets, respectively) based on the experimental results confirms that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of MI-based BCIs.

The present study tests the neglected hypothesis that the neurofunctional networks involved in motor impulsivity might also be dysfunctional in PD-ICDs. Methods: We performed blind spectral analyses of resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) data in PD patients with and without ICDs to probe the functional integrity of all cortical networks. Analyses were performed directly at the source level after blind source separation. Discrete differences between groups were tested by comparing patients with and without ICDs. Gradual dysfunctions were assessed by means of correlations between power changes and clinical scores reflecting ICD severity (QUIP score). Results: Spectral signatures of ICDs were found in the medial prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate and the supplementary motor area, in the beta and gamma bands. Beta power changes in the supplementary motor area were found to predict ICDs severity. Conclusion: ICDs are associated with abnormal activity within frequency bands and cortical circuits supporting the control of motor response inhibition. Significance: These results bring to the forefront the need to consider, in addition to the classical interpretation based on aberrant mesocorticolimbic reward processing, the issue of motor impulsivity in PD-ICDs and its potential implications for PD therapy.

The attention degree is estimated from EEG signals using methods of nonlinear and statistical time-frequency analyses. We find that the feedback increases the duration of the maximum interval during which the subject maintains substantial attention (150 +/- 40 s with feedback versus 100 +/- 20 s without feedback). However, the mean degree of attention during this interval is 27% lower than without feedback. The obtained result evidences that the cognitive reserve is limited, and therefore, to maintain high performance for a prolonged time, the brain operates in a "safe-mode" regime.

Although voluntary (self-paced) movement demonstrates characteristic patterns of electroencephalographic activity, externally paced (stimulus driven) cortical activity is more complex and involves stimulus processing, anticipation, motor preparation, and execution (Neuper & Pfurtscheller, 2001). Thus, the primary purpose of the present study was to explore the event-related dynamics of brain oscillations in the externally paced sport skill of ice hockey shooting. Twenty-eight ice hockey players completed a total of 50 shots on net taken on five possible random targets that illuminated at a random time. This randomization of time and location enabled the evaluation of cue-driven cortical activity during a sport skill. Event-related desynchronization and synchronization of electroencephalographic activity were analyzed from -3 to +0.5 s relative to the cue light, and prior to shot execution was analyzed for multiple spectral bandwidths to explore premovement cortical dynamics. Overall, the results revealed that the cortical patterns of ice hockey shooting differ from that of self-paced, closed-skilled sport. Specifically, theta, alpha, and lower beta bands demonstrated significant widespread event-related desynchronization prior to the external cue (target light), and event-related synchronization (or reduction of event-related desynchronization) occurred only after the cue appeared.

Yet behavioral work suggests that the processing of rewards is faster than for punishments, raising the possibility that expected value and motivational salience manifest at different latencies during movement planning. Given the role of beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) in movement preparation and in communication within the reward circuit, this study investigated how beta activity is modulated by positive and negative monetary incentives during reach planning, and in particular whether it reflects expected value and motivational salience at different latencies. Electroencephalography was recorded while male and female humans performed a reaching task in which reward or punishment delivery depended on movement accuracy. Before a preparatory delay period, participants were informed of the consequences of hitting or missing the target, according to four experimental conditions: Neutral (hit/miss: +0/-0 cent), Reward (hit/miss: +5/-0 cent), Punish (hit/miss: +0/-5 cent) and Mixed (hit/miss: +5/-5 cent). Results revealed that beta power over parieto-frontal regions was strongly modulated by incentives during the delay period, with power positively correlating with movement times. Interestingly, beta power was selectively sensitive to potential rewards early in the delay period, after which it came to reflect motivational salience as movement onset neared. These results demonstrate that beta activity reflects expected value and motivational salience on different time scales during reach planning. They also provide support for models that link beta activity with basal ganglia and dopamine for the allocation of neural resources according to behavioral salience.

Participants performed the flanker task with an alerting tone in half of the trials and SAT manipulation. Behavioral results showed the usual increase of the conflict effect (incongruent-congruent flankers) in the alerting trials. This interaction was not affected by SAT manipulation in response times, although accuracy emphasis abolished alerting effects in error rates. Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that alerting increased the conflict by facilitating the selection and activation of stimulus-response links, reflected in modulations of the P3b component, and by enhancing the activation of incorrect response evoked by incongruent flankers, reflected in an increased initial incorrect activation in the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). Time-frequency analysis showed that the alerting-triggered increase of conflict entailed stronger response of executive mechanisms, reflected in a larger conflict-related midfrontal theta-band power. These EEG effects were not affected by SAT manipulation. In conclusion, alerting affects both the emergence of conflict and conflict control, and this alerting-conflict interaction could not be explained in terms of SAT.

One particular class of methods, based on the linear parametric representation of multiple interacting time series, is widely used to study causal connectivity in the brain. However, the results obtained by these methods should be interpreted with great care. The goal of this paper is to show, both theoretically and using simulations, that results obtained by applying causal connectivity measures on the sensor (scalp) time series do not allow interpretation in terms of interacting brain sources. This is because (1) the channel locations cannot be seen as an approximation of a source's anatomical location and (2) spurious connectivity can occur between sensors. Although many measures of causal connectivity derived from EEG sensor time series are affected by the latter, here we will focus on the well-known time domain index of Granger causality (GC) and on the frequency domain directed transfer function (DTF). Using the state-space framework and designing two simulation studies we show that mixing effects caused by volume conduction can lead to spurious connections, detected either by time domain GC or by DTF. Therefore, GC/DTF causal connectivity measures should be computed at the source level, or derived within analysis frameworks that model the effects of volume conduction. Since mixing effects can also occur in the source space, it is advised to combine source space analysis with connectivity measures that are robust to mixing.

Youth soccer players (n = 16) were the participants of the study. To assess anxiety state, participants completed the Sport Competition Anxiety Test. The EEG was recorded using single-channel mobile EEG system on the prefrontal cortex. Regression model was used to analyze EEG rhythms as predictor of anxiety by cross-sectional study. Regression analyses revealed that the indicator of eyes-open condition based on delta rhythm is the predictor with positive slope to the prediction of the level of competitive anxiety (P <= 0.01). The indicator of eyes-closed condition based on theta rhythm is the predictor with negative slope to the prediction of the level of competitive anxiety (P <= 0.03). The findings are interpreted to suggest that delta and theta rhythms are a plausible neurobiological index of anxiety and can distinguish anxiety in sport competition. A slow EEG oscillation predicts formation of competitive anxiety in soccer players and appears to reflect the mechanism of the defensive inhibition in prefrontal cortex to competitive anxiety. Application of the portable EEG system may provide an efficient and valid predictor of emotional state of soccer players.

Non-sinusoidal waves in the EEG and their simulated effect on anaesthetic quantitative EEG monitors	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Depth of anaesthesia; EEG; Wave shape; Triangularity; Non-sinusoidal waves	OSCILLATIONS	The effect of anaesthetic drugs on the cortex are commonly estimated from the electroencephalogram (EEG) by quantitative EEG monitors such as the Bispectral Index (BIS). These monitors use ratios of high to low frequency power which assumes that each neurological process contributes a unique frequency pattern. However, recent research of the effect of deep brain stimulation on EEG beta oscillations suggests that wave shape, a non-sinusoidal feature that is only measurable in the time-domain, can change the frequency 'signature' of a neurological rhythmical process by the inclusion or removal of harmonic frequencies. If wave shape variations are present in the EEG of anaesthetised patients, then quantitative EEG monitors likely overestimate the anaesthetic drug effect. The purpose of this paper is to investigate alpha-wave shape in the EEG of anaesthetised patients and demonstrate the effect of wave shape on the frequency ratios that are commonly utilised in the BIS quantitative EEG monitor. EEG data, demographic information, and surgery details were collected prospectively from 305 patients undergoing a general anaesthetic for elective surgery. Alpha-wave shape was categorised by triangularity of the EEG extrema, a measure of how peaked (towards a sawtooth wave) or flat (towards a square wave) the extremum was. The alpha-wave was then artificially modified to either a sawtooth wave or square wave, and BetaRatio and PowerFastSlow metrics calculated. Age was found to be the only significant predictor of alpha wave triangularity. The artificially modified square-alpha waves increased the power in the frequency spectrum at 26 Hz by 1-5 dB, and increased the BetaRatio by 0.7. The alpha-wave of anaesthetised patients contains non-sinusoidal components which likely impact depth of anaesthesia calculations.

A Deep Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network Architecture for Parkinson's Disease EEG Classification	2019 7TH IEEE GLOBAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING (IEEE GLOBALSIP)	IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing		English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (IEEE GlobalSIP)	NOV 11-14, 2019	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Signal Proc Soc, MathWorks, Carleton Univ, Fac Engn & Design, Univ Ottawa		Deep learning; Parkinson's disease; EEG classification; CNN; LSTM		Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by slowness of movement, tremor and rigidity, is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated that abnormal neural oscillations within and between multiple brain regions play a critical role in the motor symptoms through invasive neural recordings. Progressions have been also made in EEG studies to use features in cortical oscillations recorded non-invasively as a diagnostic tool for PD. However, it is still challenging to effectively use EEG recordings for PD diagnosis. In this work, we design a novel deep learning framework for PD EEG classification. Specifically, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN) with long shortterm memory (LSTM) cells are exploited in our framework. First, we design two 1D-CNN layers to derive features to represent spatial (topological) relationships across EEG channels. Then, we apply LSTM on the spatial features from the CNN to further improve its performance. Finally, we validate our model on the PD classification on resting EEG recorded from 20 PD and 21 healthy subjects. Our method achieves accuracy of 96.9%, precision of 100%, and recall of 93.4% for differentiating PD from healthy controls and outperforms the state-of-the-art PD EEG classification results in the deep learning literature.

J	Kilicarslan, A; Vidal, JLC				Kilicarslan, Atilla; Vidal, Jose Luis Contreras			Characterization and real-time removal of motion artifacts from EEG signals	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; real-time artifact removal; motion artifacts; ocular artifacts		Objective. Accurate implementation of real-time non-invasive brain-machine/computer interfaces (BMI/BCI) requires handling physiological and nonphysiological artifacts associated with the measurement modalities. For example, scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements are often considered prone to excessive motion artifacts and other types of artifacts that contaminate the EEG recordings. Although the magnitude of such artifacts heavily depends on the task and the setup, complete minimization or isolation of such artifacts is generally not possible. Approach. We present an adaptive de-noising framework with robustness properties, using a Volterra based non-linear mapping to characterize and handle the motion artifact contamination in EEG measurements. We asked healthy able-bodied subjects to walk on a treadmill at gait speeds of 1-to-4 mph, while we tracked the motion of select EEG electrodes with an infrared video-based motion tracking system. We also placed inertial measurement unit (IMO) sensors on the forehead and feet of the subjects for assessing the overall head movement and segmenting the gait. Main results. We discuss in detail the characteristics of the motion artifacts and propose a real-time compatible solution to filter them. We report the effective handling of both the fundamental frequency of contamination (synchronized to the walking speed) and its harmonics. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis for walking shows that the gait dependency of artifact contamination is also eliminated on all target frequencies. Significance. The real-time compatibility and generalizability of our adaptive filtering framework allows for the effective use of non-invasive BMI/BCI systems and greatly expands the implementation type and application domains to other types of problems where signal denoising is desirable. Combined with our previous efforts of filtering ocular artifacts, the presented technique allows for a comprehensive adaptive filtering framework to increase the EEG signal to noise ratio (SNR). We believe the implementation will benefit all non-invasive neural measurement modalities, including studies discussing neural correlates of movement and other internal states, not necessarily of BMI focus.

In this paper, an efficient and flexible diagnostic method is proposed, which enables the simultaneous use of a machine learning method and sparsity-based representation technique. Specifically, the proposed method is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and generalized minimax-concave (GMC) method. First, measured potential signals, for instance, electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are directly inputted into the designed network based on CNN for health conditions classification. The designed network adopts small convolution kernels to enhance the performance of feature extraction. In the training process, small batch samples are applied to improve the generalization of the model. Meanwhile, the "Dropout" strategy is applied to overcome the overfitting problem in fully connected layers. Then, for a record of the interested EEG or ECG signal, the sparse representation of useful time-frequency features can be estimated via the GMC method. Case studies of seizure detection and arrhythmia signal analysis are adopted to verify the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify different health conditions and maximally enhance the sparsity of time-frequency features.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disorder characterized by recurrent hypo and hyperglycemic episodes, whose clinical development has been associated with cognitive and working memory (WM) deficits. Objective. - To contrast quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) measures between young patients with T1D and healthy controls while performing a visuospatial WM task with two memory load levels and facial emotional stimuli. Methods. - Four or five neutral or happy faces were sequentially and pseudo-randomly presented in different spatial locations, followed by subsequent sequences displaying the reversed spatial order or any other. Participants were instructed to discriminate between these two alternatives during EEG recording. Results. - A significant increase in the absolute power of the delta and theta bands, distributed mainly over the frontal region was found during task execution, with a slight decrease of alpha band power in both groups but mainly in control individuals. However, these changes were more pronounced in the T1D patients, and reached their maximum level during the WM encoding phase, even on trials with the lower memory load. In contrast, changes seemed to occur more gradually in controls and results differed significantly only on the trials with the higher WM load. Conclusions. - These results reflect adaptive WM-processing mechanisms in which cognitive strategies have evolved in T1D patients in order to meet task demands. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Recently, researchers found that patients often present physiological abnormalities that precede an epileptic seizure onset. Importantly, these modifications can vary a lot among patients. While the conventional methodology for characterizing epilepsy is electroencephalogram (EEG), some evidences show that electrocardiogram (ECG) can be also useful to assess modifications associated to seizures. In this paper, a preliminary study about the integration of EEG and ECG for a patient-specific seizure prediction is presented. Synchronization patterns from the EEG and time and frequency features, as well as recurrence quantification analysis measures from the inter-beat (RR) series, were extracted. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was then applied to classify preictal and interictal phases combining features extracted from the two signals. Results showed that, using the proposed combined approach, it is possible to predict the epileptic seizure onset with a total average sensitivity of 93.3%, specificity of 80.6% and a prediction time of about 20 min. This approach could be implemented in portable and wearable devices for a real-life patient-specific seizure prediction.

J	Zwarts, M; van Erp, G; van Dijk, H				Zwarts, Machiel; van Erp, Gerard; van Dijk, Hans			Bilateral synchronous gamma range firing of bulbar motor units during tonic seizures	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						tonic; epilepsy; EEG; EMG		We present a patient with tonic seizures of the bulbar muscles. Video-EEG recording during the multiple attacks showed no ictal EEG abnormalities. The tonic seizures were clearly visible as EMG artefacts on the EEG recording and consisted of 3-6 symmetric tonic bursts of EMG activity of 2-4 seconds and an interval of 2-6 seconds. Spectral analysis showed a very distinct, bilateral synchronous, dominant gamma peak on the EMG spectra during the seizures with a cross correlation of 0.67 between left and right without a time lag. We discuss whether this peak originates from the firing frequencies of the bulbar motor units, and whether this is consistent with the Piper rhythm described during maximal voluntary contraction in controls and related to firing in the gamma range of the cortical motor neurons. We conclude that the EMG artefacts recorded on EEG during seizures can be informative with regards to the type and pathophysiology of epilepsy.

Methods: We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in adults with ASD and controls during the performance of a predictive contextual processing task, using either triangles or emotional faces. Targets were preceded by either randomized sequences (R) or by sequences including a predictive sequence (P). Results: ASD subjects showed an attenuated behavioral facilitation (P versus R) compared with controls (faces). P3b amplitudes of P, R and the predictive sequence (n-1) were attenuated in ASD compared with controls. However, the attenuation of n-1 was more pronounced during the processing of faces. Controls demonstrated shorter peak P3b latencies of P versus R, while this facilitation was absent in ASD subjects. ASD subjects demonstrated functional connectivity alterations during the processing of random (triangles and faces) and predicted targets (faces). These changes were associated with weaker, more randomised, functional connections between frontal and parietal regions in ASD. Conclusions: We found predictive contextual processing alterations in ASD, which were more pronounced during the processing of emotional faces compared with abstract stimuli. Significance: We provide novel evidence for the proposition that ASD is associated with deficits of top-down predictions. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe changes in brain activity related to the execution of motor tasks implemented on a software - the NeuroMaze - developed specifically to stimulate speed-accuracy tradeoff. New Method: The NeuroMaze was tested in eleven young and healthy individuals in a single experimental session. The tasks consisted in moving a square appearing on the monitor by holding and dragging it with a mouse across paths of different widths (wide [2 cm] vs intermediate [1.5 cm] vs narrow [1 cm] widths). The mouse cursor speed and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) from the frontal, somatosensory and motor areas were recorded. Results: The mouse speed is reduced by 15 +/- 6% and 48 +/- 7% from the wide to the intermediate and narrow paths respectively (p < 0.005). Moreover, there was a greater beta EEG relative power in the narrow path in the frontal area of the brain when compared to the wide path (p < 0.05). Similarly, the narrow path reduced the gamma EEG relative power in motor/sensorimotor areas when compared to the wide path (p < 0.05). Comparison with existing methods: The NeuroMaze is introduced as a method to elicit speed-accuracy tradeoff, and the authors are not aware of specific methods to establish fair comparisons. Conclusion: The NeuroMaze creates conditions to stimulate brain areas related to motor planning, sensory feedback and motor execution using speed-accuracy tradeoff contexts. Therefore, the NeuroMaze may induce adaptations in patients undergoing upper limb rehabilitation.

The method exploits electroencephalogram acquisitions (EEG), and specifically the Movement Related Potentials (MRPs) (i.e., and R rhythms), to actuate the user intention on the mechatronic device. The EEG data are collected by only five wireless smart electrodes positioned on the central and parietal cortex area. The acquired data are analyzed by an innovative single-trial classification algorithm that, with respect to the current state of the art, strongly reduces the training time (Minimum: h, reached: 10 min), as well as the acquisition time- after stimulus- for a reliable classification (Typical: 4-8 s reached: 2 s). As first step, the algorithm performs an EEG time-frequency analysis in the selected bands, making the data suitable for further computations. The implemented machine learning (ML) stage consists of: (i) dimensionality reduction; (ii) statistical inference-based features extraction (FE); (iii) classification model selection. It is also proposed a dedicated algorithm, the MLE-RIDE, for the dimensionality reduction that, jointly with statistical analyses, digitalize the and R rhythms, performing the features extraction. Finally, the best support vector machine (SVM) model is selected and used in the on-line classification. As proof of concept, two mechatronic devices have been brain-controlled by using the proposed BCI algorithm: a three-finger robotic hand and an acrylic prototype car. The experimental results, obtained with data from 3 subjects (aged 26 1), showed an accuracy on human will wireless detection of 87.4%, in the real-time binary discrimination, with 33.7ms of computation times.

This pilot study investigates the potential of EEG oscillations as covert measures to detect residual processing of pleasant/unpleasant somatic stimuli in VS patients. 22 VS patients received two somatic stimulations - a wrist grasp and the placement of an ice pack on their wrist - during EEG recording. Results showed that both pleasant and unpleasant stimulations elicited increased frontal and parietal delta power, with greater parietal responses during the unpleasant stimulations than the pleasant ones. Pleasant stimulations were associated to greater decrease of alpha activity in left frontal areas compared to the unpleasant ones. These activation patterns might mirror basic vigilance responses to external stimuli, supported by residual fronto-parietal interactions. Analysis of EEG profiles during somatic stimulations might point out informative patterns of oscillatory responses.

However, there were few studies that observed correlations between mouth breathing and cognition. This study aimed at investigating the changes in brain activity during mouth breathing while the participant simultaneously performed a cognitive task using electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Twenty subjects participated in this study, and EEG electrodes (32 channels, 250-Hz sampling rate) were placed on their scalp. Brain waves during a resting state and n-back tasks (0-back and 2-back) and physiological parameters such as SpO2, ETCO2, and the airway respiratory rate were measured. The pre-processed EEG signals were analyzed based on their frequencies as delta waves (0.5???4?Hz), theta waves (4???8?Hz), alpha waves (8???13?Hz), beta waves (13???30?Hz) and gamma waves (30???50?Hz) using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Results: When compared with nose breathing, theta and alpha powers were lower during mouth breathing at rest and alpha wave presented low power at 0-back and 2-back tasks. Furthermore, beta and gamma waves exhibited low powers at 2-back task. However, the behavioral results (accuracy and response time) have no significant difference between two breathing methods (mouth and nose). Mouth breathing showed different brain activity patterns, compared to nose breathing, and these changes are related to cognitive regions. Conclusion: The reason for this change seems to relate to the decreased oxygen saturation during mouth breathing, suggesting that when cognitive abilities are required, mouth breathing can act as one of the variables that cause different outcomes in brain activities.

Euthanasia methods should affect the brain first causing insensibility, followed by cardiorespiratory arrest. Neck or cervical dislocation methods, either manual (CD) or mechanical (MCD), are reported to cause a prolonged time to loss of sensibility and death with inconsistent results upon application, especially MCD methods. However, there is limited information on cervical dislocation in turkeys. The overall objective of this study was to assess the welfare implications of CD and a newly developed MCD device for euthanasia of cull turkeys in comparison with intravenous (IV) pentobarbital sodium (1mL/4.5kg), the gold standard euthanasia method. Time to death using electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioural responses were monitored in eight and eighteen week-old turkeys for five minutes after each euthanasia method application. Spectral analyses of EEG responses and onset of isoelectric EEGs were compared to baseline EEG recordings of birds under anesthesia and behavioural responses were studied among euthanasia treatments. A significant decrease in brain activity frequencies analysis and isoelectric EEG were recorded as time of brain death.ResultsAll turkeys euthanized with IV pentobarbital sodium presented a rapid and irreversible decrease in the EEG activity at approximately 30s post-injection with minimal behavioural responses. CD and MCD methods caused EEG responses consistent with brain death at approximately 120s and 300s, respectively. Additionally, isoelectric EEGs resulted in all pentobarbital sodium and CD groups, but only in 54 and 88% of the eight and eighteen week-old turkeys in the MCD groups, respectively. There were few clear patterns of behavioural responses after CD and MCD application. However, cessation of body movement and time to isoelectric EEG after CD application were positively correlated.ConclusionsUse of CD and MCD resulted in a prolonged time to death in both age groups of turkeys. MCD application presents a number of welfare risks based on electroencephalographic and behavioural findings. Intravenous pentobarbital sodium induced rapid brain death, but possesses several on-farm limitations. To develop improvements in cervical dislocation methods, further investigations into combined or alternative methods are required to reduce the prolonged time to insensibility and death.

After applying a spectrogram based on short-time Fourier transform (SSTFT), both sparseness constraints and total power are used on the time-frequency representation to automatically locate the subject-specific bands that pack the highest power during pedaling motor imagery. The output frequency bands are employed in the recognition system to automatically adjust the cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter (Butterworth, 2nd order). Riemannian geometry is also used to extract spatial features, which are further analyzed through a fast version of neighborhood component analysis to increase the class separability. Main results. For ten healthy subjects, our recognition system based on subject-specific bands achieved mean accuracy of 96.43% +/- 1.56% and mean Kappa of 92.85% +/- 3.12%. Significance. Our approach can be used to obtain a low-cost robotic rehabilitation system based on motorized pedal, as pedaling exercises have shown great potential for improving the muscular performance of post-stroke survivors.

However, this phenomenon has received little attention and its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we conducted two experiments combining psychophysics, electroencephalography (EEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to investigate neural mechanisms of pain insensitivity in SCZ patients. Specifically, we adopted a stimulus-response paradigm with brief stimuli of different sensory modalities (i.e., nociceptive, non-nociceptive somatosensory, and auditory) to test whether pain insensitivity in SCZ patients is supra-modal or modality-specific, and used EEG and fMRI techniques to clarify its neural mechanisms. We observed that perceived intensities to nociceptive stimuli were significantly smaller in SCZ patients than healthy controls, whereas perceived intensities to non-nociceptive somatosensory and auditory stimuli were not significantly different. The behavioral results were confirmed by stimulus-evoked brain responses sampled by EEG and fMRI techniques, thus verifying the modality-specific nature of the modulation of nociceptive information processing in SCZ patients. Additionally, significant group differences were observed in the spectral power of alpha oscillations in prestimulus EEG and the seed-based functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI (seeds: the thalamus and periaqueductal gray that are key nodes in ascending and descending pain pathways respectively), suggesting a possible contribution of cortical-subcortical dysfunction to the phenomenon. Overall, our study provides insight into the neural mechanisms of pain insensitivity in SCZ and highlights a need for systematic assessments of their pain-related diseases.

Objective stress assessment methods using noninvasive physiological responses such as heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalograms (EEG) have therefore been proposed for effective stress management. In this study, a novel wearable device that can measure electrocardiograms (ECG) and EEG simultaneously was designed to enable continuous stress monitoring in daily life. The developed system is easily worn by hanging from both ears, is lightweight (i.e., 42.5 g), and exhibits an excellent noise performance of 0.12 Vrms. Significant time and frequency features of HRV and EEG were found in two different stressors, namely the Stroop color word and mental arithmetic tests, using 14 young subjects. Stressor situations were classified using various HRV and EEG feature selections and a support vector machine technique. The five-fold cross-validation results obtained when using both EEG and HRV features showed the best performance with an accuracy of 87.5%, which demonstrated the requirement for simultaneous HRV and EEG measurements.

Dysregulation of Temporal Dynamics of Synchronous Neural Activity in Adolescents on Autism Spectrum	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; resting state; neural oscillations; neural synchronization; functional connectivity; phase synchrony; developmental cognitive neuroscience	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN NETWORK; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; CHILDREN; ABNORMALITIES; PATTERNS; TRAITS	Autism spectrum disorder is increasingly understood to be based on atypical signal transfer among multiple interconnected networks in the brain. Relative temporal patterns of neural activity have been shown to underlie both the altered neurophysiology and the altered behaviors in a variety of neurogenic disorders. We assessed brain network dynamics variability in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) using measures of synchronization (phase-locking) strength, and timing of synchronization and desynchronization of neural activity (desynchronization ratio) across frequency bands of resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Our analysis indicated that frontoparietal synchronization is higher in ASD but with more short periods of desynchronization. It also indicates that the relationship between the properties of neural synchronization and behavior is different in ASD and typically developing populations. Recent theoretical studies suggest that neural networks with a high desynchronization ratio have increased sensitivity to inputs. Our results point to the potential significance of this phenomenon to the autistic brain. This sensitivity may disrupt the production of an appropriate neural and behavioral responses to external stimuli. Cognitive processes dependent on the integration of activity from multiple networks maybe, as a result, particularly vulnerable to disruption. Autism Res 2019. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary Parts of the brain can work together by synchronizing the activity of the neurons. We recorded the electrical activity of the brain in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and then compared the recording to that of their peers without the diagnosis. We found that in participants with autism, there were a lot of very short time periods of non-synchronized activity between frontal and parietal parts of the brain. Mathematical models show that the brain system with this kind of activity is very sensitive to external events.

The dataset contains electroencephalographic (EEG), magnetoencephalographic (MEG), and functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 16 subjects who undertook multiple runs of a simple task performed on a large number of famous, unfamiliar and scrambled faces. We demonstrate: (1) batching and scripting of preprocessing of multiple runs/subjects of combined MEG and EEG data, (2) creation of trial-averaged evoked responses, (3) source-reconstruction of the power (induced and evoked) across trials within a time-frequency window around the "N/M170" evoked component, using structural MRI for forward modeling and simultaneous inversion (fusion) of MEG and EEG data, (4) group-based optimisation of spatial priors during M/EEG source reconstruction using fMRI data on the same paradigm, and (5) statistical mapping across subjects of cortical source power increases for faces vs. scrambled faces.

For the five-day emotion related EEG data of 12 subjects, the CSP algorithm is firstly used to project the raw EEG data into an optimal subspace to extract the discriminative features by maximizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between the two categories of EEG data. Then the WPD algorithm is used to decompose the EEG signals into the related features in time-frequency domain. Finally, four stateof-the-art classifiers including Bagging tree, SVM, linear discriminant analysis and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis are used to make binary emotion classification. The experimental results show that with CSP spatial filtering, the emotion classification on the WPD features extracted with bior3.3 wavelet base gets the best accuracy of 0.862, which is 29.3% higher than that of the power spectral density (PSD) feature without CSP preprocessing, is 23% higher than that of the PSD feature with CSP preprocessing, is 1.9% higher than that of the WPD feature extracted with bior3.3 wavelet base without CSP preprocessing, and is 3.2% higher than that of the WPD feature extracted with the rbio6.8 wavelet base without CSP preprocessing. Our proposed method can effectively reduce the variance and non-stationary of the cross-day EEG signals, extract the emotion related features and improve the accuracy and stability of the cross-day EEG emotion classification. It is valuable for the development of robust emotional brain-computer interface applications.

It is crucial to investigate the correlation of brain waves by sleep EEG analysis due to the association between rhythmic oscillations of neuronal activity and neocortical synchronization. Multiscale joint permutation entropy (MJPE) had been proven to be capable of measuring the correlation between time series from the view of multiple time scales and thus can be a promising approach to address the challenge. Instead of simulation, we tested the MJPE method on a widely used open dataset of sleep EEG time series from healthy subjects and found that the correlation index obtained by MJPE had the capability of quantifying the brain wave correlations under different sleep stages, reflecting the typical sleep patterns and indicating the weakened correlation with aging. A higher level of correlation was found as the sleep stage advanced. The findings based on the MJPE results were in accordance with previous studies and existing knowledge in sleep medicine. In the second part of the study, we applied MJPE on sleep EEGs from subjects under pathological conditions (sleep apnea and sleep at high altitude). Likewise, the correlation index also properly revealed their sleep architectures, with consistent trends of the correlation through the nights. The effectiveness and practicability of the MJPE method had been verified on sleep EEGs. Therefore, the MJPE method should be encouraged to be widely used for analyzing large-scale sleep EEGs under various pathological conditions to provide insight into the mechanisms of the sleep process and neuron synchronization.

PharmaCog Consortium	Two-Year Longitudinal Monitoring of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients with Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease Using Topographical Biomarkers Derived from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Electroencephalographic Activity	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alpha rhythms; amnesic mild cognitive impairment; biomarkers; clinical trial; electroencephalography; functional magnetic resonance imaging; oddball event-related potentials; PharmaCog project; prodromal Alzheimer's disease; resting state	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL MIDLINE STRUCTURES; EEG SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; RESTING-STATE FMRI; QUANTITATIVE EEG; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; PARIETAL CORTEX; ALPHA RHYTHMS	Auditory "oddball" event-related potentials (aoERPs), resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) connectivity, and electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms were tested as longitudinal functional biomarkers of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data were collected at baseline and four follow-ups at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients classified in two groups: "positive" (i.e., "prodromal AD"; n = 81) or "negative" (n = 63) based on a diagnostic marker of AD derived from cerebrospinal samples (A beta(42)/P-tau ratio). A linear mixed model design was used to test functional biomarkers for Group, Time, and Group x Time effects adjusted by nuisance covariates (only data until conversion to dementia was used). Functional biomarkers that showed significant Group effects ("positive" versus "negative", p < 0.05) regardless of Time were 1) reduced rsfMRI connectivity in both the default mode network (DMN) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), both also giving significant Time effects (connectivity decay regardless of Group); 2) increased rsEEG source activity at delta (<4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) rhythms and decreased source activity at low-frequency alpha (8-10.5 Hz) rhythms; and 3) reduced parietal and posterior cingulate source activities of aoERPs. Time x Group effects showed differential functional biomarker progression between groups: 1) increased rsfMRI connectivity in the left parietal cortex of the DMN nodes, consistent with compensatory effects and 2) increased limbic source activity at theta rhythms. These findings represent the first longitudinal characterization of functional biomarkers of prodromal AD relative to "negative" aMCI patients based on 5 serial recording sessions over 2 years.

While this work has established the ability to decode identity-level information (such as the identity of a face or of a word) from neural signals, much less is known about the precise nature of the signals that support such feats, their robustness across visual categories, or their consistency across human participants. Here, we address these questions through the use of EEG-based decoding and multivariate feature selection as applied to three visual categories: words, faces and face ensembles (i.e., crowds of faces). Specifically, we use recursive feature elimination to estimate the diagnosticity of time and frequency-based EEG features for identity-level decoding across three datasets targeting each of the three categories. We then relate feature diagnosticity across categories and across participants while, also, aiming to increase decoding performance and reliability. Our investigation shows that word and face processing are similar in their reliance on spatiotemporal information provided by occipitotemporal channels. In contrast, ensemble processing appears to also rely on central channels and exhibits a similar profile with word processing in the frequency domain. Further, we find that feature diagnosticity is stable across participants and is even capable of supporting cross-participant feature selection, as demonstrated by systematic boosts in decoding accuracy and feature reduction. Thus, our investigation sheds new light on the nature and the structure of the information underlying identity-level visual processing as well as on its generality across categories and participants.

Most machine learning approaches for the filter estimation, however, disregard within-trial temporal dynamics and are extremely sensitive to changes in training data and involved hyperparameters. This leads to highly variable solutions and impedes the selection of a suitable candidate for, e.g., neurotechnological applications. Fostering component introspection, we propose to embrace this variability by condensing the functional signatures of a large set of oscillatory components into homogeneous clusters, each representing specific within-trial envelope dynamics. The proposed method is exemplified by and evaluated on a complex hand force task with a rich within-trial structure. Based on electroencephalography data of 18 healthy subjects, we found that the components' distinct temporal envelope dynamics are highly subject-specific. On average, we obtained seven clusters per subject, which were strictly confinedregarding their underlying frequencybands. As the analysis method is not limited to a specific spatial filtering algorithm, it could be utilized for a wide range of neurotechnological applications, e.g., to select and monitor functionally relevant features for brain-computer interface protocols in stroke rehabilitation.

The specific aim of the described stimuli and analyses is to examine whether it is feasible to replicate previously reported CVEP morphological patterns elicited by an apparent motion stimulus, designed to simultaneously stimulate both ventral and dorsal central visual networks, using object and motion stimuli designed to separately stimulate ventral and dorsal visual cortical networks. Four visual paradigms are presented: 1. Randomized visual objects with consistent temporal presentation. 2. Randomized visual objects with inconsistent temporal presentation (or jitter). 3. Visual motion via a radial field of coherent central dot motion without jitter. 4. Visual motion via a radial field of coherent central dot motion with jitter. These four paradigms are presented in a pseudo-randomized order for each participant. Jitter is introduced in order to view how possible anticipatory-related effects may affect the morphology of the object-onset and motion-onset CVEP response. EEG data analyses are described in detail, including steps of data exportation from and importation to signal processing platforms, bad channel identification and removal, artifact rejection, averaging, and categorization of average CVEP morphological pattern type based upon latency ranges of component peaks. Representative data show that the methodological approach is indeed sensitive in eliciting differential object-onset and motion-onset CVEP morphological patterns and may, therefore, be useful in addressing the larger research aim. Given the high temporal resolution of EEG and the possible application of high-density EEG in source localization analyses, this protocol is ideal for the investigation of distinct CVEP morphological patterns and the underlying neural mechanisms which generate these differential responses.

Such Eureka! events, or Insight moments, are among the most fascinating mysteries of human cognition, whose neurophysiological substrate seems to include a role for oscillatory activity within the alpha and gamma bands in the right parietal and temporal brain regions. We tested this hypothesis on thirty-one healthy participants using transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) to externally amplify alpha (10 Hz) and gamma (40 Hz) activity in the right parietal and temporal lobes, respectively. During gamma-tACS over the right temporal lobe, we observed an increase in accuracy on a verbal insight task. Furthermore, electroencephalography (EEG) data revealed an increase in gamma spectral power over bilateral temporal lobes after stimulation. Additionally, resting-state functional MRI data acquired before the stimulation session suggested a correlation between behavioral response to right temporal lobe tACS and functional connectivity of bilateral temporal lobes, in line with the bilateral increase in gamma band revealed by EEG. Overall, results suggest the possibility of enhancing the probability of generating Eureka! moments in humans by means of frequency-specific noninvasive brain stimulation.

Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, PsyclNFO, and the Web of Science Core Collection databases using the keywords 'genetic generalized epilepsy', 'antiepileptic drugs and 'epileptiform discharge'. Primary human studies published in English that reported the effect of AEDs on EDs captured on electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of at least 24 h in duration in patients with GGE were included. Results: Six studies published between 1984 and 2017, which reported the effect of AEDs on EDs, involving a total of 116 patients with GCE, were analyzed. Our systematic review found a tendency for AEDs to reduce ED density, frequency, cumulative duration, and burst duration in GGE. Furthermore, we found evidence that the AED-mediated reduction in ED burden was associated with improved seizure control and cognitive outcomes. Conclusions: Antiepileptic drugs tend to reduce ED burden in GCE, but the significance of this association remains uncertain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have suggested that social learning and observation influence placebo hypoalgesia. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to determine the neurophysiological changes associated with pain relief acquired through the observation. Thirty-one participants observed a demonstrator undergo painful heat stimulations paired with a "control" cream and non-painful ones paired with a "treatment" cream, which actually were both Vanicreams. After their observation, the participants then received the same creams and stimulations. We found that the treatment cream led to lower self-reported pain intensity ratings than the control cream. Anticipatory treatment cues elicited smaller P2 in electrodes F1, Fz, FC1, and FCz than the control condition. The P2 component localization indicated a higher current density in the right middle frontal gyrus, a region associated with attentional engagement. In placebo responders, the sensorimotor cortex activity captured in electrodes C3, Cz, and C4 indicated that hypoalgesia was positively correlated with resting state peak alpha frequency (PAF). These results suggest that observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia may be driven by anticipatory mechanisms that modulate frontal attentional processes. Furthermore, resting state PAF could serve as a predictor of observationally-induced hypoalgesia.

Educational Neuroscience: Exploring Cognitive Processes that Underlie Learning	MIND, BRAIN AND TECHNOLOGY: LEARNING IN THE AGE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES	Educational Communications and Technology-Issues and Innovations		English	Editorial Material; Book Chapter							WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; MENTAL WORKLOAD; WORKED EXAMPLES; EEG ALPHA; LOAD; ACTIVATION; MULTIMEDIA; ATTENTION; THETA	This chapter reviews the most important neurotechnologies, neuroscience approaches, and empirical research using neuroscience methods and tools in education. Four specific technologies and representative studies using them are discussed in detail: eye tracking, electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. These neurotechnologies are examined as tools that offer high temporal resolution and those that provide high spatial resolution. A separate section addresses the use of neuroscience frameworks and tools that explore social cognition, focusing specifically on collaborative learning in teams. The chapter concludes with a discussion of important challenges and implications that educational researchers must keep in mind as they design empirical studies employing approaches and technologies from cognitive, social, and affective neuroscience. These implications include ensuring adequate signal-to-noise ratios, reducing the possibility of perceptual-motor confounds that may distort data of interest, and training psychophysiological signal classifiers using tasks that represent the cognitive processes involved in the experimental task. Careful task and study design and proper interpretation of physiological data in the context of cognitive and learning performance will improve the validity of educational studies conducted with EEG, fMRI, fNIRS, and eye tracking and will improve the reliability of data and generalizability of the findings.

A group of 20 people, unpaid volunteers, took part in the experimental neurophysiological work. To analyze the recorded signals of brain activity, we used wavelet mathematics and developed algorithms based on the calculation of skeletons. We found a significant difference in EEG activity for the subjects, objectively shared by health condition.

J	Han, HB; Lee, KE; Choi, JH				Han, Hio-Been; Lee, Ka Eun; Choi, Jee Hyun			Functional Dissociation of theta Oscillations in the Frontal and Visual Cortices and Their Long-Range Network during Sustained Attention	ENEURO			English	Article						EEG; frontal theta; oscillations; sustained attention; theta; visual theta	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; PHASE; GAMMA; FREQUENCY; EEG; STIMULATION; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; RHYTHMS	theta-Band (4-12 Hz) activities in the frontal cortex have been thought to be a key mechanism of sustained attention and goal-related behaviors, forming a phase-coherent network with task-related sensory cortices for integrated neuronal ensembles. However, recent visual task studies found that selective attention attenuates stimulus-related theta power in the visual cortex, suggesting a functional dissociation of cortical theta oscillations. To investigate this contradictory behavior of cortical theta, a visual Go/No-Go task was performed with electroencephalogram (EEG) recording in C57BU6J mice. During the No-Go period, transient theta oscillations were observed in both the frontal and visual cortices, but theta oscillations of the two areas were prominent in different trial epochs. By separating trial epochs based on subjects' short-term performance, we found that frontal theta was prominent in good-performance epochs, while visual theta was prominent in bad-performance epochs, exhibiting a functional dissociation of cortical theta rhythms. Furthermore, the two theta rhythms also showed a heterogeneous pattern of phase-amplitude coupling with fast oscillations, reflecting their distinct architecture in underlying neuronal circuitry. Interestingly, in good-performance epochs, where visual theta was relatively weak, stronger fronto-visual long-range synchrony and shorter posterior-to-anterior temporal delay were found. These findings highlight a previously overlooked aspect of long-range synchrony between distinct oscillatory entities in the cerebral cortex and provide empirical evidence of a functional dissociation of cortical theta rhythms.

There are different opinions about reasons. The effect of epilepsy features was not studied in ADHD before or after epilepsy. We aimed to obtain clues about this comorbidity in children. METHODS: Data of forty-four (33 males, 11 girls) consecutive epilepsy patients with ADHD were retrospectively reviewed. The binary subgroups were statistically compared. RESULTS: ADHD was diagnosed before epilepsy in 11 (25%) and after epilepsy in 33 (75%) patients. The mean age was 11.5 +/- 2.7, the first and last seizure ages were 5.2 +/- 3 and 9.5 +/- 2.8, antiepileptic drug (AED) starting and ADHD ages were 6.6 +/- 3.4 and 8.4 +/- 2 years respectively. In patients with ADHD after epilepsy, AED and first seizure ages were younger (p=0.004 and p=0.002, respectively). Gender, epilepsy type, ADHD age, electroencephalography and brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were similar. There was a shorter interval time between ADHD and epilepsy in patients with a first seizure age >5 and AED age >6.5 years (p=0.013 and p=0.000). EEG abnormalities were more frequent in patients with >1.5 years time interval between epilepsy and ADHD (p=0.044). The ages of last seizure and AED starting ages were positively correlated with ADHD age (r=0.389, r=0.434, p< 0.05). DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION: We found similar ADHD ages in patients with ADHD before or after epilepsy. However, AEDs need was observed in two separate periods, early childhood and school age. The similarity of other features suggests that common pathogenetic mechanisms may play a role in this comorbidity.

Basically, an SVM classifier is calculated for each frequency in the periodogram and a proposed weighting system, based on the error rate of each SVM classifier, is used to obtain a final decision value. Also, it is shown that principal component analysis can be used to identify the best group of EEG channels to apply to the classification method, improving the correct classification rate. Two applications with real data are presented. The first application uses a public data set of epileptic patients and compares the proposed method with other methods presented in the literature. In this case, the correct classification rate obtained was 100%. The second application consists of EEG data collected from a subject submitted to 10 visual stimuli and the correct classification rate obtained was 95.31%. The classifier WFF-SVM combines multiple existing techniques, each one of them widely used in time series and dimensionality reduction problems. Our paper combines standard signal processing techniques to obtain high classification rates of EEG data.	[de Carvalho, Jhonnata B.; de Pinho, Andre L.

J	Ou, JH; Law, SP				Ou, Jinghua; Law, Sam-Po			Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms as reflected by beta and gamma oscillations in speech perception: An individual-difference approach	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						EEG; Beta oscillation; Gamma oscillation; Speech perception	VISUAL-CORTEX; RESPONSES; DISCRIMINATION; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS; EEG	Recent neurophysiological studies have proposed distinct roles of beta and gamma oscillations in implementing top-down and bottom-up processes. The present study aims to test this hypothesis in the domain of speech perception. We examined beta and gamma oscillations elicited to a tone contrast in a passive oddball paradigm, and their relationships with discrimination sensitivity d' and RT from two groups of healthy adults who showed high and low discrimination sensitivity to the contrast. The low-sensitivity group showed a significant reduction in beta, which was further related to d'. Individual differences in RT were related to different frequency bands in the two groups, with a RT-beta correlation in the low-sensitivity group, and a RT-gamma relation in the high-sensitivity group. Based on these findings, we suggest that beta, implicated in top-down processing, reflects individual differences in phonological representations, and that gamma, involved in bottom-up processing, reflects individual differences in acoustic encoding.

This paper aims to study the effectiveness of HRM incentives in shipping enterprises. To this end, literature analysis, neuroscience experimental methods, and data analytical methods were used to analyse the relationship between active individuals and guided management in HRM of shipping enterprises. Then, based on the incentive related concepts, cognitive neural and related theories, the active individual incentive effect experiments based on EEG analysis were designed, to explores the incentive principle and process on the individual. The extraction and analysis of the brain wave experimental data reveals the different effects of different incentive frequency and timing on the active individual. Finally, the incentive method suitable for active individual in HRM of shipping enterprises was proposed. The research findings shall provide relevant theoretical basis for the shipping enterprise to formulate more effective HRM incentive measures, which have certain practical value.

Coupling of autonomic and central events during sleep benefits declarative memory consolidation	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; WAVE ACTIVITY; THETA RHYTHM; DEEP SLEEP; SPINDLES; PHASE; MECHANISMS; AMPLITUDE; RIPPLES	While anatomical pathways between forebrain cognitive and brainstem autonomic nervous centers are well-defined, autonomic-central interactions during sleep and their contribution to waking performance are not understood. Here, we analyzed simultaneous central activity via electroencephalography (EEG) and autonomic heart beat-to-beat intervals (RR intervals) from electrocardiography (ECG) during wake and daytime sleep. We identified bursts of ECG activity that lasted 4-5 s and predominated in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM). Using event-based analysis of NREM sleep, we found an increase in delta (0.5-4 Hz) and sigma (12-15 Hz) power and an elevated density of slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) about 5 s prior to peak of the heart rate burst, as well as a surge in vagal activity, assessed by high-frequency (HF) component of RR intervals. Using regression framework, we show that these Autonomic/Central Events (ACE) positively predicted post-nap improvement in a declarative memory task after controlling for the effects of spindles and slow oscillations from sleep periods without ACE. No such relation was found between memory performance and a control nap. Additionally, NREM ACE negatively correlated with REM sleep and learning in a non-declarative memory task. These results provide the first evidence that coordinated autonomic and central events play a significant role in declarative memory consolidation.

Jane; Chen, Xun			Removal of High-Voltage Brain Stimulation Artifacts From Simultaneous EEG Recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Noninvasive electrical brain stimulation; artifact removal; EEG; joint blind source separation (JBSS); independent vector analysis (IVA)	INDEPENDENT VECTOR ANALYSIS; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; MUSCLE ARTIFACTS; STATISTICS; NETWORKS; TDCS	Objective: noninvasive electrical brain stimulation (NEBS) can modulate brain dynamics and be used to induce changes in target brain areas. Because high-voltage stimulation artifacts tend to completely dominate the simultaneously recorded EEG and vary slightly trial by trial in both amplitude and phase, the majority of studies to date have simply compared poststimulation and prestimulation periods. Here, we propose the use of a modified joint blind source separation (JBSS) approach for removing stimulation artifacts when the same stimulus is applied in multiple epochs. Methods: quadrature regression and subsequent independent vector analysis (q-IVA) was applied to simulated and real EEG datasets recorded from ten subjects who received theta-band galvanic vestibular stimulation. Results: in simulations, q-IVA and JBSS approaches significantly improved the relative root-mean-squared error, correlation coefficient, and power deviation between the original and recovered EEG compared to conventional methods. In the real EEG data, after removing the artifacts with q-IVA, the power spectra during stimulation demonstrated significantly enhanced beta and gamma power compared to prestimulation, becoming similar to that seen in immediate poststimulation periods. In addition, we demonstrate that increased alpha power (8-13 Hz) in occipital regions with eye closure could be reliably detected in the cleaned EEG data after applying q-IVA. Conclusion: q-IVA and JBSS approaches outperform conventional artifact removal methods in both time and frequency domains. Significance: our results provide a promising way to effectively isolate stimulation artifacts in EEG, paving the way for future studies attempting to uncover ongoing modulation of brain activity during NEBS.

Objective/hypothesis: The aim of this study was to further elucidate the neurobiology of insomnia disorder (ID) and the potential for new treatment developments, based on the modulation of cortical activity through the non-invasive brain stimulation technique transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that bi-frontal anodal tDCS shortens and cathodal tDCS prolongs total sleep time in patients with ID, compared to sham stimulation. Furthermore, we tested for differences in indices of arousal between ID patients and healthy controls and explored their potential impact on tDCS effects. Methods: Nineteen ID patients underwent a within-subject repeated-measures sleep laboratory study with adaptation, baseline and three experimental nights. Bifrontal anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS was delivered in a counterbalanced order immediately prior to sleep. Wake EEG was recorded prior to and after tDCS as well as on the following morning. Subsequently, we compared patients with ID to a healthy control group from an earlier dataset. Results: Against our hypothesis, we did not observe any tDCS effects on sleep continuity or sleep architecture in patients with ID. Further analyses of nights without stimulation demonstrated significantly increased levels of arousal in ID patients compared to healthy controls, as indexed by subjective reports, reduced total sleep time, increased wake after sleep onset and increased high frequency EEG power during wakefulness and NREM sleep. Of note, indices of increased arousal predicted the lack of effect of tDCS in ID patients. Conclusions: Our study characterizes for the first time differential effects of tDCS on sleep in patients with ID and healthy controls, presumably related to persistent hyperarousal in ID. These findings suggest that adapted tDCS protocols need to be developed to modulate arousal and sleep dependent on baseline arousal levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The relationship between negative BOLD responses and ERS and ERD of alpha/beta oscillations in visual and motor cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; Negative BOLD; NBR; Alpha; ERS; Cross-modal	BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SIGNAL CHANGES; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; HUMAN BRAIN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BLOOD-FLOW; FMRI; MRI	Previous work has investigated the electrophysiological origins of the intra-modal (within the stimulated sensory cortex) negative BOLD fMRI response (NBR, decrease from baseline) but little attention has been paid to the origin of cross-modal NBRs, those in a different sensory cortex. In the current study we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings to assess the neural correlates of both intra- and cross-modal responses to left-hemifield visual stimuli and right-hand motor tasks, and evaluate the balance of activation and deactivation between the visual and motor systems. Within- and between-subject covariations of EEG and fMRI responses to both tasks are assessed to determine how patterns of event-related desynchronization/synchronisation (ERD/ERS) of alpha/beta frequency oscillations relate to the NBR in the two sensory cortices. We show that both visual and motor tasks induce intra-modal NBR and cross-modal NBR (e.g. visual stimuli evoked NBRs in both visual and motor cortices). In the EEG data, bilateral intra-modal alpha/beta ERD were consistently observed to both tasks, whilst the cross-modal EEG response varied across subjects between alpha/beta ERD and ERS. Both the mean cross-modal EEG and fMRI response amplitudes showed a small increase in magnitude with increasing task intensity. In response to the visual stimuli, subjects displaying cross-modal ERS of motor beta power displayed a significantly larger magnitude of cross-modal NBR in motor cortex. However, in contrast to the motor stimuli, larger cross-modal ERD of visual alpha power was associated with larger cross-modal visual NBR. Single-trial correlation analysis provided further evidence of relationship between EEG signals and the NBR, motor cortex beta responses to motor tasks were significantly negatively correlated with cross-modal visual cortex NBR amplitude, and positively correlated with intra-modal motor cortex PBR. This study provides a new body of evidence that the coupling between BOLD and low-frequency (alpha/beta) sensory cortex EEG responses extends to cross-modal NBR.

Earlier findings denoted the role of different subcortical structures and cortical regions in the visual test. However, there is a lack of information about how multimodal cues modify the EEG-patterns during acquired equivalence learning. To test this we have recorded EEG from 18 healthy volunteers and analyzed the power spectra and the strength of cross-frequency coupling, comparing a unimodal visual-guided and a bimodal, audio-visual-guided paradigm. We found that the changes in the power of the different frequency band oscillations were more critical during the visual paradigm and they showed less synchronized activation compared to the audio-visual paradigm. These findings indicate that multimodal cues require less prominent, but more synchronized cortical contribution, which might be a possible biomarker of forming multimodal associations.

Default examinations for understanding attention are questionnaires or physiological signals, like evoked potentials and electroencephalography. Physiological records were obtained using visual, auditory, and auditory-visual stimuli combinations with 48 participants-18-25-year-old university students-to find differences between sustained and divided attention. A Fourier-based filter was used to get a 0.01-30-Hz frequency band. Fractal dimensions, entropy values, power spectral densities, and Hjorth parameters from electroencephalography and P300 components from evoked potentials were calculated as features. To decrease the size of the feature set, some features, which yield less detail level for data, were eliminated. The visual and auditory stimuli in selective attention were compared with the divided attention state, and the best accuracy was found to be 88.89% on a support vector machine with linear kernel. As a result, it was seen that divided attention could be more difficult to determine from selective attention, but successful classification could be obtained with appropriate methods. Contrary to literature, the study deals with the infrastructure of attention types by working on a completely healthy and attention-high group.

Cognitive loading via mental arithmetic modulates effects of blink-related oscillations on precuneus and ventral attention network regions	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						awareness; blink; blink-related oscillations; environmental monitoring; magnetoencephalography; mental arithmetic; neurocognitive mechanisms; precuneus; ventral attention network	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTEX; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; EEG; MEMORY; SUPPRESSION; ACTIVATION; STATE; THETA	Blink-related oscillations (BROs) have been linked with environmental monitoring processes associated with blinking, with cortical activations in the bilateral precuneus. Although BROs have been described under resting and passive fixation conditions, little is known about their characteristics under cognitive loading. To address this, we investigated BRO effects during both mental arithmetic (MA) and passive fixation (PF) tasks using magnetoencephalography (n=20), while maintaining the same sensory environment in both tasks. Our results confirmed the presence of BRO effects in both MA and PF tasks, with similar characteristics including blink-related increase in global field power and blink-related activation of the bilateral precuneus. In addition, cognitive loading due to MA also modulated BRO effects by decreasing BRO-induced cortical activations in key brain regions including the bilateral anterior precuneus. Interestingly, blinking during MA-but not PF-activated regions of the ventral attention network (i.e., right supramarginal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus), suggesting possible recruitment of these areas for blink processing under cognitive loading conditions. Time-frequency analysis revealed a consistent pattern of BRO-related effects in the precuneus in both tasks, but with task-related functional segregation within the anterior and posterior subregions. Based on these findings, we postulate a potential neurocognitive mechanism for blink processing in the precuneus. This study is the first investigation of BRO effects under cognitive loading, and our results provide compelling new evidence for the important cognitive implications of blink-related processing in the human brain.

We show that an adequate quaternion Fourier transform permits to build relevant time-frequency representations of bivariate signals that naturally identify geometrical or polarization properties. First, a bivariate counterpart of the usual analytic signal of real signals is introduced, called the quaternion embedding of bivariate signals. Then two fundamental theorems ensure that a quaternion short term Fourier transform and a quaternion continuous wavelet transform are well defined and obey desirable properties such as conservation laws and reconstruction formulas. The resulting spectrograms and scalograms provide meaningful representations of both the time-frequency and geometrical/polarization content of the signal. Moreover the numerical implementation remains simply based on the use of FFT. A toolbox is available for reproducibility. Synthetic and real-world examples illustrate the relevance and efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the functional roles of this information flow loop remain unclear. In the current study, we compared information flow patterns in four different brain states using electroencephalography: resting-state, fixation, working memory (WM) encoding and WM maintenance. An auditory (pure tones) WM span task was carried out. A consistent anterior-to-posterior information flow in the theta band and an opposite pattern in the alpha band were found in all four segments. Flows in both patterns were enhanced during WM encoding. In contrast, a prefrontal-to-central information flow in the alpha band was dominant during the resting-state. In addition, enhanced information flows from right temporal to other brain regions in the theta band were found during WM processing (WM encoding and maintenance). Comparison of the consistency and dynamical changes of information flows in these four brain states indicated their functional roles in central executive processes, internal attention, WM information maintenance, and the right-hemisphere advantage in pure tone processing.

The purpose of the present study was to explore first, the neuropsychological and academic deficits in young individuals with TBI; and second, the underlying relationship between qEEG patterns and cognitive test performance. Analyses included 21 school-aged participants whom have experienced a recent TBI and 15 school-aged participants whom have never experienced a TBI. Mean subtest and composite scores were compared and regression analyses were used to determine whether alpha band and beta band qEEG coherence values predicted processing speed measures. Results suggest that young individuals who experienced a recent TBI exhibit general deficits in cognition and academic skills beyond what would be expected in the general population. Further, beta band coherence with the frontal brain regions significantly predicted processing speed scores, providing evidence of a relationship between qEEG patterns and processing speed. This outlines a relatively inexpensive method for utilizing neural connectivity to verify cognitive deficits for school-aged individuals with a recent TBI.

We used wireless electroencephalography to collect neurophysiological data from a group of 12 senior high school students and their teacher during regular biology lessons. Six scheduled classes over the course of the semester were organized such that class materials were presented using different teaching styles (videos and lectures), and students completed a multiple-choice quiz after each class to measure their retention of that lesson's content. Both students' brain-to-brain synchrony and their content retention were higher for videos than lectures across the six classes. Brain-to-brain synchrony between the teacher and students varied as a function of student engagement as well as teacher likeability: Students who reported greater social closeness to the teacher showed higher brain-to-brain synchrony with the teacher, but this was only the case for lectures-that is, when the teacher is an integral part of the content presentation. Furthermore, students' retention of the class content correlated with student-teacher closeness, but not with brain-to-brain synchrony. These findings expand on existing social neuroscience research by showing that social factors such as perceived closeness are reflected in brain-to-brain synchrony in real-world group settings and can predict cognitive outcomes such as students' academic performance.

Statistical Analysis of Sleep Quality from EEG Signal with Aromatic Stimuli	INTERNETWORKING INDONESIA			English	Article						DWT; EEG; FFT; Statistical Methods		Generally, an adults need to sleep for about 8 hours every night to keep the body in a good condition. In addition to adequate sleep, good sleep quality is also an important factor to note. But when the sleep time and sleep quality was disrupted, of course many bad effects are lurking. The quality of one's sleep can be known by reading the bio potential signals in the brain commonly called electroencephalograph (EEG). To be able to detect this signal, an EEG sensor is required at some point around the head. The data of signal measurement by EEG sensor will be recorded and can be processed directly by computer, without having to go through the signal conditioning circuit first. This process is usually called the data acquisition process. In the first stage of digital processing on a computer, the signal will have pre-processing (cutting, filtering and segmentation). Then, the signal will be extracted by the method of Discrete Wavelet Transform and Fast Fourier Transform. The output of this system is the signal characteristics of the frequency and amplitude of the EEG signal of each sleep data segment. The amplitude results will be used as input in analyzing using the t test method paired samples. It is obtained that lavender aromatherapy with alpha and theta waves frequency of 0.023 and 0.021, respectively provide the smaller of significance level about 0,05.

We recently discovered that the large vertex brain potentials elicited by sudden supramodal stimuli are strongly coupled with a multiphasic modulation of isometric force, a phenomenon that we named cortico-muscular resonance (CMR). Here, we extend our investigation of the CMR to the time-frequency domain. We show that (i) both somatosensory and auditory stimuli evoke a number of phase-locked and non-phase-locked modulations of EEG spectral power. Remarkably, (ii) some of these phase-locked and non-phase-locked modulations are also present in the Force spectral power. Finally, (iii) EEG and Force time-frequency responses are correlated in two distinct regions of the power spectrum. An early, low-frequency region (similar to 4 Hz) reflects the previously-described coupling between the phase-locked EEG vertex potential and force modulations. A late, higher-frequency region (beta-band, similar to 20 Hz) reflects a second coupling between the non-phase-locked increase of power observed in both EEG and Force. In both time-frequency regions, coupling was maximal over the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the hand exerting the force, suggesting an effect of the stimuli on the tonic corticospinal drive. Thus, stimulus-induced CMR occurs across at least two different types of cortical activities, whose functional significance in relation to the motor system should be investigated further. We propose that these different types of corticomuscular coupling are important to alter motor behaviour in response to salient environmental events.

Discriminability maps were used both to generalize the signal behavior of all the volunteers and to select time intervals of high discrimination among classes. The features extracted from chosen intervals were tested in eight different classification algorithms. To improve classes discrimination, LDA was used for dimensional reduction. Algorithms were tested using a fivefold cross-validation. The results showed similar signal activity for both real and imaginary actions, obtaining closer classification responses among all volunteers. The tested algorithm gave a mean classification success up to 70%, with minor differences between the type of task and the cognitive state.	[Veslin, E. Y.; Dutra, M.

However, these measurements are temporally limited and affected by clinical variables. The RNS System (NeuroPace, Inc.) is a chronic, closed-loop electrographic seizure detection and stimulation system. When adapted by investigators for research, it facilitates cognitive testing in a controlled ambulatory setting, with measurements collected over months to years. We utilized an associative learning paradigm in 5 patients with traditional iEEG and 3 patients with chronic iEEG, and found increased hippocampal gamma (60-100 Hz) sustained at 1.3-1.5 seconds during encoding in successful versus failed trials in surgical patients, with similar results in our RNS System patients (1.4-1.6 seconds). Our findings replicate other studies demonstrating that sustained hippocampal gamma supports encoding. Importantly, we have validated the RNS System to make sensitive measurements of hippocampal dynamics during cognitive tasks in a chronic ambulatory research setting.

Neural Pattern Similarity Differentially Relates to Memory Performance in Younger and Older Adults	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; EEG; episodic memory; representational similarity	AGE-DIFFERENCES; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; FALSE RECOGNITION; LIFE-SPAN; OSCILLATIONS; REPRESENTATIONS; NEUROMODULATION; SPECIALIZATION; SPECIFICITY; HIPPOCAMPAL	Age-related memory decline is associated with changes in neural functioning, but little is known about how aging affects the quality of information representation in the brain. Whereas a long-standing hypothesis of the aging literature links cognitive impairments to less distinct neural representations in old age ("neural dedifferentiation"), memory studies have shown that overlapping neural representations of different studied items are beneficial for memory performance. In an electroencephalography (EEG) study, we addressed the question whether distinctiveness or similarity between patterns of neural activity supports memory differentially in younger and older adults. We analyzed between-item neural pattern similarity in 50 younger (19 -27 years old) and 63 older (63-75 years old) male and female human adults who repeatedly studied and recalled scene-word associations using a mnemonic imagery strategy. We compared the similarity of spatiotemporal EEG frequency patterns during initial encoding in relation to subsequent recall performance. The within-person association between memory success and pattern similarity differed between age groups: For older adults, better memory performance was linked to higher similarity early in the encoding trials, whereas young adults benefited from lower similarity between earlier and later periods during encoding, which might reflect their better success in forming unique memorable mental images of the joint picture-word pairs. Our results advance the understanding of the representational properties that give rise to subsequent memory, as well as how these properties may change in the course of aging.

PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; PROPAGATING WAVES; PERCEPTUAL ECHOES; SINGLE-TRIAL; AREAS V1; PHASE; FEEDFORWARD; MONKEY; GAMMA	Predictive coding is a key mechanism to understand the computational processes underlying brain functioning: in a hierarchical network, higher levels predict the activity of lower levels, and the unexplained residuals (i.e., prediction errors) are passed back to higher layers. Because of its recursive nature, we wondered whether predictive coding could be related to brain oscillatory dynamics. First, we show that a simple 2-level predictive coding model of visual cortex, with physiological communication delays between levels, naturally gives rise to alpha-band rhythms, similar to experimental observations. Then, we demonstrate that a multilevel version of the same model can explain the occurrence of oscillatory traveling waves across levels, both forward (during visual stimulation) and backward (during rest). Remarkably, the predictions of our model are matched by the analysis of 2 independent electroencephalography (EEG) datasets, in which we observed oscillatory traveling waves in both directions.

C	Stelian, SN			IEEE	Stelian, Stanciu Nicolae			Features of the Electrical Cortical Signal in Steady State and in White Flash Stimulation	2019 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ADVANCED TOPICS IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (ATEE)	International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)	MAR 28-30, 2019	Bucharest, ROMANIA			visual evoked potential (VEP); EEG analysis; white flash stimulation; biomedical signal processing		The features of the electrical cortical signals are described in terms of relative power and variation coefficient extracted from the analysis of both steady state and white flash visual stimulation. Different frequency ranges of brain activity, common for visual processing, are considered. An EEG analyzer Zwonitz 2000 and a system of 19 silver electrodes situated on specific scalp areas, with ear reference, were used for the recordings. The stimulation was done by white flashes from a distance of approximately 30 cm in front of the eyes, in 30 normal subjects. Amplitudes and frequency of the signals from monopolar recording were estimated. The method Quellen Ableitung (QA) or source derivation was applied. This method mostly eliminates the surface currents and helps recording only the vertical electric currents, which appear from the nerve cells discharges on the normal direction on the scalp surface. Using the average values obtained, we have mapped the values in different domains of frequencies on different areas on the scalp both in steady state and flash stimulation. The EEG recorder Bioscript 2000 - Zwonitz with dedicated programs for the QA method helped to perform the numerical signal analysis. Spectral power values relative to each frequency domain at rest (steady state) and at white flash stimulation were obtained for each subject. Collected EEG data were further visualized on a computer monitor for manual artifacts removal. Artifact free 40-second sequences were selected. The data was digitally processed using a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, with windows set for the important frequency bands: Delta-2 (1.95-3.91) Hz, Theta (3.91-7.81) Hz, Alpha (7.81-12.78) Hz and Beta (12.78-25.88) Hz. The values for each recording location were then mapped. We conclude that the brain is optimally processing visual signals with patterns of inhomogeneous distribution of specific features described in this work. Some clinical dysfunctions of the occipital visual areas could be detected from the signal analysis presented here. In the same time, the procedure is adequate for the evaluation when the development of specific pathologies is monitored.

Reactivation of memory traces in the hippocampus occurs during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs; 140-250 Hz). To better understand the mechanisms underlying high-frequency oscillations and cognitive comorbidities in epilepsy, we evaluated how rigorously identified deep CA1 pyramidal cells (dPCs) discharge during SWRs in control and TLE mice. MethodsWe used the unilateral intraamygdala kainate model of TLE in video-electroencephalography (EEG) verified chronically epileptic adult mice. Local field potential and single-cell recordings were performed using juxtacellular recordings from awake control and TLE mice resting on a spherical treadmill, followed by post hoc identification of the recorded cells. ResultsHippocampal SWRs in TLE mice occurred with increased intraripple frequency compared to control mice. The frequency of SWR events was decreased, whereas the overall frequency of SWRs, interictal epileptiform discharges, and high-frequency ripples (250-500 Hz) together was not altered. CA1 dPCs in TLE mice showed significantly increased firing during ripples as well as between the ripple events. The strength of ripple modulation of dPC discharges increased in TLE without alteration of the preferred phase of firing during the ripple waves. SignificanceThese juxtacellular electrophysiology data obtained from identified CA1 dPCs from chronically epileptic mice are in general agreement with recent findings indicating distortion of normal firing patterns during offline SWRs as a mechanism underlying deficits in memory consolidation in epilepsy. Because the primary seizure focus in our experiments was in the amygdala and we recorded from the CA1 region, these results are also in agreement with the presence of altered high-frequency oscillations in areas of secondary seizure spread.

The DMN consists of several areas in the brain where activity simultaneously increases during the resting state and is suppressed during cognitive tasks (i.e., DMN suppression). Although the DMN has been evaluated in patients with MDD, it has not been studied in people with self-measured depressive symptoms without medication. Although most studies have used high-demand cognitive tasks, the relationships between MDD and passive sensory tasks remain unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalograph (EEG) data under two sessions: a resting session and an auditory session. Moreover, we assessed depressive states with a Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) score. To reveal the DMN suppression mechanism in the depressive states, we used EEG time-frequency analysis. As a result, the alpha-band phase synchronization in the DMN increased during the resting session and decreased during the auditory session. The results suggest that participants in a depressive state have both an abnormal DMN connectivity and a suppressed DMN connectivity via a passive stimulus. Moreover, we were able to estimate the DMN suppression mechanism during the depressive states: (1) the beta-band phase resetting was found in the auditory and parietal areas via the auditory stimulus; (2) the beta-band transfer entropy from the auditory area to the parietal area was high as information flow among these area; and (3) the beta-band systems (information flow) were synchronized with the alpha-band DMN systems. Although the sample size was small, these results suggest that the DMN systems may already be altered during self-measured depressive symptoms like the early stages of the depressive states.

Predicting the fate of basketball throws: an EEG study on expert action prediction in wheelchair basketball players	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Expertise; Action prediction; Action observation	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; ACTION ANTICIPATION; FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION; MOTOR EXPERTISE; ERRORS; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; COMPONENTS	The ability to anticipate and detect changes in human movement helps people to modify their behaviors in ever changing environments. Studies indicate that expertise modulates observation of domain-specific actions in sports-a process that is crucial for adapting rapidly to a new situation, often before awareness of environmental changes is achieved. Here, we explored the electrophysiological underpinnings of wheelchair basketball players predicting the fate of free throws performed by wheelchair basketball athletes. We performed electroencephalography (EEG) in semi-professional wheelchair players with different degrees of expertise (players) and in ambulant, non-expert people (controls) while they observed movie stimuli of a free throw that could land inside or outside the basket. On each trial, participants were asked to predict the outcome of the throw. For each group, event-related potentials (ERPs) were averaged as a function of condition, using only the trials that were correctly predicted. Results show that compared to controls, expert players exhibit a greater negative amplitude of oCNV over Pz (an observational contingent negative variation-like waveform which is considered a marker of action effect prediction) during the wrist movement preceding the ball release (the last 100 ms of the shot), which carries the most crucial kinematic information regarding the fate of the throw. Our data provide further support to the view that functional modulation of the action observation network is associated with expertise.	[Ozkan, D. G.; Aglioti, S.

Search asymmetry in a serial auditory task: Neural source analyses of EEG implicate attention strategies	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Auditory search asymmetry; P3a; P3b; Ventral attention network; Dorsal attention network; Functional connectivity	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-SEARCH; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENTS; DYNAMICS; P300; GENERATORS	Here we report a detailed analysis of the fast network dynamics underlying P3a and P3b event-related potential (ERP) subcomponents generated during an unconventional serial auditory search paradigm. We dissect the electroencephalographic (EEG) data from an earlier study of ours, using a variety of advanced signal processing techniques, in order to discover how the brain is processing auditory targets differently when they possess a rare, salient, unpredictable feature not shared with distractors than when targets lack this feature but distractors have it. We find that brain regions associated with the Ventral Attention Network (VAN) are the primary neural generators of the P3a subcomponent in response to feature-present targets, whereas regions associated with the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), as well as regions associated with detecting auditory oddball stimuli (ODD), may be the primary neural generators of the P3b, in the context of our study, and perhaps in search paradigms in general. Moreover, measurements of the time courses of oscillatory power changes and inter-regional synchronization in theta and low-gamma frequency bands were consistent with the early activation and synchronization within the VAN associated with the P3a subcomponent, and with the later activation and synchronization within the DAN and ODD networks associated with the P3b subcomponent. Implications of these finding for the mechanisms underlying search asymmetry phenomena are discussed.

J	Muthukrishnan, SP; Soni, S; Sharma, R				Muthukrishnan, Suriya Prakash; Soni, Sunaina; Sharma, Ratna			Brain Networks Communicate Through Theta Oscillations to Encode High Load in a Visuospatial Working Memory Task: An EEG Connectivity Study	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Visuospatial working memory; Encoding; Memory load; Electroencephalography; Lagged coherence; Functional brain connectivity	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; BLOOD-FLOW CHANGES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL SYSTEMS; VISUAL TASKS; PARIETAL	The encoding of visuospatial information is the foremost and indispensable step which determines the outcome in a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) task. It is considered to play a crucial role in limiting our ability to attend and process only 3-5 integrated items of information. Despite its importance in determining VSWM performance, the neural mechanisms underlying VSWM encoding have not been clearly differentiated from those involved during VSWM retention, manipulation and/or retrieval. The high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) and improved spatial resolution with dense array data acquisition makes it an ideal tool to study the dynamics in the functional brain connectivity during a cognitive task. In the present study, the changes in the functional brain connectivity due to memory load during VSWM encoding were studied using 128-channel EEG. Lagged linear coherence (LagR) was computed between 84 regions of interest (ROIs) defined according to the Brodmann areas for seven EEG frequency bands: delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz). Interestingly, out of seven EEG frequency bands investigated in the current study, LagR of only theta band varied significantly in 13 brain connections due to memory load during VSWM encoding. LagR of theta band increased significantly at high memory load when compared to low memory load in twelve brain connections with the maximum change observed between right cuneus and right middle temporal gyrus (Cohen's d = 0.836), indicating the integration of brain processes to confront the increase in memory demands. Theta LagR decreased significantly between left postcentral gyrus and right precentral gyrus at high memory load as compared to low memory load, which might have a role for sustaining attention during encoding. Change in the LagR values due to memory load between fusiform gyrus and lingual gyrus in the right hemisphere had a positive correlation (r = 0.464, p = 0.003) with the error rate, signifying the crucial role played by these two regions in predicting the performance. The current study has not only identified the neural connections that are responsible for the formation of working memory traces during VSWM encoding, but also support the notion that encoding is a rate-limiting process underlying our memory capacity limit.

Whether this mechanism is compromised during the acute phase after ischemic stroke remains unknown. In this study, we applied a phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (PAC) algorithm to investigate multimodal neuro signals including CBF velocity (CBFV), and electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to the Neurointensive Care Unit, Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (Beijing, China) with continuous monitoring of 8-lead EEG (F3-C3, T3-P3, P3-O1, F4-C4, T4-P4, P4-O2), non-invasive arterial blood pressure (ABP), and bilateral CBFV of the middle cerebral arteries or posterior cerebral arteries were retrospectively analyzed. PAC was calculated between the phase of CBFV in frequency bands (0-0.05 and 0.05-0.15Hz) and the EEG amplitude in five bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma). The global PAC was calculated as the sum of all PACs across the six EEG channels and five EEG bands for each patient. The hemispherical asymmetry of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) was calculated as the difference between left and right PAC. Results: Sixteen patients (3 males) met our inclusion criteria. Their age was 60.9 +/- 7.9 years old. The mean ABP, mean left CBFV, and mean right CBFV were 90.2 +/- 31.2 mmHg, 57.3 +/- 20.6 cm/s, and 68.4 +/- 20.9 cm/s, respectively. The PAC between CBFV and EEG was significantly higher in b and g bands than in the other three bands. Occipital region (P3-O1 and P4-O2 channels) showed stronger PAC than the other regions. The deceased group tended to have smaller global PAC than the survival group (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] was 0.81, p = 0.57). The unfavorable outcome group showed smaller global PAC than the favorable group (AUROC = 0.65, p = 0.23). The PAC asymmetry between the two brain hemispheres correlates with the degree of stenosis in stroke patients (p = 0.01). Conclusion: We showed that CBFV interacts with EEG in beta and gamma bands through a phase-amplitude CFC relationship, with the strongest PAC found in the occipital region and that the degree of hemispherical asymmetry of CFC correlates with the degree of stenosis.

In this study, we use intracranial electroencephalography techniques to record neural activity in auditory and olfactory cortices during an auditory-olfactory matching task. Spoken cues evoke phase locking between low frequency oscillations in auditory and olfactory cortices prior to odor arrival. This phase synchrony occurs only when the participant's later response is correct. Furthermore, the phase of low frequency oscillations in both auditory and olfactory cortical areas couples to the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations in olfactory cortex during correct trials. These findings suggest that phase synchrony is a fundamental mechanism for integrating cross-modal odor processing and highlight an important role for primary olfactory cortical areas in multisensory integration with the olfactory system.

Functional significance of this phenomenon remains unclear, partly because the majority of studies used channel-level analysis, which precluded the spatial localization of observed effects. It is not also clear whether CF-AAC may serve as a marker of specific pathological conditions and specific states, or a more general predisposition to affective disturbances. We used source-level analysis of EEG data obtained in resting conditions in a nonclinical sample and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and investigated associations of CF-AAC measures with a broad range of known risk factors for affective disorders, including age, gender, genotype, stress exposure, personality, and self-reported 'neurotic' symptomatology. A consistent pattern of associations showed that all investigated risk factors were associated with an enhancement of CF-AAC in cortical regions associated with emotional and self-referential processing. It could be concluded that CF-AAC is a promising candidate marker of a general predisposition to affective disorders at preclinical stages.

However, despite the key role of the brain in processing inputs from internal organ systems and the external environment to coordinate and optimize behavior, little is known about brain dynamics during exercise. The present study investigates tonic and transient oscillatory brain activity in a group of participants performing an oddball task during a single bout of aerobic exercise. Twenty young males (19-32years) were recruited for two experimental sessions on separate days. EEG activity was recorded during a session of cycling at 80% (moderate-to-high intensity) of VO2max (maximum rate of oxygen consumption) while participants responded to infrequent targets (red square and big blue circle) presented among frequent nontargets (small blue circle). This was compared to a (baseline) light intensity session (30% VO2max) to control any potential effect of dual tasking (i.e., pedaling and performing the oddball task). A cluster-based nonparametric permutations test revealed an increase in power across the entire frequency spectrum during the moderate-to-high intensity exercise compared to light intensity. Furthermore, the more salient target (red square) elicited a lower increase in (stimulus-evoked) theta power in the 80% VO2max than in the light intensity condition. Alpha and lower beta power decreased less in the standard trials (small blue circle) during the moderate-to-high exercise condition than in the light exercise condition. The present study unveils, for the first time, a complex brain activity pattern during vigorous exercise while attending to task-relevant stimuli. Physical exercise induces physiological changes that are well described in the literature. Surprisingly, little is known about changes at brain level. This study examines tonic and stimulus-locked oscillatory brain dynamics of young adults under physical exertion while performing an (sustained attention) oddball task. Moderate-to-high intensity exercise induced an overall power increase across the EEG frequency spectrum, which was accompanied by a lesser power modulation of specific stimulus-locked brain rhythms, relative to a light intensity exercise. These results unveil a complex oscillatory brain activity pattern during vigorous exercise that cannot be explained as a mere general cortical activity increase.

Methods Data on medical history, etiology and semiology of SE, anticonvulsive medication usage, efficacy and safety of in-MDZ were retrospectively reviewed between 2015 and 2018. Time to end of SE regarding the administration of in-MDZ and ss-band effects were analyzed on EEG and with frequency analysis. Results In total, 42 patients (mean age: 52.7 +/- 22.7 years; 23 females) were treated with a median dose of 5 mg of in-MDZ (range: 2.5-15 mg, mean: 6.4 mg, SD: 2.6) for SE. The majority of the patients suffered from nonconvulsive SE (n = 24; 55.8%). In total, 24 (57.1%) patients were responders, as SE stopped following the administration of in-MDZ without any other drugs being given. On average, SE ceased on EEG at 05:05 (minutes:seconds) after the application of in-MDZ (median: 04:56; range: 00:29-14:53; SD:03:13). Frequency analysis showed an increased ss-band on EEG after the application of in-MDZ at 04:07 on average (median: 03:50; range: 02:20-05:40; SD: 01:09). Adverse events were recorded in six patients (14.3%), with nasal irritations present in five (11.9%) and prolonged sedation occurring in one (2.6%) patient. Conclusions This pharmaco-EEG-based study showed that in-MDZ is effective and well-tolerated for the acute treatment of SE. EEG and clinical effects of in-MDZ administration occurred within 04:07 and 5:05 on average. Intranasal midazolam appears to be an easily applicable and rapidly effective alternative to buccal or intramuscular application as first-line treatment if an intravenous route is not available.

Here we recorded EEG from people who either had, or had not experienced an OBE in order to investigate the neural dynamics of OBE in the non-clinical population. A screening questionnaire was completed by 551 people, 24% of whom reported having at least one OBE. Participants who were free of any psychiatric or neurological diagnoses, including migraines, were invited to take part in subsequent EEG recording. EEG data were obtained from 19 people who had had an OBE and 20 who had not. Amplitude of the visual P1 ERP deflection and consistency of alpha-band phase locking were significantly reduced in the participants who had had an OBE. We did not find any group differences in resting state power or in visually induced gamma oscillations. These results provide support for the claim that cortical differences, particularly with respect to the timing of visual information processing, may give rise to OBE in clinically healthy individuals. To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare EEG variables obtained from people who have, and have not, had an OBE. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods Seventy-three subjects (11 years, range 5-18) were included and randomly assigned to two groups according to the anesthetic agent. Anesthesia was performed by target-controlled infusion of propofol (group P) or by sevoflurane inhalation (group S). Steady-state periods were performed at a fixed randomized concentration between 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 mu g.ml(-1) of propofol in group P and between 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% of sevoflurane in group S. Remifentanil was continuously administered throughout the study. Clinical data, Bispectral Index (BIS), and raw EEG were continuously recorded. The relationship between BIS and anesthetic concentrations was studied using nonlinear regression. For all steady-state periods, EEG traces were reviewed to assess the presence of epileptoid signs, and spectral analysis of raw EEG was performed. Results Under propofol, BIS decreased monotonically and EEG slowed down as concentrations increased from 2 to 6 mu g.ml(-1). Under sevoflurane, BIS decreased from 0% to 4% and paradoxically rose from 4% to 5% of expired concentration: this increase in BIS was associated with the occurrence of fast oscillations and epileptoid signs on the EEG trace. Propofol was associated with more delta waves and burst suppression periods compared to sevoflurane. Conclusion Under deep anesthesia, the BIS and electroencephalographic profiles differ between propofol and sevoflurane. For high concentrations of sevoflurane, an elevated BIS value may be interpreted as a sign of epileptoid patterns or EEG fast oscillations rather than an insufficient depth of hypnosis.

Early patterns of functional brain development associated with autism spectrum disorder in tuberous sclerosis complex	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						tuberous sclerosis complex; autism spectrum disorder; functional connectivity; infancy; electroencephalography; cognitive function; alpha oscillations	DIAGNOSTIC OBSERVATION SCHEDULE; ALPHA PEAK FREQUENCY; WHITE-MATTER; YOUNG-CHILDREN; INTERHEMISPHERIC CONNECTIVITY; MOUSE MODEL; BAND POWER; EEG; EPILEPSY; INFANTS	Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder that confers a high risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with behavioral predictors of ASD emerging early in life. Deviations in structural and functional neural connectivity are highly implicated in both TSC and ASD. For the first time, we explore whether electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of neural network function precede or predict the emergence of ASD in TSC. We determine whether altered brain function (a) is present in infancy in TSC, (b) differentiates infants with TSC based on ASD diagnostic status, and (c) is associated with later cognitive function. We studied 35 infants with TSC (N = 35), and a group of typically developing infants (N = 20) at 12 and 24 months of age. Infants with TSC were later subdivided into ASD and non-ASD groups based on clinical evaluation. We measured features of spontaneous alpha oscillations (6-12 Hz) that are closely associated with neural network development: alpha power, alpha phase coherence (APC), and peak alpha frequency (PAF). Infants with TSC demonstrated reduced interhemispheric APC compared to controls at 12 months of age, and these differences were found to be most pronounced at 24 months in the infants who later developed ASD. Across all infants, PAF at 24 months was associated with verbal and nonverbal cognition at 36 months. Associations between early network function and later neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes highlight the potential utility of early scalable EEG markers to identify infants with TSC requiring additional targeted intervention initiated very early in life. Autism Res 2019, 00: 1-16. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary Approximately half of infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) develop autism. Here, using EEG, we find that there is a reduction in communication between brain regions during infancy in TSC, and that the infants who show the largest reductions are those who later develop autism. Being able to identify infants who show early signs of disrupted brain development may improve the timing of early prediction and interventions in TSC, and also help us to understand how early brain changes lead to autism.

Methods To this end, we analyzed 820 seizures from 252 consecutive patients explored by stereo-electroencephalography (total of 2148 electrodes), including various forms of focal refractory epilepsies. We used a reproducible method combining visual and time-frequency analyses. Results We described eight SOPs: low-voltage fast activity (LVFA), preictal spiking followed by LVFA, burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA, slow wave/DC shift followed by LVFA, sharp theta/alpha waves, beta sharp waves, rhythmic spikes/spike-waves, and delta-brush. LVFA occurred in 79% of patients. The seizure onset pattern was significantly associated with (1) underlying etiology (burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA with the presence of a focal cortical dysplasia, LVFA with malformation of cortical development, postvascular and undetermined epilepsies), (2) spatial organization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ; burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA with focal organization, slow wave/DC shift followed by LVFA with network organization), and (3) postsurgical seizure outcome (better outcome when LVFA present). Significance This study demonstrates that the main determinants of the SOP are the underlying etiology and the spatial organization of the EZ. Concerning the postsurgical seizure outcome, the main determinant factor is the spatial organization of the EZ, but the SOP plays also a role, conferring better prognosis when LVFA is present.

A total of 49 EEG recordings were performed (in seven PMV conditions for seven subjects), each lasting for 65 min. EEGs were recorded through the scalp and sorted by frequency using power spectral analysis. The best PMV condition for attention ability changed over time, from slightly cooler temperatures to higher temperatures. However, extreme PMV conditions led to poor attention ability during the experiment. The highest attention level was at PMV + 1, according to our EEG analysis, but was reported as both PMV 0 and + 1 by the subjects. The lowest attention level was in higher temperature conditions (PMV +2, +3), according to subjects' own evaluations, while the lowest brain activity was measured in lower temperature conditions (PMV -2, -3).

Rhythmic fluctuations have been found in the posterior and anterior hypothalamus, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the mammillary body and the medial amygdaloid nucleus of cats and rats. Similar fluctuations appear in the nitric oxide signal registered in the nucleus accumbens, as well as in the power of delta and theta waves of the EEG in the posterior hypothalamus. The EEG rhythmic fluctuations are generated in the arcuate nucleus because they disappear after its electrocoagulation. The frequency of the EEG fluctuations is increased, decreased or even abolished when catecholamine or histamine receptor agonists and antagonists are centrally applied showing that the EEG ultradian rhythm is controlled by catecholaminergic and histaminergic neurons.

Segmenting these signals, extracting features to obtain the important properties of the signal and classification are key aspects of detecting epileptic seizures. Despite the introduction of several techniques, it is very challenging when multiple EEG channels are involved. When many channels exist, a spatial filter is required to eliminate noise and extract relevant information. This adds a new dimension of complexity to the frequency feature space. In order to stabilize the classifier of the channels, feature selection is very important. Furthermore, and to improve the performance of a classifier, more data is required from EEG channels for complex problems. The increase of such data poses some challenges as it becomes difficult to identify the subject dependent bands when the channels increase. Hence, an automated process is required for such identification. The proposed approach in this work tends to tackle the multiple EEG channels problem by segmenting the EEG signals in the frequency domain based on changing spikes rather than the traditional time based windowing approach. While to reduce the overall dimensionality and preserve the class-dependent features an optimization approach is used. This process of selecting an optimal feature subset is an optimization problem. Thus, we propose an adaptive multi-parent crossover Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing the features used in classifying epileptic seizures. The GA-based approach is used to optimize the various features obtained. It encodes the temporal and spatial filter estimates and optimize the feature selection with respect to the classification error. The classification was done using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed technique was evaluated using the publicly available epileptic seizure data from the machine learning repository of the UCI center for machine learning and intelligent systems. The proposed approach outperforms other ones and achieved a high level of accuracy. These results, indicate the ability of a multi-parent crossover GA in optimizing the feature selection process in EEG classification. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Subjects walked on a treadmill, while EEG over the leg motorcortex area and EMG from the medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was recorded. Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence were calculated from pair-wise recordings. Significant EEG-EMG and EMG-EMG coherence in the beta and gamma frequency bands was found throughout the stance phase with the largest coherence towards push-off. Analysis of directionality revealed that EEG activity preceded EMG activity throughout the stance phase until the time of push-off. These findings suggest that the motor cortex contributes to ankle plantar flexor muscle activity and forward propulsion during gait.

To date, less is known on the effects of gross motor movements that do not fall into the category of sports-related aerobic or anaerobic exercise. In previous studies, we found beneficial effects of dynamic working environments, i.e., environments that encourage movements during cognitive task performance, on cognitive performance and corresponding brain activity. Aim of the present study was to examine the effects of working in a dynamic and a static office environment on attentional and vigilance performance, and on the corresponding electroencephalographic (EEG) brain oscillatory patterns. In a 2-week intervention study, participants worked either in a dynamic or a static office. In each intervention group, 12 subjects performed attentional and vigilance tasks. Spontaneous EEG was measured from 19 electrodes continuosly before, during, and immediately after each experimental condition at the first, and at the last intervention session. Results showed differences in EEG brain activity in the dynamic compared to the static office at the beginning as well as at the end of the intervention. EEG theta power increased in the vigilance task in anterior regions, alpha power in central and parietal regions in the dynamic compared to the static office. Further, increases in beta activity in the attention and vigilance task were shown in frontal and central regions in the dynamic office. Gamma power increased in the attention task in frontal and central regions. After 2 weeks, effects on brain activity increased in the attentional and vigilance task in the dynamic office. Increased theta and alpha oscillations were obtained in anterior areas with higher activity in the beta band in anterior and central areas in the dynamic compared to the static office. EEG oscillatory patterns indicate beneficial effects of dynamic office environments on attentional and vigilance performance that are mediated by increased motor activity. We discuss the obtained patterns of EEG oscillations in terms of the close interrelations between the attentional and the motor system.

The research on the special multisensory integration has a very important role in the study of human perception, learning and memory. In this study, EEG data of subjects from single sensory area and multi-sensory joint areas will be obtained by cross-sensory stimulation experiments. After the analysis from the time, frequency and spatial domains, the features of cross-sensory information enhancement are extracted. The brain areas where information exchanges exist will be determined. By designing the experiments (single-sensory sustained attention task, sSAT and multi-sensory sustained attention task, mSAT), we obtain induced brain waves, and analyze human EEG information from which we extract ERP (Event Related Potential) component and conduct discriminatory analysis. Then we study the reaction mechanism of the brain. Using behavioral analysis, ERP time domain analysis and time-frequency analysis technology, we compare the results of two kinds of experiments (sSAT and mSAT) to explore the physiological mechanism of sustained attention. On this basis of analyzing subjects' individual differernces, an effective neurofeedback training method will be established to activate the various functional areas of the brain, which provides a theoretical basis for development of instruments to enhance perception and improve the living conditions of the populations whose sensory perception is decreased. This study has enormous social value.

The pathophysiological mechanisms by which ECTS induces neuropsychological impairment in 15-30% of affected children remain unclear. The objective of this study is to review the current state of knowledge concerning the brain structural and functional changes that may be involved in cognitive dysfunctions in ECTS. Structural brain imaging suggests the presence of subtle neurodevelopmental changes over the epileptogenic zone and over distant regions in ECTS. This structural remodeling likely occurs prior to the diagnosis and evolves over time, especially in patients with cognitive impairment, suggesting that the epileptogenic processes might interfere with the dynamics of the brain development and/or the normal maturation processes. Functional brain imaging demonstrates profound disorganization accentuated by interictal epileptic spikes (IES) in the epileptogenic zone and in remote networks in ECTS. Over the epileptogenic zone, the literature demonstrates changes in term of neuronal activity and synchronization, which are effective several hundred milliseconds before the IES. In the same time window, functional changes are also observed in bilateral distant networks, notably in the frontal and temporal lobes. Effective connectivity demonstrates that the epileptogenic zone constitutes the key area at the origin of IES propagation toward distant cortical regions, including frontal areas. Altogether, structural and functional network disorganizations, in terms of: (i) power spectral values, (ii) functional and effective connectivity, are likely to participate in the cognitive impairment commonly reported in children with ECTS. These results suggest a central and causal role of network disorganizations related to IES in the neuropsychological impairment described in ECTS children.

Both types of conflict conjointly modulate behavioral performance, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms have remained unclear. While cognitive control is linked to oscillations in the theta frequency band, there are several mechanisms via which theta oscillations may enable cognitive control: via the coordination and synchronization of a large and complex neuronal network and/or via local processes within the medial frontal cortex. We, therefore, investigated this issue with a focus on theta oscillations and the underlying neuronal networks. For this purpose, n=40 healthy young participants performed a conflict paradigm that combines conscious and subliminal distractors while an EEG was recorded. The data show that separate processes modulate the theta-based activation and organization of cognitive control networks: EEG beamforming analyses showed that variations in theta band power generated in the supplementary motor area reflected the need for control and task-relevant goal shielding, as both conflicts as well as their conjoint effect on behavior increased theta power. Yet, large networks were not modulated by this and graph theoretical analyses of the efficiency (i.e. small worldness) of theta-driven networks did not reflect the need for control. Instead, theta network efficiency was decreased by subliminal conflicts only. This dissociation suggests that while both kinds of conflict require control and goal shielding, which are induced by an increase in theta band power and modulate processes in the medial frontal cortex, only non-conscious conflicts diminish the efficiency of theta-driven large-scale networks.

However, a detailed analysis of the ISO of individually identified sleep spindles is not available. New method: We investigated basic properties of ISO during baseline sleep of 34 healthy young human participants using new and established methods. The analyses focused on fast sleep spindle and sigma activity (13-15 Hz) in NREM stage 2 and slow wave sleep (SWS). To describe ISO in sigma activity we analyzed power of power of the EEG signal. For the study of ISO in sleep spindle activity we applied a new method in which the EEG signal was reduced to a spindle on/off binary square signal. Its spectral properties were contrasted to that of a square signal wherein the same spindles and also the inter spindle intervals were permutated randomly. This approach was validated using surrogate data with imposed ISO modulation. Results: We confirm the existence of ISO in sigma activity albeit with a frequency below the previously reported 0.02 Hz. These ISO are most prominent in the high sigma band and over the centro-parieto-occipital regions. A similar modulation is present in spindle activity. ISO in sleep spindles are most prominent in the centro-parieto-occipital regions, left hemisphere and second half of the night independent of the number of spindles. Conclusions: The comparison of spectral properties of binary event signals and permutated event signals is effective in detecting slow oscillatory phenomena.

The projected audio features reflect individual music preference adaptively since they are calculated by considering correlations with the user's EEG signals during listening to musical pieces that the user likes/dislikes via a novel CCA proposed in this paper. The novel CCA, called KDLPCCA, can consider not only a non-linear correlation but also local properties and discriminative information of each class sample, namely, music likes/dislikes. Specifically, local properties reflect intrinsic data structures of the original audio features, and discriminative information enhances the power of the final classification. Hence, the projected audio features have an optimal correlation with individual music preference reflected in the user's EEG signals, adaptively. If the KDLPCCA-based projection that can transform original audio features into novel audio features is calculated once, our method can extract projected audio features from a new musical piece without newly observing individual EEG signals. Our method therefore has a high level of practicability. Consequently, effective classification of user's favorite musical pieces via a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the new projected audio features becomes feasible. Experimental results show that our method for favorite music classification using projected audio features via the novel CCA outperforms methods using original audio features, EEG features and even audio features projected by other state-of-the-art CCAs.

Whereas these mismatches between reward expectation and reward outcome are known to drive procedural learning, their role in declarative learning remains underexplored. Earlier work from our lab addressed this, and consistently found that signed reward prediction errors (SRPEs; " better-than-expected" signals) boost declarative learning. In the current EEG study, we sought to explore the neural signatures of SRPEs. Participants studied 60 Dutch-Swahili word pairs while RPE magnitudes were parametrically manipulated. Behaviorally, we replicated our previous findings that SRPEs drive declarative learning, with increased recognition for word pairs accompanied by large, positive RPEs. In the EEG data, at the start of reward feedback processing, we found an oscillatory (theta) signature consistent with unsigned reward prediction errors (URPEs; "different-than-expected" signals). Slightly later during reward feedback processing, we observed oscillatory (high-beta and high-alpha) signatures for SRPEs during reward feedback, similar to SRPE signatures during procedural learning. These findings illuminate the time course of neural oscillations in processing reward during declarative learning, providing important constraints for future theoretical work.

The neurotherapeutic potential of transcranial PBM has been recently investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. According to the PBM mechanisms of action on increasing the cerebral blood flow and the neuronal firing, a change may occur in cortical electrical activity after transcranial PBM that could be revealed in qEEG. A total of 30 participants (15 males and 15 females) were included in this experimental study in a convenience sampling method. A 19-channel EEG was obtained from subjects, before and after receiving sham or real 850-nm PBM by light emitting diode (LED) array on the right prefrontal cortex (PFC). An attentional task also was completed by the participant before and after the irradiation. Results presented that the effect of PBM on the reaction time was significant (p=0.001) in favor of the real-treatment group (p<0.05). For the absolute power, repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction of group x time x frequency (p=0.04). In the real-treatment group, absolute power of delta band was significantly reduced in all electrodes (p<0.05). Also, a similar significant interaction of group x time x frequency was seen for relative power (p=0.04). Post-hoc analysis showed a significant decrease in delta band after PBM in the real treatment group (p<0.05). The study presented that light irradiation with 850-nm LED source on right PFC could change brain electrical activity and has beneficial effects on attentional performance.

Electrophysiology-based research in the field has consistently developed over the last fifty years. Objective: To summarize the current knowledge on the electrophysiological characteristics of the migraine brain, and discuss perspectives. Methods: We critically reviewed the literature on the topic to present and discuss articles selected on the basis of their significance and/or novelty. Results: Physiologic fluctuations within time, between-subject differences, and methodological issues account as major limitations of electrophysiological research in migraine. Nonetheless, several abnormalities revealed through different approaches have been described in the literature. Altogether, these results are compatible with an abnormal state of sensory processing. Perspectives: The greatest contribution of electrophysiological testing in the future will most probably be the characterization of sub-groups of migraine patients sharing specific electrophysiological traits. This should serve as strategy towards personalized migraine treatment. Incorporation of novel methods of analysis would be worthwhile.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) population have been extensively studied using the time-domain representation of signals but time-frequency domain techniques are less explored. Although, adult ADHD is a proven disorder, most of the electrophysiological studies have focused only on children with ADHD. Methods. ERP data of 35 university students with ADHD and 35 control adults were recorded during visual continuous performance task (CPT). Gray level co-occurrence matrix-based texture features were extracted from time-frequency (t-f) images of event-related EEG epochs. Different ERP components measures, that is, amplitudes and latencies corresponding to N1, N2, and P3 components were also computed relative to standard and target stimuli. Results. Texture analysis has shown that the mean value of contrast, dissimilarity, and difference entropy is significantly reduced in adults with ADHD than in control adults. The mean correlation and homogeneity in adults with ADHD were significantly increased as compared with control adults. ERP components analysis has reported that adults with ADHD have reduced N1 amplitude to target stimuli, reduced N2 and P3 amplitude to both standard and target stimuli than controls. Conclusions. The differences in texture features obtained from t-f images of ERPs point toward altered information processing in adults with ADHD during a cognitive task. Findings of reduction in N1, N2, and P3 components highlight deficits of early sensory processing, stimulus categorization, and attentional resources, respectively, in adults with ADHD.

A New Design of Mental State Classification for Subject Independent BCI Systems	IRBM			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Brain-computer interface (BCI); Motor Imagery (MI); Subject Independent (SI); Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; EEG	Background: Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems have been widely used to develop sustainable assistive technology for people suffering from neurological impairments. A major limitation of current BCI systems is that they are based on Subject-dependent (SD) concept. The SD based BCI system is time consuming and inconvenient for physical or mental disables people and also not suitable for limited computer resources. In order to overcome these problems, recently subject-independent (SI) based BCI concept has been introduced to identify mental states of motor disabled people but the expected outcome of the SI based BCI has not been achieved yet. Hence this paper intends to present an efficient scheme for SI based BCI system. The goal of this research is to develop a method for classifying mental states which can be used by any user. For attaining this target, this study employs a supervised spatial filtering method with four types of feature extraction methods including Katz Fractal Dimension, Sub band Energy, Log Variance and Root Mean Square (RMS) and finally the obtained features are used as input to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification model for identifying mental states for SI BCI system. Results: The performance of the proposed design is evaluated in several ways such as considering different time window length; different frequency bands; different number of channels. The mean classification accuracy using Katz feature is 84.35% which is the maximum output compare to other features that outperforms the existing methods. Conclusions: Our proposed design will help to make a new technology for development of real-time SI based BCI systems that can be more supportive for the motor disabled patients. (C) 2019 AGBM.

Blue light effect on EEG activity - The role of exposure timing and chronotype	LIGHTING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SLEEP; ALERTNESS; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MODULATION; VIGILANCE; DURATION; DEPENDS; INDEX; MOOD	There is growing evidence for monochromatic blue light effects. However, the role of individual differences in it has not yet been explored. The aim of this experiment was to examine whether chronotype could moderate the monochromatic blue light effect on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity with regard to the timing of exposure. The participants were 30 young male volunteers. A within-subjects counterbalanced design was applied. There were two light conditions comparable in luminance: Monochromatic blue light of 460 nm and polychromatic white light of 6.5 lux. EEG measurements were taken after 4 hours of exposure in the morning, afternoon, and evening. EEG spectral power was categorized into five frequency ranges: delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, and beta. Chronotypes were assessed by the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. A mixed analysis of variance was applied. Significant interactions between chronotype, light conditions, and the time of the day were found in theta and alpha1 bands after exposure to monochromatic blue light. These preliminary results indicated that in morning-oriented types the spectral power of theta and alpha1 EEG bands was higher in monochromatic blue light when compared to polychromatic white light in the afternoon hours than in the morning or the evening hours. These results may indicate a decrease in alertness in monochromatic blue light in the afternoon hours in morning-oriented types. This could point to the moderating role of individual differences in the monochromatic blue light effect.

While the evidence supporting their significance derives mainly from invasive recordings, recent studies have extended these observations to HFO recorded in the widely accessible scalp EEG. Here, we investigated whether scalp HFO in drug-resistant focal epilepsy correspond to epilepsy severity and how they are affected by surgical therapy. In eleven children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy that underwent epilepsy surgery, we prospectively recorded pre- and postsurgical scalp EEG with a custom-made low-noise amplifier (LNA). In four of these children, we also recorded intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG). To detect clinically relevant HFO, we applied a previously validated automated detector. Scalp HFO rates showed a significant positive correlation with seizure frequency (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001). Overall, scalp HFO rates were higher in patients with active epilepsy (19 recordings, p= 0.0066, PPV = 86%, NPV= 80%, accuracy = 84% CI [62%94%]) and decreased following successful epilepsy surgery. The location of the highest HFO rates in scalp EEG matched the location of the highest HFO rates in ECoG. This study is the first step towards using non-invasively recorded scalp HFO to monitor disease severity in patients affected by epilepsy.

Maths anxiety research has also noted the involvement of these aspects, yet this has not been investigated from a neurophysiological standpoint. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to research gamma-band activity in relation to maths anxiety over two studies. The first measured gamma differences during the processing of complex addition and multiplication stimuli. Results identified differences between high and low maths anxious individuals; significantly greater gamma power was observed in those with high maths anxiety than those with low maths anxiety. As a control condition was not used, the second study replicated the design, but also applied a non-numerical control condition amongst the other stimuli sets. This showed significantly greater gamma activity in high maths anxious individuals across numerical conditions, but not in the non-numerical condition. High maths anxious individuals likely show attentional bias and threat perception to numerical-based stimuli, as indexed by gamma power. This study provides the first evidence of greater gamma-band activity in high maths anxious individuals and serves as a foundation for the exploration of gamma activity in high maths anxious individuals.

Previous studies reported alterations of SEPs in patients with schizophrenia as well as in individuals in the prodromal stage. Moreover, cannabis use as an environmental risk factor for the development of schizophrenia has been demonstrated to influence SEP parameters in individuals at risk to develop psychosis. The aim of this study was to explore the course of SEP changes and the impact of concomitant cannabis use in individuals at risk to develop psychosis who sought medical help. Methods: Median nerve SEPs including high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) superimposed on the primary cortical response (N20) were investigated using multichannel EEG in individuals (n = 54 at baseline) remaining at risk to develop psychosis at follow-up after 1 year (high-risk: n = 19; ultra-high-risk: n = 27) vs. subjects with conversion to psychosis (n = 8) and a healthy control group (n = 35). Longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of SEP components as estimated by dipole source analysis were performed. Results: The longitudinal development of the N20 strength depended on cannabis use. In cannabis non-users, a greater decrease of N20 strengths over time was associated with more negative symptoms at baseline. At baseline, converters did not differ from subjects remaining at risk. At follow-up, converters showed increased low- and high-frequency activity than at-risk subjects and did not differ from controls. Conclusion: The results of this study lead to the suggestion that the deficits in early somatosensory processing in individuals at risk to develop psychosis may not represent a marker for a genetic risk for psychosis but rather reflect state-dependent factors such as negative symptoms. On the other hand, the transition to psychosis seems to represent an interstage between reduced sensory registration from the at-risk state and gating deficits in the chronic state.

Low-frequency rTMS (stimulation frequency <= 1Hz) induces long-lasting inhibitory effects on cortical excitability. In order to study the effects of 1Hz rTMS of the motor cortex on neuronal activity, 20 healthy subjects were recruited to receive rTMS, and electroencephalography (EEG) in resting condition with eye open were recorded before rTMS, at 0min, 20min, 40min, 60min after rTMS. In multiple frequency bands, power values on each channel were calculated, and functional connectivity between two channels was assessed using phase synchronization. We found an increase in power of theta-band oscillations in the frontal and the central brain areas immediately after rTMS. And alpha resting power in the central-parietal brain area did not change immediately after rTMS, but increased at 20min after rTMS. Moreover, there is a widespread increase in functional connectivity after rTMS in the theta band, whereas widespread decreases in the functional connectivity were found in the alpha band after rTMS. At the same time, there was no significant recovery on power and functional connectivity at 60min after rTMS. These results provide an evidence for a transient reorganization of neuronal activity after 1Hz rTMS over the motor cortex. In addition, low-frequency rTMS produces widespread long-lasting alterations in cortical functional connectivity.

The parameter measured served as an evaluator of the brain spontaneous, self-generated, global de-synchronizing, workload endogenous attractors that displace the EEG oscillatory dynamics toward free energy-consuming processing loops. The distinction of the high beta EEG waves as related with stress and anxiety, together with an approach based primarily on the inter-channel frequency correlation, rather than only the power activation of the frequency beta range, allowed us to supplement with new finding and ways to evaluate the impact of self-generated processing attractors that kept our brain apart from natural tendency to re-synchronize, save and reorganize energy.

Young (n = 15, 22.1 +/- 1.7 years) and older (n = 15, 68.3 +/- 2.7 years) participants performed normal walking and VG walking requiring precise foot placement based on visual cues. Coherence analysis was used to quantify coupling between electroencephalography and electromyography from the anterior tibial muscle (corticomuscular) and between the 2 ends of the anterior tibial muscle (intramuscular) at 15-50 Hz during the swing phase of walking as markers of corticospinal activity. Our results indicated that corticomuscular and intramuscular coherence was lower in older compared to young participants during both tasks. In addition, coherence was generally greater during VG than during normal walking across age groups, although during late swing, older participants drove several of the observed task-related coherence increases. Performance on the VG task was lower in older compared to young participants and was correlated with task-related corticomuscular coherence modulations within the older group. These results suggest age-related differences in the corticospinal control of walking, with possible implications for precision control of foot placement based on visual information.

Sustaining attention for a prolonged period of time increases temporal variability in cortical responses	CORTEX			English	Article						Sustained attention; Vigilance; Time-on-task; Motivation; EEG	MENTAL FATIGUE; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PHASE-LOCKING; FRONTAL THETA; ON-TASK; VIGILANCE; MIND	Our ability to stay focused is limited: prolonged performance of a task typically results in mental fatigue and decrements in performance over time. This so-called vigilance decrement has been attributed to depletion of attentional resources, though other factors such as reductions in motivation likely also play a role. In this study, we examined three electroencephalography (EEG) markers of attentional control, to elucidate which stage of attentional processing is most affected by time-on-task and motivation. To elicit the vigilance decrement, participants performed a sustained attention task for 80 min without breaks. After 60 min, participants were motivated by an unexpected monetary incentive to increase performance in the final 20 min. We found that task performance and self reported motivation declined rapidly, reaching stable levels well before the motivation manipulation was introduced. Thereafter, motivation increased back up to the initial level, and remained there for the final 20 min. While task performance also increased, it did not return to the initial level, and fell to the lowest level overall during the final 10 min. This pattern of performance changes was mirrored by the trial-to-trial consistency of the phase of theta (3-7 Hz) oscillations, an index of the variability in timing of the neural response to the stimulus. As task performance decreased, temporal variability increased, suggesting that attentional stability is crucial for sustained attention performance. The effects of attention on our two other EEG measures early P1/N1 event-related potentials (ERPs) and pre-stimulus alpha (9-14 Hz) power did not change with time-on-task or motivation. In sum, these findings show that the vigilance decrement is accompanied by a decline in only some facets of attentional control, which cannot be fully brought back online by increases in motivation. The vigilance decrement might thus not occur due to a single cause, but is likely multifactorial in origin. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this context, fully understanding how the proprioceptive input modulates the brain activity may provide valuable insights. Specifically, it has not been investigated how the speed of motions, passively guided by a haptic device, affects the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). On the grounds that faster passive motions elicit larger quantity of afferent input, we hypothesize a proportional relationship between localized SMR features and passive movement speed. To address this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment where healthy subjects received passive forearm oscillations at different speed levels while their electroencephalogram was recorded. The mu and beta event related desynchronization (ERD) and beta rebound of both left and right sensorimotor areas are analyzed by linear mixed-effects models. Results indicate that passive movement speed is correlated with the contralateral beta rebound and ipsilateral mu ERD. The former has been previously linked with the processing of proprioceptive afferent input quantity, while the latter with speed-dependent inhibitory processes. This suggests the existence of functionally distinct frequency-specific neuronal populations associated with passive movements. In future, our findings may guide the design of novel rehabilitation paradigms.

In old age, both episodic memory performance and related neural activity decline. These changes occur in parallel to age-related decreases in sleep quality. Thus, poor sleep quality may be an explanatory factor for poor memory in older adulthood. Furthermore, Black adults tend to sleep more poorly than White adults, and this could be explained by differences in health and psychosocial factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, race-related stress). However, there have been no studies investigating the effect of race on sleep quality, episodic memory, and memory-related neural function. In the current pilot study, we recruited a diverse sample of older and younger adults and measured their habitual sleep using a wrist-worn accelerometer for 1 week. We recorded their electroencephalography (EEG) as they performed an episodic memory task to assess the impact of habitual sleep on memory-related neural oscillations. We found that more variable sleep quality was associated with worse memory performance, particularly for older adults. Additionally, Black participants demonstrated greater intraindividual sleep variance than White participants, and greater sleep variance was strongly linked to reduced memory-related neural activity in Black participants. Taken together, maintaining good sleep quality is especially important for memory performance in older adulthood, and greater sleep variation, that is evident in Black adults, may hamper memory-related neural function.

This paper is aimed at investigating whether the expertise acquired during the deep-sea diving is reflected in FC in a group of professional divers (PDs) compared to a group of new divers (NDs), and how it could affect the concentration and stress levels. The sources of brain frequency rhythms, derived by the electroencephalography acquisition in a hyperbaric chamber, were extracted in different frequency bands and the corresponding FC was estimated in order to compare the two groups. The results highlighted a significant decrease of the alpha source in PDs during air breathing and a significant increase of the upper beta source over central areas at the beginning of post-oxygen air, as well as an increase of beta FC between frontotemporal regions in the last minutes of oxygen breathing and in the early minutes of post-oxygen air. This provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that experience and expertise differences would modulate brain networks. These experiments provided the unique opportunity of investigating the impact of the neurophysiological activity in simulated critical scenarios in view of the investigation in real sea-water experiments.

We aim to understand the link between alterations to networks and cognitive impairment using functional connectivity analysis and modelling. Methods: EEG was recorded from 21 AD patients and 26 controls, mapped into source space using eLORETA, and functional connectivity was calculated using phase locking factor. The mini-mental state exam (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive impairment. A computational model was used to uncover mechanisms of altered functional connectivity. Results: Small-worldness (SW) of functional networks decreased in AD and was positively correlated with MMSE score and the language sub-score. Reduced SW was a result of increased path lengths, predominantly localized to the temporal lobes. Combining observed differences in local oscillation frequency with reduced temporal lobe effective connectivity in the model could account for observed functional network differences. Conclusions: Temporal lobe disconnection plays a key role in cognitive impairment in AD. Significance: We combine electrophysiology, neuropsychological scores, and computational modelling to provide novel insight into the relationships between the disconnection hypothesis and cognitive decline in AD.

Using long-term neocortical recordings from epileptic patients, we investigated the spatial-temporal propagation patterns of interictal spiking. Methods: Interictal spikes were detected in 10 epileptic patients. Short time direct directed transfer function was used to map the spatial-temporal patterns of interictal spike onset and propagation across different cortical topographies. Results: Each patient had unique interictal spike propagation pattern that was highly consistent across times, regardless of the frequency band. High spiking brain regions were often not spike onset regions. We observed frequent spike propagations to shorter distances and that the central sulcus forms a strong barrier to spike propagation. Spike onset and seizure onset seemed to be distinct networks in most cases. Conclusions: Patients in epilepsy have distinct and unique network of causal propagation pattern which are very consistent revealing the underlying epileptic network. Although spike are epileptic biomarkers, spike origin and seizure onset seems to be distinct in most cases. Significance: Understanding patterns of interictal spike propagation could lead to the identification patient-specific epileptic networks amenable to surgical or other treatments.

The recent development of real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) allows studying this relationship in a causal fashion. Specifically, it has been shown that corticospinal excitability is higher during the scalp surface negative EEG peak compared to the positive peak of mu-oscillations in sensorimotor cortex, as indexed by larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for fixed stimulation intensity. Objective: We further characterize the effect of mu-rhythm phase on the MEP input-output (IO) curve by measuring the degree of excitability modulation across a range of stimulation intensities. We furthermore seek to optimize stimulation parameters to enable discrimination of functionally relevant EEG-defined brain states. Methods: A real-time EEG-TMS system was used to trigger MEPs during instantaneous brain-states corresponding to mu-rhythm surface positive and negative peaks with five different stimulation intensities covering an individually calibrated MEP IO curve in 15 healthy participants. Results: MEP amplitude is modulated by mu-phase across a wide range of stimulation intensities, with larger MEPs at the surface negative peak. The largest relative MEP-modulation was observed for weak intensities, the largest absolute MEP-modulation for intermediate intensities. These results indicate a leftward shift of the MEP IO curve during the mu-rhythm negative peak. Conclusion: The choice of stimulation intensity influences the observed degree of corticospinal excitability modulation by mu-phase. Lower stimulation intensities enable more efficient differentiation of EEG mu-phase-defined brain states. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to deepen the understanding of luxury consumers' implicit intentions towards sustainability by using, for the first time, a neuroscientific approach applied to the luxury fashion domain. A greater cortical activity related to cognitive and emotional aspects was hypothesized for luxury sustainability-oriented consumers than for non-sustainability-oriented subjects when presented with sustainability-related cues. Sixteen luxury consumers were divided into two groups according to their sensitivity towards sustainability issues. They were asked to observe a set of 10 stimuli depicting sustainability issues and then to interact with a salesperson while their cortical activity was recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG). Frequency band analysis revealed higher levels of beta, delta, and theta band EEG activity in temporoparietal than frontocentral areas when observing pictures related to sustainability and a specific right temporoparietal theta band activation for the Nonsustainable Group. An increased level of knowledge of sustainability themes was confirmed by the correct detection of stimuli valence and a significant presence of delta power when the salesperson explained the brand's sustainable policy. The specific brain responses related to sensitivity towards sustainability and the different effect of knowledge on sustainability topics based on group differences are discussed here in light of emotional behavior.

To fuel further EEG research with speech production, a method using three-mode tensor decomposition (time x space x frequency) is proposed to perform speech artifact removal. Tensor decomposition enables simultaneous inspection of multiple modes, which suits the multi-way nature of EEG data. In a picture-naming task, we collected raw data with speech artifacts by placing two electrodes near the mouth to record lip EMG. Based on our evaluation, which calculated the correlation values between grand-averaged speech artifacts and the lip EMG, tensor decomposition outperformed the former methods that were based on independent component analysis (ICA) and blind source separation (BSS), both in detecting speech artifact (0.985) and producing clean data (0.101). Our proposed method correctly preserved the components unrelated to speech, which was validated by computing the correlation value between the grand-averaged raw data without EOG and cleaned data before the speech onset (0.92-0.94).

However, the coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) frequencies in a definite time span may change during these processes, indicating different neurophysiological correlates. This study evaluated the changes of EEG coherence during ToM tasks in comparison with Empathy, Physical causality, and baseline conditions, aiming to determine the neurophysiological correlates of ToM. Methods: Sixteen healthy adults underwent a visual activation paradigm using 30 comic strips concerning ToM, Empathy, or Physical causality during EEG recording. The interhemispheric coherence was estimated using a bivariate autoregressive (AR) parametric model. The coherence spectra were analyzed in the alpha, beta, and gamma frequency EEG bands. Results: Coherence analysis taking all of the responses showed that in the gamma band, in comparison with the Empathy, Physical causality, and baseline conditions. ToM was associated with significantly higher peaks between the frontal and parietal areas in the right hemisphere and, in comparison with the Physical causality and baseline conditions, in the left hemisphere. Analysis taking the correct responses confirmed these results. Conclusions: In healthy adults, ToM processes are associated with immediate specific changes of brain connectivity, as expressed by high cortical coherence within the right frontal and parietal areas. These previously unexplored aspects indicate an online involvement of the right hemisphere networks in normal ToM. In patients with epilepsy, the study of EEG coherence during specific tasks may help determine the neural dysfunctions associated with impaired ToM.

Effect of suvorexant on event-related oscillations and EEG sleep in rats exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor and protracted withdrawal	SLEEP			English	Article						alcohol; EEG; event-related oscillations; suvorexant; slow-wave sleep	OREXIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINE; ADMISSION PREDICTS RELAPSE; TREAT ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; REM-SLEEP; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; AMERICAN ACADEMY; CHRONIC INSOMNIA; PHASE-LOCKING; DOUBLE-BLIND	Study Objectives Insomnia is a prominent complaint in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD). However, despite the importance of sleep in the maintenance of sobriety, treatment options for sleep disturbance associated with a history of AUD are currently limited. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that suvorexant, a dual Hct/OX receptor antagonist, normalizes sleep in patients with primary insomnia; yet, its potential for the treatment of sleep pathology associated with AUD has not been investigated in either preclinical or clinical studies. Methods This study employed a model whereby ethanol vapor exposure or control conditions were administered for 8 weeks to adult rats. Waking event-related oscillations (EROs) and EEG sleep were evaluated at baseline before exposure and again following 24 hr of withdrawal from the exposure. Subsequently, the ability of vehicle (VEH) and two doses (10, 30 mg/kg IP) of suvorexant to modify EROs, sleep, and the sleep EEG was investigated. Results After 24 hr following EtOH withdrawal, the ethanol-treated group had increases in waking ERO and activity, more fragmented sleep (shorter duration and increased frequency of slow wave (SW) and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep episodes), and increased and power in REM and SW sleep. Suvorexant induced a dose-dependent decrease in the latency to REM and SW sleep onsets but also produced REM and SW sleep fragmentation and increased energy in waking EROs when compared with VEH. Conclusions Taken together, these studies suggest that suvorexant has overall sleep-promoting effects, but it may exacerbate some aspects of sleep and EEG pathology.

Previous studies have demonstrated human auditory cortex can reliably track the temporal envelope of speech in noisy environments, which provides a plausible neural basis for noise-robust speech recognition. The current study aimed at teasing apart auditory and language contributions to noise-robust envelope tracking by comparing the neural responses of 2 groups of listeners, i.e., native listeners and foreign listeners who did not understand the testing language. In the experiment, speech signals were mixed with spectrally matched stationary noise at 4 intensity levels and listeners' neural responses were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). When the noise intensity increased, the neural response gain increased in both groups of listeners, demonstrating auditory gain control. Language comprehension generally reduced the response gain and envelope-tracking precision, and modulated the spatial and temporal profile of envelope-tracking activity. Based on the spatio-temporal dynamics of envelope-tracking activity, a linear classifier can jointly decode the 2 listener groups and 4 levels of noise intensity. Altogether, the results showed that without feedback from language processing, auditory mechanisms such as gain control can lead to a noise-robust speech representation. High-level language processing modulated the spatio-temporal profile of the neural representation of speech envelope, instead of generally enhancing the envelope representation.

Redaction of false high frequency oscillations due to muscle artifact improves specificity to epileptic tissue	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High Frequency Oscillations; Muscle artifacts; Algorithms; Epilepsy; EEG	TEMPORAL-LOBE; FAST RIPPLES; INTRACRANIAL EEG; RECORDINGS	Objective: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of epilepsy. HFOs are typically acquired on intracranial electrodes, but contamination from muscle artifacts is still problematic in HFO analysis. This paper evaluates the effect of myogenic artifacts on intracranial HFO detection and how to remove them. Methods: Intracranial EEG was recorded in 31 patients. HFOs were detected for the entire recording using an automated algorithm. When available, simultaneous scalp EEG was used to identify periods of muscle artifact. Those markings were used to train an automated scalp EMG detector and an intracranial EMG detector. Specificity to epileptic tissue was evaluated by comparison with seizure onset zone and resected volume in patients with good outcome. Results: EMG artifacts are frequent and produce large numbers of false HFOs, especially in the anterior temporal lobe. The scalp and intracranial EMG detectors both had high accuracy. Removing false HFOs improved specificity to epileptic tissue. Conclusions: Evaluation of HFOs requires accounting for the effect of muscle artifact. We present two tools that effectively mitigate the effect of muscle artifact on HFOs. Significance: Removing muscle artifacts improves the specificity of HFOs to epileptic tissue. Future HFO work should account for this effect, especially when using automated algorithms or when scalp electrodes are not present. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Gupta, V; Pachori, RB				Gupta, Vipin; Pachori, Ram Bilas			Epileptic seizure identification using entropy of FBSE based EEG rhythms	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Rhythms; Fourier-Bessel series expansion (FBSE); Entropy; Classification	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BINARY PATTERN; LEAST-SQUARES; CLASSIFICATION; REPRESENTATION	This paper has proposed a new method for classification of epileptic seizures based on weighted multi scale Renyi permutation entropy (WMRPE) and rhythms obtained with Fourier-Bessel series expansion (FBSE) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this method, each EEG signal is considered for the FBSE to determine the coefficients then the selected order values of these coefficients are used to obtain the rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). The feature used in this work is WMRPE which has been extracted from rhythms of EEG signal. These computed feature values are then used in distinct classifiers such as random forest (RF), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and regression for classification of epileptic seizure EEG signals. The classification is validated using 10-fold cross-validation technique in order to verify the robustness of the proposed work and the optimization of classification performance has beer implemented with feature ranking methods. The proposed method is also tested with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. In this present work, the proposed method provides better classification accuracy results for seven different classification problems in which six are two-class classification problems and the remaining one is three-class classification problem. In two-class classification problems, the EEG signals of epileptic patients at the time of seizure interval has been classified with six distinct classes of EEG signals i.e., healthy subjects with eyes open condition healthy subjects with eyes closed condition, epileptic patients at the time of seizure-free interval captured from hippocampal formation zone, epileptic patients at the time of seizure-free interval captured from epileptogenic zone, epileptic patients at the time of seizure-free interval, and subjects at the time of non-seizure (healthy and seizure-free) interval. In three-class classification problem, the EEG signals corresponding to epileptic patients during seizure interval, healthy subjects with eyes open condition and epileptic patients at the time of seizure-free interval captured from hippocampal formation zone have been classified with the help of proposed method. The obtained results show that the WMRPE with FBSE based rhythms provides better classification accuracies in comparison to the existing rhythms based method and other existing methods. The proposed method is also perform well in noisy environment at different SNR levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The subjects were 94 children with epileptic disorders including idiopathic and non-idiopathic CSWS, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), Panayiotopoulos syndrome, other types of focal epilepsies (oFE), and focal spikes without clinical seizures (Latent). We detected ripple oscillations using a semi-automatic detection tool based on localized power increase. Results: In the idiopathic CSWS Group, the median ratio of ripples per spike in the initial EEG was 5.73, which was significantly higher than those in the BECTS, Panayiotopoulos syndrome, oFE, and Latent Groups (0.39, 0.02, 0.35, 0, respectively, all with p < 0.01). Ripples were particularly frequent at younger ages. Conclusions: This paper is the first to confirm a high ratio of ripples per spike in CSWS in the largest number of patients to date. Significance: The dense generation of ripples, which occurs through a combination of heavy loading of individual spikes with ripples and large numbers of spikes during sleep, characterizes CSWS and might be closely related to the pathophysiology of this epileptic encephalopathy.

However, there is limited understanding of by what means music modulates pain perception and how the brain responds to nociceptive inputs while listening to music, because clinical practice typically involves the coexistence of multiple therapeutic interventions. To address this challenge, laboratory studies with experimental and control conditions are needed. Methods: In the present investigation, we delivered nociceptive laser stimuli on 30 participants under three conditions - participants were sitting in silence, listening to their preferred music, or listening to white noise. Differences among conditions were quantified by self-reports of pain intensity and unpleasantness, and brain activity sampled by electro-encephalography (EEG). Results: Compared with the noise and silence conditions, participants in the music condition reported lower ratings on pain unpleasantness, as reflected by reduced brain oscillations immediately prior to the nociceptive laser stimulus at frequencies of 4-15 Hz in EEG. In addition, participants showed smaller P2 amplitudes in laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) when they were listening to music or white noise in comparison to sitting in silence. These findings suggest that a general modulation effect of sounds on pain, with a specific reduction of pain unpleasantness induced by the positive emotional impact. Conclusion: Music may serve as a real-time regulator to modulate pain unpleasantness. Results are discussed in view of current understandings of music-induced analgesia.

J	Amiri, M; Frauscher, B; Gotman, J				Amiri, Mina; Frauscher, Birgit; Gotman, Jean			Interictal coupling of HFOs and slow oscillations predicts the seizure-onset pattern in mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						intracranial EEG; low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spiking; low-voltage fast activity; phase-amplitude coupling	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP; PHASE; SPIKES; ZONE; HZ; MODULATION; RIPPLES; MARKER	Objective Low-voltage fast activity (LVF) and low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spiking (PS) are the two most common seizure-onset patterns in mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy, with different underlying mechanisms, pathology, and postsurgical outcome. The present work aims to investigate whether specific coupling patterns of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs >80 Hz) and low-frequency waves in the interictal period may distinguish these two patterns, and also seizure-onset zone (SOZ) from non-SOZ as a secondary aim. Methods We used intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data (during non-rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep) of 18 patients with either LVF or PS seizure-onset patterns. We investigated the interaction between HFOs (ripples: 80-250 Hz and fast ripples: >250 Hz) and slow oscillations (slow-delta, delta, and theta waves). We compared classic features (amplitude, duration, frequency, and power) and phase of coupling between HFOs and slower oscillations inside and outside the SOZ. We then used these features to classify HFOs and subsequently patients into LVF and PS groups. Results Ripples in the LVF group had significantly longer duration, lower frequency, and higher amplitude than in the PS group. The phase of slow oscillations at which HFOs occur is different between the LVF and PS HFOs (LVF, mostly at the peak or the transition of peak to trough; PS, mostly during the transition of trough to peak). HFOs associated with theta waves best discriminate seizure-onset patterns. The coupling phase improves the classification of HFOs and patients to either LVF or PS groups, and also the classification of HFOs in SOZ and non-SOZ. Significance The phase of coupling of HFOs and low-frequency waves may help to not only identify the SOZ, but also to classify patients with different types of seizure-onset patterns.

Inconsistent with previous models, thalamocortical spindles are separated into slow spindles (8_12 Hz) and fast spindles (13_17 Hz) with differential properties. We proposed that cortical high frequency (similar to 25 Hz) activity during up states is the key ingredient for the generation of slow spindles. In fact, the nonlinear interaction between cortical high frequency and thalamic oscillations at fast spindle frequency reproduces oscillations in the range of the difference between the two frequencies that lies into the range of slow spindle. The developed simple deterministic thalamocortical model is able to reproduce up and down states with stochastic high-frequency up-state activity as well as both fast and slow spindles. In agreement with the previous experimental observations, the fast and slow spindles are generated at opposing phases of the up state. To further confirm the causal relationship between slow spindles and cortical high frequency oscillations, we next showed that externally applied high frequency stimulation enhanced the slow spindle activity. Moreover, the prediction of the model was validated experimentally by recording EEG from subjects during nap. Both model and experimental results show increase in high frequency activity before slow spindles. Our findings suggest the important role of cortical high frequency activity in the generation of slow spindles.

Usually, during the functional integration and isolation of information in the brain, it is often accompanied by simultaneous rhythmic oscillations of different frequencies. Therefore, studying the phase-synchronous coupling between different frequencies of neurons may have important physiological significance. In this paper, we apply high order bispectral (BIS) analysis to investigate non-linear phase coupling of different oscillators of patients with chronic disorders of consciousness (DOC). We found that non-linear phase coupling of different oscillators of patients in minimally conscious state (MCS) showed significantly different from those with vegetative state (VS). In order to quantify the group differences, three relevant parameters of bispectrum are introduced. Moreover, Bispectral entropy (BE) and the weighted center frequencies fl of the bispectrum significantly correlated with the level of behavioral responsiveness measured using the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). And classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) is trained to predict states of consciousness of patients with DOC. What's more, sharpening the current knowledge of BIS by using EEG-based approaches may shed light on the processes of consciousness and their pathophysiology, and may contribute to clinical treatment and assessment of patents with DOC.

In young individuals, even prestimulus activity has been shown to influence the encoding of an upcoming stimulus, with ongoing theta and beta oscillations being predictive of subsequent recognition. The present study investigated if these memory-related ongoing oscillations are also affected by aging. In an EEG experiment, healthy older and young individuals performed an encoding task with a subsequent recognition test on picture and word stimuli. The group of younger participants showed an increased oscillatory activity in the lower frequency range (ranging from 3 to 17 Hz) in the pre- and post-stimulus period compared with the older adults. Only in young participants, ongoing beta power during encoding was related to later memory in both stimulus categories, whereas in older participants, this effect was diminished. Interestingly, there was no general age-related decrease in recognition performance. These results indicate that ongoing low beta oscillations might constitute a functional indicator of cognitive aging that reveals itself even before a strong decline in behavioral performance is noticeable, and that could be a potential target for neuromodulatory interventions.

J	Fu, Z; Wu, XH; Chen, J				Fu, Zhen; Wu, Xihong; Chen, Jing			Congruent audiovisual speech enhances auditory attention decoding with EEG	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						auditory selective attention; auditory attention decoding; stimulus reconstruction; audiovisual speech; EEG	CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ATTENDED SPEECH; COCKTAIL PARTY; TRACKING; ENVIRONMENT; MODULATION; RESPONSES; CHILDREN; SPEAKER	Objective. The auditory attention decoding (AAD) approach can be used to determine the identity of the attended speaker during an auditory selective attention task, by analyzing measurements of electroencephalography (EEG) data. The AAD approach has the potential to guide the design of speech enhancement algorithms in hearing aids, i.e. to identify the speech stream of listener?s interest so that hearing aids algorithms can amplify the target speech and attenuate other distracting sounds. This would consequently result in improved speech understanding and communication and reduced cognitive load, etc. The present work aimed to investigate whether additional visual input (i.e. lipreading) would enhance the AAD performance for normal-hearing listeners. Approach. In a two-talker scenario, where auditory stimuli of audiobooks narrated by two speakers were presented, multi-channel EEG signals were recorded while participants were selectively attending to one speaker and ignoring the other one. Speakers? mouth movements were recorded during narrating for providing visual stimuli. Stimulus conditions included audio-only, visual input congruent with either (i.e. attended or unattended) speaker, and visual input incongruent with either speaker. The AAD approach was performed separately for each condition to evaluate the effect of additional visual input on AAD. Main results. Relative to the audio-only condition, the AAD performance was found improved by visual input only when it was congruent with the attended speech stream, and the improvement was about 14 percentage points on decoding accuracy. Cortical envelope tracking activities in both auditory and visual cortex were demonstrated stronger for the congruent audiovisual speech condition than other conditions. In addition, a higher AAD robustness was revealed for the congruent audiovisual condition, with reduced channel number and trial duration achieving higher accuracy than the audio-only condition. Significance. The present work complements previous studies and further manifests the feasibility of the AAD-guided design of hearing aids in daily face-to-face conversations. The present work also has a directive significance for designing a low-density EEG setup for the AAD approach.

Magnetoencephalography for localizing and characterizing the epileptic focus	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY: BASIS AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS	Handbook of Clinical Neurology		English	Article; Book Chapter							SOURCE LOCALIZATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FOCAL EPILEPSY; MEG; CHILDREN; SURGERY; SPIKES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SENSITIVITY	Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is the noninvasive measurement of the miniscule magnetic fields produced by electrical currents flowing in the brain-the same neuroelectric activity that produces the EEG. MEG is one of several diagnostic tests employed in the evaluation of patients with epilepsy, but without the need to expose the patient to any potentially harmful agents. MEG is especially important in those being considered for epilepsy surgery, in whom accurate localization of the epileptic focus is paramount. While other modalities infer brain function indirectly by measuring changes in blood flow, metabolism, oxygenation, etc., MEG, as well as EEG, measures neuronal and synaptic function directly and, like EEG, MEG enjoys submillisecond temporal resolution. The measurement of magnetic fields provides information not only about the amplitude of the current but also its orientation. MEG picks up the magnetic field from neuromagnetometers surrounding the head in a helmet-shaped array of sensors. Clinical whole-head systems currently have 200-300 magnetic sensors, thereby offering very high resolution. The magnetic signals are not distorted by anatomy, because magnetic susceptibility is the same for all tissues, including the skull. Hence, MEG allows for a more accurate measurement and localization of brain activities than does EEG. Because one of its primary strengths is the ability to precisely localize electromagnetic activity within brain areas, MEG results are always coregistered to the patient's MRI. When combined in this way with structural imaging, it has been called magnetic source imaging (MSI), but MEG is properly understood as a clinical neurophysiologic diagnostic test. Signal processing and clinical interpretation in magnetoencephalography require sophisticated noise reduction and computerized mathematical modeling. Technological advances in these areas have brought MEG to the point where it is now part of routine clinical practice. MEG has become an indispensable part of the armamentarium at epilepsy centers where MEG laboratories are located, especially when patients are MRI-negative or where results of other structural and functional tests are not entirely concordant.

Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from alpha-Band Activity in the Human Brain	ENEURO			English	Article						alpha-ERD; biogenic magnetite; biophysics; EEG; magnetoreception; quantum compass	MAGNETITE-BASED MAGNETORECEPTION; LOGGERHEAD SEA-TURTLES; HUMAN EEG; ORIENTATION; PULSE; COMPASS; WEAK; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION	Magnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a drop in amplitude of electroencephalography (EEG) alpha-oscillations (8-13 Hz) occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha-event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), such a response has been associated previously with sensory and cognitive processing of external stimuli including vision, auditory and somatosensory cues. Alpha-ERD in response to the geomagnetic field was triggered only by horizontal rotations when the static vertical magnetic field was directed downwards, as it is in the Northern Hemisphere; no brain responses were elicited by the same horizontal rotations when the static vertical component was directed upwards. This implicates a biological response tuned to the ecology of the local human population, rather than a generic physical effect. Biophysical tests showed that the neural response was sensitive to static components of the magnetic field. This rules out all forms of electrical induction (including artifacts from the electrodes) which are determined solely on dynamic components of the field. The neural response was also sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. This rules out free-radical "quantum compass" mechanisms like the cryptochrome hypothesis, which can detect only axial alignment. Ferromagnetism remains a viable biophysical mechanism for sensory transduction and provides a basis to start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.

J	Bergmann, TO; Lie, A; Zrenner, C; Ziemann, U				Bergmann, Til Ole; Lie, Anne; Zrenner, Christoph; Ziemann, Ulf			Pulsed Facilitation of Corticospinal Excitability by the Sensorimotor mu-Alpha Rhythm	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillation; motor cortex; motor evoked potential (MEP); real-time EEG-TMS; short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI); transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)	OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR SYSTEM; EEG; TMS; CORTEX; PHASE; INHIBITION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; PERFORMANCE	Alpha oscillations (8 -14 Hz) are assumed to gate information flow in the brain by means of pulsed inhibition; that is, the phasic suppression of cortical excitability and information processing once per alpha cycle, resulting in stronger net suppression for larger alpha amplitudes due to the assumed amplitude asymmetry of the oscillation. While there is evidence for this hypothesis regarding occipital alpha oscillations, it is less clear for the central sensorimotor mu-alpha rhythm. Probing corticospinal excitability via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex and the measurement of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), we have previously demonstrated that corticospinal excitability is modulated by both amplitude and phase of the sensorimotor mu-alpha rhythm. However, the direction of this modulation, its proposed asymmetry, and its underlying mechanisms remained unclear. We therefore used real-time EEG-triggered single- and paired-pulse TMS in healthy humans of both sexes to assess corticospinal excitability and GABA-A-receptor mediated short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) at rest during spontaneous high amplitude mu-alpha waves at different phase angles (peaks, troughs, rising and falling flanks) and compared them to periods of low amplitude (desynchronized) mu-alpha. MEP amplitude was facilitated during troughs and rising flanks, but no phasic suppression was observed at any time, nor any modulation of SICI. These results are best compatible with sensorimotor mu-alpha reflecting asymmetric pulsed facilitation but not pulsed inhibition of motor cortical excitability. The asymmetric excitability with respect to rising and falling flanks of the mu-alpha cycle further reveals that voltage differences alone cannot explain the impact of phase.

EEG alpha rhythm detection on a portable device	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Emotiv EPOC; Alpha rhythm; Matching pursuit; BCI	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MATCHING PURSUIT; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNALS	Portable EEG devices have a great potential to become efficient computer interfaces. However, a necessary step is to accurately describe the EEG signal in order to quantify brain rhythms. This study explored two signal analysis techniques, Matching Pursuit (MP) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), for differentiation between two states, eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), through the detection of EEG alpha activity obtained from seven scalp regions, using a portable EEG device. Subjects were ten healthy male volunteers. MP results generally reproduced the results from FFT analysis, and all methods performed well on the occipital region. However, there was better state discrimination with MP atom number, and MP atom number was the only variable that reached statistical significance on all locations under study. When employing EEG alpha rhythm for EO vs. EC state discrimination, it may be useful to compute MP atom number, especially when extra-occipital acquisition is warranted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bartur, G; Pratt, H; Soroker, N				Bartur, Gadi; Pratt, Hillel; Soroker, Nachum			Changes in mu and beta amplitude of the EEG during upper limb movement correlate with motor impairment and structural damage in subacute stroke	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Event related de-synchronization; Stroke	MIRROR VISUAL FEEDBACK; NEURON SYSTEM; BRAIN; ALPHA; AREAS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; INTEGRITY; RECOVERY	Objective: Mu and beta EEG oscillations show typical desynchronization patterns during movement. The aim of the current study was to assess whether in sub-acute stroke patients the magnitude of movement-related desynchronization reflects the extent of residual motor ability in the paretic upper limb. Methods: EEG and EMG data were recorded from 14 first-event stroke patients during repeated wrist extension movements of the paretic upper limb. Residual motor ability was assessed by the Fugl Meyer and Box and Blocks standardized clinical tests. Normalized lesion data was analyzed using the MEDx software. Results: The magnitude of event-related de-synchronization (ERD) of the high-mu and low-beta bands of the EEG, measured over the affected hemisphere, correlated significantly with (a) residual motor function in the paretic upper limb as measured by standard clinical tests; (b) the magnitude of EMG recorded from the paretic upper limb during wrist extension; and (c) the total hemispheric volume loss (negative correlation). Conclusion: The magnitude of high-mu and low-beta ERD recorded from the lesioned hemisphere of subacute stroke patients correlates with residual motor ability in the paretic upper limb. Significance: Measures derived from quantitative EEG analysis may play an important role in neurorehabilitation clinical practice. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

EEG data were acquired while subjects were exposed to grayscale images of widely known object categories (e.g., "luggage," "chair," and "car"). Following a short delay, two probes were shown to test memory accuracy. Oscillatory portraits of successful and erroneous memories were contrasted. Where significant differences were identified, oscillatory traits of false memories (i.e., when a novel probe item of the same category is recognized as familiar) were compared with those of successful and erroneous memories. Spectral analysis revealed theta (6-8 Hz) power over occipital channels for encoding of successful and false memories that was smaller when compared to other types of memory errors. The reduced theta power indicates successful encoding and reflects the efficient activation of the underlying neural assemblies. Prominent alpha-beta (10-26 Hz) activity belonging to the right parieto-occipital channels was identified during the retention interval. It was found to be larger for false memories and errors than that of correctly answered trials. High levels of alphabeta oscillatory activity for errors correspond to poor maintenance leading to inefficient allocation of WM resources. In case of false memories, this would imply necessary cognitive effort to manage the extra semantic and perceptual load induced by the encoded stimuli.

Even in the absence of visible structural brain changes, patients with asymptomatic stenosis are prone to cognitive impairment. On a neuronal level, it was suggested that stenosis may lead to disturbed functional brain connectivity. If so, carotid revascularization should have an effect on hypothesized brain network disturbances. We studied functional connectivity in a motor network by resting-state electroencephalography in 12 patients with high grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis before and after interventional or surgical revascularization as compared to 23 controls. In patients with stenosis, functional connectivity of neural oscillations was significantly decreased prior and improved returning to normal connectivity after revascularization. In a subgroup of patients, also studied by contrast perfusion magnetic resonance imaging, reduced connectivity was associated with decreased regional brain perfusion reflected by increased mean transit time in the middle cerebral artery borderzone. Cognitive testing revealed only minor differences between patients and controls. In summary, we identified oscillatory connectivity changes in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis correlating with regional hypoperfusion, which both normalized after revascularization. Hence, electrophysiological changes might be a reversible precursor preceding macroscopic structural brain damage and behavioral impairment in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Influence of reading skill and word length on fixation-related brain activity in school-aged children during natural reading	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						FRP; Reading; Word length; Eye-tracking; EEG; Reading fluency	REGRESSION-BASED ESTIMATION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; PERCEPTUAL SPAN; FREQUENCY; MICROSACCADES; RECOGNITION; ACQUISITION; POTENTIALS; PATTERNS	Word length is one of the main determinants of eye movements during reading and has been shown to influence slow readers more strongly than typical readers. The influence of word length on reading in individuals with different reading skill levels has been shown in separate eye-tracking and electroencephalography studies. However, the influence of reading difficulty on cortical correlates of word length effect during natural reading is unknown. To investigate how reading skill is related to brain activity during natural reading, we performed an exploratory analysis on our data set from a previous study, where slow reading (N = 27) and typically reading (N = 65) 12-to-13.5-year-old children read sentences while co-registered ET-EEG was recorded. We extracted fixation-related potentials (FRPs) from the sentences using the linear deconvolution approach. We examined standard eye-movement variables and deconvoluted FRP estimates: intercept of the response, categorical effect of first fixation versus additional fixation and continuous effect of word length. We replicated the pattern of stronger word length effect in eye movements for slow readers. We found a difference between typical readers and slow readers in the FRP intercept, which contains activity that is common to all fixations, within a fixation time-window of 50-300 ms. For both groups, the word length effect was present in brain activity during additional fixations; however, this effect was not different between groups. This suggests that stronger word length effect in the eye movements of slow readers might be mainly due re-fixations, which are more probable due to the lower efficiency of visual processing.

For nonlinear and nonstationary signals, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) works as a dyadic filter bank to reserve local dynamical properties in decomposed components. Moreover, cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analysis illustrates that the coupling between the phase of low-frequency components and the amplitude of high-frequency components is correlated with the brain functions of sensory detection, working memory, consciousness, and attentional selection. To improve the functions of phase-amplitude coupling analysis, we utilized a multi-timescale approach based on EMD to assess changes in brain functions in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness using a measure of phase-amplitude coupling. Two groups of patients received two different anesthetic recipes (with or without ketamine) during the induction period of GA. Long-term (low-frequency) coupling represented a common transitional process of brain functions from consciousness to unconsciousness with a decay trend in both groups. By contrast, short-term coupling reflected a reverse trend to long-term coupling. However, the measures of short-term coupling also reflected a higher degree of coupling for the group with ketamine compared with that without ketamine. In addition, the coupling phase is a factor of interest. The phases for different combinations of coupling components showed significant changes in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. The coupling between the delta-band phase and the theta-band amplitude changed from in-phase to out-phase coupling during the induction process from consciousness to unconsciousness. The changes in the coupling phase in EEG signals were abrupt and sensitive in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.

Two Spatially Distinct Posterior Alpha Sources Fulfill Different Functional Roles in Attention	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; attention; brain oscillations; EEG; multimodal attention; source estimates	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BAND ACTIVITY; EEG; MODULATION; PREDICTS; ALLOCATION; INCREASES; MECHANISM	Directing attention helps to extract relevant information and suppress distracters. Alpha brain oscillations (8 -12 Hz) are crucial for this process, with power decreases facilitating processing of important information and power increases inhibiting brain regions processing irrelevant information. Evidence for this phenomenon arises from visual attention studies (Worden et al., 2000); however, the effect also exists in other modalities, including the somatosensory system (Haegens et al., 2011) and intersensory attention tasks (Foxe and Snyder, 2011). We investigated in human participants (10 females, 10 males) the role of alpha oscillations in focused (0/100%) versus divided (40/60%) attention, both across modalities (visual/somatosensory; Experiment 1) and within the same modality (visual domain: across hemifields; Experiment 2) while recording EEG over 128 scalp electrodes. In Experiment 1, participants divided their attention between visual and somatosensory modality to determine the temporal/spatial frequency of a target stimulus (vibrotactile stimulus/Gabor grating). In Experiment 2, participants divided attention between two visual hemifields to identify the orientation of a Gabor grating. In both experiments, prestimulus alpha power in visual areas decreased linearly with increasing attention to visual stimuli. In contrast, prestimulus alpha power in parietal areas was lower when attention was divided between modalities/hemifields compared with focused attention. These results suggest there are two alpha sources, one of which reflects the "visual spotlight of attention" and the other reflects attentional effort. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that attention recruits two spatially distinct alpha sources in occipital and parietal brain regions, acting simultaneously but serving different functions in attention.

Although SSVEP responses have been tested for flicker frequencies up to 100 Hz [Herrmann, 2001], effects of attention on SSVEP amplitude have only been reported for lower frequencies (up to similar to 30 Hz), with no systematic comparison across a wide, finely sampled frequency range. Does attention modulate SSVEP amplitude at higher flicker frequencies (gamma band, 30-80 Hz), and is attentional modulation constant across frequencies? By isolating SSVEP responses from the broadband EEG signal using a multivariate spatiotemporal source separation method, we demonstrate that flicker in the alpha and gamma bands elicit strongest and maximally phase stable brain responses (resonance), on which the effect of attention is opposite: positive for gamma and negative for alpha. Finding subject-specific gamma resonance frequency and a positive attentional modulation of gamma-band SSVEPs points to the untapped potential of flicker as a non-invasive tool for studying the causal effects of interactions between visual gamma-band rhythmic stimuli and endogenous gamma oscillations on perception and attention.

Characteristics of EEG signals are complex, being non-stationarity, aperiodic and nonlinear in nature. EEG signals are a combination of sustained oscillation and non-oscillation transients that are challenging to deal with using linear approaches. Method: This research proposes a new scheme based on a tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) and a statistical approach to analyse various EEG recordings. Firstly, the proposed method decompose EEG signals into different sub-bands using the TQWT method, which is parameterized by its Q-factor and redundancy. This method depends on the resonance of a signal, instead of frequency or scaling as in the Fourier and wavelet transforms. Secondly, using a statistical feature extraction on the sub-bands to divide each sub-band into n windows, and then extract several statistical features from each window. Finally, the extracted features are forwarded to a bagging tree (BT), k nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM) as classifiers to evaluate the performance of the proposed feature extraction technique. Results: The proposed method is tested on two different EEG databases: Bonn University database and Born University database. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction algorithm with thek-NN classifier produces the best performance compared with the other two classifiers. Comparison with existing methods: In order to further evaluate the performances, the proposed scheme is compared with the other existing methods in terms of accuracy. The results prove that the proposed TQWT based feature extraction method has great potential to extract discriminative information from brain signals. Conclusion: The outcomes of the proposed technique can assist doctors and other health experts to identify diversified EEG categories.

The present study is to verify the modifications of EEG power spectra in eyes-open resting state of schizophrenia and first-degree relatives, and to investigate associations between EEG band power and schizotypal personality traits in first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. Participant samples in this study consisted of 33 healthy normal controls, 35 unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients and 35 schizophrenia patients. Group differences in resting EEG band power were examined via repeated-measures analysis of variance, and correlation between EEG power and schizotypal personality traits via Pearson Correlation analysis. The results showed that patients with schizophrenia exhibited increased delta, theta and alpha activity over anterior and central regions in eyes-open resting state compared with that of normal control. Gamma band power was found for the first time to be negatively correlated to schizotypal personality traits in first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. To conclusion, these findings suggested that low-frequency EEG activity might be neural manifestations of pathophysiological changes in the brain of schizophrenia, and gamma band activity might be an approach to measure the genetic liability of the disorder.

Identifying biomarkers of such process is a prerequisite for developing and implementing targeted therapies aimed at preventing the development of epilepsy. Currently, there are no validated electrophysiological biomarkers of post-traumatic epileptogenesis. Experimental EEG studies using the lateral fluid percussion injury model have identified three candidate biomarkers of post-traumatic epileptogenesis: pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-300 Hz); repetitive HFOs and spikes (rHFOSs); and reduction in sleep spindle duration and dominant frequency at the transition from stage III to rapid eye movement sleep. EEG studies in humans have yielded conflicting data; recent evidence suggests that epileptiform abnormalities detected acutely after traumatic brain injury carry a significantly increased risk of subsequent epilepsy. Well-designed studies are required to validate these promising findings, and ultimately establish whether there are post-traumatic electrophysiological features which can guide the development of 'antiepileptogenic' therapies.

J	Al-Salman, W; Li, Y; Wen, P				Al-Salman, Wessam; Li, Yan; Wen, Peng			Detecting sleep spindles in EEGs using wavelet fourier analysis and statistical features	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Sleep spindles; Statistical model; Wavelet fourier analysis; EEG signals	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; TRANSFORM; TIME; CLASSIFICATION; ECG	One of the more difficult tasks in sleep stage scoring is the detection of sleep spindles. Developing an effective method to identify these transitions in sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is an ongoing challenge, as there are typically hundreds of such transitions in each recording. This paper proposes a statistical model and a method based on wavelet Fourier analysis to detect sleep spindles. In this work, spindle detection is achieved in two phases: a training phase and a testing phase. An EEG signal is first divided into segments, using a sliding window technique. The size of the window is 0.5 s, with an overlap of 0.4 s. Then, each EEG segment is decomposed using a discrete wavelet transform into different levels of decompositions. The wavelet detail coefficient at level 3 (D3) is selected from these parameters, and this is passed through a fast Fourier transform to identify the desired frequency bands {alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma}-. Ten statistical characteristics are extracted from each band. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance is used to select the important features, representing each of the 0.5 s EEG segments. To detect all possible occurrences of sleep spindles in the original EEG signals, four different window sizes of 0.25, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0s are also tested. Finally, the extracted features are used as the input to four classifiers to detect the sleep spindles: a least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), K-nearest neighbours, a K-means algorithm and a C4.5 decision tree. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method yields optimal results with a window size of 0.5 s. The maximum averages of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 97.9%, 98.5% and 97.8%, respectively. This method can efficiently detect spindles in EEG signals, and can assist sleep experts in analysing EEG signals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Decoding motion direction using the topography of sustained ERPs and alpha oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Decoding; Motion perception; EEG; ERPs; Alpha-band oscillations	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; PERCEPTUAL DECISION; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; REPRESENTATION; ARTIFACTS; MULTIPLE; TRACKING; MEG	The present study sought to determine whether scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain decodable information about the direction of motion in random dot kinematograms (RDKs), in which the motion information is spatially distributed and mixed with random noise. Any direction of motion from 0 to 360 degrees was possible, and observers reported the precise direction of motion at the end of a 1500-ms stimulus display. We decoded the direction of motion separately during the motion period (during which motion information was being accumulated) and the report period (during which a shift of attention was necessary to make a fine-tuned direction report). Machine learning was used to decode the precise direction of motion (within +/- 11.25 degrees) from the scalp distribution of either alpha-band EEG activity or sustained event-related potentials (ERPs). We found that ERP-based decoding was above chance (1/16) during both the stimulus and the report periods, whereas alpha-based decoding was above chance only during the report period. Thus, sustained ERPs contain information about spatially distributed direction-of-motion, providing a new method for observing the accumulation of sensory information with high temporal resolution. By contrast, the scalp topography of alpha-band EEG activity appeared to mainly reflect spatially focused attentional processes rather than sensory information.

Among molecular mechanisms, activation of BDNF receptor TrkB along with the inhibition of GSK3 beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) are considered as critical molecular level determinants for ketamine's antidepressant effects. Hydroxynorketamines (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,6S) HNK), non-anesthetic metabolites of ketamine, have been proposed to govern the therapeutic effects of ketamine through a mechanism not involving NMDARs. However, we have shown that nitrous oxide, another NMDAR blocking anesthetic and a putative rapid-acting antidepressant, evokes TrkB-GSK3 beta signaling alterations during rebound slow EEG (electroencephalogram) oscillations. We investigated here the acute effects of ketamine, 6,6-d(2)-ketamine (a ketamine analogue resistant to metabolism) and cis-HNK that contains (2R,6R) and (2S,6S) enantiomers in 1:1 ratio, on TrkB-GSK3 beta signaling and concomitant electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations in the adult mouse cortex. Ketamine dose-dependently increased slow oscillations and phosphorylations of TrkB(Y816) and GSK3 beta(59) in crude brain homogenates (i.e. sedative/anesthetic doses ( > 50 mg/kg, i.p.) produced more prominent effects than a subanesthetic dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.)). Similar, albeit less obvious, effects were seen in crude synaptosomes. A sedative dose of 6,6-d(2)-ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) recapitulated the effects of ketamine on TrkB and GSK3 beta phosphorylation while cis-HNK at a dose of 20 mg/kg produced negligible acute effects on TrkB-GSK3 beta signaling or slow oscillations. These findings suggest that the acute effects of ketamine on TrkB-GSK3 beta signaling are by no means restricted to subanesthetic (i.e. antidepressant) doses and that cis-HNK is not responsible for these effects.

However, the effect on sleep seems to depend on multiple factors such as composition of the Cannabis, dosage and route of administration. Vaporization is the recommended route for the administration of Cannabis for medical purposes; however, there is no published research about the effects of vaporized Cannabis on sleep, neither in laboratory animals, nor in humans. Because previous reports suggested that low doses of THC have sedating effects, the aim of the present study was to characterize in rats, the acute effects on sleep induced by the administration of low doses of THC by means of vaporization of a specific type of Cannabis (THC 11.5% and negligible amounts of other cannabinoids). For this purpose, polysomnographic recordings in chronically prepared rats were performed during 6 h in the light and dark phases. Animals were treated with 0 (control), 40, 80 and 200 mg of Cannabis immediately before the beginning of recordings; the THC plasma concentrations with these doses were low (up to 6.7 ng/mL with 200 mg). A quantitative EEG analyses by means of the spectral power and coherence estimations was also performed for the highest Cannabis dose. Compared to control, 200 mg of Cannabis increased NREM sleep time during the light phase, but only during the first hour of recording. Interestingly, no changes on sleep were observed during the dark (active) phase or with lower doses of Cannabis. Cannabis 200 mg also produced EEG power reductions in different cortices, mainly for high frequency bands during W and REM sleep, but only during the light phase. On the contrary, a reduction in the sleep spindles intra-hemispheric coherence was observed during NREM sleep, but only during the dark phase. In conclusion, administration of low doses of THC by vaporization of a specific type of Cannabis produced a small increment of NREM sleep, but only during the light (resting) phase. This was accompanied by subtle modifications of high frequency bands power (during the light phase) and spindle coherence (during the dark phase), which are associated with cognitive processing. Our results reassure the importance of exploring the sleep-promoting properties of Cannabis.

Functional brain connectivity in electrical status epilepticus in sleep	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES); EEG; coherence; oscillations; phase lag; continuous spike and waves during slow wave sleep (CSWS)	EEG COHERENCE; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SLOW SLEEP; CHILDREN; SPECTRUM; AUTISM; SPIKES; ENCEPHALOPATHY; ABNORMALITIES; DISCHARGES	Aims. Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) is an age-related, self-limited epileptic encephalopathy. The syndrome is characterized by cognitive and behavioral abnormalities and a specific EEG pattern of continuous spikes and waves during slow-wave sleep. While spikes and sharp waves are known to result in transient cognitive impairment during learning and memory tasks performed during the waking state, the effect of epileptiform discharges during sleep on cognition and behavior is unclear. There is increasing evidence that abnormalities of coherence, a measure of the consistency of the phase difference between two EEG signals when compared over time, is an important feature of brain oscillations and plays a role in cognition and behavior. The objective of this study was to determine whether coherence of EEG activity is altered during slow-wave sleep in children with ESES when compared to typically developing children.Methods. We examined coherence during epochs of ESES versus epochs when ESES was not present. In addition, we compared coherence during slow-wave sleep between typically developing children and children with ESES.Results. ESES was associated with remarkably high coherences at all bandwidths and most electrode pairs. While the high coherence was largely attributed to the spikes and spike-and-wave discharge, activity between spikes and spike-and-wave discharge also demonstrated high coherence.Conclusions. This study indicates that EEG coherence during ESES is relatively high. Whether these increases in coherence correlate with the cognitive and behavioral abnormalities seen in children with this EEG pattern remains to be determined.

Resting alpha power and peak alpha frequency may be decreased in patients with psychosis. We used high-density EEG (hd-EEG) to record resting-state data and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy controls to compare brain resonances across multiple frequencies. We recorded hd-EEG (128 channels) from 22 FEP patients and 22 healthy controls during eyes-closed resting state and eyes-closed photic stimulation at 1 Hz, 4 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz, and 40 Hz. Alpha power, peak alpha frequency, and SSVEP amplitude were analyzed using ANOVA and statistical non-parametric mapping. We found that FEP patients had lower peak alpha frequencies (9.72 Hz vs 10.40 Hz, p = .02, Cohen's d = 0.73) and this decrease was driven by slowing over the central and posterior scalp. There was no difference in alpha power. Alpha waves propagated primarily from anterior to posterior and that propagation was slowed in patients. During SSVEP, patients had smaller increases in EEG power in the stimulation band (F-(1,F-184) = 5.3, p = .02). Patients had attenuated responses to SSVEP stimulation at alpha, beta and gamma frequencies. The gamma response was partially preserved in patients who also had depressive symptoms. We conclude that even in early stages of illness, psychotic disorders are associated with decreased alpha peak frequency and impaired evoked resonances. These findings implicate multiple patterns of dysconnectivity in cortico-cortico and cortico-thalamic networks in FEP.

External sources are usually related to experiment conditions whereas internal artifacts are usually generated by the persons examined. Internal artifacts, in contrast to external ones, are characterised by non-stationarity, which results in higher detection complexity. Typical internal artifacts are related to eye blinking, eye movement and muscle activity. The paper presents the comparison results of various approaches to classification of EEG-related features. Another aspect reviewed in the paper is comparing normalisation methods of dealing with inter-subject variability. The analysis process covered several parts. Preprocessing included signal filtering and bad-channel removal. Signal epoching with 50% overlap was applied in order to achieve better time resolution. Feature extraction was based on frequency analysis performed with the Welch method. Due to the high number of obtained features, the feature selection procedure was the essential part of the processing. Selected features were used to train and validate supervised classifiers. The accuracy was the main measure used in classifier performance assessment.

Power and temporal dynamics of alpha oscillations at rest differentiate cognitive performance involving sustained and phasic cognitive control	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state EEG; Alpha; IAF; Long-range temporal correlations; Cognitive control; Attention	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; EDITION CVLT-II; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; PEAK FREQUENCY; BRAIN NETWORKS; EEG COHERENCE; ATTENTION	Resting state neuronal activity in EEG/MEG recordings is primarily characterized by the presence of alpha oscillations (approx. 8-12 Hz). However, their functional significance and link to cognitive task performance remains elusive. We investigated resting state neuronal activity and its relation to task performance by assessing traditional measures of alpha activity (power and individual alpha peak frequency) and dynamic properties of the signal measured by long-range temporal correlations (LRTC). Multichannel EEG was recorded at rest in 82 healthy male adults and compared to their cognitive performance, measured by tests involving executive functions, working memory, short-and long-term memory demands. Our results showed that attention-span scores positively correlated with alpha power at rest, with corresponding neuronal sources located primarily in the left-hemispheric anterior cingulate cortex, parietal regions, and bilateral suplementary motor areas. Furthermore, better working memory performance was related to increased LRTC of alpha oscillations at rest in the right hemispheric fronto-parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. Our findings suggest that resting state neuronal activity may reflect properties of brain networks that are functionally relevant for cognitive task performance. While alpha power measured at rest might relate to tasks that employ sustained inhibitory control, LRTC are suggested to reflect the capacity of neuronal networks to perform tasks that require phasic attention and quick adaptation to changing task demands.

In order to classify the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of stroke patients with cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage, this paper proposed a novel EEG stroke signal feature extraction method by combining fuzzy entropy and hierarchical theory. Fuzzy entropy not only took the advantages of sample entropy, but also had less dependence on the length of time series and possessed better robustness to noise signals. It measured the similarity of two vectors based on Gaussian function instead of Heaviside function, avoiding discontinuity problems of sample entropy and approximate entropy. Hierarchical theory efficiently took advantages of the approximation information in low-frequency and the detail information in high-frequency. This was benefit for capturing a wealth of dynamic information and retaining redundant components. Support vector machine (SVM) was further used as the stroke signal classification model for classifying ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. The experimental results showed that, compared with other benchmarks, the classification accuracy based on the features of hierarchical fuzzy entropy is much higher than those benchmarks methods. Compared with the features of fuzzy entropy without using hierarchical theory, the classifier based on the features of hierarchical fuzzy entropy gave a much more improvement in classification performance by increasing accuracy from 68.03% to 96.72%. It meant that the proposed EEG stroke signal hierarchical fuzzy entropy feature extraction method was an efficient measure in classifying ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

We tested this conjecture by recording response behavior and electroencephalographic (EEG) data to auditory pitch changes, embedded at different time lags in a continuous sound stream. Participants reacted more rapidly to larger rather than smaller feature change magnitudes (deviancy), as well as to changes appearing after longer rather than shorter waiting times (hazard rate of response times). However, the feature and time dimensions of attention separately contributed to response speed, with no significant interaction. Notably, phase coherence at low frequencies (delta and theta bands, 1-7 Hz) predominantly reflected attention capture by feature changes, while oscillatory power at higher frequency bands, alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-25 Hz) reflected the orienting of attention in time. Power and phase coherence predicted different portions of response speed variance, suggesting a division of labor in encoding sensory attention in complex auditory scenes.

The present paper is devoted to the study of the relationship of mental processes and the perception of external stimuli related to the previous musical education. The experimental set under study included 38 individuals who were observed during perception of music and during listening to foreign languages in four stages, each of which was 5 min long. The proposed methodology is based on the application of digital signal processing methods, signal filtering, statistical methods for signal segment selection and active electrode detection. Neural networks and support vector machine (SVM) models are then used to classify the selected groups of linguists to groups with and without a previous musical education. Our results include mean classification accuracies of 82.9% and 82.4% (with the mean cross-validation errors of 0.21 and 0.22, respectively) for perception of language or music and features based upon EEG power in the beta and gamma EEG frequency bands using neural network and SVM classification models.

On a neural level, these 2 processes are thought to be supported by neocortical alpha/beta desynchronization and hippocampal theta/gamma synchronization, respectively. Intuitively, these 2 processes should couple to successfully create and retrieve episodic memories, yet this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We address this by analyzing human intracranial electroencephalogram data recorded during 2 associative memory tasks. We find that neocortical alpha/beta (8 to 20 Hz) power decreases reliably precede and predict hippocampal "fast" gamma (60 to 80 Hz) power increases during episodic memory formation; during episodic memory retrieval, however, hippocampal "slow" gamma (40 to 50 Hz) power increases reliably precede and predict later neocortical alpha/beta power decreases. We speculate that this coupling reflects the flow of information from the neocortex to the hippocampus during memory formation, and hippocampal pattern completion inducing information reinstatement in the neocortex during memory retrieval.

However, it is unknown whether 1064-nm tPBM also modulates electrophysiology, and specifically neural oscillations, in the human brain. The hypothesis guiding our study is that applying 1064-nm tPBM of the right prefrontal cortex enhances neurophysiological rhythms at specific frequency bands in the human brain under resting conditions. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the 64-channel scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) before, during, and after the application of 11 min of 4-cm-diameter tPBM (CW 1064-nm laser with 162 mW/cm(2) and 107 J/cm(2)) to the right forehead of human subjects (n = 20) using a within-subject, sham-controlled design. Time-resolved scalp topographies of EEG power at five frequency bands were computed to examine the tPBM-induced EEG power changes across the scalp. The results show time-dependent, significant increases of EEG spectral powers at the alpha (8 to 13 Hz) and beta (13 to 30 Hz) bands at broad scalp regions, exhibiting a front-to-back pattern. The findings provide the first sham-controlled topographic mapping that tPBM increases the strength of electrophysiological oscillations (alpha and beta bands) while also shedding light on the mechanisms of tPBM in the human brain.

Effect of locomotor demands on cognitive processing	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; LOAD CARRIAGE; TASK DEMANDS; EEG; WALKING; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; ARTIFACTS; EXERCISE	Understanding how brain dynamics change with dual cognitive and motor tasks can improve our knowledge of human neurophysiology. The primary goals of this study were to: (1) assess the feasibility of extracting electrocortical signals from scalp EEG while performing sustained, physically demanding dual-task walking and (2) test hypotheses about how the P300 event-related potential is affected by walking physical exertion. Participants walked on a treadmill for an hour either carrying an empty rucksack or one filled with 40% of their body weight. During the walking conditions and during a seated control condition, subjects periodically performed a visual oddball task. We recorded scalp EEG and examined electrocortical dynamics time-locked to the target stimulus. Channel-level event-related potential analysis demonstrated that it is feasible to extract reliable signals during long duration loaded walking. P300 amplitude was reduced during loaded walking versus seated, but there was no effect of time on task. Source level activity and frequency analysis revealed that sensorimotor, parietal, and cingulate brain areas all contributed to the reduced P300 amplitude during dual-task walking. We interpret the results as supporting a prioritization of cortical resources for walking, leading to fewer resources being directed toward the oddball task during dual-task locomotion.	[Bradford, J.

However, it is unclear how altering the phase of stimulation and the duration of the ISI might impact positive tACS effects. Here, we investigated the role of tACS parameters in engendering performance improvements by manipulating these two stimulation parameters (i.e. phase and ISI) in two experiments. Methods: Repetitive sessions of bilateral PFC theta-tACS were applied with in-phase stimulation + 1-min ISI (experiment 1) and anti-phase stimulation + 5-min ISI (experiment 2) while participants were engaged in a multitasking challenge accompanied by electroencephalography (EEG) data collection. Results: Compared to the control group, in-phase stimulation + 1-min ISI showed an enhancement of multitasking performance coupled with a modulation of posterior alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) activities. However, repetitive sessions of anti-phase tACS + 5-min ISI did not generate significant enhancement in multitasking performance, nor changes in neural oscillatory activities compared to the control group. Conclusion: The results revealed that the previous reported positive tACS effects on multitasking performance are not affected by manipulating the phase of current polarity. Yet, changing the ISI of the stimulation protocol eliminated the previous observed performance improvements. Taken together, these results stress the importance of stimulation protocol for generating positive tACS effects on cognitive function and neural oscillations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Gamma Band Phase Delay in Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						ASSR; Auditory steady-state response; EEG; Gamma; Oscillations; Phase; Schizophrenia	STEADY-STATE RESPONSE; AUDITORY-STIMULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; AMPLITUDE; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; ABNORMALITIES; DYSFUNCTION; DYNAMICS	BACKGROUND: In 1999, Kwon et al. reported several electroencephalographic gamma band auditory steady-state response (ASSR) abnormalities in schizophrenia, spawning approximately 100 subsequent studies. While many studies replicated the finding of reduced 40-Hz ASSR power in schizophrenia and extended this by showing that 40-Hz phase synchrony (phase-locking factor [PLF]) was also reduced, none attempted to replicate the original phase delay finding of Kwon et al. Accordingly, we measured the 40-Hz ASSR phase-locking angle (PLA) to assess phase delay and examined its differential sensitivity to schizophrenia, relative to power and PLF measures. METHODS: To obtain ASSRs, electroencephalography data were recorded from 28 patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy control subjects listening to repeated 40-Hz 500-ms click trains. Evoked power, total power, PLF, and PLA were calculated after Morlet wavelet time-frequency decomposition of single trial data from electrode fz. RESULTS: In patients with schizophrenia, 40-Hz PLA was significantly reduced (i.e., phase delayed) (p < .0001) and was unrelated to reductions in their 40-Hz power or PLF. PLA discriminated patients from healthy control subjects with 85% accuracy compared with 67% for power and 65% for PLF. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the original Kwon et al. study, 40-Hz click train-driven gamma oscillations were phase delayed in schizophrenia. Importantly, this phase delay abnormality was substantially larger than the gamma power and phase synchrony abnormalities that have been the focus of prior 40-Hz ASSR studies in schizophrenia. PLA provides a unique neurobiological measure of gamma band abnormalities in schizophrenia, likely reflecting a distinct pathophysiological mechanism from those underlying PLF and power abnormalities.

The Role of Neuronal Oscillations in Visual Active Sensing	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						active sensing; cognition; attention; oscillations; phase reset; eye movement; saccade; predictive coding	GAMMA-BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; WORKING-MEMORY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; FIELD POTENTIALS; FRONTAL THETA; CORTEX; PHASE; EEG; ALPHA	Visual perception is most often studied as a "passive" process in which an observer fixates steadily at point in space so that stimuli can be delivered to the system with spatial precision. Analysis of neuronal signals related to vision is generally keyed to stimulus onset, stimulus movement, etc.; i.e., events external to the observer. In natural "active" vision, however, information is systematically acquired by using eye movements including rapid (saccadic) eye movements, as well as smooth ocular pursuit of moving objects and slower drifts. Here we consider the use of alternating saccades and fixations to gather information from a visual scene. The underlying motor sampling plan contains highly reliable information regarding "where" and "when" the eyes will land, this information can be used predictively to modify firing properties of neurons precisely at the time when this "contextual" information is most useful - when a volley of retinal input enters the system at the onset of each fixation. Analyses focusing on neural events leading to and resulting from shifts in fixation, as well as visual events external to the observer, can provide a more complete and mechanistic understanding of visual information processing. Studies thus far suggest that active vision may be a fundamentally different from that process we usually study with more traditional passive viewing paradigms. In this Perspective we note that active saccadic sampling behavior imposes robust temporal patterning on the activity of neuron ensembles and large-scale neural dynamics throughout the brain's visual pathways whose mechanistic effects on information processing are not yet fully understood. The spatio-temporal sequence of eye movements elicits a succession of temporally predictable quasi-rhythmic sensory inputs, whose encoding is enhanced by entrainment of low frequency oscillations to the rate of eye movements. Review of the pertinent findings underscores the fact that temporal coordination between motor and visual cortices is critical for understanding neural dynamics of active vision and posits that phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations plays a mechanistic role in this process.

J	Wostmann, M; Alavash, M; Obleser, J				Woestmann, Malte; Alavash, Mohsen; Obleser, Jonas			Alpha Oscillations in the Human Brain Implement Distractor Suppression Independent of Target Selection	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; attention; auditory; selection; suppression	SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL INPUT; BAND; MECHANISMS; NETWORKS; EEG; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; ALLOCATION; DYNAMICS	In principle, selective attention is the net result of target selection and distractor suppression. The way in which both mechanisms are implemented neurally has remained contested. Neural oscillatory power in the alpha frequency band (similar to 10 Hz) has been implicated in the selection of to-be-attended targets, but there is lack of empirical evidence for its involvement in the suppression of to-be-ignored distractors. Here, we use electroencephalography recordings of N = 33 human participants (males and females) to test the preregistered hypothesis that alpha power directly relates to distractor suppression and thus operates independently from target selection. In an auditory spatial pitch discrimination task, we modulated the location (left vs right) of either a target or a distractor tone sequence, while fixing the other in the front. When the distractor was fixed in the front, alpha power relatively decreased contralaterally to the target and increased ipsilaterally. Most importantly, when the target was fixed in the front, alpha lateralization reversed in direction for the suppression of distractors on the left versus right. These data show that target-selection-independent alpha power modulation is involved in distractor suppression. Although both lateralized alpha responses for selection and for suppression proved reliable, they were uncorrelated and distractor-related alpha power emerged from more anterior, frontal cortical regions. Lending functional significance to suppression-related alpha oscillations, alpha lateralization at the individual, single-trial level was predictive of behavioral accuracy. These results fuel a renewed look at neurobiological accounts of selection-independent suppressive filtering in attention.

SE with electrographic and behavioral features similar to those seen in humans is reproduced in rodents by i.p. pilocarpine injection, and can be terminated by diazepam and ketamine treatment but only behaviourally, not electrographically. Little is known on the behavioral and EEG effects induced by a delayed administration of ketamine (25 mg/kg) after diazepam (10 mg/kg) or vice versa. Therefore, we analysed behavior and EEG activity recorded from the mouse hippocampal CA3 region before, during SE and after anticonvulsant treatments. In the first group (n = 4), diazepam was administered one hour before ketamine whereas in the second group (n = 4) ketamine was administered one hour before diazepam. The EEG SE did not disappear after each of the two treatments but progressed within 4 h to a pattern of interictal discharges. However, diazepam administration before ketamine significantly shortened the time of behavioral recovery compared to when ketamine was administered before diazepam (p < 0.05). The two protocols were also associated to distinct EEG changes in gamma and high frequency oscillations. In conclusion, although diazepam and ketamine are not effective in stopping EEG SE, diazepam administration one hour before ketamine shortens behavioral recovery in pilocarpine-treated mice.

Sensory-processing deficits are common in humans with FXS and an animal model, the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse, manifesting in the auditory system as debilitating hypersensitivity and abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) phenotypes. FXS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, but how EEG/ERP phenotypes change during development is unclear. Therefore, we characterized baseline and stimulus-evoked EEG in auditory and frontal cortex of developing (postnatal day (P) 21 and P30) and adult (P60) wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice with the FVB genetic background. We found that baseline gamma-band power and N1 amplitude of auditory ERP were increased in frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice during development and in adults. Baseline gamma power was increased in auditory cortex at P30. Genotype differences in stimulus-evoked gamma power were present in both cortical regions, but the direction and strength of the changes were age-dependent. These findings suggest that cortical deficits are present during early development and may contribute to sensory-processing deficits in FXS, which in turn may lead to anxiety and delayed language. Developmental changes in EEG measures indicate that observations at a single time-point during development are not reflective of FXS disease progression and highlight the need to identify developmental trajectories and optimal windows for treatment.

Individual alpha frequency increases during a task but is unchanged by alpha-band flicker	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha rhythm < content; topics; behavioral oscillations; EEG < methods; entrainment; individual alpha frequency	OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; PHASE; ENTRAINMENT; POWER; MODULATION; ATTENTION; REVEAL	Visual perception fluctuates in sync with ongoing neural oscillations in the delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands of the human EEG. Supporting the relationship between alpha and perceptual sampling, recent work has demonstrated that variations in individual alpha frequency (IAF) correlate with the ability to discriminate one from two stimuli presented briefly in the same location. Other studies have found that, after being presented with a flickering stimulus at alpha frequencies, perception of near-threshold stimuli fluctuates for a short time at the same frequency. Motivated by previous work, we were interested in whether this alpha entrainment involves shifts in IAF. While recording EEG, we tested whether two-flash discrimination (a behavioral correlate of IAF) can be influenced by similar to 1 s of rhythmic visual stimulation at two different alpha frequencies (8.3 and 12.5 Hz). Speaking against the bottom-up malleability of IAF, we found no change in IAF during stimulation and no change in two-flash discrimination immediately afterward. We also found synchronous activity that persisted after 12.5 Hz stimulation, which suggests that a separate source of alpha was entrained. Importantly, we replicated the correlation between IAF and two-flash discrimination in a no-stimulation condition, demonstrating the sensitivity of our behavioral measure. We additionally found that IAF increased during the task compared to rest, which demonstrates that IAF is influenced by top-down factors but is not involved in entrainment.

Thirty female LDH patients and thirty healthy controls volunteered to participate in the experiment. We also tested a healthy participant's motion imaginery (MI) of left/right lateral bending movement for over 200 times. We used Daubechies 4 (db4) wavelet to decompose EEG signal and we extracted 6, 0, a and 11 rhythms of the EEG signal. Wavelet entropy and sample entropy (SampEn) of four frequency bands were calculated. The results showed that there was significant difference of wavelet entropy EEG in T7, 02, and AF4 channels between the LDH and the healthy group when they did real left lateral bending. The topographic map also showed that SampEn value of four rhythms of the MI right lateral bending were significantly less than the values of the MI left lateral motion in healthy participant.

The aim of the present study was to explore whether face stimuli can be used in an ERP-based RSVP paradigm to infer recognition of broadly familiar faces. To do this, we explored whether famous faces differentially break into awareness when presented in RSVP and, importantly, whether ERPs can be used to detect these breakthrough events on an individual basis. Our findings provide evidence that famous faces are differentially perceived and processed by participants' brains as compared to novel (or unfamiliar) faces. EEG data revealed large differences in brain responses between these conditions.

The goal of this study is to investigate how effective connectivity (EC) changes effect on unexpected seizures prediction, as this will authorize the patients to play it safe and avoid risk. We approve the hypothesis that EC variables near seizure change significantly so seizure can be predicted in accordance with this variation. We introduce two time-variant coefficients based on standard deviation of EC on Freiburg EEG dataset by using directed transfer function and Granger causality methods and compare index changes over the course of time in five different frequency bands. Comparison of the multivariate and bivariate analysis of factors is implemented in this investigation. The performance based on the suggested methods shows the seizure occurrence period is approximately 50 min that is expected onset stated in, the maximum value of sensitivity approaching similar to 80%, and 0.33 FP/h is the false prediction rate. The findings revealed that greater accuracy and sensitivity are obtained by the designed system in comparison with the results of other works in the same condition. Even though these results still are not sufficient for clinical applications. Based on the conclusions, it can generally be observed that the greater results by DTF method are in the gamma and beta frequency bands.

The log-periodogram distribution for each series is modeled as a mixture of Gaussian distributions with frequency-dependent weights and mean functions. The implied model for the log-spectral density is a mixture of linear mean functions with frequency-dependent weights. The mixture weights are built through successive differences of a logit-normal distribution function with frequency-dependent parameters. Building from the construction for a single spectral density, we develop a hierarchical extension for multiple time series. Specifically, we set the mean functions to be common to all spectral densities and make the weights specific to the time series through the parameters of the logit-normal distribution. In addition to accommodating flexible spectral density shapes, a practically important feature of the proposed formulation is that it allows for ready posterior simulation through a Gibbs sampler with closed form full conditional distributions for all model parameters. The modeling approach is illustrated with simulated datasets and used for spectral analysis of multichannel electroencephalographic recordings, which provides a key motivating application for the proposed methodology.

In this study, we employed traditional electrophysiological and advanced time-frequency methods, combined with principal component analyses, to extract neural activity related to error monitoring and tested their relations to academic achievement in cognitively able kindergarteners with autism spectrum disorder. In total, 35 cognitively able kindergarteners with autism spectrum disorder completed academic assessments and the child-friendly "Zoo Game" Go/No-go task at school entry. The Go/No-go task successfully elicited an error-related negativity and error positivity in children with autism spectrum disorder as young as 5 years at fronto-central and posterior electrode sites, respectively. We also observed increased response-related theta power during errors relative to correct trials at fronto-central sites. Both larger error positivity and theta power significantly predicted concurrent academic achievement after controlling for behavioral performance on the Zoo Game and intelligence quotient. These results suggest that the use of time-frequency electroencephalography analyses, combined with traditional event-related potential measures, may provide new opportunities to investigate neurobiological mechanisms of executive function and academic achievement in young children with autism spectrum disorder.

Frontal and parietal alpha oscillations reflect attentional modulation of cross-modal matching	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EYE FIELDS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BAND ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; STIMULATION; CORTEX; ENHANCEMENT; PERFORMANCE	Multisensory perception is shaped by both attentional selection of relevant sensory inputs and exploitation of stimulus-driven factors that promote cross-modal binding. Underlying mechanisms of both top-down and bottom-up modulations have been linked to changes in alpha/gamma dynamics in primary sensory cortices and temporoparietal cortex. Accordingly, it has been proposed that alpha oscillations provide pulsed inhibition for gamma activity and thereby dynamically route cortical information flow. In this study, we employed a recently introduced multisensory paradigm incorporating both bottom-up and top-down aspects of cross-modal attention in an EEG study. The same trimodal stimuli were presented in two distinct attentional conditions, focused on visual-tactile or audio-visual components, for which cross-modal congruence of amplitude changes had to be evaluated. Neither top-down nor bottom-up cross-modal attention modulated alpha or gamma power in primary sensory cortices. Instead, we found alpha band effects in bilateral frontal and right parietal cortex. We propose that frontal alpha oscillations reflect the origin of top-down control regulating perceptual gains and that modulations of parietal alpha oscillations relates to intersensory re-orienting. Taken together, we suggest that the idea of selective cortical routing via alpha oscillations can be extended from sensory cortices to the frontoparietal attention network.

Among many physiological parameters, the brain signals provide direct information about the cognitive load. In this paper, for a silent reading scenario, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal and papillary response are used to address both global and localized analysis of a content. The global analysis is done using the EEG data collected from a target group of readers on whether the overall content is easy or difficult to understand. The entropy analysis of left temporal brain signals is found to grossly differentiate the texts. Detailed analysis is done using the pupil dilation to localize certain difficult segments in the content. The oscillatory behavior of the pupil dilation reveals detailed characteristics of the effect of the texts on each individual. To carry out the experiment, two types (easy and difficult) of textual contents are considered which are calibrated using standard natural language processing parameters. The proposed work presents a methodology for global and detailed analysis of a content which helps in preparing the reading materials. Furthermore, the methodology provides the insights into the reading characteristics of the individuals.

Currently, neurobiology studies have revealed the partially synchronous oscillating phenomenon within brain, which needs to be analyzed from oscillatory synchronization. This combination of oscillations and synchronism is worthy of further exploration to achieve inspiring learning of the emotion recognition models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of valence and arousal-based emotion recognition using EEG data. First, we construct the emotional oscillatory brain network (EOBN) inspired by the partially synchronous oscillating phenomenon for emotional valence and arousal. And then, a coefficient of variation and Welch's t-test based feature selection method is used to identify the core pattern (cEOBN) within EOBN for different emotional dimensions. Finally, an emotional recognition model (ERM) is built by combining cEOBN-inspired information obtained in the above process and different classifiers. The proposed approach can combine oscillation and synchronization characteristics of multi-channel EEG signals for recognizing different emotional states under the valence and arousal dimensions. The cEOBN-based inspired information can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data. The experimental results show that the previous method can be used to detect affective state at a reasonable level of accuracy.

Differential frontal alpha oscillations and mechanisms underlying loss of consciousness: a comparison between slow and fast propofol infusion rates	ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						alpha band; EEG; loss of consciousness; propofol; speed of induction	GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; STATES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; PERFORMANCE; RETURN; RHYTHM; SLEEP; INDEX	Mechanisms underlying loss of consciousness following propofol administration remain incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to compare frontal lobe electroencephalography activity and brainstem reflexes during intravenous induction of general anaesthesia, in patients receiving a typical bolus dose (fast infusion) of propofol compared with a slower infusion rate. We sought to determine whether brainstem suppression ('bottom-up') predominates over loss of cortical function ('top-down'). Sixteen ASA physical status-1 patients were randomly assigned to either a fast or slow propofol infusion group. Loss of consciousness and brainstem reflexes were assessed every 30 s by a neurologist blinded to treatment allocation. We performed a multitaper spectral analysis of all electroencephalography data obtained from each participant. Brainstem reflexes were present in all eight patients in the slow infusion group, while being absent in all patients in the fast infusion group, at the moment of loss of consciousness (p = 0.010). An increase in alpha band power was observed before loss of consciousness only in participants allocated to the slow infusion group. Alpha band power emerged several minutes after the loss of consciousness in participants allocated to the fast infusion group. Our results show a predominance of 'bottom-up' mechanisms during fast infusion rates and 'top-down' mechanisms during slow infusion rates. The underlying mechanisms by which propofol induces loss of consciousness are potentially influenced by the speed of infusion.

Sparse Multi-task Inverse Covariance Estimation for Connectivity Analysis in EEG Source Space	2019 9TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE/EMBS International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAR 20-23, 2019	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMBS		Inverse Covariance Estimation; Sleeping alpha-Burst; EEG Source Imaging; Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)		Understanding how different brain areas interact to generate complex behavior is a primary goal of neuroscience research. One approach, functional connectivity analysis, aims to characterize the connectivity patterns within brain networks. In this paper, we address the problem of discriminative connectivity, i.e. determining the differences in network structure under different experimental conditions. We introduce a novel model called Sparse Multi-task Inverse Covariance Estimation (SMICE) which is capable of estimating a common connectivity network as well as discriminative networks across different tasks. We apply the method to EEG signals after solving the inverse problem of source localization, yielding networks defined on the cortical surface. We propose an efficient algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve SMICE.

New method: Natural frequency components were sought using a data-driven frequency Principal Components Analysis (f-PCA) approach, optimised to reduce between-condition and between-group misallocation of variance. Frequency component correspondence was screened using the Congruence Coefficient and topographic correlations for potential matches on Condition and/or Group. The amplitudes of corresponding natural components were then explored as a function of these independent variables. Results: Separate f-PCAs with Young and Older adults' EC and EO data each yielded between six and nine components that peaked across the traditional delta to beta band ranges. Across these, two components were matched on Group and Condition, while a further six were matched on Condition (within-groups), and four on Group (within-conditions). Comparison with Existing Methods: Multiple frequency components were found within the traditional bands, and provided a wider perspective in terms of additional natural component details. In addition to novel insights, the well-documented age-related spectral reductions were seen in the common delta component, and in one EC (but no EO) alpha component. Conclusions: This combination of optimised f-PCA approach and component screening procedure has wide potential in the EEG field beyond the ageing topic explored here, being applicable across an extensive range of studies using EEG oscillations to explore aspects of cognitive processing and individual differences.

The participant was not trained in reading the prayer to herself or other people. EEG examination was performed by Nihon Kohden Corporation, EEG-1200-K Neurofax apparatus, in the monopolar longitudinal montage in the system of 10/20 electrodes aimed at determining the peak frequency value of each exploratory site. The method of result analysis was based on connecting cerebral regions into networks of 3 or more members according to identical peak frequency value, which was observed within subgroups of theta and beta frequencies and analyzed through a proximity index and continuity and discontinuity of activation during the observed period. Out of the definite observation sample of 3 s from each subperiods (beginning, middle and end), a window of 2 s was moving from the beginning till end of the period with 200-ms time lag. This resulted in six subsamples for each electrode and for each experimental situation (resting state, situation of prayer). Stable and unstable activity of the regions was assessed within subgroups via cartographic formulas equivalent to the states which subgroups of theta and beta imply in psychophysiological sense. The results indicated that through participant's inner dialogue-monologue there are elements of both knowledge and belief, and that this phenomenon is possible considering insufficiently specific circumstances of the experiment and the participant herself, such as her relatively young age and insufficient practice of praying. The paper discusses the types of connections between regions which imply knowledge and those related to belief according to our understanding and regarding findings in literature.

Neural processing operations of the human brain vary according to the difficulty level of the problem and the intelligence level of individuals. In this study, we used a bimodal system consisting of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate these inter-individual differences. A continuous wave 32-channel fNIRS from OxyMonfNIRS device (Artinis) and 19-channel EEG from (g.tec's company) were utilized to study the oxygenation procedure as well as the electrical activity of the brain when doing the problems of Raven's Progressive Matrix (RPM) intelligence test. We used this information to estimate the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the individual without performing a complete logical-mathematical intelligence test in a long-time period and examining the answers of people to the questions. After EEG preprocessing, different features including Higuchi's fractal dimension, Shannon entropy values from wavelet transform coefficients, and average power of frequency sub-bands were extracted. Clean fNIRS signals were also used to compute features such as slope, mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness, and peak. Then dimension reduction algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to select an effective feature set from fNIRS and EEG in order to improve the IQ estimation process. We utilized two regression methods, i.e., Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to extract optimum models for the IQ determination. The best regression models based on fNIRS-EEG and fNIRS presented 3.093% and 3.690% relative error for 11 subjects, respectively.

Cortical dynamics during preparation and execution of reactive balance responses with distinct postural demands	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Balance; Posture; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Independent component analysis (ICA); Mobile brain/body imaging (MOBI)	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; UNEXPECTED EVENTS; MUSCLE SYNERGIES; MOTOR CONTROL; LEFT-HANDERS; ALPHA-BAND; EEG ALPHA; MOVEMENT	The contributions of the cerebral cortex to human balance control are clearly demonstrated by the profound impact of cortical lesions on the ability to maintain standing balance. The cerebral cortex is thought to regulate subcortical postural centers to maintain upright balance and posture under varying environmental conditions and task demands. However, the cortical mechanisms that support standing balance remain elusive. Here, we present an EEG-based analysis of cortical oscillatory dynamics during the preparation and execution of balance responses with distinct postural demands. In our experiment, participants responded to backward movements of the support surface either with one forward step or by keeping their feet in place. To challenge the postural control system, we applied participant-specific high accelerations of the support surface such that the postural demand was low for stepping responses and high for feet-in-place responses. We expected that postural demand modulated the power of intrinsic cortical oscillations. Independent component analysis and time-frequency domain statistics revealed stronger suppression of alpha (9-13 Hz) and low-gamma (31-34 Hz) rhythms in the supplementary motor area (SMA) when preparing for feet in -place responses (i.e., high postural demand). Irrespective of the response condition, support-surface movements elicited broadband (3-17 Hz) power increase in the SMA and enhancement of the theta (3-7 Hz) rhythm in the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral sensorimotor cortices (Ml/S1). Although the execution of reactive responses resulted in largely similar cortical dynamics, comparison between the bilateral Ml/S1 showed that stepping responses corresponded with stronger suppression of the beta (13-17 Hz) rhythm in the Ml/S1 contralateral to the support leg. Comparison between response conditions showed that feet-in-place responses corresponded with stronger enhancement of the theta (3-7 Hz) rhythm in the PFC. Our results provide novel insights into the cortical dynamics of SMA, PFC, and Ml/S1 during the control of human balance.

In particular, alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity, linked to attention in general, is related to coordination dynamics and empathy traits. Researchers have also identified an association between each individual's attentiveness to their co-actor and the relative similarity in the co-actors' roles, influencing their behavioral synchronization patterns. We employed music ensemble performance to evaluate patterns of behavioral and neural activity when roles between co-performers are systematically varied with complete counterbalancing. Specifically, we designed a piano duet task, with three types of co-actor dissimilarity, or asymmetry: (1) musical role (starting vs. joining), (2) musical task similarity (similar vs. dissimilar melodic parts), and (3) performer animacy (human-to-human vs. human-to-non-adaptive computer). We examined how the experience of these asymmetries in four initial musical phrases, alternatingly played by the co-performers, influenced the pianists' performance of a subsequent unison phrase. Electroencephalography was recorded simultaneously from both performers while playing keyboards. We evaluated note-onset timing and alpha modulation around the unison phrase. We also investigated whether each individual's self-reported empathy was related to behavioral and neural activity. Our findings revealed closer behavioral synchronization when pianists played with a human vs. computer partner, likely because the computer was non-adaptive. When performers played with a human partner, or a joining performer played with a computer partner, having a similar vs. dissimilar musical part did not have a significant effect on their alpha modulation immediately prior to unison. However, when starting performers played with a computer partner with a dissimilar vs. similar part there was significantly greater alpha synchronization. In other words, starting players attended less to the computer partner playing a similar accompaniment, operating in a solo-like mode. Moreover, this alpha difference based on melodic similarity was related to a difference in note-onset adaptivity, which was in turn correlated with performer trait empathy. Collectively our results extend previous findings by showing that musical ensemble performance gives rise to a socialized context whose lasting effects encompass attentiveness, perceptual-motor coordination, and empathy.

Such episodes appear to be predictive of further episodes of inpatient delirium and associated adverse outcomes. Frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) findings of suppression patterns and low proprietary index values have been associated with postoperative delirium and poor outcomes. However, the efficacy of titrating anaesthesia to proprietary index targets for preventing delirium remains contentious. We aim to assess the efficacy of two strategies which we hypothesise could prevent post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium by maximising the alpha oscillation observed in frontal EEG channels during the maintenance and emergence phases of anaesthesia.MethodsThis is a 2 x 2 factorial, double-blind, stratified, randomised control trial of 600 patients. Eligible patients are those aged 60years or over who are undergoing non-cardiac, non-intracranial, volatile-based anaesthesia of expected duration of more than 2 h. Patients will be stratified by pre-operative cognitive status, surgery type and site. For the maintenance phase of anaesthesia, patients will be randomised (1:1) to an alpha power-maximisation anaesthesia titration strategy versus standard care avoiding suppression patterns in the EEG. For the emergence phase of anaesthesia, patients will be randomised (1:1) to early cessation of volatile anaesthesia and emergence from an intravenous infusion of propofol versus standard emergence from volatile anaesthesia only. The primary study outcomes are the power of the frontal alpha oscillation during the maintenance and emergence phases of anaesthesia. Our main clinical outcome of interest is PACU delirium.DiscussionThis is a largely exploratory study; the extent to which EEG signatures can be modified by titration of pharmacological agents is not known. The underlying concept is maximisation of anaesthetic efficacy by individualised drug titration to a clearly defined EEG feature. The interventions are already clinically used strategies in anaesthetic practice, but have not been formally evaluated. The addition of propofol during the emergence phase of volatile-based general anaesthesia is known to reduce emergence delirium in children; however, the efficacy of this strategy in older patients is not known.Trial registrationAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, ID: 12617001354370.

Filtering of neurophysiologic signals	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY: BASIS AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS	Handbook of Clinical Neurology		English	Article; Book Chapter							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MARKER; SHIFTS; EEG	Clinical neurophysiologic signals cover a broad range of frequencies. Filters help to emphasize waveforms that are of clinical or research interest and to mold their frequency characteristics to suit the purpose of the investigation. Some frequency content is obvious and well known, such as the alpha rhythm (8-11Hz) or spindles (12-14Hz) in the EEG. Other frequencies are not initially discriminable from background activity and require filtering in order to examine them, such as high-frequency oscillations (80-500Hz) in EEG and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (100-3000Hz). Often used to mitigate the effects of background noise or artifact, filters can be used specifically to attenuate unwanted frequencies, such as mains interference (50 or 60Hz) and electrode offset potential (<0.1Hz). For digital instrumentation, an antialiasing filter (below Nyquist) is always needed prior to sampling by the analog-to-digital converter. Once the signals are in the digital realm, sophisticated filtering operations can be carried out post hoc; but in order not to be misled, the neurophysiologist must always bear in mind the effect of filtering on the physiological waveform.

J	Mezzina, G; De Venuto, D				Mezzina, Giovanni; De Venuto, Daniela			Time-Frequency Linearization of Reactive Cortical Responses for the Early Detection of Balance Losses	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							FALL DETECTION; NEURAL-CONTROL; SENSOR; PERTURBATION; STABILITY; DEVICES	Aiming at finding a fast and accurate preimpact fall detection (PIFD) strategy, this paper proposes a novel methodology that precociously discriminates the occurrence of unexpected loss of balance from the steady walking, by analyzing the subject's cortical signal modifications (at the scalp level) in the time-frequency domain. In this study, the subjects were asked to walk at their preferred speed on the treadmill platform programmed to provide unexpected bilateral slippages. The proposed PIFD method exploits synchronously recorded electromyographic (EMG: 2 channels from the same lower limb muscle bundle, bilaterally) and electro-encephalographic (EEG: 13 channels from motor, sensory-motor and parietal cortex areas) signals. To validate the method offline, also, the lower limb kinematics has been reconstructed via a motion capture system (23 reflective markers and 8 fixed cameras). During the PIFD system functioning, the EMG signals from the lateral gastrocnemii are first translated in a binary waveform and then used to trigger the EEG analysis. Once enabled via EMG (every gait cycle), the EEG computation branch extracts and linearizes the rate of variation in the EEG power spectrum density (PSD) for five bands of interests: theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta I, beta II, beta III rhythms (13-15 Hz, 16-20 Hz, and 21-28 Hz). The slope of the linearized trend identifies, in this context, the cortical responsiveness parameter. Experimental results from six subjects revealed that the proposed system can distinguish the loss of balance with an overall accuracy of similar to 96% (average value between sensitivity and specificity). The discrimination process requests, on average, 370.6 ms. This value could be considered suitable for the implementation of countermeasures aimed at restoring the balance of the subject.

J	Zhao, HY; Jiang, J; Zhou, LS; Jiang, CM				Zhao Huaiyang; Jiang Jun; Zhou Linshu; Jiang Cunmei			Role of the human mirror system in automatic processing of musical emotion: Evidence from EEG	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						chord emotion; mu rhythm; alpha frequency band; beta frequency band; human mirror system	MU RHYTHM SUPPRESSION; SPREADING ACTIVATION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURON SYSTEM; BAND ACTIVITY; IMITATION; EMPATHY; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION	The human mirror system (HMS) consists of a core parietofrontal network of regions in the inferior parietal lobule and inferior frontal gyrus/premotor cortex, which can be activated by action observation and execution. Mu rhythm suppression is considered an electrophysiological indicator of the HMS given their similarity in reaction to action observation and execution. Mu rhythm comprises alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) frequency bands, which are typically measured at the power change of midline electrode sites. The beta frequency band is related to the movement preparation, whereas the alpha frequency band is suppressed during the execution of movement. Consistent with the role of the HMS in social cognition, such as emotion understanding, theory of mind, and empathy, mu rhythm suppression is modulated by the processing of social information, such as facial emotional information. Emotion is an important component of social communication. In addition to the emotional facial expression, music is an effective means of expressing emotions through imitation, and for most of people, the main purpose of listening to music is to process musical emotions. However, information on whether mu rhythm suppression is involved in the processing of musical emotions is limited. The aims of the present study were to examine whether mu rhythm suppression is modulated by the processing of musical emotions using Electroencephalogram (EEG). Given that the HMS is involved in the automatic processing of musical emotions, the present study focused on this point by using a cross-modal affective priming paradigm with an SOA of 200 ms. Fifteen musically untrained normal individuals participated in the experiment. Target faces with pleasant and unpleasant emotions were primed by affectively congruous or incongruous chords. Forty-eight congruous and 48 incongruous trials were included in the present study. The participants were instructed to decide as fast and accurately as possible whether the emotion of the face was pleasant or unpleasant. Behavioral results showed that the affectively congruous target faces (M = 575.17 ms, SD = 75.34) were judged faster than affectively incongruous target faces (M = 605.38 ms, SD = 87.74). However, no difference was observed in the percentages of correct responses to the affectively congruous (M = 98%, SD = 2.4%) and incongruous (M = 97%, SD = 2.5%) target faces. Electrophysiological results revealed that the beta frequency band (18-24 Hz) oscillations were less strong for incongruous than for congruous target faces at a time window of 500-650 ms after the onset of chords. A significant desynchronization of the a frequency band was observed for both the congruous and incongruous target stimuli at a time window of 300-450 ms after the onset of chords. Moreover, source analysis exhibited the central-frontal area responsible for automatic musical emotion processing, where the HMS is located. Overall, the present study showed that mu rhythm suppression was involved in the automatic processing of chord emotions, as shown in the alpha and beta frequency bands. The results extend the role of the mu rhythm and provide electrophysiological support for the role of the HMS in the processing of musical emotions.

The effects of distractor set-size on neural tracking of attended speech	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Speech; Attention; Distraction; Entrainment; EEG; Oscillations; Cocktail party	COCKTAIL-PARTY; ENERGETIC MASKING; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FUNDAMENTAL-FREQUENCY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL SEPARATION; CORTICAL TRACKING; UNATTENDED SPEECH; PHASE PATTERNS; OSCILLATIONS	Attention is crucial to speech comprehension in real-world, noisy environments. Selective phase-tracking between low-frequency brain dynamics and the envelope of target speech is a proposed mechanism to reject competing distractors. Studies have supported this theory in the case of a single distractor, but have not considered how tracking is systematically affected by varying distractor set sizes. We recorded electro-encephalography (EEG) during selective listening to both natural and vocoded speech as distractor set-size varied from two to six voices. Increasing set-size reduced performance and attenuated EEG tracking of target speech. Further, we found that intrusions of distractor speech into perception were not accompanied by sustained tracking of the distractor stream. Our results support the theory that tracking of speech dynamics is a mechanism for selective attention, and that the mechanism of distraction is not simple stimulus-driven capture of sustained entrainment of auditory mechanisms by the acoustics of distracting speech.

They reflect local field potential activity generated by the laminar arrangement of cell-type specific microcircuits interacting brain-wide under the influence of neuromodulators, endogenous processes and cognitive demands. Under neuropathological conditions, the spatiotemporal structure of physiological brain oscillations is disrupted as recorded by electroencephalography and event-relate potentials. Such rhythmopathies can be used to track microcircuit alterations leading not only to transient pathological activities such as interictal discharges and seizures but also to a range of cognitive co-morbidities. Here we review how basic oscillatory modes induced in human brain slices prepared after surgical treatment can help us to understand basic aspects of brain function and dysfunction. We propose to overcome the traditional view of examining human brain slices merely as generators of epileptiform activities and to integrate them in a more physiologically-oriented oscillatory framework to better understand mechanisms of the diseased human brain.

In this study, 15 participants were randomly assigned to honesty or deception groups and were instructed to tell the truth or lie when facing certain stimuli. Meanwhile, event-related potential signals were recorded using a 64-channel electroencephalography cap. Event-related coherence was computed separately in four frequency bands (delta (1-3.5Hz), theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), and beta (14-30 HZ)) for the long-range intrahemispheric electrode pairs (F3P3, F4P4, F3T7, F4T8, F3O1, and F4O2). The results indicated that deceptive responses elicited greater connectivities in the frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks than in the frontooccipital network. Furthermore, the deception group displayed lower values of coherence in the frontoparietal electrode pairs in the alpha and beta bands than the honesty group. In particular, increased coherence in the delta and theta bands on specific left frontoparietal electrode pairs was observed. Additionally, the deception group exhibited higher values of coherence in the delta band and lower values of coherence in the beta band on the frontotemporal electrode pairs than did the honesty group. These data indicated that the active cognitive processes during deception include changes in ensemble activities between the frontal and parietal/temporal regions.

Methods We reviewed 184 patients who underwent bilateral SEEG implantation (2009-2015). Noninvasive and invasive evaluation findings were collected. Outcomes of interest included subsequent resection and seizure freedom. Statistical analyses employed multivariable logistic regression and proportional hazard modeling. Preoperative and postoperative seizure frequency, severity, and quality of life scales were also compared. Results Following bilateral SEEG implantation, 106 of 184 patients (58%) underwent resection. Single seizure type (P = 0.007), a family history of epilepsy (P = 0.003), 10 or more seizures per month (P = 0.004), lower number of electrodes (P = 0.02), or sentinel electrode placement (P = 0.04) was predictive of undergoing a resection, as were lack of nonlocalized (P < 0.0001) or bilateral (P < 0.0001) ictal-onset zones on SEEG. Twenty-six of 81 patients (32% with follow-up greater than 1 year) remained seizure-free. Predictors of seizure freedom were single seizure type (P = 0.01), short epilepsy duration (P = 0.008), use of 2 or fewer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at the time of surgery (P = 0.0006), primary localization hypothesis involving the frontal lobe (P = 0.002), sentinel electrode placement only (P = 0.02), and lack of overlap between ictal-onset zone and eloquent cortex (P = 0.04), along with epilepsy substrate histopathology (P = 0.007). Complete resection of a suspected focal cortical dysplasia showed a trend to increased likelihood of seizure freedom (P = 0.09). The 44 of 55 patients (80%) who underwent resection and experienced seizure recurrence had >50% seizure reduction, as opposed to 26 of 45 patients (58%) who continued medical therapy alone (P = 0.003). Seventy-two percent of patients had a clinically meaningful quality of life improvement (>10% decrease in the Quality of Life in Epilepsy [QOLIE-10] score) at 1 year. Significance A strong preimplantation hypothesis of a suspected unifocal epilepsy increases the odds of resection and seizure freedom. We discuss a tailored approach, taking into account localization hypothesis and suspected epilepsy etiology in guiding implantation and subsequent surgical strategy.

While the hippocampus is deemed central to this process, detailed knowledge of which oscillatory rhythms interact in the sleeping human hippocampus is lacking. Combining intracranial hippocampal and non-invasive electroencephalography from twelve neurosurgical patients, we characterized spectral power and coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Hippocampal coupling was extensive, with the majority of channels expressing spectral interactions. NREM consistently showed delta-ripple coupling, but ripples were also modulated by slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles. SO-delta and SO-theta coupling, as well as interactions between delta/theta and spindle/beta frequencies also occurred. During REM, limited interactions between delta/theta and beta frequencies emerged. Moreover, oscillatory organization differed substantially between i) hippocampus and scalp, ii) sites along the anterior-posterior hippocampal axis, and iii) individuals. Overall, these results extend and refine our understanding of hippocampal sleep oscillations.

Shift in lateralization during illusory self-motion: EEG responses to visual flicker at 10 Hz and frequency-specific modulation by tACS	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; electroencephalogram; optic flow; sawtooth; steady state visually evoked potentials; transcranial alternating current stimulation; vection	TRANSCRANIAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ORIENTATION; ENTRAINMENT; DOMINANCE; SYSTEM; FIELDS; CORTEX; SPACE	Self-motion perception is a key aspect of higher vestibular processing, suggested to rely upon hemispheric lateralization and alpha-band oscillations. The first aim of this study was to test for any lateralization in the EEG alpha band during the illusory sense of self-movement (vection) induced by large optic flow stimuli. Visual stimuli flickered at alpha frequency (approx. 10 Hz) in order to produce steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs), a robust EEG measure which allows probing the frequency-specific response of the cortex. The first main result was that differential lateralization of the alpha SSVEP response was found during vection compared with a matched random motion control condition, supporting the idea of lateralization of visual-vestibular function. Additionally, this effect was frequency-specific, not evident with lower frequency SSVEPs. The second aim of this study was to test for a causal role of the right hemisphere in producing this lateralization effect and to explore the possibility of selectively modulating the SSVEP response. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) was applied over the right hemisphere simultaneously with SSVEP recording, using a novel artefact removal strategy for combined tACS-EEG. The second main result was that tACS enhanced SSVEP amplitudes, and the effect of tACS was not confined to the right hemisphere. Subsequent control experiments showed the effect of tACS requires the flicker frequency and tACS frequency to be closely matched and tACS to be of sufficient intensity. Combined tACS-SSVEPs are a promising method for future investigation into the role of neural oscillations and for optimizing tACS.	[Dowsett, James; Dieterich, Marianne; Taylor, Paul C.

This paper constructs an automatic seizure detection system, which combines the predicting result of multi-domain feature with the predicting result of spike rate feature to detect the occurrence of epileptic seizures. After segmenting EEG data into 5 s with 80% overlap epochs, the paper extracts time domain features, frequency domain features and hurst exponents (HE) from each epoch and these features are reduced by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to be input parameters of the random forest (RF) classifier, which provides classification of the EEG epochs concerning the existence of seizures. In parallel, the paper extracts spikes from EEG data with morphological filter and calculates the spike rate to determine whether there is seizure. Then the results obtained by these two methods are merged as the final detection result. The paper shows that the accuracy (AC), sensitivity (SE), specicity (SP) and the false positive ratio based on event (FPRE) obtained by hybrid method are 98.94%, 76.60%, 98.99% and 2.43 times/h, respectively. Finally, the paper applies the seizure detection method to do seizure warning and recording to help the family member to take care of the patients and the doctor to adjust the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

Simulating human sleep spindle MEG and EEG from ion channel and circuit level dynamics	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						MEG; EEG; Forward model; Sleep; Spindle; Thalamus; Cortex; Human	SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MULTIELECTRODE DATA; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; PITFALLS; MODEL; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; INFEASIBILITY; CANCELLATION	Background: Although they form a unitary phenomenon, the relationship between extracranial M/EEG and transmembrane ion flows is understood only as a general principle rather than as a well-articulated and quantified causal chain. Method: We present an integrated multiscale model, consisting of a neural simulation of thalamus and cortex during stage N2 sleep and a biophysical model projecting cortical current densities to M/EEG fields. Sleep spindles were generated through the interactions of local and distant network connections and intrinsic currents within thalamocortical circuits. 32,652 cortical neurons were mapped onto the cortical surface reconstructed from subjects' MRI, interconnected based on geodesic distances, and scaled-up to current dipole densities based on laminar recordings in humans. MRIs were used to generate a quasi-static electromagnetic model enabling simulated cortical activity to be projected to the M/EEG sensors. Results: The simulated M/EEG spindles were similar in amplitude and topography to empirical examples in the same subjects. Simulated spindles with more core-dominant activity were more MEG weighted. Comparison with existing methods: Previous models lacked either spindle-generating thalamic neural dynamics or whole head biophysical modeling; the framework presented here is the first to simultaneously capture these disparate scales. Conclusions: This multiscale model provides a platform for the principled quantitative integration of existing information relevant to the generation of sleep spindles, and allows the implications of future findings to be explored. It provides a proof of principle for a methodological framework allowing large-scale integrative brain oscillations to be understood in terms of their underlying channels and synapses.	[Rosen, B.

Characterizing the role of the structural connectome in seizure dynamics	BRAIN			English	Article						epilepsy; intracranial EEG; high-angular resolution diffusion imaging; structural connectivity; functional connectivity	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; SCALE BRAIN NETWORKS; RESTING-STATE; FOCAL EPILEPSY; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; COGNITIVE DECLINE; EEG; SURGERY; PATTERNS	How does the human brain's structural scaffold give rise to its intricate functional dynamics? This is a central question in translational neuroscience that is particularly relevant to epilepsy, a disorder affecting over 50 million subjects worldwide. Treatment for medication-resistant focal epilepsy is often structural-through surgery or laser ablation-but structural targets, particularly in patients without clear lesions, are largely based on functional mapping via intracranial EEG. Unfortunately, the relationship between structural and functional connectivity in the seizing brain is poorly understood. In this study, we quantify structure-function coupling, specifically between white matter connections and intracranial EEG, across pre-ictal and ictal periods in 45 seizures from nine patients with unilateral drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We use high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) tractography to construct structural connectivity networks and correlate these networks with time-varying broadband and frequency-specific functional networks derived from coregistered intracranial EEG. Across all frequency bands, we find significant increases in structure-function coupling from pre-ictal to ictal periods. We demonstrate that short-range structural connections are primarily responsible for this increase in coupling. Finally, we find that spatiotemporal patterns of structure-function coupling are highly stereotyped for each patient. These results suggest that seizures harness the underlying structural connectome as they propagate. Mapping the relationship between structural and functional connectivity in epilepsy may inform new therapies to halt seizure spread, and pave the way for targeted patient-specific interventions.

Changes due to rTMS stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were investigated considering separately responders and non-responders to therapy in each of both groups. The aim of the research is to determine whether non-responders differ from responders suffered from both diseases, as well as if any change occurred due to rTMS across consecutive rTMS sessions. Methods: The graph-theory-based connectivity analysis of non-linearity measure of phase interdependencies-Phase Locking Value (PLV)-was examined from EEG data. The approximately 15-min EEG recordings from each of participants were recorded before and after 1st, 10th, and 20th session, respectively. PLV calculated from data was analyzed using principal graph theory indices (strength and degree) within five physiological frequency bands and in individual channels separately. The impact of rTMS on the EEG connectivity in every group of patients evaluated by PLV was assessed. Results: Each of four groups reacted differently to rTMS treatment. The strength and degree of PLV increased in gamma band in both groups of responders. Moreover, an increase of indices in beta band for BP-responders was observed. While, in MDD-non-responders the indices decreased in gamma band and increased in beta band. Moreover, the index strength was lower in alpha band for BP-non-responders. The rTMS stimulation caused topographically specific changes, i.e., the increase of the activity in the left DLPFC as well as in other brain regions such as right parieto-occipital areas. Conclusions: The analysis of PLV allowed for evaluation of the rTMS impact on the EEG activity in each group of patients. The changes of PLV under stimulation might be a good indicator of response to depression treatment permitting to improve the effectiveness of therapy.

Evidence for distinct oscillatory signatures of memory formation	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; FIELD POTENTIAL POWER; EPISODIC MEMORY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL; THETA; BETA; EEG	Decreases in low-frequency power (2-30 Hz) alongside high-frequency power increases (>40 Hz) have been demonstrated to predict successful memory formation. Parsimoniously, this change in the frequency spectrum can be explained by one factor, a change in the tilt of the power spectrum (from steep to flat) indicating engaged brain regions. A competing view is that the change in the power spectrum contains several distinct brain oscillatory fingerprints, each serving different computations. Here, we contrast these two theories in a parallel magnetoencephalography (MEG)-intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) study in which healthy participants and epilepsy patients, respectively, studied either familiar verbal material or unfamiliar faces. We investigated whether modulations in specific frequency bands can be dissociated in time and space and by experimental manipulation. Both MEG and iEEG data show that decreases in alpha/beta power specifically predicted the encoding of words but not faces, whereas increases in gamma power and decreases in theta power predicted memory formation irrespective of material. Critically, these different oscillatory signatures of memory encoding were evident in different brain regions. Moreover, high-frequency gamma power increases occurred significantly earlier compared to low-frequency theta power decreases. These results show that simple spectral tilt cannot explain common oscillatory changes and demonstrate that brain oscillations in different frequency bands serve different functions for memory encoding.

To optimize the stimulatory effect of NMES, the parameters of NMES, including stimulation mode, location, current intensity, and duration, among others have been investigated; however, these studies mainly focused on the effects of changing parameters in the current plateau stage of the NMES cycle, while the impacts on other stages, such as the current rising stage, have yet to be investigated. In this article, we studied the electroencephalograph (EEG) effects during NMES, with different rates of current change in the rising stage, and stable current intensity in the plateau stage. EEG signals (64-channel) were collected from 28 healthy subjects, who were administered with high, medium, or low current change rate (CCR) NMES through a right-hand wrist extensor. Time-frequency analysis and brain source analysis, using the LORETA method, were used to investigate neural activity in sensorimotor cortical areas. The strengths of cortical activity induced by different CCR conditions were compared. NMES with a high CCR activated the sensorimotor cortex, despite the NMES current intensity in the plateau stage lower than the motor threshold. Reduction of the Alpha 2 band (10-13 Hz) event related spectral power (ERSP) during NMES stimulation was significantly enhanced by increasing CCR (p < 0.05). LORETA-based source analysis demonstrated that, in addition to typical sensory areas, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), sensorimotor areas including primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and somatosensory association cortex (SAC) were all activated by within threshold NMES. Furthermore, compared with the low CCR condition, cortical activity was significantly enhanced in the S1, M1, and PMC areas under high CCR conditions. This study shows CCR in the NMES rising stage can affect EEG responses in the sensorimotor cortex and suggests that CCR is an important parameter applicable to the optimization of NMES treatment.

The generation and propagation of the human alpha rhythm	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						alpha; oscillations; intracranial EEG; laminar; thalamocortical	OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; LAMINAR PROFILE; GAMMA; PHASE; EEG; CORTEX; INFORMATION; INHIBITION; MONKEY	The alpha rhythm is the longest-studied brain oscillation and has been theorized to play a key role in cognition. Still, its physiology is poorly understood. In this study, we used microelectrodes and macroelectrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in both visual and somatosensory cortex propagates from higher-order to lower-order areas. In posterior cortex, alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas toward the occipital pole, whereas alpha in somatosensory cortex propagates from associative regions toward primary cortex. Several analyses suggest that this cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback, which propagates from higher- to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.

Wavelet entropy (WE) and teager energy operator (TEO) are adopted to distinguish HFOs from normal electroencephalogram (EEG). Labeled data are used to initialize the clustering center of semi-supervised k-means algorithm, and unlabeled data are employed to obtain physiological and suspected pathological HFOs. For the suspected pathological HFOs, the mean shift algorithm is used for clustering, and the results are analyzed by the spectral center algorithm to locate SOZs. By comparing the EEG data of five patients with the results of the other three methods, it can be seen that the method proposed in this paper has good sensitivity and specificity, which is helpful for accurate localization before clinical epilepsy surgery.

In the case of medical and healthcare, extensive research has focused on the development of brain-computer interface systems, particularly those utilizing steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEPs). However, the conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis is associated with the low-frequency resolution because of the length of the analysis window, resulting in sidelobe artifacts. In this paper, we utilized the non-harmonic analysis (NHA), which does not depend on the length of the analysis window, to analyze the continuous changes in and determine the classification accuracy of SSVEPs. Moreover, our experiments utilized the gray-scale images, allowing for the presentation of the stimulus as a sinusoidal pattern and reducing the effect of frequency distortion associated with the refresh rate of the liquid-crystal display. Our findings indicated that NHA resulted in exponential improvements in time-frequency resolution when compared with the STFT analysis. As the accuracy of NHA was high, our results suggest that this method is effective for examining SSVEPs and changes in brain waves during experiments conducted using liquid-crystal displays.

Although the functions of these channels are relatively well characterized by single-cell studies, the contributions of common variation in these channels to neurophysiological biomarkers and symptoms of schizophrenia remain elusive. Here, using computational modeling, we show that a common biomarker of schizophrenia, namely, an increase in delta-oscillation power, may be a direct consequence of altered expression or kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels or calcium transporters. Our model of a circuit of layer V pyramidal cells highlights multiple types of schizophrenia-related variants that contribute to altered dynamics in the delta-frequency band. Moreover, our model predicts that the same membrane mechanisms that increase the layer V pyramidal cell network gain and response to delta-frequency oscillations may also cause a deficit in a single-cell correlate of the prepulse inhibition, which is a behavioral biomarker highly associated with schizophrenia.

This paper proposes to define an "EEG-Copeia" as an organized list of scientifically validated EEG markers, characterized by a specific association with an identified cognitive process, that define a psychophysiological unit of analysis useful for mental or brain disorder evaluation and treatment. A characteristic of EEG neurofeedback for mental and brain disorders is that it targets a EEG markers related to a supposed cognitive process, whereas conventional treatments target clinical manifestations. This could explain why EEG neurofeedback studies encounter difficulty in achieving reproducibility and validation. The present paper suggests that a first step to optimize EEG neurofeedback protocols and future research is to target a valid EEG marker. The specificity of the cognitive skills trained and learned during real time feedback of the EEG marker could be enhanced and both the reliability of neurofeedback training and the therapeutic impact optimized. However, several of the most well-known EEG markers have seldom been applied for neurofeedback. Moreover, we lack a reliable and valid EEG targets library for further RCT to evaluate the efficacy of neurofeedback in mental and brain disorders. With the present manuscript, our aim is to foster dialogues between cognitive neuroscience and EEG neurofeedback according to a psychophysiological perspective. The primary objective of this review was to identify the most robust EEG target. EEG markers linked with one or several clearly identified cognitive-related processes will be identified. The secondary objective was to organize these EEG markers and related cognitive process in a psychophysiological unit of analysis matrix inspired by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project.

Visual gamma has been successfully detected using concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings and linked to activity in the visual cortex using voxel-wise regression analysis. As gamma-band oscillations reflect predominantly feedforward projections between brain regions, its inclusion in functional connectivity analysis is highly recommended; however, very few studies have investigated this line of research. In the current study, we aimed to explore this gap by asking which fMRI brain network is related to gamma activity induced by the color discrimination task. Advanced denoising strategies and multitaper spectral decomposition were applied to EEG data to detect gamma oscillations, and group independent component analysis was performed on fMRI data to identify task-related neural networks. Despite using only trials without motor response (50% of the trials), the two neural measures were successfully coupled. One of the six task-related networks, the occipito-parietal network, exhibited significant trial-by-trial covariations with gamma oscillations. In addition to the expected extrastriate visual cortex, the network encompasses extensive brain activations in the precuneus, bilateral intraparietal, and anterior insular cortices. We argue that the visual cortex is the source of gamma, whereas the remaining brain regions exhibit feedforward and feedback connections related to this oscillatory activity. Our findings provide evidence for the electrophysiological basis of the connectivity revealed by BOLD signal and impart novel insights into the neural mechanism of color discrimination.

J	Tamburro, G; Stone, DB; Comani, S				Tamburro, Gabriella; Stone, David B.; Comani, Silvia			Automatic Removal of Cardiac Interference (ARCI): A New Approach for EEG Data	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						automatic artifact removal; cardiac artifact; cardiovascular artifact; EEG; ICA	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PHYSIOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS; FINGERPRINT METHOD; ECG ARTIFACTS; ICA; IDENTIFICATION; SIGNALS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; DECOMPOSITION	EEG recordings are generally affected by interference from physiological and nonphysiological sources which may obscure underlying brain activity and hinder effective EEG analysis. In particular, cardiac interference can be caused by the electrical activity of the heart and/or cardiovascular activity related to blood flow. Successful EEG application in sports science settings requires a method for artifact removal that is automatic and flexible enough to be applied in a variety of acquisition conditions without requiring simultaneous ECG recordings that could restrict movement. We developed an automatic method for classifying and removing both electrical cardiac and cardiovascular artifacts (ARCI) that does not require additional ECG recording. Our method employs independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate data independent components (ICs) and identifies the artifactual ICs by evaluating specific IC features in the time and frequency domains. We applied ARCI to EEG datasets with cued artifacts and acquired during an eyes-closed condition. Data were recorded using a standard EEG wet cap with either 128 or 64 electrodes and using a novel dry electrode cap with either 97 or 64 dry electrodes. All data were decomposed into different numbers of components to evaluate the effect of ICA decomposition level on effective cardiac artifact detection. ARCI performance was evaluated by comparing automatic ICs classifications with classifications performed by experienced investigators. Automatic and investigator classifications were highly consistent resulting in an overall accuracy greater than 99% in all datasets and decomposition levels, and an average sensitivity greater than 90%. Best results were attained when data were decomposed into a fewer number of components where the method achieved perfect sensitivity (100%). Performance was also evaluated by comparing automatic component classification with externally recorded ECG. Results showed that ICs automatically classified as artifactual were significantly correlated with ECG activity whereas the other ICs were not. We also assessed that the interference affecting EEG signals was reduced by more than 82% after automatic artifact removal. Overall, ARCI represents a significant step in the detection and removal of cardiac-related EEG artifacts and can be applied in a variety of acquisition settings making it ideal for sports science applications.

Altered EEG alpha and theta oscillations characterize apathy in Parkinson's disease during incentivized movement	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Apathy; Parkinson's disease; Motivation; EEG; Oscillations; Alpha; Theta	BASAL GANGLIA; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; DEMENTIA; REWARD; POWER; CONNECTIVITY; DEPRESSION	Apathy is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is difficult to quantify and poorly understood. Some studies have used incentivized motor tasks to assess apathy, as the condition is often associated with a reduction in motivated behavior. Normally event-related desynchronization, a reduction of power in specific frequency bands, is observed in the motor cortex during the peri-movement period. Also, alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) oscillations are sensitive to rewards that are closely related to motivational states however these oscillations have not been widely investigated in relation to apathy in PD. Using EEG recordings, we investigated the neural oscillatory characteristics of apathy in PD during an incentivized motor task with interleaved rest periods. Apathetic and non-apathetic PD subjects on dopaminergic medication and healthy control subjects were instructed to squeeze a hand grip device for a monetary reward proportional to the subject's grip force and the monetary value attributed to that trial. Apathetic PD subjects exhibited higher alpha and theta powers in the pre-trial baseline rest period compared to non-apathetic PD subjects and healthy subjects. Further, we found that both resting power and relative power in alpha and theta bands during incentivized movement predicted PD subjects' apathy scores. Our results suggest that apathetic PD patients may need to overcome greater baseline alpha and theta oscillatory activity in order to facilitate incentivized movement. Clinically, resting alpha and theta power as well as alpha and theta event-related desynchronization during movement may serve as potential neural markers for apathy severity in PD.

All the words in the sentence were manipulated for inter-word spacing (intact spaces vs. spaces replaced by a random letter) and parafoveal preview (identical preview vs. random letter string preview). We observed disruption for unspaced text and invalid preview conditions in both EMs and fixation-related potentials (FRPs). Unspaced and invalid preview conditions received longer reading times than spaced and valid preview conditions. In addition, the FRP data showed that unspaced previews disrupted reading in earlier time windows of analysis, compared to string preview conditions. Moreover, the effect of parafoveal preview was greater for spaced relative to unspaced conditions, in both EMs and FRPs. These findings replicate well-established preview effects, provide novel insight into the neural correlates of reading with and without inter-word spacing and suggest that spatial selection precedes lexical processing.

EEG is an increasingly method to detect brain function with high temporal resolution and low cost. How to analyze the synchronization phenomenon is the focus of cognitive neuroscience research based on EEG signals. Wavelet coherence is a classical method to evaluate EEG synchronization, but it is uncertain how to use. In this paper, this requires knowledge of the true relationship between signals, hence we compare different measures of functional connectivity on simulated data (unidirectional coupled Henon maps, and the auditory Stroop EEG), including wavelet cross-spectrum, wavelet correlation, wavelet coherence and FFT coherence. To determine whether synchrony is detected, surrogate data were generated and analyzed, and FFT coherence measures performed best on simulated data. Above all, the parameter optimization method of the wavelet cross-spectrum is proposed with many samples. It is found that the optimized wavelet coherence performed most reliably than FFT coherence.

J	Krull, EM; Sakata, S; Toyoizumi, T				Krull, Erin Munro; Sakata, Shuzo; Toyoizumi, Taro			Theta Oscillations Alternate With High Amplitude Neocortical Population Within Synchronized States	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						synchronized state; independent component analysis; theta oscillation; non-REM; slow oscillation; delta oscillation; cortical state	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; PARADOXICAL SLEEP; FIELD POTENTIALS; POWER-DENSITY; REM-SLEEP; EEG; DYNAMICS; ALGORITHM; NEURONS	Synchronized states are marked by large-amplitude low-frequency oscillations in the cortex. These states can be seen during quiet waking or slow-wave sleep. Within synchronized states, previous studies have noted a plethora of different types of activity, including delta oscillations (0.5-4 Hz) and slow oscillations (<1 Hz) in the neocortex and large- and small- irregular activity in the hippocampus. However, it is not still fully characterized how neural populations contribute to the synchronized state. Here we apply independent component analysis to parse which populations are involved in different kinds of neocortical activity, and find two populations that alternate throughout synchronized states. One population broadly affects neocortical deep layers, and is associated with larger amplitude slower neocortical oscillations. The other population exhibits theta-frequency oscillations that are not easily observed in raw field potential recordings. These theta oscillations apparently come from below the neocortex, suggesting hippocampal origin, and are associated with smaller amplitude faster neocortical oscillations. Relative involvement of these two alternating populations may indicate different modes of operation within synchronized states.

Multitaper Infinite Hidden Markov Model for EEG	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY			Infinite Hidden Markov Model; Beam Sampler; Multitaper Spectral Analysis; State-Space Modeling		Electroencephalographam (EEG) monitoring of neural activity is widely used for identifying underlying brain states. For inference of brain states, researchers have often used Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with a fixed number of hidden states and an observation model linking the temporal dynamics embedded in EEG to the hidden states. The use of fixed states may be limiting, in that 1) pre-defined states might not capture the heterogeneous neural dynamics across individuals and 2) the oscillatory dynamics of the neural activity are not directly modeled. To this end, we use a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM), which discovers the set of hidden states that best describes the EEG data, without a-priori specification of state number. In addition, we introduce an observation model based on classical asymptotic results of frequency domain properties of stationary time series, along with the description of the conditional distributions for Gibbs sampler inference. We then combine this with multitaper spectral estimation to reduce the variance of the spectral estimates. By applying our method to simulated data inspired by sleep EEG, we arrive at two main results: 1) the algorithm faithfully recovers the spectral characteristics of the true states, as well as the right number of states and 2) the incorporation of the multitaper framework produces a more stable estimate than traditional periodogram spectral estimates.

Neural Interactions in a Spatially-Distributed Cortical Network During Perceptual Decision-Making	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						perceptual decision-making task; reaction time; behavioral response fluctuations; cortical network reorganization; functional brain network	FRONTOPARIETAL ATTENTION NETWORK; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; EEG; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; COHERENCE	Behavioral experiments evidence that attention is not maintained at a constant level, but fluctuates with time. Recent studies associate such fluctuations with dynamics of attention-related cortical networks, however the exact mechanism remains unclear. To address this issue, we consider functional neuronal interactions during the accomplishment of a reaction time (RT) task which requires sustained attention. The participants are subjected to a binary classification of a large number of presented ambiguous visual stimuli with different degrees of ambiguity. Generally, high ambiguity causes high RT and vice versa. However, we demonstrate that RT fluctuates even when the stimulus ambiguity remains unchanged. The analysis of neuronal activity reveals that the subject's behavioral response is preceded by the formation of a distributed functional network in the beta-frequency band. This network is characterized by high connectivity in the frontal cortex and supposed to subserve a decision-making process. We show that neither the network structure nor the duration of its formation depend on RT and stimulus ambiguity. In turn, RT is related to the moment of time when the beta-band functional network emerges. We hypothesize that RT is affected by the processes preceding the decision-making stage, e.g., encoding visual sensory information and extracting decision-relevant features from raw sensory information.

In this longitudinal single-case study, the subject was a 58-yr-old man with right-hand hemiplegia due to ischemic stroke. Over a 9-mo period we treated him with MT twice a week and measured electroencephalograms (EEG) before, during, and after each therapy session. Using advanced signal processing methods, we identified five distinct movement-related oscillatory EEG components: one slow component designated as mu rhythm and four faster components designated as sensorimotor rhythms. Results show that MT produced long-term changes of two oscillatory EEG components including the mu rhythm. which is a well-documented correlate of voluntary movement in the frequency range of 7.5-12 Hz. Specifically, MT was significantly associated with an increase in the power of mu rhythm recorded over both hemispheres and a decrease in the power of one sensorimotor component recorded over the affected hemisphere. To obtain robust, repeatable individual measures of EEG components suitable for longitudinal study. we used irregular-resampling autospectral analysis to separate fractal and oscillatory components in the EEG power spectrum and three-way parallel factor analysis to isolate oscillatory EEG components and track their activations over time. The rhythms were identified over individual days of MT training and were clearly related to the periods of event-related desynchronization and synchronization (rest, observe, and move) during MT. Our results are consistent with a model in which MT promotes recovery of motor function by altering neural activity associated with voluntary movement. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We provide novel evidence that mirror therapy (MT), which helps in the recovery of motor function after a stroke, is also associated with long-lasting changes in brain electrical activity. Using precise measurements of oscillatory EEG components over a 9-mo period in a victim of ischemic stroke, we showed that MT produced long-term increases in the mu rhythm recorded over both hemispheres and a decrease in a sensorimotor EEG component recorded over the affected hemisphere.

To investigate the influence of load on working memory, we asked human subjects to maintain sets of letters in memory while we recorded single neurons and intracranial encephalography (EEG) in the medial temporal lobe and scalp EEG. Along the periods of a trial, hippocampal neural firing differentiated between success and error trials during stimulus encoding, predicted workload during memory maintenance, and predicted the subjects' behavior during retrieval. During maintenance, neuronal firing was synchronized with intracranial hippocampal EEG. On the network level, synchronization between hippocampal and scalp EEG in the theta-alpha frequency range showed workload dependent oscillatory coupling between hippocampus and cortex. Thus, we found that persistent neural activity in the hippocampus participated in working memory processing that is specific to memory maintenance, load sensitive and synchronized to the cortex.

J	Principe, A; Ley, M; Conesa, G; Rocamora, R				Principe, Alessandro; Ley, Miguel; Conesa, Gerardo; Rocamora, Rodrigo			Prediction error connectivity: A new method for EEG state analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Coherence; Markov model; iEEG; EEG states; Seizure prediction	SEIZURE PREDICTION; EPILEPSY; BRAIN; LONG; DYNAMICS	Several models have been proposed to explain brain regional and interregional communication, the majority of them using methods that tap the frequency domain, like spectral coherence. Considering brain interareal communication as binary interactions, we describe a novel method devised to predict dynamics and thus highlight abrupt changes marked by unpredictability. Based on a variable-order Markov model algorithm developed in-house for data compression, the prediction error connectivity (PEC) estimates network transitions by calculating error matrices (EMs). We analysed 20 h of EEG signals of virtual networks generated with a neural mass model. Subnetworks changed through time (2 of 5 signals), from normal to normal or pathological states. PEC was superior to spectral coherence in detecting all considered transitions, especially in broad and ripple bands. Subsequently, EMs of real data were classified using a support vector machine in order to capture the transition from interictal to preictal state and calculate seizure risk. A single seizure was randomly selected for training. Through this approach it was possible to establish a threshold that the calculated risk consistently overcame minutes before the events. Using either spectral coherence or PEC we created 1000 models that successfully predicted 6 seizures (100% sensibility), a whole cluster recorded in a patient with hippocampal epilepsy. However, PEC resulted superior to coherence in terms of true seizure free time and amount of false warnings. Indeed, the best PEC model predicted 96% of interictal time (vs. 83% of coherence) of about 20 h of stereo-EEG. This analysis was extended to patients with neo/mesocortical temporal, neocortical frontal, parietal and occipital lobe epilepsy. Again PEC showed high performance, allowing the prediction of 31 events distributed across 10 days with ROC AUCs that reached 98% (average 93 +/- 5%) in 6 different patients. Moreover, considering another state transition, PEC could classify and forecast up to 88% (average 85 +/- 3%) of the REM phase both in deep and scalp EEG. In conclusion, PEC is a novel approach that relies on pattern analysis in the time-domain. We believe that this method can be successfully employed both for the study of brain connectivity, and also implemented in real-life solutions for seizure detection and prediction.

J	Soni, R; Muniyandi, M				Soni, Rahul; Muniyandi, Manivannan			Breath rate variability: A novel measure to study the meditation effects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF YOGA			English	Article						Breath awareness and yoga; effect of meditation; respiration awareness meditation	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; MINDFULNESS; YOGA	Context: Reliable quantitative measure of meditation is still elusive. Although electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) are known as quantitative measures of meditation, effects of meditation on EEG and HRV may well take long time as these measures are involuntarily controlled. Effect of mediation on respiration is well known; however, quantitative measures of respiration during meditation have not been studied. Aims: Breath rate variability (BRV) as an alternate measure of meditation even over a short duration is proposed. The main objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that BRV is a simple measure that differentiates between meditators and nonmeditators. Settings and Design: This was a nonrandomized, controlled trial. Volunteers meditate in their natural habitat during signal acquisition. Subjects and Methods: We used Photo-Plythysmo-Gram (PPG) signal acquisition system from BIO-PAC and recorded video of chest and abdomen movement due to respiration during a short meditation (15 min) session for 12 individuals (all males) meditating in a relaxed sitting posture. Seven of the 12 individuals had substantial experience in meditation, while others are controls without any experience in meditation. Respiratory signal from PPG signal was derived and matched with that of the video respiratory signal. This derived respiratory signal is used for calculating BRV parameters in time, frequency, nonlinear, and time-frequency domain. Statistical Analysis Used: First, breath-to-breath interval (BBI) was calculated from the respiration signal, then time domain parameters such as standard deviation of BBI (SDBB), root mean square value of SDBB (RMSSD), and standard deviation of SDBB (SDSD) were calculated. We performed spectral analysis to calculate frequency domain parameters (power spectral density [PSD], power of each band, peak frequency of each band, and normalized frequency) using Burg, Welch, and Lomb-Scargle (LS) method. We calculated nonlinear parameters (sample entropy, approximate entropy, Poincare plot, and Renyi entropy). We calculated time frequency parameters (global PSD, low frequency-high frequency [LF-HF] ratio, and LF-HF power) by Burg LS and wavelet method. Results: The results show that the mediated individuals have high value of SDSD (+24%), SDBB (+29%), and RMSSD (+26%). Frequency domain analysis shows substantial increment in LFHF power (+73%) and LFHF ratio (+33%). Nonlinear parameters such as SD1 and SD2 were also more (>20%) for meditated persons. Conclusions: As compared to HRV, BRV can provide short-term effect on anatomic nervous system meditation, while HRV shows long-term effects. Improved autonomic function is one of the long-term effects of meditation in which an increase in parasympathetic activity and decrease in sympathetic dominance are observed. In future works, BRV could also be used for measuring stress.

J	Krott, A; Medaglia, MT; Porcaro, C				Krott, Andrea; Medaglia, Maria Teresa; Porcaro, Camillo			Early and Late Effects of Semantic Distractors on Electroencephalographic Responses During Overt Picture Naming	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); oscillations; word production; picture-word interference paradigm; semantic competition; lexical competition; response exclusion; overt picture naming	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL SOURCE SEPARATION; SPREADING-ACTIVATION THEORY; TIME-COURSE; WORD PRODUCTION; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; SPEECH PRODUCTION; LEXICAL ACCESS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INTERFERENCE	This study investigated the nature of the interference effect of semantically related distractors in the picture-word interference paradigm, which has been claimed to be caused by either competition between lexical representations of target and distractor or by a late response exclusion mechanism that removes the distractor from a response buffer. EEG was recorded while participants overtly named pictures accompanied by categorically related versus unrelated written distractor words. In contrast to previous studies, stimuli were presented for only 250 ms to avoid any re-processing. ERP effects of relatedness were found around 290, 470, 540, and 660 ms post stimulus onset. In addition, related distractors led to an increase in midfrontal theta power, especially from about 440 to 540 ms, as well as to decreased high beta power between 40 and 110 ms and increased high beta power between 275 and 340 ms post stimulus onset. Response-locked analyses showed no differences in ERPs, however increased low and high beta power for related distractors in various time windows, most importantly a high beta power increase between -175 and -155 ms before speech onset. These results suggest that the semantic distractor effect is a combination of various effects and that the lexical competition account and the response exclusion account each capture a part, but not all aspects of the effect.

Yet the neural correlates of the serial order effect are still relatively unexplored. The present study aimed to investigate the electrophysiological correlates underlying this effect. EEG alpha activity was measured using a task-related power paradigm while participants completed both the Alternative Uses Task as well as a Category Fluency Task. The results indicated that left hemisphere alpha power increased relative to right alpha power as a function of the serial order effect in the Alternative Uses Task, but not in the Category Fluency Task. This finding provides evidence that the pattern of observed EEG alpha activity changes over the course of the serial order effect.

We assessed neural changes associated with learning a bimanual coordination task over 4 days of practice in healthy young (n = 24) and older adults (n = 24). The electroencephalogram was recorded during task performance at the start and end of training. Motor performance improved with practice in both groups, but the amount of learning was lower in the older adults. Beta power (15-30 Hz) in sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices of older adults was reduced with training, indicative of higher neural activity. We also found a functional reorganization after training in beta and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands. Between-session changes in alpha and beta power differed between groups in several cortical areas: young adults exhibited reduced power in the beta band in sensorimotor cortices, whereas older adults displayed a smaller decrease. Our findings indicate a less flexible reorganization of neural activity accompanying learning in older adults compared with young adults. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This rhythmic oscillatory activity is present during both rest and task performance. The most visible rhythm in the adult human brain is in the band between approximately 8-12 Hz, and is referred to as alpha activity. While sometimes dismissed by neurophysiologists as a nuisance biological artefact, since it often interferes with the recording of event-related potentials (ERPs), there has been an explosion of research linking it to specific functional roles in cognition and behavior over the past two decades. Here, we review some of the research into the functional significance of alpha oscillations with respect to attention and expectation. We focus our discussion on how the amplitude and phase of alpha activity might be involved in the prioritization of relevant sensory input. In addition to summarizing the literature, we also endeavor to provide a critical appraisal as well as highlight limitations and conceptual gaps in the field.

Here we synthesize recent advances in the field, highlighting empirical work on creativity as divergent thinking, remote associations, musical creativity, and visual imagery. There is a general consensus that alpha-band activity plays a key role in the creative process, though other frequency bands, such as theta and gamma also serve critical functions. We further discuss evidence for electrical stimulation (tDCS and tACS) as a tool for improvements in creative thinking. EEG's high temporal resolution is supremely suitable for studying creative cognition, and studies continuing to yield new and exciting evidence regarding the local and global neural processes underlying creativity.

Neurophysiological Correlates of Gait Retraining With Real-Time Visual and Auditory Feedback	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; ERS/ERD; walking; gait training	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; ERD/ERS RESPONSES; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; DISCRIMINATION; PERFORMANCE; INTERVALS; WALKING	Most people acquire motor skills through feedback-based training. How the human brain processes sensory feedbacks during training, especially in a gait training, remain largely unclear. The purpose of this paper is to explore how humans adopt a new gait pattern to reduce impacts during walking-with the aid of visual and audio feedbacks. This paper demonstrates the features of underlying brain activity in incorporating the visual or auditory cues to acquire a new gait pattern. Electroencephalography (EEG) and peak positive acceleration (PPA) of the heel were collected from 23 participants during walking on a treadmill with no feedback, with visual feedback, or with audio feedback. The feedbacks were presented after each foot strike, where a sub-threshold PPA triggered a positive feedback (green/low-pitched), and a suprathreshold PPA triggered a negative feedback (red/high-pitched). The participants were instructed to voluntarily control their gait, so that low PPA could be achieved. This control was perturbed in some sessions by an additional cognitive task, and the influence of such distraction was also explored. The PPA was significantly lower in the sessions with visual or audio feedback than in sessions without feedback, showing an immediate improvement in gait pattern, when the feedback was provided. Different feedbacks modulated neural activities at different locations and/or levels during training. Alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) was particularly increased during the encoding of auditory feedback or the introduction of a distracting task. In the meantime, prominent frontal and posterior theta ERS were coupled with negative feedback, and strong beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) was observed only in sessions with feedbacks. Our results indicate that feedback effectively enhances motor planning when acquiring a new gait.

Functional connectivity (FC) among the brain regions recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging systems have been reported, but convenient method to estimate FC for clinical situation has not been established. Objectives: This observational study investigated the relationship between neural functional connectivity obtained by electroencephalography (EEG) and the upper limb function in patients during recovery stage after stroke. Methods: Twenty-four patients in the recovery stage between 4 and 8 weeks after the onset of stroke (mean age: 62 +/- 12 (SD)) were enrolled. The EEG signals were obtained by five electrodes placed on the motor-related areas (C3, C4, FC3, FC4, and FCz in the International 10-20 system) for 60 sec at rest and during finger movement on the affected side, and amplitude envelope correlations as measures of FC among the areas were calculated. Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) was used to assess upper limb motor function. Results: The FMA scores evaluated at 4W (33 +/- 24 (SD)) were improved by 8W (42 +/- 23) (p < .001). The FCs in alpha and beta bands calculated between the electrodes in the ipsi-lesional hemisphere were correlated negatively with the FMA score at 4W after stroke. The FCs obtained at 4W could be used to predict the FMA score at 8W after stroke. Conclusions: The FCs recorded at rest, as well as during the finger motor task, by the five electrodes placed on motor-related areas could be used to predict the motor function and recovery of the upper limb affected by stroke. The results indicate the possibility of using FCs recorded by conventional EEG with electrodes as biomarkers to predict motor recovery after stroke.

To address this question, we simultaneously collected electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals while healthy participants were conducting four overground walking conditions without any constraints (e.g., specific speed). The EEG results demonstrated that a wide range of frequencies from delta band to gamma band were involved in walking. The EEG power spectral density (PSD) was significantly different in sensorimotor and posterior parietal areas between exoskeleton-assisted walking and non-exoskeleton walking. The EMG PSD difference was predominantly observed in the theta band and the gastrocnemius lateralis muscle. EEG-EMG PSD correlations differed among walking conditions. The alpha and beta bands were primarily involved in consistently increasing EEG-EMG PSD correlations across the walking conditions, while the theta band was primarily involved in consistently decreasing correlations as observed in the EEG involvement. However, there is no dominant frequency band as observed in the EMG involvement. Channels located over the sensorimotor area were primarily involved in consistently decreasing EEG-EMG PSD correlations and the outer-ring channels were involved in the increasing EEG-EMG PSD correlations. Our study revealed the spectral and spatial distributions relevant to overground walking and deepened the understanding of EEG and EMG representations during locomotion, which may inform the development of a more human-compatible exoskeleton and its usage in motor rehabilitation.

Integration of these computational modes is reflected in the phenomenon of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). On slow temporal scales, CFC may reflect trait-like properties, which posits a question of its developmental trends. This is the first study that explored source-level CFC measures in a developmental perspective using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. CFC measures demonstrated good test-retest stability and proved to be higher in adults in cortical areas participating in sensory-motor integration, response inhibition, and attentional control. In children, greater CFC was observed in parietal regions involved in self-centered cognition. Over the period from 7 to 10 years, CFC demonstrated nonlinear growth trajectories. Introversion was associated with higher CFC in cortical areas related to emotion, attention, and social cognition, implying that the association between introversion and CFC appears early in the development.

This phenomenon is known as "testing effect" or "retrieval practice effect" and has been primarily described in behavioral studies with healthy young subjects. However, possible age-related changes and their associated underlying neural processes, in particular neural oscillations, remain unclear. To address this issue, we used a previously established paradigm in healthy young (N = 27) and elderly (N = 28) male and female human adults while their brain activity was being recorded using EEG. Subjects viewed prefamiliarized scene images intermixed with new scenes and classified them as indoor versus outdoor (encoding task) or old versus new (retrieval task). Subsequently, subjects performed a recognition memory task 10 min and 24 h after encoding. Behaviorally, both age groups showed the testing effect at both time points but, importantly, it was less pronounced in the elderly. At the neural level, the retrieval compared with the encoding task was accompanied by power decreases in the alpha (9 -12 Hz) and beta bands (13-30 Hz), possibly reflecting task demands, and this difference was more pronounced in the elderly. Finally, a correlation analysis revealed that those elderly who displayed a more pronounced testing effect exhibited a neural pattern that was more similar to the younger subjects. These findings provide evidence that the testing effect decreases across the life span, and they suggest that changes in alpha-beta oscillations play a direct role.

In this naturalistic study, we examined whether trauma treatment not only reduces symptoms but also changes neural networks involved in emotional control. Methods: Before and after eight weeks of phase-oriented inpatient trauma treatment, patients (n = 28) with complex posttraumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) and complex dissociative disorders (CDD) performed a cognitive reappraisal task while electroencephalography (EEG) was registered. Patients were measured as a prototypical dissociative part that aims to fulfill daily life goals while avoiding traumatic memories and associated dissociative parts. Matched healthy controls (n = 38) were measured twice as well. We examined task-related functional connectivity and assessed self-reports of clinical symptoms and emotion regulation skills. Results: Prior to treatment and compared to controls, patients showed hypoconnectivity within neural networks involved in emotional downregulation while reappraising affect-eliciting pictures as well as viewing neutral and affect-eliciting pictures. Following treatment, connectivity became normalized in these networks comprising regions associated with cognitive control and memory. Additionally, patients showed a treatment-related reduction of negative but not of positive dissociative symptoms. Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating that trauma-focused treatment was associated with favorable changes in neural networks involved in emotional control. Emotional overregulation manifesting as negative dissociative symptoms was reduced but not emotional underregulation, manifesting as positive dissociative symptoms.

This paper focuses on the impact of traffic noise exposure on the human brain. We collected road traffic noise sounds of different sound pressure levels (SPLs), and recorded the electroencephalograph (EEG) when subjects exposed under different SPLs' road noise. Using the graphic theoretical-based EEG method, the effects of road traffic noise with different SPLs on the functional connectivity of human brain networks were studied. Using time-frequency analysis, the beta2 bands was found to be most sensitive frequency band to different SPLs road noise. The brain network characteristic parameters of different SPLs noises were calculated. It is found that in these two frequency bands, the higher the noise SPL, the lower the clustering coefficient and the higher the characteristic path length. In summary, the paper points out the specific effects of road noise with different SPLs on the human brains. It is found that the higher the SPL of noise, the greater the damage to the functional connectivity of the human brain. That means, noise exposure can affect the rate at which the brain processes, analyses, and transmits information. The research results can provide a basis for road noise evaluation and prevention.

Prior work suggests that slowing may be comprised of at least two distinct neural mechanisms: slow oscillation activity (<1 Hz) may reflect primarily inhibitory cortical mechanisms while power in the delta frequency (1-4 Hz) may correlate with local synaptic strength. In focal epilepsy patients, we examined slow wave activity near and far from the seizure onset zone (SOZ) during wake, sleep, and postictal states using intracranial electroencephalography. We found that slow oscillation (0.3-1 Hz) activity was decreased near the SOZ, while delta activity (2-4 Hz) activity was increased. This finding was most prominent during sleep, and accompanied by a loss of long-range intra-hemispheric synchrony. In contrast to sleep, postictal slowing was characterized by a broadband increase of spectral power, and showed a reduced modulatory effect of slow oscillations on higher frequencies. These results suggest slow oscillation focal slowing is reduced near the seizure onset zone, perhaps reflecting reduced inhibitory activity. Dissociation between slow oscillation and delta slowing could help localize the seizure onset zone from interictal intracranial recordings.

Statistical Properties and Predictability of Extreme Epileptic Events	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ROGUE WAVES; SEIZURE PREDICTION; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; DYNAMICS; LONG; TIME	The use of extreme events theory for the analysis of spontaneous epileptic brain activity is a relevant multidisciplinary problem. It allows deeper understanding of pathological brain functioning and unraveling mechanisms underlying the epileptic seizure emergence along with its predictability. The latter is a desired goal in epileptology which might open the way for new therapies to control and prevent epileptic attacks. With this goal in mind, we applied the extreme event theory for studying statistical properties of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of WAG/Rij rats with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy. Our approach allowed us to reveal extreme events inherent in this pathological spiking activity, highly pronounced in a particular frequency range. The return interval analysis showed that the epileptic seizures exhibit a highly-structural behavior during the active phase of the spiking activity. Obtained results evidenced a possibility for early (up to 7 s) prediction of epileptic seizures based on consideration of EEG statistical properties.

Because of their intrinsic correlation with emotions, physiological signals based emotion recognition method is objective and insusceptible to intentional disguise of the subject under study. In particular, electroencephalogram (EEC) signals arc known to be responsive and sensitive to variations in emotional state. In this paper, a 4-class emotion classification problem is investigated. Firstly, a clustering algorithm is used to determine the target class of each emotion-related data. Then wavelet analysis is used to extract features from 32-channel EEC signals. Finally, we compare live feature dimensionality reduction or feature selection algorithms and four types of machine learning based classifiers. The comprehensive comparative results show the effectiveness of the combination of EEC feature dimensionality reduction algorithm and random forest (RF) for multi-class emotion recognition problem under study.

Only a few of these studies have focused on HFOs during the development of epilepsy, but results suggest pathological HFOs could be a biomarker of epileptogenesis. The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy" (EpiBioS4Rx) is a multi-center project designed to identify biomarkers of epileptogenesis after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and evaluate treatments that could modify or prevent the development of post-traumatic epilepsy. One goal of the EpiBioS4Rx project is to assess whether HFOs could be a biomarker of post-traumatic epileptogenesis. The current study describes the work towards this goal, including the development of common surgical procedures and EEG protocols, an interim analysis of the EEG for HFOs, and identifying issues that need to be addressed for a robust biomarker analysis. At three participating sites - University of Eastern Finland (UEF), Monash University in Melbourne (Melbourne) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) TBI was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by lateral fluid-percussion injury. After injury and in sham-operated controls, rats were implanted with screw and microwire electrodes positioned in neocortex and hippocampus to record EEG. A separate group of rats had serial magnetic resonance imaging after injury and then implanted with electrodes at 6 months. Recordings 28 days post-injury were available from UEF and UCLA, but not Melbourne due to technical issues with their EEG files. Analysis of recordings from 4 rats - UEF and UCLA each had one TBI and one sham-operated control - showed EEG contained evidence of HFOs. Computer-automated algorithms detected a total of 1,819 putative HFOs and of these only 40 events (2%) were detected by all three sites. Manual review of all events verified 130 events as HFO and the remainder as false positives. Review of the 40 events detected by all three sites was associated with 88% agreement. This initial report from the EpiBioS4Rx Consortium demonstrates the standardization of EEG electrode placements, recording protocol and long-term EEG monitoring, and differences in detection algorithm HFO results between sites. Additional work on detection strategy, detection algorithm performance, and training in HFO review will be performed to establish a robust, preclinical evaluation of HFOs as a biomarker of post-traumatic epileptogenesis.

Based on the nonlinear and non-stationary of the EEGs, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is applied to decompose the original signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). In this paper, after getting the IMFs, the fluctuation index and variation coefficient are calculated to analyze the amplitude change of IMFs. In order to better reflect the information of EEG signals, Hilbert transform is applied to obtain the instantaneous frequency for each IMF. Then, the novel feature named fluctuation index and variation coefficient of instantaneous frequency for IMFs are calculated. Furthermore, feature based on sample entropy of the first order difference is extracted. Finally, both of the calculated features will put together as a fusion feature into SVM for classification. The proposed method is evaluated using the Boon epileptic dataset and the highest average classification accuracy is 99.59%, showing a powerful method to detect seizure.

While most authors focus on frontal electrode pairs (e.g., F3/F4 or F7/F8), several recent studies have indicated that EEG asymmetries can also be observed outside the frontal lobe and in frequency bands other than alpha. Because the focus of most EEG asymmetry research is on the correlations between asymmetry and other traits, much less is known about the distribution of patterns of asymmetry at the population level. To systematically assess these asymmetries in a representative sample, we determined EEG asymmetries across the head in the alpha, beta, delta and theta frequency bands in 235 healthy adults. We found significant asymmetries in all four frequency bands and across several brain areas, indicating that EEG asymmetries are not limited to frontal alpha. Asymmetries were not modulated by sex. They were modulated by direction of hand preference, with stronger right-handedness predicting greater right (relative to left) alpha power, or greater left (relative to right) activity. Taken together, the present results show that EEG asymmetries other than frontal alpha represent markers of asymmetric brain function that should be explored further.

Here the research question is: Does an oddball paradigm maintain the greater P3a amplitude under several experimental conditions? An EEG study was carried out with an oddball number parity decision task having four conditions in control and schizophrenic participants. Contrary to previous findings (Gonsalvez and Polich, 2002; Polich, 2007) in control participants, non-correlation was found between the time of a novel (N) stimulus condition to the next novel condition and P3a amplitude. Moreover, with an innovative method for stimulus properties extraction features and EEG analysis, single trial across-subject averaging of participants' data revealed significant correlations (r > 0.3) of stimulus properties (such as probability, frequency, amplitude, and duration) on P300, and even r > 0.5 was found when N was an environmental sound in schizophrenic patients. Therefore, stimulus properties are strong markers of some of the features in the P3a wave. Finally, a context analysis of ERP waves across electrodes revealed a consistent modulation in novel appearance for MisMatch Negativity in schizophrenia. A supplementary analysis running linear modeling (LIMO) in EEG was also provided (see Supplementary Material). Therefore, in a multiple condition task: stimulus properties and their temporal properties are strong markers of some of the features in the P300 wave. An interpretation was done based on differences between controls and schizophrenics relate to differences in the operation of implicit memory for stimulus properties and stronger correlations were observed within groups related contextual and episodic processes.

Utilizing HFOs for epilepsy surgery planning offers the promise of improved seizure outcomes for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. This review discusses possible machine learning strategies that can be applied to HFO biomarkers to better identify epileptogenic regions. We discuss the role of HFO rate, and utilizing features such as explicit HFO properties (spectral content, duration, and power) and phase-amplitude coupling for distinguishing pathological HFO (pHFO) events from physiological HFO events. In addition, the review highlights the importance of neuroanatomical localization in machine learning strategies.

However, some well know ICA algorithm, such as Infomax ICA, suffering from the problem of convergence latency and make it hard to be apply on real-time application. This paper proposes a highly efficient chip implementation of multi-channel EEC real-time system based on online recursive independent component analysis algorithm (ORICA). The core size of the chip is 1.5525-mm(2) using 28nm CMOS technology. The EEC demonstration board will be implemented with the ORICA chip.

The electrophysiology of subjectively perceived memory confidence in relation to recollection and familiarity	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Episodic memory; Confidence; Familiarity; Recollection; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EPISODIC MEMORY; RETRIEVAL; FREQUENCY; ITEM; DISSOCIATION; SYNCHRONY	Subjectively perceived confidence is critically involved in distinguishing recollection from familiarity in episodic memory retrieval. However, the extent to which recollection and familiarity share similar electrophysiological processes associated with subjectively perceived memory confidence remains an open question. In addition, the role of memory encoding in subjectively perceived confidence during retrieval has not yet been investigated. To address these issues, an EEG study was performed in thirty healthy volunteers. During a memory task, participants encoded a subset of words while rating the words on pleasantness. Memory recognition and subjectively perceived confidence concerning these 'old' and additional 'new' words was tested. Results showed that during retrieval, correctly classifying an old item with high subjectively perceived confidence was associated with a parietal ERP and parietal theta power, while frontal theta activity was related to high-confident novelty processing. During the memory encoding phase, a parietal ERP and frontal theta oscillations were related to subsequent subjectively perceived memory confidence. Our findings provide the first evidence that subjectively perceived memory confidence is associated with distinct electrophysiological correlates during both memory encoding and retrieval.

When networks of task-irrelevant neurons fire in unison, they mask the signal generated by task-critical neurons. On a macroscopic level, such synchronisation can contribute to alpha/beta (8-30 Hz) oscillations. Reducing the amplitude of these oscillations, therefore, may enhance information processing. Here, we test this hypothesis. Twenty-one participants completed an associative memory task while undergoing simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Using representational similarity analysis, we quantified the amount of stimulus-specific information represented within the BOLD signal on every trial. When correlating this metric with concurrently-recorded alpha/beta power, we found a significant negative correlation which indicated that as post-stimulus alpha/beta power decreased, stimulus-specific information increased. Critically, we found this effect in three unique tasks: visual perception, auditory perception, and visual memory retrieval, indicating that this phenomenon transcends both stimulus modality and cognitive task. These results indicate that alpha/beta power decreases parametrically track the fidelity of both externally-presented and internally-generated stimulus-specific information represented within the cortex.

Dynamic- and Frequency-Specific Regulation of Sleep Oscillations by Cortical Potassium Channels	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							WHOLE-CELL RECORDINGS; BK CHANNEL; ADENOSINE KINASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; K+ CURRENTS; LOCAL SLEEP; BRAIN; EEG; CALCIUM; WAKEFULNESS	Primary electroencephalographic (EEG) features of sleep arise in part from thalamocortical neural assemblies, and cortical potassium channels have long been thought to play a critical role. We have exploited the regionally dynamic nature of sleep EEG to develop a novel screening strategy and used it to conduct an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated RNAi screen for cellular roles of 31 different voltage-gated potassium channels in modulating cortical EEG features across the circadian sleep-wake cycle. Surprisingly, a majority of channels modified only electroencephalographic frequency bands characteristic of sleep, sometimes diurnally or even in specific vigilance states. Confirming our screen for one channel, we show that depletion of the KCa1.1 (or "BK") channel reduces EEG power in slow-wave sleep by slowing neuronal repolarization. Strikingly, this reduction completely abolishes transcriptomic changes between sleep and wake. Thus, our data establish an unexpected connection between transcription and EEG power controlled by specific potassium channels. We postulate that additive dynamic roles of individual potassium channels could integrate different influences upon sleep and wake within single neurons.

BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Fear of heights; EEG; VR; Functional brain network	VIRTUAL-REALITY; FEAR; EEG; ACROPHOBIA; INTOLERANCE; PERCEPTION; ASYMMETRY; EXPOSURE; THERAPY; SYSTEM	Fear of highs is one of the most common phobias all around world. It could affect people's life, work and health. Standing on high-altitude can lead to fear, anxiety or even panic to some people. In this paper, EEG method is creatively combined with VR technology to assess the severity of fear of heights. By doing time frequency analysis, we found that alpha band (8-13 Hz) and high beta (20-30 Hz) are sensitive to fear of heights and frontal and parietotemporal areas are the regions of interests for fear of heights. Then using cross mutual information we built up a functional brain networks of every subject. And we extracted EEG features from the brain networks. Statistical analysis was performed to select the features based on significance of difference. Finally, we implemented classification. The performance of classifiers (the average accuracy could reach 94.44%) based on the proposed method was compared to the performance of classifiers based on the traditional physiological features. As a result, the proposed method was verified to be reliable and superior on estimating the severity of fear of heights. In addition, the system was tested on elderly people and came out with good performance. It turns out that the proposed system has good generalization capability and adaptability.

Here, EEG signals were recorded on humans performing a visual detection task, while they received brief patterns of rhythmic or random transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to the right Frontal Eye Field (FEF) prior to the onset of a lateralized target. TMS entrained oscillations, i.e., increased high-beta power and phase alignment (the latter to a higher extent for rhythmic high-beta patterns than random patterns) while also boosting visual detection sensitivity. Considering post-hoc only those participants in which rhythmic stimulation enhanced visual detection, the magnitude of high-beta entrainment correlated with left visual performance increases. Our study provides evidence in favor of a causal link between high-beta oscillatory activity in the Frontal Eye Field and visual detection. Furthermore, it supports future applications of brain stimulation to manipulate local synchrony and improve or restore impaired visual behaviors.

Despite the application of time-frequency analysis (TFA) to extract the temporal and spectral characteristics of non-phase-locked component (NPLC) of interest simultaneously, the statistical results are not always expectedly satisfying, in that the spatial information is not considered. Complex Morlet wavelet transform is widely applied to TFA of event-related-potential (ERP) data, and mother wavelet (which should be firstly defined by center frequency and bandwidth (CFBW) before using the method to TFA of ERP data) influences the time-frequency results. In this study, an optimal set of CFBW was firstly selected from the number sets of CFBW, to further analyze for TFA of the ERP data in a cognitive experiment paradigm of emotion (Anger and Neutral) and task (Go and Nogo). Then tensor decomposition algorithm was introduced to investigate the NPLC of interest from the fourth-order tensor. Compared with the TFA results which only revealed a significant difference between Go and Nogo task condition, the tensor-based analysis showed significant interaction effect between emotion and task. Moreover, significant differences were found in both emotion and task conditions through tensor decomposition. In addition, the statistical results of TFA would be affected by the selected region of interest (ROI), whereas those of the proposed method were not subject to ROI. Hence, this study demonstrated that tensor decomposition method was effective in extracting NPLC, by considering spatial information simultaneously as the potential to explore the brain mechanisms related to experimental design.

Rajendra; Molinari, Filippo			Cascaded LSTM recurrent neural network for automated sleep stage classification using single-channel EEG signals	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Recurrent neural networks; Long short-term memory; Sleep analysis; EEG signals; Neurocognitive performance	IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEM; FEATURES	Automated evaluation of a subject's neurocognitive performance (NCP) is a relevant topic in neurological and clinical studies. NCP represents the mental/cognitive human capacity in performing a specific task. It is difficult to develop the study protocols as the subject's NCP changes in a known predictable way. Sleep is time-varying NCP and can be used to develop novel NCP techniques. Accurate analysis and interpretation of human sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is needed for proper NCP assessment. In addition, sleep deprivation may cause prominent cognitive risks in performing many common activities such as driving or controlling a generic device; therefore, sleep scoring is a crucial part of the process. In the sleep cycle, the first stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or stage N1 is the transition between wakefulness and drowsiness and becomes relevant for the study of NCP. In this study, a novel cascaded recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks, is proposed for the automated scoring of sleep stages using EEG signals derived from a single-channel. Fifty-five time and frequency-domain features were extracted from the EEG signals and fed to feature reduction algorithms to select the most relevant ones. The selected features constituted as the inputs to the LSTM networks. The cascaded architecture is composed of two LSTM RNNs: the first network performed 4-class classification (i.e. the five sleep stages with the merging of stages N1 and REM into a single stage) with a classification rate of 90.8%, and the second one obtained a recognition performance of 83.6% for 2-class classification (i.e. N1 vs REM). The overall percentage of correct classification for five sleep stages is found to be 86.7%. The objective of this work is to improve classification performance in sleep stage N1, as a first step of NCP assessment, and at the same time obtain satisfactory classification results in the other sleep stages.

Performance evaluation of DWT based sigmoid entropy in time and frequency domains for automated detection of epileptic seizures using SVM classifier	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT); EEG; Epilepsy; Epileptic seizures; Sigmoid entropy; Support vector machine (SVM)	EEG SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; DIAGNOSIS; ENERGY; ONSET	The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal contains useful information on physiological states of the brain and has proven to be a potential biomarker to realize the complex dynamic behavior of the brain. Epilepsy is a brain disorder described by recurrent and unpredictable interruption of healthy brain function. Diagnosis of patients with epilepsy requires monitoring and visual inspection of long-term EEG by the neurologist, which is found to be a time-consuming procedure. Therefore, this study proposes an automated seizure detection model using a novel computationally efficient feature named sigmoid entropy derived from discrete wavelet transforms. The sigmoid entropy was estimated from the wavelet coefficients in each sub-band and classified using a non-linear support vector machine classifier with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The performance of the proposed method was tested with the Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital (RMCH) database, which consists of the 58 Hours of EEG from 115 subjects, the University of Bonn (UBonn), and CHB-MIT databases. Results showed that sigmoid entropy exhibits lower values for epileptic EEG in contrary to other existing entropy methods. We observe a seizure detection rate of 96.34%, a false detection rate of 0.5/h and a mean detection delay of 1.2 s for the RMCH database. The highest sensitivity of 100% and 94.21% were achieved for UBonn and CHB-MIT databases respectively. The performance comparison confirms that sigmoid entropy was found to be better and computationally efficient as compared to other entropy methods. It can be concluded that the proposed sigmoid entropy could be used as a potential biomarker for recognition and detection of epileptic seizures.

To study the linear and nonlinear abnormality of EEG in AD and MCI patients, multiple characteristics was applied to distinguish AD and MCI patients from the normal controls (NC). EEG signals was recorded from 28 subjects, including 10 AD patients, 8 MCI subjects and 10 healthy elderly people. EEG signals in all channels was computed by auto-regressive model and multi scale entropy (MSE) to obtain relative power spectral density (PSD) value of each frequency band and entropy value in different time scales. Area under Receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the classification ability of the two method. The ratio Alpha/theta of MCI group in left frontal area can distinguish MCI from NC subjects. Also the long scale entropy value in left frontal-central area manifests a better accuracy in distinguish AD and MCI from NC group. In addition, the combined feature from alpha/theta and long scale entropy in the left frontal central area can discriminate AD from NC group with higher AUC reaching 0.89. This indicated that combined PSD and MSE can be taken as a potential measure to detect AD in early state.

Reconsidering Spatial Priors In EEG Source Estimation Does White Matter Contribute to EEG Rhythms?	2019 7TH INTERNATIONAL WINTER CONFERENCE ON BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE (BCI)	International Winter Workshop on Brain-Computer Interface		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Winter Conference on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)	FEB 18-20, 2019	Korea Univ, Res Ctr Brain & Artificial Intelligence, Gangwon, SOUTH KOREA	Korea Univ, Global Leader Dev Div Brain Engn, Tech Univ Berlin, Machine Learning Grp, Brain Engn Soc Korea, Korean Brain Educ Soc, IEEE Syst, Man, & Cybernet Soc TC Brain Machine Interface Syst, IEEE Brain Initiat, KIISE SIG Brain Comp Interface	Korea Univ, Res Ctr Brain & Artificial Intelligence		NEURAL MASS MODEL; FIELD-THEORY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; BRAIN; CELLS; NETS; TIME	Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a core tool used in functional neuroimaging in humans for nearly a hundred years. Because it is inexpensive, easy to implement, and noninvasive, it also represents an excellent candidate modality for use in the BCI setting. Nonetheless, a complete understanding of how EEG measurements (voltage fluctuations) relate to information processing in the brain remains somewhat elusive. A deeper understanding of the neuroanatomical underpinnings of the EEG signal may help explain inter-individual variability in evoked and induced potentials, which may improve BCI therapies targeted to the individual. According to classic biophysical models, EEG fluctuations are primarily a reflection of locally synchronized neuronal oscillations within the gray matter oriented approximately orthogonal to the scalp. In contrast, global models ignore local signals due to dendritic processing, and suggest that propagation delays due to white matter architecture are responsible for the EEG signal, and are capable of explaining the coherence between numerous rhythms (e.g., alpha) at spatially distinct areas of the scalp. Recently, combined local-global models suggest that the EEG signal may reflect a superposition of local processing along with global contributors including transduction along white matter tracts in the brain. Incorporating both local and global (e.g., white matter) priors into EEG source models may therefore improve source estimates. These models may also help disentangle which aspects of the EEG signal are predicted to colocalize spatially with measurements from functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we explore the possibility that white matter conductivity contributes to EEG measurements via a generative model based on classic axonal transduction models, and discuss its potential implications for source estimation.

To more effectively elicit these outcomes, flow is increasingly studied using neurophysiological measures. For example, portable EEG is employed to enable automatic state detection required for adaptive system design. However, so far, there is a lack of highly diagnostic findings, and moderately diagnostic ones relate more strongly to a central flow pre-condition - namely optimal task difficulties. Unfortunately, even these metrics might be infeasible in real-world scenarios and for portable EEG systems without midline electrodes. In this work, we discuss how frequency band personalization and separation could provide options to overcome these problems. Results from an experiment with a task manipulated in difficulty highlight that upper Alpha and Beta ranges show differentiating patterns to their lower frequency counterparts (i.e. within bands). These sub-bands could be used to detect instances of higher flow and optimized difficulty using portable EEG.

Despite previous works which mostly used time and frequency features of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in subject-dependent emotion recognition issues, we used multiscale fuzzy entropy as a nonlinear dynamic feature. The EEG signals of the well-known Database for Emotion Analysis Using Physiological signals dataset was used for classification of two and three levels of emotions in arousal and valence space. The compound feature selection with a cost of average accuracy of support vector machine classifier was used to reduce feature dimensions. For subject-dependent systems, the proposed method is superior in comparison to previous works with 90.81% and 90.53% accuracies in two-level classification and 79.83% and 77.80% accuracies in three-level classification in arousal and valence dimensions, respectively.

Neonatal infant EEG bursts are altered by prenatal maternal depression and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor use	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Prenatal maternal depression; SSRI; Delta brush; EEG burst; Infant EEG		Objective: Increasingly, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are prescribed in pregnancy. These medications pass freely into the developing fetus but little is known about their effect on brain development in humans. In this study we determine if prenatal maternal depression and SSRI medication change the EEG infant delta brush bursts which are an early marker of normal brain maturation. Methods: We measured delta brush bursts from the term infants of three groups of mothers (controls (N = 52), depressed untreated (N = 15), and those taking serotonin SSRI medication (N = 10). High density EEGs were obtained during sleep at an average age of 44 weeks post conceptional age. We measured the rate of occurrence, brush amplitude, oscillation frequency and duration of the bursts. Results: Compared to infants of control mothers, the parameters of delta brush bursts of the offspring of depressed and SSRI-using mothers are significantly altered: burst amplitude is decreased; the oscillation frequency increased, and the duration increased (SSRI only). These significant differences were found during both sleep states. Conclusions: Electrocortical bursting activity (i.e. delta brushes) is known to play an important role in early central nervous system (CNS) synaptic formation and function. Significance: Maternal depression or SSRI use may alter brain function in their offspring. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Multiscale recordings reveal the dynamic spatial structure of human seizures	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Review						Epilepsy; Human single unit activity; Focal seizures; Surround inhibition; Seizure localization	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; CELLULAR MECHANISMS; ACTION-POTENTIALS; EPILEPSY; NEURONS; PROPAGATION; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; CHLORIDE	The cellular activity underlying human focal seizures, and its relationship to key signatures in the EEG recordings used for therapeutic purposes, has not been well characterized despite many years of investigation both in laboratory and clinical settings. The increasing use of microelectrodes in epilepsy surgery patients has made it possible to apply principles derived from laboratory research to the problem of mapping the spatiotemporal structure of human focal seizures, and characterizing the corresponding EEG signatures. In this review, we describe results from human microelectrode studies, discuss some data interpretation pitfalls, and explain the current understanding of the key mechanisms of ictogenesis and seizure spread.

Flickering visual stimulation is known to evoke rhythmic oscillations in the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, called steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP). The presence of harmonic components in the EEG signals during SSVEP suggests the non-linearity of the visual-system response to rhythmic stimulation, but the nature of this behavior has not been deeply understood. The aim of this study is the quantitative evaluation and characterization of this non-linear phenomenon and its interference with the physiological alpha rhythm by means of spectral and higher order spectral analysis. Approach. EEG signals were acquired in a group of 12 healthy subjects during a pattern-reversal stimulation protocol at three different driving frequencies (7.5 Hz, 15 Hz and 24 Hz). Spectral power values were estimated, after Laplacian spatial filtering, to quantitatively evaluate the changes in the power of the individual alpha and stimulation frequencies related harmonic components. Bicoherence measure were employed to assess the presence of quadratic phase coupling (QPC) at each channel location. Main results. Our analysis confirmed a strong non-linear response to the rhythmic stimulus principally over the parieto-occipital channel locations and a simultaneous significant alpha power suppression during 7.5 Hz and 15 Hz stimulation. A prominent sub-harmonic component characterized the resonance behavior of the 24 Hz stimulation. Significance. The findings presented suggest that bicoherence is a useful tool for the identification of QPC interactions between stimulus-related frequency components within the same signal and the characterization of the non-linearity of SSVEP-induced harmonics generation. In addition, the applied methodology demonstrates the presence of coupled EEG rhythms (harmonics of the main oscillation) both in resting condition and during stimulation, with different characteristics in the distinct brain areas.

To assess whether alpha oscillations systematically reflect a feedback pacing mechanism for cortical processing during visual perception, comparisons were made between alpha oscillations, visual suppression from TMS, visual evoked responses, and metacontrast masking. Peak alpha oscillation frequencies, measured through scalp EEG recordings, significantly correlated with the optimum latencies for visual suppression from TMS of early visual cortex. Individuals with shorter alpha periods (i.e., higher peak alpha frequencies) processed visual information faster than those with longer alpha periods (i.e., lower peak alpha frequencies). Moreover, peak alpha oscillation periods and optimum TMS visual suppression latencies predicted the latencies of late but not early visual evoked responses. Together, these findings demonstrate an important role of alpha oscillatory and late feedback activity in visual cortex for conscious perception. They also show that the timing for visual awareness varies across individuals, depending on the pace of one's endogenous oscillatory cycling frequency.

J	Magosso, E; Ricci, G; Ursino, M				Magosso, Elisa; Ricci, Giulia; Ursino, Mauro			Modulation of brain alpha rhythm and heart rate variability by attention-related mechanisms	AIMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; alpha power; attention; Independent Component Analysis; Heart Rate Variability	WORKING-MEMORY; BAND; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; COMPONENT; WIRELESS; INCREASE; TASKS; THETA	According to recent evidence, oscillations in the alpha-band (8-14 Hz) play an active role in attention via allocation of cortical resources: decrease in alpha activity enhances neural processes in task-relevant regions, while increase in alpha activity reduces processing in task-irrelevant regions. Here, we analyzed changes in alpha-band power of 13-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) acquired from 30 subjects while performing four tasks that differently engaged visual, computational and motor attentional components. The complete (visual + computational + motor) task required to read and solve an arithmetical operation and provide a motor response; three simplified tasks involved a subset of these components (visual + computational task, visual task, motor task). Task-related changes in alpha power were quantified by aggregating electrodes into two main regions (fronto-central and parieto-occipital), to test regional specificity of alpha modulation depending on the involved attentional aspects. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was applied to discover the main independent processes accounting for alpha power over the two scalp regions. Furthermore, we performed analysis of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) from one electrocardiogram signal acquired simultaneously with EEG, to test autonomic reaction to attentional loads. Results showed that alpha power modulation over the two scalp regions not only reflected the number of involved attentional components (the larger their number the larger the alpha power suppression) but was also fine-tuned by the nature of the recruited mechanisms (visual, computational, motor) relative to the functional specification of the regions. ICA revealed topologically dissimilar and differently attention-regulated processes of alpha power over the two regions. HRV indexes were less sensitive to different attentional aspects compared to alpha power, with vagal activity index presenting larger changes. This study contributes to improve our understanding of the electroencephalographic and autonomic correlates of attention and may have practical implications in neurofeedback, brain-computer interfaces, neuroergonomics as well as in clinical practice and neuroscience research exploring attention-deficit disorders.

Methods: In 117 untreated patients with typical absences, we analyzed clinical EEG features, and resting EEG activity using partial directed coherence to calculate out- and inflow of cortical oscillations in different regions of interest. Results: Absences began before 4 years in 12.0%, at 4-9.5 years in 71.8%, and at 10-13 years in 162% of the cases. Valproate was started in 91 patients and ethosuximide in 27. With one of AEDs, 77.8% reached seizure control, while the remaining patients needed to switch to the alternative AED. Only 5.9% patients remained drug-resistant. Absences with simple automatisms were the only feature associated with a lack of response to the first AED. Connectivity analysis of resting EEGs showed increased frontal outflow in patients compared with controls, which was significantly greater in the nonresponders to the first AED than in responders. Among the 91 patients followed for 61.2 +/- 31.7 months. 142% relapsed after a seizure-free period, without differences between the responders to the first or second AED. Conclusions: The assessment of electroclinical features provided only minimal prognostic indices. The enhanced outflow of frontal oscillations suggests a circuitry dysfunction significantly greater in the nonresponder to the early treatment. Seizure relapses were rare and comparable in patients who reached seizure freedom with first or second AED, indicating that the resistance to one AED does not influence the outcome.

However, to extract information on cortical processing, researchers have to rely on source localization methods that can be very broadly classified into e current density estimates such as exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), minimum norm estimates (MNE) and beamformers such as Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DIGS) and Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV). These algorithms produce a distributed map of brain activity underlying sustained and transient responses during neuroimaging studies of behavior. On the other hand, there are very few comparative analyses that evaluates the "ground truth detection" capabilities of these methods. The current article evaluates the reliability in estimation of sources of spectral event generators in the cortex using a two-pronged approach. First, simulated EEG data with point dipoles and distributed dipoles are used to validate the accuracy and sensitivity of each one of these methods of source localization. The abilities of the techniques were tested by comparing the localization error, focal width, false positive ratios while detecting already known location of neural activity generators under varying signal to noise ratios. Second, empirical EEG data during auditory steady state responses (ASSR) in human participants were used to compare the distributed nature of source localization. All methods were successful in recovery of point sources in favorable signal to noise scenarios and could achieve high hit rates if false positives are ignored. Interestingly, focal activation map is generated by LCMV and DICS when compared to eLORETA while control of false positives is much superior in eLORETA. Subsequently drawbacks and strengths of each method are highlighted with a detailed discussion on how to choose a technique based on empirical requirements.

A fast growing literature suggests that alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations play a key role in this core cognitive process. It is clear that alpha-band activity tracks both the locus and timing of covert spatial orienting. There is limited evidence, however, for the widely embraced view that alpha oscillations suppress irrelevant visual information during spatial selection. Extant evidence is equally compatible with an account in which alpha activity enables spatial selection through signal enhancement rather than distractor suppression. Thus, more work is needed to characterize the computational role of alpha activity in spatial attention.

Methods: 12 patients in an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and 12 in a minimally conscious state (MCS) underwent 2-weeks active and 2-weeks sham tDCS. Neurophysiological assessment was performed with EEG power spectra and coherence analysis directly before and after each session. Results: An increase of power and coherence of the frontal and parietal alpha and beta frequency bands and significant clinical improvements were seen after the active tDCS in MCS patients. In contrast, UWS patients showed some local frontal changes in the slow frequencies. No treatment effect was observed after sham. Conclusions: tDCS could induce changes in cortical EEG oscillations, modulating the travel of alpha and beta waves between anterior and posterior brain areas when some cognitive functions were preserved. This plays an important role in consciousness by integrating cognitive-emotional processing with the state of arousal. In unresponsive people, brain integration seems to be lost.

Thirty-three healthy subjects (16 females) were enrolled to interact with a haptic device able to mimic caress-like stimuli conveyed by strips of different fabrics moved back and forth at different velocities. Specifically, two velocity levels (i.e., 9.4 and 65 mm/sec) and two kinds of fabric (i.e., burlap and silk) were selected to deliver pleasant and unpleasant affective elicitations, according to subjects' self-assessment. EEG power spectra and functional connectivity were then calculated and analyzed. Experimental results, reported in terms of p-value topographic maps, demonstrated that caresses administered through unpleasant fabrics increased brain activity in the (4-8 Hz), (8-14 Hz), and (14-30 Hz) bands, whereas the use of pleasant fabrics enhanced functional connections in specific areas (e.g., frontal, occipital, and temporal cortices) depending on the oscillations frequency and caressing velocity. Furthermore, we adopted K-NN algorithms to automatically recognize the pleasantness of the haptic stimulation at a single-subject level using EEG power spectra, achieving a recognition accuracy up to 74.24%. Finally, we showed how brain oscillation power in the alpha and beta bands over contralateral frontal- and central-cortex were the most informative features characterizing the pleasantness of a tactile stimulus on the forearm.

Bidirectional prefrontal-hippocampal dynamics organize information transfer during sleep in humans	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; RIPPLE OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC MEMORY; EEG-DATA; SPINDLES; NEOCORTEX; NETWORKS; COMMUNICATION; REACTIVATION	How are memories transferred from short-term to long-term storage? Systems-level memory consolidation is thought to be dependent on the coordinated interplay of cortical slow waves, thalamo-cortical sleep spindles and hippocampal ripple oscillations. However, it is currently unclear how the selective interaction of these cardinal sleep oscillations is organized to support information reactivation and transfer. Here, using human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that the prefrontal cortex plays a key role in organizing the ripple-mediated information transfer during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We reveal a temporally precise form of coupling between prefrontal slow-wave and spindle oscillations, which actively dictates the hippocampal-neocortical dialogue and information transfer. Our results suggest a model of the human sleeping brain in which rapid bidirectional interactions, triggered by the prefrontal cortex, mediate hippocampal activation to optimally time subsequent information transfer to the neocortex during NREM sleep.

In this paper we focus on a special type of frequency coupling between brain and body oscillations, which is reflected by the numerical ratio (r) between two frequencies (m and n; n > m). This approach is motivated by theoretical considerations, indicating that during alert wakefulness brain-body oscillations form a coupled hierarchy of frequencies with integer relationships that are binary multiples (r = n:m = 1:2, 1:4, 1:8.....). During sleep we expect an irrational relationship (r = n/m = irrational number) between brain and body oscillations that reflects decoupling. We analyzed alpha frequency, heart rate, breathing frequency during performance of a memory tasks and in addition spindle frequency from data collected by the SIESTA sleep research group. As predicted, our results show a binary multiple frequency relationship between alpha, heart rate and breathing frequency during task performance but an irrational relationship between spindle frequency, heart rate and breathing frequency during sleep.

Low-frequency alternating current stimulation rhythmically suppresses gamma-band oscillations and impairs perceptual performance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						TACS-MEG; Visual cortex; Gamma; Alpha; Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC); Visual detection	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA; PHASE; POWER; EEG; MEG; THETA; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Low frequency oscillations such as alpha (8-12 Hz) are hypothesized to rhythmically gate sensory processing, reflected by 40-100 Hz gamma band activity, via the mechanism of pulsed inhibition. We applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) at individual alpha frequency (IAF) and flanking frequencies (IAF-4 Hz, IAFthorn4 Hz) to the occipital cortex of healthy human volunteers during concurrent magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants performed a visual detection task inducing strong gamma-band responses. Occipital (but not retinal) TACS phasically suppressed stimulus-induced gamma oscillations in the visual cortex and impaired target detection, with stronger phase-to-amplitude coupling predicting behavioral impairments. Retinal control TACS ruled out retino-thalamo-cortical entrainment resulting from (subthreshold) retinal stimulation. All TACS frequencies tested were effective, suggesting that visual gamma-band responses can be modulated by a range of low frequency oscillations. We propose that TACS-induced membrane potential modulations mimic the rhythmic change in cortical excitability by which spontaneous low frequency oscillations may eventually exert their impact when gating sensory processing via pulsed inhibition.

The different synchronization patterns of brain rhythms can account for different perceptual and cognitive functions, and we argue that this includes language. We aim to address six distinct questions-the What, How, Where, Who, Why, and When questions-pertaining to oscillatory investigations of language. Language deficits found in clinical conditions like autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia can be satisfactorily construed in terms of an abnormal, disorder-specific pattern of brain rhythmicity. Lastly, an eco-evo-devo approach to language is defended with explicit reference to brain oscillations, embracing a framework that considers language evolution to be the result of a changing environment surrounding developmental paths of the primate brain.

This technology opens promising perspectives to monitor the "brain at work" in complex real-life situations such as while operating aircraft. However, there is a need to benchmark these sensors in real operational conditions. We therefore designed a scenario in which twenty-two pilots equipped with a six-dry-electrode EEG system had to perform one low load and one high load traffic pattern along with a passive auditory oddball. In the low load condition, the participants were monitoring the flight handled by a flight instructor, whereas they were flying the aircraft in the high load condition. At the group level, statistical analyses disclosed higher P300 amplitude for the auditory target (Pz, P4 and Oz electrodes) along with higher alpha band power (Pz electrode), and higher theta band power (Oz electrode) in the low load condition as compared to the high load one. Single trial classification accuracy using both event-related potentials and event-related frequency features at the same time did not exceed chance level to discriminate the two load conditions. However, when considering only the frequency features computed over the continuous signal, classification accuracy reached around 70% on average. This study demonstrates the potential of dry-EEG to monitor cognition in a highly ecological and noisy environment, but also reveals that hardware improvement is still needed before it can be used for everyday flight operations.

Auditory EEG Biomarkers in Fragile X Syndrome: Clinical Relevance	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Fragile X Syndrome; EEG; chirp; habituation; gamma; sensory	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MOUSE MODEL; SENSORIMOTOR CONTROL; LATERAL INHIBITION; SPECTRUM DISORDER; AUTISM; POWER; HABITUATION; RELIABILITY; AGE	Sensory hypersensitivities are common and distressing features of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). While there are many drug interventions that reduce behavioral deficits in Fmr1 mice and efforts to translate these preclinical breakthroughs into clinical trials for FXS, evidence-based clinical interventions are almost non-existent potentially due to lack of valid neural biomarkers. Local circuit function in sensory networks is dependent on the dynamic balance of activity in inhibitory/excitatory synapses. Studies are needed to examine the association of electrophysiological alterations in neural systems with sensory and other clinical features of FXS to establish their clinical relevance. Adolescents and adults with FXS (n = 38, Mean age = 25.5, std = 10.1; 13 females) and age matched typically developing controls (n = 40, Mean age = 27.7, std = 12.1; 17 females) completed auditory chirp and auditory habituation tasks while undergoing dense array electroencephalography (EEG). Amplitude, latency, and percent change (habituation) in N1 and P2 event-related potential (ERP) components were characterized for the habituation task; time-frequency calculations using Morlet wavelets characterized phase-locking and single trial power for the habituation and chirp tasks. FXS patients showed increased amplitude but some evidence for reduced habituation of the N1 ERP, and reduced phase-locking in the low and high gamma frequency range and increased low gamma power to the chirp stimulus. FXS showed increased theta power in both tasks. While the habituation finding was weaker than previously found, the remaining findings replicate our previous work in a new sample of patients with FXS. Females showed less deficit in the chirp task but not the habituation task. Abnormal increases in gamma power were related to more severe behavioral and psychiatric features as well as reductions in neurocognitive abilities. Replicating electrophysiological deficits in a new group of patients using different EEG equipment at a new data collection site with differing levels of environmental noise that were robust to data processing techniques utilizing multiple researchers, indicates a potential for scalability to multi-site clinical trials. Given the robust replicability, relevance to clinical measures, and preclinical evidence for sensitivity of these EEG measures to pharmacological intervention, the observed abnormalities may provide novel translational markers of target engagement and potentially outcome measures in large-scale studies evaluating new treatments targeting neural hyperexcitability in FXS.

However, most studies assume stationarity of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, whereas they are typically nonlinear and nonstationary. Little work has focused on the time irreversibility of sleep EEG signals. Hence, the aim of this work is to reveal the temporally irreversible structures of rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM sleep using a visibility algorithm, which is robust to nonstationarity and finite-size effect. Results show that the temporal structure of non-REM sleep is more irreversible than that of REM sleep. The degree of irreversibility is highest in slow-wave sleep. Moreover, statistical analysis suggests that aging is the major factor that affects the irreversibility of sleep signals, while gender and body mass index contribute insignificantly. The dominant role of slow oscillations on the irreversible structures of the sleep signals is also indicated.

EEG power spectrum analysis for schizophrenia during mental activity	AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; EEG; Power spectrum; BPN; SVM	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES	Cognitive dysfunction is a core defect for schizophrenia subjects. This is due to structural and functional abnormalities of the brain which can be determined using Electroencephalogram (EEG). The objective of this study is to analyze EEG in patients with schizophrenia using power spectral density during mental activity. The subjects included in this study are 52 schizophrenia subjects and 29 Normal subjects. EEG is recorded under resting condition and during mental activity. Two modified odd ball paradigms are designed to stimulate mental activity and named as stimulus 1 and stimulus 2. EEG signal is filtered using FIR band pass filter to extract delta, theta, alpha, and beta band EEG. This method measures powers of each band using Welch power spectral density method called absolute power. The absolute power of alpha band is low and beta band is high for schizophrenia subjects compared to normal subjects during rest and two stimuli. Student's t-test is used to find the significant features (p < 0.05) at each recording condition. The significant features from each recording condition are used to classify Schizophrenia using both BPN and SVM classifier. SVM classifier is produced maximum sensitivity of 91% when features from all recording conditions are combined together. Thus this work concludes that the mental activity EEG supports for classifying Schizophrenia from normal and hence absolute band powers can be used as features to identify Schizophrenia.

A Pilot OERP and fNIRS Study	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						OERPs; olfactory perception; haptic perception; fNIRS; delta rhythm; cross-modal perception	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; WORKING-MEMORY; OLFACTION; DORSAL; ODORS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; INTEGRATION; HEMOGLOBIN	Cross-modal perception allows olfactory information to integrate with other sensory modalities. Olfactory representations are processed by multisensory cortical pathways, where the aspects related to the haptic sensations are integrated. This complex reality allows the development of an integrated perception, where olfactory aspects compete with haptic and/or trigeminal activations. It is assumed that this integration involves both perceptive electrophysiological and metabolic/hemodynamic aspects, but there are no studies evaluating these activations in parallel. The aim of this study was to investigate brain dynamics during a cross-modal olfactory and haptic attention task, preceded by an exploratory session. The assessment of cross-modal dynamics was conducted through simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recording, evaluating both electrophysiological and hemodynamic activities. The study consisted of two experimental sessions and was conducted with a sample of ten healthy subjects (mean age 25 +/- 5.2 years). In Session 1, the subjects were trained to manipulate 3D haptic models (HC) and to smell different scents (SC). In Session 2, the subjects were tested during an attentive olfactory task, in order to investigate the olfactory event-related potentials (OERP) N1 and late positive component (LPC), and EEG rhythms associated with fNIRS components (oxyHb and deoxy-Hb). The main results of this study highlighted, in Task 1, a higher fNIRS oxy-Hb response during SC and a positive correlation with the delta rhythm in the central and parietal EEG region of interest. In Session 2, the N1 OERP highlighted a greater amplitude in SC. A negative correlation was found in HC for the deoxy-Hb parietal with frontal and central N1, and for the oxy-Hb frontal with N1 in the frontal, central and parietal regions of interests (ROIs). A negative correlation was found in parietal LPC amplitude with central deoxy-Hb. The data suggest that cross-modal valence modifies the attentional olfactory response and that the dorsal cortical/metabolic pathways are involved in these responses. This can be considered as an important starting point for understanding integrated cognition, as the subject could perceive in an ecological context.

Systematic Review on Features Extracted from PPG Signals for the Detection of Atrial Fibrillation	PHEALTH 2019	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Wearable Micro and Nano Technologies for Personalized Health (pHealth)	JUN 10-12, 2019	Genoa, ITALY	Italian Sci Soc Biomed Informat, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Camber Engineers Genoa, European Federat Med Informat, HL7 Int, ISO TC 215, CEN TC 251		Atrial Fibrillation; AF; photoplethysmography; PPG; features	ESC GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; ACCURACY	Problem: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. It constitutes one of the leading cardiovascular health problems, affecting 33.5 million people of the world's population. AF detection is commonly made by an Electrocardiogram (EEG). Nevertheless, with the advances in biomedical sensors, innovative approaches have emerged on detecting AF based on the analysis of signals acquired by photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. Objective: This paper aims to provide a systematic review to determine the features that have been used to detect Atrial Fibrillation in PPG signals. Methods: A systematic review of six databases (Pubmed, Science Direct, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Engineering Village y Mendeley) was carried out following the PRISMA-DTA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses on Diagnostic Test Accuracy). Results: This article provides an analysis of the features extracted for the detection of Atrial Fibrillation in photoplethysmography signals from 16 studies. It was found 44 features: 29 were extracted from the signal analyzed in the time domain, 12 from the signal analyzed in the frequency domain, and 3 from the signal analyzed in the time-frequency domain. Conclusions: The systematic review allowed obtaining the features reported in the literature with higher performance in the detection of AF in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. It was possible to observe a clear tendency to analyze the PPG signal in the time domain, although some studies have obtained better performance in the classification of AF when analyzing features in the frequency and time-frequency domains.

Dissociating the effect of flavor and nicotine in smokeless tobacco products using electroencephalography: The case of wintergreen flavors	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						EEG; Nicotine; Flavor; Time-frequency decomposition; Smokeless tobacco; Addiction	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; BAND OSCILLATIONS; ODDBALL PARADIGM; CHEWING-GUM; P300; EEG; ALPHA; GAMMA; DEPRIVATION; INHIBITION	The increased consumption of tobacco products in recent years has been linked, among other factors, to the presence of added flavors. Although flavors are important in explaining consumption, their effects in the brain have until now been unexplored. In the present study, we investigated how electrophysiology can serve to dissociate the effects of nicotine and flavor. Participants attended 4 sessions (2-by-2 factorial design, with flavor and nicotine as within-subject factors), in each session an oddball task was performed before and after smokeless tobacco consumption. We explored the dissociation of neural responses to flavor and nicotine. While event-related potentials did not show modulation due to flavors, time-frequency showed a flavor-nicotine dissociation. Low-frequency activity (delta, theta and alpha) showed only effects of nicotine, and high-frequency activity (betal, beta2 and gamma) showed effects only susceptible to flavor. Flavors in smokeless tobacco not only made the product more desirable but also triggered the allocation of cognitive resources. This long-lasting effect of flavor may enhance the addictive potential of the tobacco product. Further research is being developed to determine the precise role of flavors in contributing to addiction. This is the first study investigating the neural effects of flavor (specifically wintergreen) in smokeless tobacco products. By understanding the effects of flavors in the brain we can explain the precipitants of tobacco consumption behaviors, and the addictive potential of flavors. Regulators will be able to determine if and in which amount flavors should be allowed in tobacco products.

J	Meyer, M; Endedijk, HM; van Ede, F; Hunnius, S				Meyer, Marlene; Endedijk, Hinke M.; van Ede, Freek; Hunnius, Sabine			Theta oscillations in 4-year-olds are sensitive to task engagement and task demands	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; EEG-THETA; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; INFANTS; ALPHA; ATTENTION; RHYTHM; RESPONSES	Top-down control processes are essential for guiding attention and working memory towards task-relevant information. Recently, theta oscillations were suggested as critical for these cognitive processes. Infant studies testing a mixture of bottom-up and top-down processes support adult theta findings. Yet, since infants cannot be instructed, it remains unclear to what extent theta oscillations are involved particularly in top-down control in early childhood. That is especially relevant towards school age when children need top-down control to solve the increasingly complex tasks. In this EEG study, we investigated whether theta-power in 4-year-olds is sensitive to task engagement and to different cognitive task demands. In a within-subjects design, children had three different instructions before watching videos including either no demands (No Task), language-related (Color-naming Task), or action-related (Imitation Task) demands. We analyzed children's theta-power (3-6 Hz) in two contrasts: (1) Task vs. No Task and (2) Color-naming vs. Imitation Task. The findings revealed more frontomedial theta-power when children were engaged in a task and their frontomedial theta-power increased during their cognitive engagement. Theta-power was stronger over left fronto-temporal sites for language-compared to action-related demands. These findings support recent theoretical work highlighting theta oscillations in top-down control and extend this neurocognitive framework to preschoolers.

J	Biswas, A; Ray, S				Biswas, Ankan; Ray, Supratim			Alpha Neurofeedback Has a Positive Effect for Participants Who Are Unable to Sustain Their Alpha Activity	ENEURO			English	Article						alpha rhythm; EEG; neurofeedback	FEEDBACK-CONTROL; BIOFEEDBACK; OSCILLATIONS; ANXIETY; ENHANCEMENT; SUPPRESSION; INHIBITION; NETWORK; RHYTHMS	Alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) is linked to relaxed mental state in humans. Earlier reports have shown that individuals can increase their alpha power if provided with a valid feedback, compared to controls who are provided invalid feedback. However, these results remain controversial, partly because controls may be in a different behavioral state, making it difficult to directly compare their alpha power with the valid group. We here address this issue by using an experimental paradigm in which an invalid feedback is given on a fraction of trials, such that both valid and invalid conditions can be obtained from the same participant. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we recorded alpha power from the occipital area from 24 humans (nine females) and played a feedback tone which could be valid (tone frequency proportional to alpha power), invalid (tone sequence from a previous valid trial; participants were unaware of this condition), or neutral (constant tone frequency). We found that during eyes closed-state, neurofeedback did not enhance alpha activity beyond pre-trained state within the experimental duration, probably because of saturation of alpha rhythmicity. However, for participants whose alpha power decreased over time within a trial, valid feedback helped them to sustain alpha more than invalid feedback. Further, alpha increase showed a weak negative correlation with their self-reported attentional load but was uncorrelated with relaxation levels. Our results reconcile many conflicting reports in the neurofeedback literature, and show that even under most stringent control, valid neurofeedback can help participants who are otherwise unable to sustain their alpha activity.

EEG can predict speech intelligibility	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; stimulus-response correlation; speech comprehension; speech intelligibility	CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; NEURAL RESPONSES; COCKTAIL PARTY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; ATTENTION; ENVELOPE; MOVEMENT; TRACKING; RELIES	Objective. Speech signals have a remarkable ability to entrain brain activity to the rapid fluctuations of speech sounds. For instance, one can readily measure a correlation of the sound amplitude with the evoked responses of the electroencephalogram (EEG), and the strength of this correlation is indicative of whether the listener is attending to the speech. In this study we asked whether this stimulus-response correlation is also predictive of speech intelligibility. Approach. We hypothesized that when a listener fails to understand the speech in adverse hearing conditions, attention wanes and stimulus-response correlation also drops. To test this, we measure a listener's ability to detect words in noisy speech while recording their brain activity using EEG. We alter intelligibility without changing the acoustic stimulus by pairing it with congruent and incongruent visual speech. Main results. For almost all subjects we found that an improvement in speech detection coincided with an increase in correlation between the noisy speech and the EEG measured over a period of 30min. Significance. We conclude that simultaneous recordings of the perceived sound and the corresponding EEG response may be a practical tool to assess speech intelligibility in the context of hearing aids.

Background EEG connectivity captures the time-course of epileptogenesis in a mouse model of epilepsy	ENEURO			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; KAINIC ACID MODEL; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; SEIZURES; SPIKES; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; INJECTION; FEATURES	Large-scale brain networks are increasingly recognized as important for the generation of seizures in epilepsy. However, how a network evolves from a healthy state through the process of epileptogenesis remains unclear. To address this question, here, we study longitudinal epicranial background EEG recordings (30 electrodes, EEG free from epileptiform activity) of a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We analyse functional connectivity networks and observe that over the time-course of epileptogenesis the networks become increasingly asymmetric. Furthermore, computational modelling reveals that a set of nodes, located outside of the region of initial insult, emerges as particularly important for the network dynamics These findings are consistent with experimental observations, thus demonstrating that ictogenic mechanisms can be revealed on the EEG, that computational models can be used to monitor unfolding epileptogenesis and that both the primary focus and epileptic network play a role in epileptogenesis.

This study aimed to evaluate an integrated model for estimating cortisol levels in elderly people. Material/Methods: Sixty-four participants were included. Saliva cortisol levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cognitive function was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). EEG recording was performed during the eyes-opened resting state condition. QEEG in five frequency bands and ten ratios were analyzed. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to estimate cortisol levels based on the QEEG index, age and cognitive function. Results: The first model using the QEEG index estimated cortisol levels with an accuracy of 15.4%. The second model based on the QEEG index and age estimated cortisol levels with an accuracy of 24.3%. The third model based on the QEEG index and cognitive impairment estimated cortisol levels with an accuracy of 20.2%. The fourth model yielded the best results, estimating cortisol levels with an accuracy of 30.8%; this model was based on age, delayed recall and the QEEG index of the beta/high beta band at the central region and the delta/beta band at the left temporal region Conclusions: An integrated model of the QEEG index, age and delayed recall can be used to estimate cortisol levels in elderly people, which could be possibly used to predict physiological and psychiatric changes in humans.

Value-driven attentional capture is modulated by the contents of working memory: An EEG study	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Working memory; Alpha power; Value; Attentional capture	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; TOP-DOWN; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; COMPONENTS; GUIDANCE; CORTEX; THETA; SET	Attention and working memory (WM) have previously been shown to interact closely when sensory information is being maintained. However, when non-sensory information is maintained in WM, the relationship between WM and sensory attention may be less strong. In the current study, we used electroencephalography to evaluate whether value-driven attentional capture (i.e., allocation of attention to a task-irrelevant feature previously associated with a reward) and its effects on either sensory or non-sensory WM performance might be greater than the effects of salient, non-reward-associated stimuli. In a training phase, 19 participants learned to associate a color with reward. Then, participants were presented with squares and encoded their locations into WM. Participants were instructed to convert the spatial locations either to another type of sensory representation or to an abstract, relational type of representation. During the WM delay period, task-irrelevant distractors, either previously-rewarded or non-rewarded, were presented, with a novel color distractor in the other hemifield. The results revealed lower alpha power and larger N2pc amplitude over posterior electrode sides contralateral to the previously rewarded color, compared to ipsilateral. These effects were mainly found during relational WM, compared to sensory WM, and only for the previously rewarded distractor color, compared to a previous non-rewarded target color or novel color. These effects were associated with modulations of WM performance. These results appear to reflect less capture of attention during maintenance of specific location information, and suggest that value-driven attentional capture can be mitigated as a function of the type of information maintained in WM.

Due to the novelty of the concept, various measures are used in the literature to calculate phase-amplitude coupling. Here, performance of the three most widely used phase-amplitude coupling measures - phase-locking value (PLV), mean vector length (MVL), and modulation index (MI) - and of the generalized linear modeling cross-frequency coupling (GLM-CFC) method is thoroughly compared with the help of simulated data. We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all four indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all four indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the MVL was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, only the MI and GLM-CFC can detect biphasic coupling. Coupling values of all four indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The MI was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators. Based on our analyses, we recommend the MI for noisy and short data epochs with unknown forms of coupling. For high quality and long data epochs with monophasic coupling and a high signal-to-noise ratio, the use of the MVL is recommended. Ideally, both indices are reported simultaneously for one data set.

An objective, automated method that predicts clinical outcomes in depression is essential for increasing the accuracy of depression recognition and treatments. This paper aims at better recognizing depression using the transformation of EEG features and machine learning methods. An experiment based on emotional face stimuli task was conducted, and twenty-eight subjects' EEG data were recorded from 128-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN) by Net Station software. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used by psychiatrists as the criterion for diagnosis of depression patients. The power spectral density and activity were respectively extracted as original features using Auto-regress model and Hjorth algorithm with different time windows. Two separate approaches processed the features: ensemble learning and deep learning. For the ensemble learning, a deep forest transformed the original features to new features that potentially improve feature engineering and a support vector machine (SVM) that was applied as classifier. For deep learning method, we added spatial information of EEG caps to both features by image conversion and adopted convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize them. The performance of both methods was evaluated for separated and total frequency bands. As a result, the best accuracy obtained was 89.02% when we used the ensemble model and power spectral density. The best accuracy of deep learning method was 84.75% using the activity. These experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed methods and show that EEG could be used as a reliable indicator for depression recognition, which makes it possible for EEG-based portable system design and application in auxiliary depression recognition in the future.

Electroencephalograms were recorded in 30 healthy participants who were asked to press buttons classifying their spontaneous thoughts as self-referential or non-self-referential. EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis in conjunction with dipole localization. Self-referential thoughts, as compared to non-self-referential thoughts, were accompanied by more pronounced decreases of theta, alpha, and beta spectral power in the anterior hub of the default-mode network, in the left lateral prefrontal, motor/somatosensory, and temporal cortices. These oscillatory dynamics are interpreted as a reflection of autobiographical memory retrieval intrinsic to self-referential thoughts.

J	Rodriguez-Larios, J; Alaerts, K				Rodriguez-Larios, Julio; Alaerts, Kaat			Tracking Transient Changes in the Neural Frequency Architecture: Harmonic Relationships between Theta and Alpha Peaks Facilitate Cognitive Performance	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; cross-frequency coupling; EEG; theta oscillations; working memory	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; COMMUNICATION; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS; GAMMA	The synchronization between neural oscillations at different frequencies has been proposed as a core mechanism for the coordination and integration of neural systems at different spatiotemporal scales. Because neural oscillations of different frequencies can only fully synchronize when their "peak" frequencies form harmonic relationships (e.g.,f(2) = f(1)/2), the present study explored whether the transient occurrence of harmonic cross-frequency relationship between task-relevant rhythms underlies efficient cognitive processing. Continuous EEG recordings (51 human participants; 14 males) were obtained during an arithmetic task, rest and breath focus. In two separate experiments, we consistently show that the proportion of epochs displaying a 2:1 harmonic relationship between alpha (8-14 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) peak frequencies (i.e., alpha(peak) approximate to 10.6 Hz; theta(peak) approximate to 5.3 Hz), was significantly higher when cognitive demands increased. In addition, a higher incidence of 2: 1 harmonic cross-frequency relationships was significantly associated with increased alpha-theta phase synchrony and improved arithmetic task performance, thereby underlining the functional relevance of this cross-frequency configuration. Notably, opposite dynamics were identified for a specific range of "nonharmonic" alpha-theta cross-frequency relationships (i.e., alpha(peak)/theta(peak) = 1.1-1.6), which showed a higher incidence during rest compared with the arithmetic task. The observation that alpha and theta rhythms shifted into harmonic versus nonharmonic cross-frequency relationships depending on (cognitive) task demands is in line with the notion that the neural frequency architecture entails optimal frequency arrangements to facilitate cross-frequency "coupling" and "decoupling".

Early seizure detection for closed loop direct neurostimulation devices in epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						responsive neurostimulation; machine learning; convolutional neural networks; intracranial EEG; epilepsy	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; BRAIN-RESPONSIVE NEUROSTIMULATION; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; REAL-TIME DETECTION; LONG-TERM; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION; DETECTION ALGORITHM; ANTERIOR NUCLEUS	Current treatment concepts for epilepsy are based on continuous drug delivery or electrical stimulation to prevent the occurrence of seizures, exposing the brain and body to a mostly unneeded risk of adverse effects. To address the infrequent occurrence and short duration of epileptic seizures, intelligent implantable closed-loop devices are needed which are based on a refined analysis of ongoing brain activity with highly specific and fast detection algorithms to allow for timely, ictal interventions. Since the development and FDA approval of a first closed loop neurostimulation device relying on simple threshold-based approaches, machine learning approaches became widely available, probably outperformed in the near future by deep convolutional neural networks, which already showed to be extremely successful in pattern recognition in images and partly in signal analysis. Handcrafted features or rules defined by experts become replaced by systematic feature selection procedures and systematic hyperparameter search approaches. Training of these classifiers augments the need of large databases with intracranial EEG recordings, which is partly given by existing databases but potentially can be replaced by continuously transferring data from implanted devices and their publication for research purposes. Already in early design states, the final target hardware must be taken into account for algorithm development. Size, power consumption and, as a consequence, limited computational resources given by low power microcontrollers, FPGAs and ASICS limit the complexity of feature computation, classifier complexity, and the numbers and complexity of layers of deep neuronal networks. Novel approaches for early seizure detection will be a key module for new generations of closed-loop devices together with improved low power implant hardware and will provide together with more efficient intervention paradigms new treatment options for patients with difficult to treat epilepsy.

Constructing brain connectivity group graphs from EEG time series	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Brain functional connectivity; EEG time series; graphical model; multivariable power spectra; schizophrenia; spectral matrix clustering	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; NETWORKS; COHERENCE	Graphical analysis of complex brain networks is a fundamental area of modern neuroscience. Functional connectivity is important since many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, are described as 'dys-connectivity' syndromes. Using electroencephalogram time series collected on each of a group of 15 individuals with a common medical diagnosis of positive syndrome schizophrenia we seek to build a single, representative, brain functional connectivity group graph. Disparity/distance measures between spectral matrices are identified and used to define the normalized graph Laplacian enabling clustering of the spectral matrices for detecting 'outlying' individuals. Two such individuals are identified. For each remaining individual, we derive a test for each edge in the connectivity graph based on average estimated partial coherence over frequencies, and associated p-values are found. For each edge these are used in a multiple hypothesis test across individuals and the proportion rejecting the hypothesis of no edge is used to construct a connectivity group graph. This study provides a framework for integrating results on multiple individuals into a single overall connectivity structure.	[Walden, A.

Little is known whether GHB's efficacy reflects the promotion of physiological sleep mechanisms and no study has investigated its sleep consolidating effects under low sleep pressure. GHB (50 mg/kg p.o.) and placebo were administered in 20 young male volunteers at 2:30 a.m., the time when GHB is typically given in narcolepsy, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover manner. Drug effects on sleep architecture and electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep spectra were analyzed. In addition, current source density (CSD) analysis was employed to identify the effects of GHB on the brain electrical sources of neuronal oscillations. Moreover, lagged-phase synchronization (LPS) analysis was applied to quantify the functional connectivity among sleep-relevant brain regions. GHB prolonged slow-wave sleep (stage N3) at the cost of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Furthermore, it enhanced delta-theta (0.5-8 Hz) activity in NREM and REM sleep, while reducing activity in the spindle frequency range (13-15 Hz) in sleep stage N2. The increase in delta power predominated in medial prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal and fusiform gyri, and posterior cingulate cortex. Theta power was particularly increased in the prefrontal cortex and both temporal poles. Moreover, the brain areas that showed increased theta power after GHB also exhibited increased lagged-phase synchronization among each other. Our study in healthy men revealed distinct similarities between GHB-augmented sleep and physiologically augmented sleep as seen in recovery sleep after prolonged wakefulness. The promotion of the sleep neurophysiological mechanisms by GHB may thus provide a rationale for GHB-induced sleep and waking quality in neuropsychiatric disorders beyond narcolepsy.

This selection process is aided by prior knowledge of the features, location, and temporal proximity of an upcoming stimulus. In the laboratory, this knowledge is often conveyed by cues, preceding a task-relevant target stimulus. Response speed in cued selection tasks varies within and across participants and is often thought to index efficient selection of a cued feature, location, or moment in time. The present study used a reverse correlation approach to identify neural predictors of efficient target discrimination: Participants identified the orientation of a sinusoidal grating, which was presented in one hemifield following the presentation of bilateral visual cues that carried temporal but not spatial information about the target. Across different analytic approaches, faster target responses were predicted by larger alpha power preceding the target. These results suggest that heightened pre-target alpha power during a cue period may index a state that is beneficial for subsequent target processing. Our findings are broadly consistent with models that emphasize capacity sharing across time, as well as models that link alpha oscillations to temporal predictions regarding upcoming events.

Discrimination of Movement-Related Cortical Potentials Exploiting Unsupervised Learned Representations From ECoGs	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; electrocoticogram (ECoG); generative model; minimum description length (MDL); representation learning; temporal marked point process	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MACHINE INTERFACES; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HIGH-GAMMA; K-SVD; EEG; ALPHA; PHASE	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aim to bypass the peripheral nervous system to link the brain to external devices via successful modeling of decoding mechanisms. BCI based on electrocorticogram or ECoG represent a viable compromise between clinical practicality, spatial resolution, and signal quality when it comes to extracellular electrical potentials from local neuronal assemblies. Classic analysis of ECoG traces usually falls under the umbrella of Time-Frequency decompositions with adaptations from Fourier analysis and wavelets as its most prominent variants. However, analyzing such high-dimensional, multivariate time series demands for specialized signal processing and neurophysiological principles. We propose a generative model for single-channel ECoGs that is able to fully characterize reoccurring rhythm-specific neuromodulations as weighted activations of prototypical templates over time. The set of timings, weights and indexes comprise a temporal marked point process (TMPP) that accesses a set of bases from vector spaces of different dimensions-a dictionary. The shallow nature of the model admits the equivalence between latent variables and representations. In this way, learning the model parameters is a case of unsupervised representation learning. We exploit principles of Minimum Description Length (MDL) encoding to effectively yield a data-driven framework where prototypical neuromodulations (not restricted to a particular duration) can be estimated alongside the timings and features of the TMPP. We validate the proposed methodology on discrimination of movement-related tasks utilizing 32-electrode grids implanted in the frontal cortex of six epileptic subjects. We show that the learned representations from the high-gamma band (85-145 Hz) are not only interpretable, but also discriminant in a lower dimensional space. The results also underscore the practicality of our algorithm, i.e., 2 main hyperparameters that can be readily set via neurophysiology, and emphasize the need of principled and interpretable representation learning in order to model encoding mechanisms in the brain.

For focal MRE, seizures originate in the epileptogenic zone (EZ), which is the minimum amount of cortex that must be treated to be seizure free. Localizing the EZ is often a laborious process wherein clinicians first inspect scalp EEG recordings during several seizure events, and then formulate an implantation plan for subsequent invasive monitoring. The goal of implantation is to place electrodes into the brain region covering the EZ. Then, during invasive monitoring, clinicians visually inspect intracranial EEG recordings to more precisely localize the EZ. Finally, the EZ is then surgically ablated, removed or treated with electrical stimulation. Unfortunately success rates average at 50%. Such grim outcomes call for analytical assistance in creating more accurate implantation plans from scalp EEG. In this paper, we introduce a method that combines imaging data (CT and MRI scans) with scalp EEG to derive an implantation distribution. Specifically, scalp EEG data recorded over a seizure event is converted into a time-gamma frequency map, which is then processed to derive a spectrally annotated implantation distribution (SAID). The SAID represents a distribution of gamma power in each of eight cortical lobe/hemisphere partitions. We applied this method to 4 MRE patients who underwent treatment, and found that the SAID distribution overlapped more with clinical implantations in success cases than in failed cases. These preliminary findings suggest that the SAID may help in improving EZ localization accuracy and surgical outcomes.

J	Tanaka, H; Miyakoshi, M				Tanaka, Hirokazu; Miyakoshi, Makoto			Cross-correlation task-related component analysis (xTRCA) for enhancing evoked and induced responses of event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG data analysis; Multivariate analysis; Trial-by-trial reproducibility; Generalized eigenvalue problem; Matrix perturbation; Woody's method; Evoked response; Induced response	SPATIAL FILTERS; ERP COMPONENTS; LATENCY; VARIABILITY; RELIABILITY; DYNAMICS; SIGNALS; P3A	We propose an analysis method that extracts trial-reproducible (i.e., recurring) event-related spatiotemporal EEG patterns by optimizing a spatial filter as well as trial timings of task-related components in the time domain simultaneously in a unified manner. Event-related responses are broadly categorized into evoked and induced responses, but those are analyzed commonly in the time and the time-frequency domain, respectively. To facilitate a comparison of evoked and induced responses, a unified method for analyzing both evoked and induced responses is desired. Here we propose a method of cross-correlation task-related component analysis (xTRCA) as an extension of our previous method. xTRCA constructs a linear spatial filter and then optimizes trial timings of single trials based on trial reproducibility as an objective function. The spatial filter enhances event-related responses, and the temporal optimization compensates trial-by-trial latencies that are inherent to ERPs. We first applied xTRCA to synthetic data of induced responses whose phases varied from trial to trial, and found that xTRCA could realign the induced responses by compensating the phase differences. We then demonstrated with mismatch negativity data that xTRCA enhanced the event-related-potential waveform observed at a single channel. Finally, a classification accuracy was improved when trial timings were optimized by xTRCA, suggesting a practical application of the method for a brain computer interface. We conclude that xTRCA provides a unified framework to analyze and enhance event-related evoked and induced responses in the time domain by objectively maximizing trial reproducibility.

Various techniques, including MRI, PET, single-photon emission CT, video-EEG, magneto-encephalography and invasive EEG, aim to identify the diseased brain tissue and the involved network. Recent technical and methodological developments, encompassing both advances in existing techniques and new combinations of technologies, are enhancing the ability to define the optimal resection strategy. Multimodal interpretation and predictive computer models are expected to aid surgical planning and patient counselling, and multimodal intraoperative guidance is likely to increase surgical precision. In this Review, we discuss how the knowledge derived from these new approaches is challenging our way of thinking about surgery to stop focal seizures. In particular, we highlight the importance of looking beyond the EEG seizure onset zone and considering focal epilepsy as a brain network disease in which long-range connections need to be taken into account. We also explore how new diagnostic techniques are revealing essential information in the brain that was previously hidden from view.

Synchronization of Sensory Gamma Oscillations Promotes Multisensory Communication	ENEURO			English	Article						coherence; communication; EEG; gamma; networks; tACS	BAND RESPONSES; EEG; BRAIN; ALPHA; STIMULATION; INTEGRATION; MODULATION; BINDING; CORTEX; FIELD	Rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma range is a signature of cortical processing and its synchronization across distant sites has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism of network interactions. While this has been shown within sensory streams, we tested whether cross talk between the senses relies on similar mechanisms. Direct sensory interactions in humans (male and female) were studied with a visual-tactile amplitude matching paradigm. In this task, congruent stimuli are associated with behavioral benefits, which are proposed to be mediated by increased binding between sensory cortices through coherent gamma oscillations. We tested this hypothesis by applying 4-in-1 multi-electrode transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with 40 Hz over visual and somatosensory cortices. In phase stimulation (0 degrees) was expected to strengthen binding and thereby enhance the congruence effect, while anti-phase (180 degrees) stimulation was expected to have opposite effects. Gamma tACS was controlled by alpha (10 Hz) and sham stimulation, as well as by applying tACS unilaterally while visual-tactile stimuli were presented lateralized. Contrary to our expectations, gamma tACS over the relevant hemisphere delayed responses to congruent trials. Additionally, reanalysis of EEG data revealed decoupling of sensory gamma oscillations during congruent trials. We propose that gamma tACS prevented sensory decoupling and thereby limited the congruence effect. Together, our results favor the perspective that processing multisensory congruence involves corticocortical communication rather than feature binding. Furthermore, we found control stimulation over the irrelevant hemisphere to speed responses under alpha stimulation and to delay responses under gamma stimulation, consistent with the idea that contralateral alpha/gamma dynamics regulate cortical excitability.

The utility of HFO in planning the surgery, though, is unclear. Reasons include the variability of the HFO across patients and brain regions and the influence of the sleep-wake cycle, which causes large fluctuations in the ratio between the HFO observed in SOZ and non-SOZ regions. To cope with these limitations, a rank-based solution is proposed to identify the SOZ by using the HFO in multichannel intracranial EEG. A time-varying index of the epileptic susceptibility of the different brain areas is derived from the HFO rate and a support vector machine is applied on this index to identify the SOZ. The solution is trained and tested on separate groups of patients to avoid the use of patient-specific information and provides optimal SOZ prediction using as little as 30 min of recordings per channel (window). Tested on 14 patients with various combinations of seizure type, epilepsy etiology, and SOZ arrangement (172.7 +/- 90.1 h/channel per patient and 75.6 +/- 23.5 channels/patient, mean +/- S.D.), our solution identified the SOZ with 0.92 +/- 0.03 accuracy and 0.91 +/- 0.03 area under the ROC curve (mean +/- S.D.) across patients. For each patient, the window onset time was varied over 72 continuous hours and the prediction of the SOZ remained insensitive to the onset time, thus showing potential for surgery planning.

In their usage of the electrophysiological recordings, most of the proposals thus far have followed the conventional practise of employing all frequency bands following signal decomposition as input features for a classifier. Although seemingly powerful, this approach may prove counterproductive since some frequency bins may not carry relevant information about seizure episodes and may, instead, add noise to the classification process thus degrading performance. A key thesis of the work described here is that the selection of frequency subsets may enhance seizure classification rates. Additionally, the authors explore whether a conservative selection of frequency bins can reduce the amount of training data needed for achieving good classification performance. They have found compelling evidence that using spectral components with <25 Hz frequency in scalp electroencephalograms can yield state-of-the-art classification accuracy while reducing training data requirements to just a tenth of those employed by current approaches.

REM sleep is usually considered as a unitary state in neuroscientific research; however, it is composed of two different microstates: phasic and tonic REM. These differ in awakening thresholds, sensory processing, and cortical oscillations. Nevertheless, studies examining cortical oscillations during REM microstates are scarce, and used low spatial sampling. Here, we analyzed the data of 18 healthy individuals assessed by highdensity sleep EEG recordings. We systematically contrasted phasic and tonic REM periods in terms of topographical distribution, source localization, as well as local, global and long-range synchronization of frequency-specific cortical activity. Tonic periods showed relatively increased high alpha and beta power over frontocentral derivations. In addition, higher frequency components of beta power exhibited increased global synchronization during tonic compared to phasic states. In contrast, in phasic periods we found increased power and synchronization of low frequency oscillations coexisting with increased and synchronized gamma activity. Source localization revealed several multimodal, higher-order associative, as well as sensorimotor areas as potential sources of increased high alpha/beta power during tonic compared to phasic REM. Increased gamma power in phasic REM was attributed to medial prefrontal and right lateralized temporal areas associated with emotional processing. Our findings emphasize the heterogeneous nature of REM sleep, expressed in two microstates with remarkably different neural activity. Considering the microarchitecture of REM sleep may provide new insights into the mechanisms of REM sleep in health and disease.

In this study, predatory responses and dynamic brain activities were evaluated in the Emei music frog (Nidirana daunchina) to assess the potential eye preferences and their underlying dynamic neural mechanism, using behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, respectively. To do this, when the prey stimulus (live cricket and leaf as control) was moved around the frogs in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions at constant velocity, the number of predatory responses were counted and electroencephalogram (EEG) absolute power spectra for each band were measured for the telencephalon, diencephalon and mesencephalon. The results showed that: (1) no significant differences in the number of predatory responses could be found for the control (leaf), but the number of predatory responses for the right visual field (RVF) was significantly greater than that for the left visual field (LVF) when the live cricket was moved into the RVF clockwise; (2) compared with no stimulus in the visual field and stimulus in the LVF, the power spectra of each EEG band were greater when the prey stimulus was moved into the RVF clockwise; and (3) the power spectra of the theta, alpha and beta bands in the left diencephalon were significantly greater than those of the right counterpart for the clockwise direction, but similar significant differences presented for the delta, theta and alpha bands in the anticlockwise direction. Together, the results suggested that right-eye preferences for predatory behaviors exist in music frogs, and that the dynamics of EEG oscillations might underlie this right eye/left hemisphere advantage.

Whether resting state changes are carried over to stimulus-evoked activity, however, is unclear. We conducted a combined rest (3 min) and task (three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm) EEG study in n=28 acute depressed MDD patients, comparing them with n=25 healthy participants. Our focus was on the temporal dynamics of both resting state and stimulus-evoked activity for which reason we measured peak frequency (PF), coefficient of variation (CV), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), and trial-to-trial variability (TTV). Our main findings are: i) atypical temporal dynamics in resting state, specifically in the alpha and theta bands as measured by peak frequency (PF), coefficient of variation (CV) and power; ii) decreased reactivity to external deviant stimuli as measured by decreased changes in stimulus-evoked variance and complexity-TTV, LZC, and power and frequency sliding (FS and PS); iii) correlation of stimulus related measures (TTV, LZC, PS, and FS) with resting state measures. Together, our findings show that resting state dynamics alone are atypical in MDD and, even more important, strongly shapes the dynamics of subsequent stimulus-evoked activity. We thus conclude that MDD can be characterized by an atypical temporal dynamic of its rest-stimulus interaction; that, in turn, makes it difficult for depressed patients to react to relevant stimuli such as the deviant tone in our paradigm.

Preclinical Alzheimer's disease EEG changes would be non-invasive and cheap screening tools and could also help to predict future progression to clinical Alzheimer's disease. However, the impact of amyloid-beta deposition and neurodegeneration on EEG biomarkers needs to be elucidated. We included participants from the INSIGHT-preAD cohort, which is an ongoing single-centre multimodal observational study that was designed to identify risk factors and markers of progression to clinical Alzheimer's disease in 318 cognitively normal individuals aged 70-85 years with a subjective memory complaint. We divided the subjects into four groups, according to their amyloid status (based on F-18-florbetapir PET) and neurodegeneration status (evidenced by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET brain metabolism in Alzheimer's disease signature regions). The first group was amyloid-positive and neurodegeneration-positive, which corresponds to stage 2 of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The second group was amyloid-positive and neurodegeneration-negative, which corresponds to stage 1 of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The third group was amyloid-negative and neurodegeneration-positive, which corresponds to suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology'. The last group was the control group, defined by amyloid-negative and neurodegeneration-negative subjects. We analysed 314 baseline 256-channel high-density eyes closed 1-min resting state EEG recordings. EEG biomarkers included spectral measures, algorithmic complexity and functional connectivity assessed with a novel information-theoretic measure, weighted symbolic mutual information. The most prominent effects of neurodegeneration on EEG metrics were localized in frontocentral regions with an increase in high frequency oscillations (higher beta and gamma power) and a decrease in low frequency oscillations (lower delta power), higher spectral entropy, higher complexity and increased functional connectivity measured by weighted symbolic mutual information in theta band. Neurodegeneration was associated with a widespread increase of median spectral frequency. We found a non-linear relationship between amyloid burden and EEG metrics in neurodegeneration-positive subjects, either following a U-shape curve for delta power or an inverted U-shape curve for the other metrics, meaning that EEG patterns are modulated differently depending on the degree of amyloid burden. This finding suggests initial compensatory mechanisms that are overwhelmed for the highest amyloid load. Together, these results indicate that EEG metrics are useful biomarkers for the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease.

The coefficients of photic driving and holding and the energy increase times gained in EEG patterns of patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy differ significantly from the parameters determined for the healthy subjects. When studying the changes occurring in reactive EEG patterns under the influence of rhythmic photostimulation, it was shown that various disorders of the functional state of the nervous system arising in vascular pathology of the brain of varying severity (initial manifestations in the form of vegetative vascular dystonia, more pronounced manifestations as a result of hypertension and vertebrobasilar insufficiency), manifest themselves as features of the brain to respond in a certain way to a given rhythm. It was shown that a healthy person is characterized by the absence of a reaction to assimilate an external rhythm or an insignificance of this reaction, associated with the absence of an increase in the energy of the wavelet spectrum near the frequency of photostimulation, which reflects the predominance of internal synchronization of the neural structures of a healthy brain. With an increase in the instability of neurodynamic processes, leading to the involvement of a larger number of neural ensembles in the pathological process, the destruction of internal synchronization occurs, which explains the increase in the quantitative indicators of the rhythm assimilation reaction in persons with essential hypertension and with vertebral-basilar insufficiency.

The identification and recognition of a facial expression might be represented by event-related brain oscillations. The present study aims to analyze EEG event-related oscillations and determine the electrophysiological indicators of impaired facial expression recognition in AD patients. EEGs of 30 healthy controls and 30 AD patients were recorded during their perception of three different facial expressions (angry, happy, neutral). Event-related power spectrum and phase locking were analyzed in the theta (4-7) and alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency bands with the EEGLAB open toolbox. There was a significant facial Expression x Group interaction (p < 0.05) for the theta power spectrum; the healthy control group had higher theta power than the AD group during the perception of angry facial expressions (p < 0.05). There was a significant hemisphere difference between the two groups (p < 0.05). There was a right hemisphere alpha power dominance in healthy subjects. However, AD patients did not have this alpha power asymmetry. The present study, for the first time in the literature, presents the electrophysiological indicators of impaired recognition of facial expression in AD patients. The current study could be a basis for future studies that will analyze emotional processing in different kinds of dementia patients, and this study may have provided indicators of electrophysiological correlates of behavioral problems observed in clinical practice.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be utilized as a biomarker for lateralizing the onset zone in suspected bitemporal epilepsy. Except subjective vision detect the HFOs, objective verification should be performed to raise the accuracy. In the present research, we prospectively studied 10 patients with refractory temporal seizures and who underwent ECoG with wide-band frequency amplifiers (2,048 Hz); all patients had a class I outcome after temporal resection. Pre- and ictal HFOs will be analyzed by wavelet transform (WT) and Granger causality (GC) to objectively verify lateralization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). WT analysis showed ictal HFOs in 10 patients mainly covered from 80 to 115 Hz (average, 92.59 +/- 10.23 Hz), and there was distinct bandpass boundary between pre-ictal HFOs and ictal HFOs. GC analysis showed five patients (2, 4, 5, 6, and 7), no matter the pre-ictal or ictal state, had the highest GC degree in SOZ itself. The remaining patients (1, 3, 8, 9, and 10) had the highest GC degree in SOZ with its adjacent regions in the pre-ictal and ictal stages. GC analysis further confirmed the result of the WT and suggested HFOs are initiated and propagated in the local brain region mainly, afterward, transmitting to adjacent brain regions. These results indicated that the combination of WT and GC analyses significantly contributes to accurate lateralization in patients with suspected bitemporal epilepsy.

Alpha modulation during working memory encoding predicts neurocognitive impairment in ADHD	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						ADHD; working memory; maintenance; visual attention; academic achievement; alpha oscillations; EEG	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ADULT ADHD; DEFICITS; GUANFACINE; CHILDREN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; STIMULANT	Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with working memory (WM) deficits. However, WM is a multiprocess construct that can be impaired through several pathways, leaving the source of WM impairments in ADHD unresolved. In this study, we aim to replicate, in an independent sample, previously reported deficits in component processes of WM deficits in ADHD and expand to consider their implications for neurocognitive outcomes. Methods In 119 children (7-14 years old, 85 with ADHD), we used electroencephalography measures to quantify component processes during performance of a spatial working memory task. We quantified stimulus encoding using alpha range (8-12 Hz) power; vigilance by the P2 event-related potential to cues; and WMmaintenance by occipital-alpha and frontal-theta (4-7 Hz) power. These measures were evaluated against metrics of executive function, ADHD symptoms, and academic achievement. Results Encoding alpha-power decreases and cue P2 amplitude were attenuated in ADHD, whereas occipital-alpha power during maintenance was significantly greater in ADHD, consistent with a compensatory response to weak encoding. Weak alpha modulation during encoding was associated with poorer reading comprehension and executive function, as well as enhanced ADHD symptoms. Previously reported effects in frontal-theta power failed to replicate. Conclusions Stimulus encoding, a component process of WM coupled to alpha modulation, is impaired in ADHD, and, unlike WM maintenance or vigilance processes, has implications outside of the laboratory via a relationship with executive function, and, to a weaker extent, reading comprehension.

When a patient has persistent symptoms after surgery, there are no tests that accurately predict whether a patient will have remnant epileptic foci. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a prognostic tool in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: From July 2012 to July 2016, 21 patients underwent preoperative and postoperative MEG at our center. Postoperative MEG was performed within 2 weeks after surgery. We analyzed MEG by estimating the time-frequency component of the signal to define gamma oscillations (GOs), which are an indicator of epileptogenic foci. We analyzed the relationship between GOs on MEG and surgical outcomes. RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 28.3 months (range, 13-44 months). At the last follow-up visit, patients were divided into 2 groups according to surgical outcome. All patients showed spike waves and GOs on preoperative electroencephalography and MEG. In the seizure control group (16 patients), spike waves (2 patients) and GOs (2 patients) were seen postoperatively despite absence of symptoms. In the recurrent seizure group (5 patients), whereas 3 patients showed spike waves, all 5 patients showed GOs on MEG postoperatively. There was a significant association between presence of GOs on postoperative MEG and surgical outcome (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MEG can provide valuable postsurgical information on epileptic foci in patients with recurrent symptoms; GOs on postoperative MEG were especially correlated with epileptic recurrence. Our data show that GOs on postoperative MEG may have prognostic value.

Despite increasing recognition of the disease as a multisystem network disorder characterised by impaired connectivity, the precise neuroelectric characteristics of impaired cortical communication remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we characterise changes in functional connectivity using beamformer source analysis on resting-state electroencephalography recordings from 74 ALS patients and 47 age-matched healthy controls. Spatiospectral characteristics of network changes in the ALS patient group were quantified by spectral power, amplitude envelope correlation (co-modulation) and imaginary coherence (synchrony). We show patterns of decreased spectral power in the occipital and temporal (delta- to beta-band), lateral/orbitofrontal (delta- to theta-band) and sensorimotor (beta-band) regions of the brain in patients with ALS. Furthermore, we show increased co-modulation of neural oscillations in the central and posterior (delta-, theta- and gamma(l)-band) and frontal (delta- and gamma(l)-band) regions, as well as decreased synchrony in the temporal and frontal (delta- to beta-band) and sensorimotor (beta-band) regions. Factorisation of these complex connectivity patterns reveals a distinct disruption of both motor and nonmotor networks. The observed changes in connectivity correlated with structural MRI changes, functional motor scores and cognitive scores. Characteristic patterned changes of cortical function in ALS signify widespread disease-associated network disruption, pointing to extensive dysfunction of both motor and cognitive networks. These statistically robust findings, that correlate with clinical scores, provide a strong rationale for further development as biomarkers of network disruption for future clinical trials.

Knowledge on the interplay between this regional brain self-regulation, distributed network entrainment and handedness is, however, limited. In a randomized cross-over design, twenty-one healthy subjects (twelve right-handers [RH], nine left-handers [LH]) performed kinesthetic motor imagery of left (48 trials) and right finger extension (48 trials). A brain-machine interface turned event-related desynchronization in the beta frequency-band (16-22 Hz) during motor imagery into passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis. Thereby, every participant subsequently activated either the dominant (DH) or non-dominant hemisphere (NDH) to control contralateral hand opening. The task-related cortical networks were studied with electroencephalography. The magnitude of the induced oscillatory modulation range in the sensorimotor cortex was independent of both handedness (RH, LH) and hemispheric specialization (DH, NDH). However, the regional beta-band modulation was associated with different alpha-band networks in RH and LH: RH presented a stronger inter-hemispheric connectivity, while LH revealed a stronger intra-hemispheric interaction. Notably, these distinct network entrainments were independent of hemispheric specialization. In healthy subjects, sensorimotor beta-band activity can be robustly modulated by motor imagery and proprioceptive feedback in both hemispheres independent of handedness. However, right and left handers show different oscillatory entrainment of cortical alpha-band networks during neurofeedback. This finding may inform neurofeedback interventions in future to align them more precisely with the underlying physiology.

Spectral Imprints of Working Memory for Everyday Associations in the Frontoparietal Network	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						working memory; prefrontal cortex; parietal cortex; oscillations; directional connectivity; iEEG; ECoG	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PARIETAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; TERM-MEMORY; CORTICES	How does the human brain rapidly process incoming information in working memory? In growing divergence from a single-region focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), recent work argues for emphasis on how distributed neural networks are rapidly coordinated in support of this central neurocognitive function. Previously, we showed that working memory for everyday "what," "where," and "when" associations depends on multiplexed oscillatory systems, in which signals of different frequencies simultaneously link the PFC to parieto-occipital and medial temporal regions, pointing to a complex web of subsecond, bidirectional interactions. Here, we used direct brain recordings to delineate the frontoparietal oscillatory correlates of working memory with high spatiotemporal precision. Seven intracranial patients with electrodes simultaneously localized to prefrontal and parietal cortices performed a visuospatial working memory task that operationalizes the types of identity and spatiotemporal information we encounter every day. First, task-induced oscillations in the same delta-theta (2-7 Hz) and alpha-beta (9-24 Hz) frequency ranges previously identified using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) carried information about the contents of working memory. Second, maintenance was linked to directional connectivity from the parietal cortex to the PFC. However, presentation of the test prompt to cue identity, spatial, or temporal information changed delta-theta coordination from a unidirectional, parietal-led system to a bidirectional, frontoparietal system. Third, the processing of spatiotemporal information was more bidirectional in the delta-theta range than was the processing of identity information, where alpha-beta connectivity did not exhibit sensitivity to the contents of working memory. These findings implicate a bidirectional delta-theta mechanism for frontoparietal control over the contents of working memory.

We also correlate the presence of ripples to the presence of interictal spikes, which are clinically recognized markers of epileptogenic activity. Our method combines feature-based agglomerative clustering and correlation-based community detection and was tested on scalp EEG from 3 children with epilepsy (age: 10 +/- 1 [mean +/- SD], 2 male, 1 female). For each patient, one epoch of EEG during wakefulness and one epoch during sleep (stage N2-N3) were considered (wakefulness: 12.57 +/- 3.39 min; sleep: 14.68 +/- 0.49 min, mean +/- SD). The proposed method showed high specificity in detecting ripples while rejecting artifacts and resulted in a minimal set of ripple templates that are consistent across patients and sleep condition. Also, the rate of ripples was higher in EEG channels that presented spikes (0.38 +/- 0.07 versus 0.24 +/- 0.07 ripples/min [mean +/- SD]). Altogether, results indicate that morphology and spectral content of scalp ripples may be patient-independent and specific to the epileptogenic activity, which suggest scalp ripples as viable markers for noninvasive epilepsy diagnosis.

The present study intended to compare the differences in electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectra and EEG brain sources between men and women during the exposure of affective music video stimuli. The multi-channel EEG signals of 15 males and 15 females available in the database for emotion analysis using physiological signals were studied, while subjects were watching sad, depressing, and fun music videos. Seven EEG frequency bands were computed using average Fourier cross-spectral matrices. Then, standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used to localize regions involved specifically in these emotional responses. To evaluate gender differences, independent sample t test was calculated for the sLORETA source powers. Our results showed that (1) the mean EEG power for all frequency bands in the women's group was significantly higher than that of the men's group; (2) spatial distribution differentiation between men and women was detected in all EEG frequency bands. (3) This difference has been related to the emotional stimuli, which was more evident for negative emotions. Taken together, our results showed that men and women recruited dissimilar brain networks for processing sad, depressing, and fun audio-visual stimuli.

Brain Activity Correlates With Cognitive Performance Deterioration During Sleep Deprivation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; error awareness test; sleep deprivation; performance; reactivity; response inhibition	VIGILANCE TASK; REACTION-TIME; EEG; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; ERRORS	We studied the correlation between oscillatory brain activity and performance in healthy subjects performing the error awareness task (EAT) every 2 h, for 24 h. In the EAT, subjects were shown on a screen the names of colors and were asked to press a key if the name of the color and the color it was shown in matched, and the screen was not a duplicate of the one before ("Go" trials). In the event of a duplicate screen ("Repeat No-Go" trial) or a color mismatch ("Stroop No-Go" trial), the subjects were asked to withhold from pressing the key. We assessed subjects' (N = 10) response inhibition by measuring accuracy of the "Stroop No-Go" (SNGacc) and "Repeat No-Go" trials (RNGacc). We assessed their reactivity by measuring reaction time in the "Go" trials (GRT). Simultaneously, nine electroencephalographic (EEG) channels were recorded (Fp(2), F-7, F-8, O-1, Oz, Pz, O-2, T-7, and T-8). The correlation between reactivity and response inhibition measures to brain activity was tested using quantitative measures of brain activity based on the relative power of gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta waves. In general, response inhibition and reactivity reached a steady level between 6 and 16 h of sleep deprivation, which was followed by sustained impairment after 18 h. Channels F-7 and Fp(2) had the highest correlation to the indices of performance. Measures of response inhibition (RNGacc and SNGacc) were correlated to the alpha and theta waves' power for most of the channels, especially in the F-7 channel (r = 0.82 and 0.84, respectively). The reactivity (GRT) exhibited the highest correlation to the power of gamma waves in channel Fp(2) (0.76). We conclude that quantitative measures of EEG provide information that can help us to better understand changes in subjects' performance and could be used as an indicator to prevent the adverse consequences of sleep deprivation.y	[Posada-Quintero, Hugo F.; Reljin, Natasa; Bolkhovsky, Jeffrey B.; Chon, Ki H.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Biomed Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Orjuela-Canon, Alvaro D.] Univ Antonio Narino, Fac Ingn Mecan Elect & Biomed, Bogota, Colombia		Posada-Quintero, HF (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Biomed Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.	h.posada@engr.uconn.edu	Posada-Quintero, Hugo F./E-2581-2016	Posada-Quintero, Hugo F./0000-0003-4514-4772; Reljin, Natasa/0000-0001-8799-9379; Orjuela-Canon, Alvaro David/0000-0002-2057-7603					43	13	13	1	5	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		1662-453X		FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ	Front.

However, from the user's point of view, a BCI system comprising a large number of channels is not desirable because of the lower comfort and extended application time. Therefore, the current trend in BCI design is to use the smallest number of channels possible. The problem is, however, that usually when we decrease the number of channels, the interface accuracy also drops significantly. In the paper, we examined whether it is possible to maintain the high accuracy of a BCI based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP-BCI) in a low-channel setup using a preprocessing procedure successfully used in a multichannel setting: independent component analysis (ICA). The influence of ICA on the BCI performance was measured in an off-line (24 subjects) mode and online (eight subjects) mode. In the off-line mode, we compared the number of correctly recognized different stimulation frequencies, and in the online mode, we compared the classification accuracy. In both experiments, we noted the predominance of signals that underwent ICA preprocessing. In the off-line mode, we detected 50% more stimulation frequencies after ICA preprocessing than before (in the case of four EEG channels), and in the online mode, we noted a classification accuracy increase of 8%. The most important results, however, were the results obtained for a very low luminance (350lx), where we noted 71% gain in the off-line mode and 11% gain in the online mode.

J	Malan, NS; Sharma, S				Malan, Nitesh Singh; Sharma, Shiru			Feature selection using regularized neighbourhood component analysis to enhance the classification performance of motor imagery signals	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Genetic algorithm; Motor imagery; Neighbourhood component analysis; Principal component analysis; Support vector machine	GENETIC ALGORITHM; BCI; OPTIMIZATION	In motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) signal analysis, mu and beta rhythms of electroencephalograms (EEGs) are widely investigated due to their high temporal resolution and capability to define the different movement-related mental tasks separately. However, due to the high dimensions and subject-specific behaviour of EEG features, there is a need for a suitable feature selection algorithm that can select the optimal features to give the best classification performance along with increased computational efficiency. The present study proposes a feature selection algorithm based on neighbourhood component analysis (NCA) with modification of the regularization parameter. In the experiment, time, frequency, and phase features of the EEG are extracted using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). Afterwards, the proposed algorithm selects the most significant EEG features, and using these selected features, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier performs the classification of MI signals. The proposed algorithm has been validated experimentally on two public BCI datasets (BCI Competition II Dataset III and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b). The classification performance of the algorithm is quantified by the average accuracy and kappa coefficient, whose values are 80.7% and 0.615 respectively. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with standard feature selection methods based on Genetic Algorithm (GA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and ReliefF and performs better than these methods. Further, the proposed algorithm selects the lowest number of features and results in increased computational efficiency, which makes it a promising feature selection tool for an MI-based BCI system.

Selective expression of inhibitory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) allows cell-type-specific reduction of neuronal excitability. In this study, we evaluated the effect of chemogenetic suppression of excitatory pyramidal and granule cell neurons of the sclerotic hippocampus in the intrahippocampal mouse model (IHKA) for temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods Intrahippocampal IHKA mice were injected with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying the genes for an inhibitory DREADD hM4Di in the sclerotic hippocampus or control vector. Next, animals were treated systemically with different single doses of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) and clozapine (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) and the effect on spontaneous hippocampal seizures, hippocampal electroencephalography (EEG) power, fast ripples (FRs) and behavior in the open field test was evaluated. Finally, animals received prolonged treatment with clozapine for 3 days and the effect on seizures was monitored. Results Treatment with both CNO and clozapine resulted in a robust suppression of hippocampal seizures for at least 15 hours only in DREADD-expressing animals. Moreover, total EEG power and the number of FRs were significantly reduced. CNO and/or clozapine had no effects on interictal hippocampal EEG, seizures, or locomotion/anxiety in the open field test in non-DREADD epileptic IHKA mice. Repeated clozapine treatment every 8 hours for 3 days resulted in almost complete seizure suppression in DREADD animals. Significance This study shows the potency of chemogenetics to robustly and sustainably suppress spontaneous epileptic seizures and pave the way for an epilepsy therapy in which a systemically administered exogenous drug selectively modulates specific cell types in a seizure network, leading to a potent seizure suppression devoid of the typical drug-related side effects.

The current study investigated the beta and mu rhythms of 16 children (7.7 +/- 1.5 years, 5 to 9.6 years) and 13 adults when a self-determining arm motion was performed. The results indicated that mu power was decreased during movement and returned to baseline level after the movement for both children and adults. However, although a decrease in beta power was observed for both children and adults during movement, the post-movement beta power rebound (PMBR) was observed in adults but not in children. These results suggest that motor-related mu suppression develops early in children; PMBR develops later and may be associated with a more prolonged motor development process.

Their delayed maturation and circuit integration, relative to excitatory neurons, suggest inhibitory neuronal development could be responsible for the onset of mature thalamocortical activity. Indeed, the immature brain lacks many inhibition-dependent activity patterns, such as slow-waves, delta oscillations and sleep-spindles, and instead expresses other unique oscillatory activities in multiple species including humans. Thalamus contributes significantly to the generation of these early oscillations. Compared to the abundance of studies on the development of inhibition in cortex, however, the maturation of thalamic inhibition is poorly understood. Here we review developmental changes in the neuronal and circuit properties of the thalamic relay and its interconnected inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) both in vitro and in vivo, and discuss their potential contribution to early network activity and its maturation. While much is unknown, we argue that weak inhibitory function in the developing thalamus allows for amplification of thalamocortical activity that supports the generation of early oscillations. The available evidence suggests that the developmental acquisition of critical thalamic oscillations such as slow-waves and sleep-spindles is driven by maturation of the TRN. Further studies to elucidate thalamic GABAergic circuit formation in relation to thalamocortical network function would help us better understand normal as well as pathological brain development.

However, whether and how TNS is able to modulate the electroencephalogram (EEG) background activity in patients with DRE is still unknown. Objectives: To investigate the effect of short-term TNS on EEG background activity in DRE by qualitative and quantitative analyses. Methods: Twenty-nine DRE patients participated in the study. Twenty-two were randomly divided into a "sham-TNS" or "real-TNS" group; seven patients underwent stimulation of the median nerve (MNS) at the wrist. Real-TNS was delivered bilaterally to the infraorbital nerve (trains of 1-20 mA, 120 Hz, cyclic modality for 20 min). The sham-TNS protocol mimicked the real-TNS one but at a zero intensity. For MNS, the same parameters as real-TNS were used. EEG was continuously acquired for 40 min: 10' pre, 20' during and 10' post stimulation. EEG was visually inspected for interictal epileptiform discharge (IEDs) changes and processed by spectral analysis for changes in mean frequency and absolute power of each frequency band. Results: A significant increase of EEG absolute alpha power was observed during real-TNS compared with the sham-TNS (F-34,F-680 = 1.748; p = 0.006). Conversely, no significant effects were noticed either for quantitative analysis of other frequency bands or for IEDs detection. MNS proved unable to modulate EEG activity. Conclusions: Short-term TNS induces an acute and specific effect on background EEG of DRE by increasing the absolute alpha band power. EEG alpha rhythm enhancement may index a cortical functional inhibition and act as a seizure-preventing mechanism.

However, brain mechanisms associated with hunger and neural circuitries that mediate hunger driven responses remained to be investigated. To understand neural signaling of hunger, local field potentials (LFPs) in the lateral hypothalamus (LHa), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal hippocampus (HP) and olfactory bulb (OB) and their interconnectivities were studied in freely moving adult male Albino mice during 18-20 h food deprivation and fed periods. Raw LFP signals were recorded and analyzed for mean values of spectral frequency power and coherence values. One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant increases in spectral powers of beta and gamma frequency ranges induced by food deprivation in the LHa, HP, NAc but not OB. No change of spectral power in these brain regions was induced by food feeding. The analyses of coherent activity between brain regions also deliniated some distributed neural network activities correlated with hunger. In particular, coherent function indicated the increased beta and gamma phase synchrony between the pairs of LHa-HP and NAc-OB regions, and decreased gamma synchrony between the pairs of LHa-NAc and NAc-HP induced by food deprivation. It was found that plasma glucose level, locomotor count, travelled distance and time spent on moving were not altered by food deprivation. These results suggest that changes in LFP hallmarks in these brain regions were associated with hunger driven by negative energy balance.

The two-dimensional arrays of micro-actuators were made either with planar geometry or with three-dimensional, semi-spherical or "dome" geometry. Subsequently, on both the behavioral and the electrophysiological level the haptic sensation received by the effector was evaluated on 6 subjects and compared to real stimulations of different grains (Paper). During the various stimulations the subject was in a state of Resting State (RS). Each stimulation had a frequency range ranging from 2 to 500 Hz on 2 and 5 s. Analysis of behavioral responses and the alpha rhythm in RS showed significant differences for low frequencies vs Paper. RS highlighted differences in ROIs on the various frequency distributions, especially low frequencies in Frontal ROI. This pilot study indicates that the best frequencies for a haptic simulation are between a range from 20 Hz to 166 Hz.

However, it remains unclear whether beta-gamma activity manifests individual differences in reinforcement learning processing. Given that individuals differ largely in reinforcement learning tasks, we adapted the Friedland task and split subjects into two groups: learners who learned to choose the optimal card after training and non-learners who did not learn well. We used recorded electroencephalography signals to test the difference in brain activity between the learners and non-learners groups when participants conducted a time estimation task and received win and loss feedback in expected and unexpected conditions. The results revealed that the unexpected condition elicited a larger reward positivity amplitude than did the expected condition, but only in the learners group. No significant difference was found between the two groups for the expectancy effect on frontal-midline theta. The current results thus demonstrate that for learners, unexpected win feedback elicits a larger beta-gamma oscillation than expected win feedback, while this was not the case for non-learners. These results indicate that betagamma oscillation may reflect effective learning from positive reward prediction error, a finding that adds to the existing theories on learning processes.

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an effective method for time-frequency analysis of EEG and has been used for seizure detection in daily healthcare monitoring systems. However, the shift variance, the lack of directionality and the substantial aliasing, limit the effects of DWT in some applications. Dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DTDWT) can overcome those drawbacks but may increase information redundancy. For classification tasks with small dataset sizes, such redundancy can greatly reduce learning efficiency and model performance. In this work, we proposed a novel redundancy removed DTDWT (RR-DTDWT) framework for automated seizure detection. Energy and modified multi-scale entropy (MMSE) features in a dual tree wavelet domain were extracted to construct a complete picture of mental states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ MMSE as an indicator of epileptic seizures. Moreover, a compact EEG representation can be obtained after removing useless information redundancy (redundancy between wavelet trees, adjacent channels and entropy scales) by a general auto-weighted feature selection framework via global redundancy minimization (AGRM). Through validation on Bonn and CHB-MIT databases, the proposed RR-DTDWT method can achieve better performance than previous studies.

Despite the interest in these factors, seasonal changes in brain functional connectivity as a possible base of these phenomena have not been studied before. The aim of the current study is to analyse seasonal effects using two resting electroencephalogram (EEG) functional connectivity measures: magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) and imaginary coherence (iCOH). Recordings from 80 healthy Estonians were used: 25 recordings from spring, 8 from summer, 10 from autumn and 37 from winter months. Eyes-closed resting EEG was recorded from 30 channels using Neuroscan Synamps2 acquisition system and five frequency bands were analysed: delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Multivariate permutation test revealed significant influence of seasons on beta MSC. Furthermore, statistical analysis between different seasons showed increased beta MSCin spring and winter months compared to summer and autumn months, increased beta iCOH in spring, autumn and winter months compared to summer months and increased gamma MSC in spring and summer months compared to autumn months. The increase in beta MSC and iCOH in spring and winter months compared to summer months may be the result of increased stress or deficiency in Vitamin D. Current study is the first to bring out seasonal changes in brain functional connectivity, but the shortcoming of the study is the limited number of recordings in summer and autumn months. Therefore, further studies are required for more reliable results.

In these patients, motor imagery based BCI systems might play a substantial role in rehabilitation strategies. 11 severely motor-injured stroke patients and 6 healthy participants participated in this study. During an unilateral upper-hand motor task, stroke patients shown significant modulation of sensorimotor rhythms in both hemispheres, shown that EEG signals of both hemispheres can be used for control of BMI systems. Main findings were that ERD amplitude was reduced in affected hemisphere, and that ERD when using affected hand was lateralized to and more marked in ipsilateral (unaffected) hemisphere. Significant activation differences between healthy and affected hemisphere were found, suggesting participation of different physiological mechanisms in both, that might be explored in future experimentation for improving the design and implementation of EEG-based BMI systems and use of these systems in neurorehabilitation of stroke.

Claims have been made that hyperoxic breathing can help reduce fatigue, increase alertness, and improve attentional capacities; however, few systematic studies of these potential benefits exist. Here, we examined the effects of short-term (15 min) hyperoxia on resting states in awake human subjects by measuring spontaneous EEG activity between normoxic and hyperoxic situations, using a within-subject design for both eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions. We also measured respiration rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels to correlate basic physiological changes due to the hyperoxic challenge with any brain activity changes. Our results show that breathing short-term 100% oxygen led to increased blood oxygen saturation levels, decreased heart rate, and a slight, but nonsignificant, decrease in breathing rate. Changes of brain activity were apparent, including decreases in low-alpha (7-10 Hz), high-alpha (10-14 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency ranges during eyes-opened hyperoxic conditions. During eyes-closed hyperoxia, increases in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (3.5-7 Hz) frequency range were apparent together with decreases in the beta range. Hyperoxia appeared to accentuate the decrease of low alpha and gamma ranges across the eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions, suggesting that it modulated brain state itself. As decreased alpha during eyes-opened conditions has been associated with increased attentional processing and selective attention, and increased delta and theta during eyes-closed condition are typically associated with the initiation of sleep, our results suggest a state-specific and perhaps opposing influence of short-term hyperoxia.

In this study, we investigated a part of the central-autonomic-network (CAN) in 17 patients suffering from schizophrenia (SZO) compared to 17 age-gender matched healthy controls (CON) applying linear and nonlinear causal coupling approaches (normalized short time partial directed coherence, multivariate transfer entropy). Therefore, from all subjects continuous heart rate (successive beat-to-beat intervals, BBI), synchronized maximum successive systolic blood pressure amplitudes (SYS), synchronized calibrated respiratory inductive plethysmography signal (respiratory frequency, RESP), and the power P-EEG of frontal EEG activity were investigated for 15 min under resting conditions. The CAN revealed a bidirectional coupling structure, with central driving towards blood pressure (SYS), and respiratory driving towards P-EEG. The central-cardiac, central-vascular, and central-respiratory couplings are more dominated by linear regulatory mechanisms than nonlinear ones. The CAN showed significantly weaker nonlinear central-cardiovascular and central-cardiorespiratory coupling pathways, and significantly stronger linear central influence on the vascular system, and on the other hand significantly stronger linear respiratory and cardiac influences on central activity in SZO compared to CON, and thus, providing better understanding of the interrelationship of central and autonomic regulatory mechanisms in schizophrenia might be useful as a biomarker of this disease.

Previous behavioral studies have shown different IFOR-IFOR (II) and EFOR-IFOR (EI) conflict effects and an effect of their interaction. However, the neural mechanism of conflict processing between two FOR-based conflicts is unclear. In the current ERP study, two FOR-based conflicts were manipulated using a two-cannon task to elucidate common and distinct brain mechanisms that underlie FOR-based conflict processing. The behavioral results showed that both conflicts exhibited longer reaction times and larger error rates in the II (180 degrees cannon angle) and EI (target cannon pointed down) incongruent conditions than in the II (0 degrees cannon angle) and EI (target cannon pointed up) congruent conditions and that an interaction existed between the two conflicts. The ERP results indicated that, for both conflicts, more negative N2 amplitudes and less positive P3 amplitudes occurred in the incongruent conditions than in the congruent conditions, and the interactions between the two conflicts during later P3 amplitudes were significant. Time-frequency analysis further indicated that, in the early time window, the II conflict and the EI conflict specifically modulated power in the theta bands and beta bands, respectively. In contrast, in the later time window, both conflicts modulated power in the alpha and beta bands. In summary, our findings provide insights into the potential existence of two specific early conflict monitoring systems and a general late executive control system for FOR-based conflicts.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) favorably provides the measure. Wavelet coherence, which is a wavelet transform based feature that provides useful information regarding synchronized activity between two signals. It does not depend on the stationarity of the signal and hence very much relevant for non-stationary EEG application. Methods: We aimed to examine how the task-related synchronization pattern of action video game players (AVGPs) differs from non-AVGPs. EEG data were collected from thirty-five young and healthy male participants while performing an attention inhibition task and a visuospatial short-term memory-retention task. The sub-frequency components, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands of EEG were extracted using Discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The intra and inter-hemispheric coherence in EEG sub-frequency bands were assessed as a feature for the analysis. Results: Theta, alpha, beta and gamma coherence has shown a significant difference (p<0.05) between AVGPs and non-AVGPs in both the visuo-spatial tasks in intra and inter-hemispheric functionality. More than 90% classification accuracies arc achieved with ANFIS algorithm. Results also indicate that frontoparietal connectivity is significantly improved in AVGPs in both the visual sensory tasks considered. Conclusion: These EEG based analysis reports enhanced neural communication with improved attention inhibition and short-term memory retention in AVGPs. Result also established the Wavelet coherence as an effective tool in understanding the neural communication among different brain locations.	[Hazarika, Jupitara; Kant, P.

Socioeconomic status related differences in resting state EEG activity correspond to differences in vocabulary and working memory in grade school	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Resting state EEG; Socioeconomic status; Language development; Working memory	HUMAN CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; FOLLOW-UP; CHILDREN; ASSOCIATIONS; CHILDHOOD; POWER	There is increasing evidence that children from low income homes exhibit differences in brain, language and cognitive development. To better understand these differences and how they relate to one another, we compared the resting state EEG of forty-five 8-15-year-olds from low-income homes and 45 age and sex matched children from higher income homes who completed a battery of language and cognitive assessments. Children from low income homes performed worse on language tasks and exhibited differences in resting state EEG including more theta and less alpha power. To investigate the relationship between language, cognition and resting state EEG we performed multiple regression analyses. Better working memory was related to lower resting state theta power. There was an interaction between alpha and vocabulary, such that only for children from low income homes, greater resting state alpha was related to higher vocabulary scores. Both relationships held when controlling for resting state changes in the other frequency band, indicating they are somewhat independent effects. These findings shed new light on SES, neural development and cognitive and language outcomes in school-aged children.

However, the mechanisms underlying adolescent alcohol-associated sleep disturbances and potential targets for therapy remain under investigated. Orexin receptor antagonists may have therapeutic value in the treatment of insomnia, yet the use of this class of drugs in the treatment of sleep disturbances following adolescent alcohol exposure has not been studied. Objectives This study employed a model whereby ethanol vapor exposure occurred for 5 weeks during adolescence (AIE), and waking event-related oscillations (EROs) and EEG sleep were subsequently evaluated in young adult rats. The ability of two doses (10, 30 mg/kg PO) of a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA-12) to modify sleep, EEG, and EROs was investigated in AIE rats and controls. Results Adolescent vapor exposure was found to produce a fragmentation of sleep, in young adults, that was partially ameliorated by DORA-12. DORA-12 also produced increases in delta and theta power in waking EROs recorded before sleep, and deeper sleep as indexed by increases in delta and theta power in the sleep EEG in both ethanol and control rats. Rats given DORA-12 also fell asleep faster than vehicle-treated rats as measured by a dose-dependent reduction in the latency to both the first slow wave and REM sleep episodes. Conclusions This study showed that DORA-12 can affect the sleep disturbance that is associated with a history of adolescent ethanol exposure and also has several other sleep-promoting effects that are equivalent in both ethanol and control rats.

Previous research has identified increased proactive interference, that is a reduced working memory capacity, as one possible mechanism associated with this phenomenon. The present study aimed at extending this finding into the domain of neuroscience, (1) by assessing EEG alpha oscillations during the retention of information, (2) by replicating the behavioral link between meaningful coincidences and proactive interference. In a sample of 52 participants, the behavioral replication was successful. Furthermore, participants who perceived more meaningful coincidences showed higher alpha power increases at parietal-occipital sites, and at the same time, displayed lower alpha power increases at frontal areas, during retention of information. This neurophysiological activation pattern further underlines the assumption that participants who perceive more meaningful coincidences show lower working memory capacities, since increased alpha power at parietal areas reflects a higher load on working memory demands.

The synchronized activity of large numbers of neurons gives rise to macroscopic brain oscillations on an electroencephalogram (EEG). It has been found that neural oscillations at rest in the gamma frequency band (25-45 Hz) are associated with development of different cognitive systems, including language. Although the etiology of language is explained by genetically driven brain maturation factors, environment plays a significant role. Specifically, candidate pathways from environment to language development include sociodemographic factors, primarily socioeconomic status (SES) which is likely to exert its effects on language development through other factors, such as parenting style. Despite these assumptions, no studies have so far examined the interrelation between brain maturation factors such as gamma frequency oscillatory activity, environmental factors such as SES, and language acquisition. Aim and method: In a longitudinal study of 84 Italian typically developing infants, we measured the power of oscillatory gamma activity as mediator between SES and language acquisition. Baseline EEG and information about SES were collected when infants were aged 6 months. Children were followed-up longitudinally to measure expressive vocabulary and Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) at 24 months. Results: The mediation model showed that SES is associated with gamma power which, in turn, is associated with expressive language at age 24 months. A higher SES predicted an increase in left central gamma power which, in turn, predicted better language scores. Conclusions: These results confirm the predictive role of gamma activity oscillatory activity on later language acquisition, suggesting a specific role for these oscillatory mechanisms in language development milestones such as vocabulary development and early word combination. Furthermore, they suggest that SES differences in brain activity may be apparent at early stages of life and affect later language skills. If replicated, our findings could contribute to identifying highest-risk children and may prompt cost-effective preventive/treatment strategies.

Despite the blooming variety of methods for estimating connectivity in the EEG of a single subject, a common pitfall is seen in relevant studies; grand averaging is used for estimating the characteristic connectivity patterns of a group of subjects. This averaging may distort results and fail to account for the internal variability of connectivity results across the subjects of a group. New Method: In this study, we propose a novel methodology for the cross-subject network investigation of EEG graphoelements. We used dimensionality reduction techniques in order to reveal internal connectivity properties and to examine how consistent these are across a number of subjects. In addition, graph theoretical measures were utilized to prioritize regions according to their network attributes. Results: As proof of concept, we applied this method on fast sleep spindles across 10 healthy subjects. Neurophysiological findings revealed subnetworks of the spindle events across subjects, highlighting a predominance for occipito-parietal areas and their connectivity with frontal regions. Comparison with existing methods: This is a new approach for the examination of within-group connectivities in EEG research. The results accounted for more than 85% of the overall data variance and the detected subnetworks were found to be meaningful down-projections of the grand average of the group, suggesting sufficient performance for the proposed methodology. Conclusion: We conclude that the proposed methodology can serve as an observatory tool for the EEG connectivity patterns across subjects, providing a supplementary analysis of the existing topography techniques.

Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain. Methods The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment. Results The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P < 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P < 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P < 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P < 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P < 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P < 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P < 0.05). Discussion The results suggest that MTrP compression at the lumbar muscle modulates pPFC activity and functional connectivity between the pPFC and insula, which may relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain.

To understand the impact of these proprieties, a multimethod neuroscientific experiment was conducted. Subjects were asked to use a news app (with articles on actuality, health and environment), programmed by the research team with randomized stimuli on a smartphone. 4 types of ads, obtained from the 2x2 matrix made by crossing the proprieties of animation (static/dynamic) and interactivity (interactive/not interactive) were proposed. Cortical oscillations and autonomic indices were monitored using electroencephalography and biofeedback on millennials (n=18). Findings showed that dynamic banners and the actuality theme evoked an increased theta band activity in the left hemisphere, interpreted as higher emotional engagement. Also the increase in beta and alpha activity for actuality contents may reflect a bigger attraction of users' selective attention. Thus, firstly animation should be present as a leading element in the ad. Secondly the platform selection should not be delegated to the Demand Side Platform.

Methods: Thirty subjects were administered a daily dose of either 5 mg donepezil or placebo for 15 days in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial. The electroencephalogram during an auditory oddball paradigm was recorded from 58 scalp electrodes. Current source density (CSD) transformations were applied to EEG epochs. The event-related potential (ERP), inter-trial coherence (ITC: the phase consistency of the EEG spectrum) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP: the EEG power spectrum relative to the baseline) were calculated for the target (oddball) stimuli. Results: The donepezil and placebo conditions differed in terms of the changes in delta/theta/alpha/beta ITC and ERSP in various regions of the scalp (especially the frontal electrodes) but not in terms of latency and amplitude of the P300-ERP component. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ITC and ERSP analyses can provide EEG markers of donepezil's effects in young, healthy, adult volunteers at a group level. Significance: Novel EEG markers could be useful to assess the therapeutic potential of drug candidates in Alzheimer's disease in healthy volunteers prior to the initiation of Phase II/III clinical studies in patients.

Group Independent Component Analysis (group-ICA) is a promising tool for decomposing spatiospectral EEG maps across multiple subjects. However, researchers are faced with many preprocessing options prior to performing group-ICA, which potentially influences the results. To examine the influence of preprocessing steps, within this article we compare results derived from group-ICA using the absolute power of spatiospectral maps and the relative power of spatiospectral maps. Within a previous study, we used K-means clustering to demonstrate group-ICA of absolute power spatiospectral maps generates sources which are stable across different paradigms (i.e. resting-state, semantic decision, visual oddball) Within the current study, we compare these maps with those obtained using relative power of spatiospectral maps as input to group-ICA. We find that relative EEG power contains 10 stable spatiospectral patterns which were similar to those observed using absolute power as inputs. Interestingly, relative power revealed two c-band (20-40 Hz) patterns which were present across 3 paradigms, but not present using absolute power. This finding suggests that relative power potentially emphasizes low energy signals which are obscured by the high energy low frequency which dominates absolute power measures.

To test whether the NDE-associated high-frequency oscillations surge is related to cardiac arrest, recordings were made from the hippocampus of anesthetized rats dying from an overdose of the sedative chloral hydrate (CH). At a lethal dose, CH caused a surge in beta band power in CA3 and CA1 and a surge in gamma band power in CA1. CH increased the inter-regional coherence of high-frequency oscillations within and between hippocampi. Whereas the surge in beta power developed at non-lethal chloral hydrate doses, the surge in gamma power was specific for impending death. In contrast, CH strongly suppressed theta band power in both CA1 and CA3 and reduced inter-regional coherence in the theta band. The simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram showed a small decrease in heart rate but no change in waveform during the high-frequency oscillation surge, with cardiac arrest only developing after the cessation of breathing and collapse of all oscillatory activity. These results demonstrate that the high-frequency oscillation surge just before death is not limited to cardiac arrest and that especially the increase in gamma synchronization in CA1 may contribute to NDE observed both with and without cardiac arrest.

Many of the previous studies reported diminished gamma oscillations in SZ, although some studies reported increased spontaneous gamma oscillations. Furthermore, brain morphological correlates of the gamma band ASSR deficits have rarely examined. We investigated different measures of the 40-Hz ASSR and their association with brain volumes and psychological measures of SZ. Methods: The 40-Hz ASSR was measured for 80 dB click sounds (1 ms, 500-ms trains at 40-Hz, with 3050 to 3500 inter-train interval) using electroencephalography with 64 electrodes in 33 patients with SZ (male: 16, female: 17 (age range: 21-60)) and 30 healthy controls (HCs) (male: 13, female: 17 (age range: 23-64)). Four gamma oscillation measures (evoked power, spontaneous oscillations (baseline and total power), and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC)) were assessed. The source activities of the ASSR were also analyzed. Brain volumes were assessed using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry and superior temporal gyrus (STG) volume measures were obtained. Results: Patients with SZ had larger total and evoked powers and higher ITC than HCs. Both groups showed significantly different association between mean evoked power and right STG volume. In HCs but not SZ, mean evoked power showed significant positive correlation with right STG volume. In addition, the two groups showed significantly different association between verbal fluency and mean evoked power. High evoked power was significantly correlated with poor verbal fluency in SZ. Conclusions: The current study found increased gamma oscillation in SZ and suggests significant involvement of the STG in gamma oscillations.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with TEA at the Mayo Clinic Minnesota from January 1, 1998 to September 21, 2017. Diagnostic criteria included the presence of recurrent episodes of transient amnesia with preservation of other cognitive functions and evidence for epilepsy [epileptiform abnormalities on EEG, clinical features of seizures, or symptomatic response to anti-seizure medications (ASMs)]. Results: Nineteen patients were identified (14 men, 5 women) with median onset age 66 years and median time to diagnosis 2 years. Thirteen patients (68%) reported persistent cognitive/behavioral symptoms, including 4 (21%) for whom these were the chief presenting complaints. EEG revealed epileptiform abnormalities involving the frontal and/or temporal regions in 12/19 individuals (63%), including activation during sleep in all of these cases. In numerous cases, sleep and prolonged EEG evaluations identified abnormalities not previously seen on shorter or awake-state studies. Brain MRI revealed focal abnormalities in only 4/19 cases (21%). FDG-PET identified focal hypometabolism in 2/8 cases where it was performed, both involving the frontal and/or temporal regions. Anti-seizure therapy, most often with a single agent, resulted in improvement (reduction in spell frequency and/or subjective improvement in interictal cognitive/behavioral complaints) in all 17 cases with available follow-up. Conclusions: TEA is a treatable cause of amnestic spells in older adults. This syndrome is frequently associated with persistent interictal cognitive/behavioral symptoms and thus can be mistaken for common mimics. In the appropriate clinical context, our findings support the use of early prolonged EEG with emphasis on sleep monitoring as a key diagnostic tool. FDG-PET may also complement MRI in distinguishing TEA from neurodegenerative disease when suspected.

It has hence remained unknown whether and how small non-pathological variations in cytoskeletal neuronal integrity affect human cognitive functioning. We investigated the role of neuronal cytoskeleton integrity for complex multicomponent behavior, which is relevant to real-life situations, as complex goals are often achieved by assembling a series of sub-tasks. For this, we quantified scaffolding proteins (i.e. neurofilament light; NF-L) using a single-molecule array (SIMOA), a new and uniquely ultra-sensitive method, and integrated this with behavioral and neurophysiological (EEG) data. For the first time, we showcase that slightest non-pathological variations in cytoskeletal integrity strongly modulate the efficiency of cognitive control processes. We show that the architecture and efficiency of theta-oscillations networks during cognitive control processes reflects a mechanism that establishes the relationship between neuronal cytoskeleton integrity and multicomponent behavior. Attentional selection processes do however not seem to play a role. The efficiency and network architecture of theta oscillations provides an important missing neural link that helps to explain how diffuse and seemingly miniscule variations in neuronal integrity may lead to reduced or even impaired cognitive functioning that is important for everyday activities.

Closed-loop acoustic stimulation has previously been shown to enhance slow oscillations and spindle activity during sleep and improve verbal associative memory. We assessed the effect of closed-loop acoustic stimulation during a daytime nap on a virtual reality spatial navigation task in 12 healthy human subjects in a randomized within-subject crossover design. We show robust enhancement of slow oscillation and spindle activity during sleep. However, no effects on behavioral performance were observed when comparing real versus sham stimulation. To explore whether memory enhancement effects were task specific and dependent on nocturnal sleep, in a second experiment with 19 healthy subjects, we aimed to replicate a previous study that used closed-loop acoustic stimulation to enhance memory for word pairs. The methods used were as close as possible to those used in the original study, except that we used a double-blind protocol, in which both subject and experimenter were unaware of the test condition. Again, we successfully enhanced slow oscillation and spindle power, but again did not strengthen associative memory performance with stimulation. We conclude that enhancement of sleep oscillations may be insufficient to enhance memory performance in spatial navigation or verbal association tasks, and provide possible explanations for lack of behavioral replication.

Neural responses associated with fixations will likely overlap with one another in the EEG recording and neural responses change as a function of eye movement characteristics. Especially in tasks that do not constrain eye movements in any way, these issues can become confounds. New method: Here, we propose the use of regression based estimates as an alternative to averaging. Multiple regression can disentangle different influences on the EEG and correct for overlap. It thereby accounts for potential confounds in a way that averaging cannot. Specifically, we test the applicability of the rERP framework, as proposed by Smith and Kutas (2015b), (2017), or Sassenhagen (2018) to combined eye tracking and EEG data from a visual search and a scene memorization task. Results: Results show that the method successfully estimates eye movement related confounds in real experimental data, so that these potential confounds can be accounted for when estimating experimental effects. Comparison with existing methods: The rERP method successfully corrects for overlapping neural responses in instances where averaging does not. As a consequence, baselining can be applied without risking distortions. By estimating a known experimental effect, we show that rERPs provide an estimate with less variance and more accuracy than averaged FRPs. The method therefore provides a practically feasible and favorable alternative to averaging. Conclusions: We conclude that regression based ERPs provide novel opportunities for estimating fixation related EEG in free-viewing experiments.

Cognitive impairment is a fatal malady to that limits active rehabilitation, and functional recovery in patients with traumatic brain injury. In severe cases, it is impossible to assess cognitive function precisely, and severe cognitive impairment makes it difficult to establish a rehabilitation plan, as well as evaluate the course of rehabilitation. Evaluation of cognitive function is essential for establishing a rehabilitation plan, as well as evaluating the course of rehabilitation. We report a case of the analysis of electroencephalography with global synchronization index and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography applied, for evaluation of cognitive function that was difficult with conventional tests, due to severe cognitive impairment in a 77-year-old male patient that experienced traumatic brain injury.

High-precision magnetoencephalography for reconstructing amygdalar and hippocampal oscillations during prediction of safety and threat	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						amygdala; hippocampus; MEG; source reconstruction; theta oscillations; threat conditioning	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG ACTIVITY; FEAR; CORTEX; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; LOCALIZATION; CIRCUITS; ANXIETY; NEURONS	Learning to associate neutral with aversive events in rodents is thought to depend on hippocampal and amygdala oscillations. In humans, oscillations underlying aversive learning are not well characterised, largely due to the technical difficulty of recording from these two structures. Here, we used high-precision magnetoencephalography (MEG) during human discriminant delay threat conditioning. We constructed generative anatomical models relating neural activity with recorded magnetic fields at the single-participant level, including the neocortex with or without the possibility of sources originating in the hippocampal and amygdalar structures. Models including neural activity in amygdala and hippocampus explained MEG data during threat conditioning better than exclusively neocortical models. We found that in both amygdala and hippocampus, theta oscillations during anticipation of an aversive event had lower power compared to safety, both during retrieval and extinction of aversive memories. At the same time, theta synchronisation between hippocampus and amygdala increased over repeated retrieval of aversive predictions, but not during safety. Our results suggest that high-precision MEG is sensitive to neural activity of the human amygdala and hippocampus during threat conditioning and shed light on the oscillation-mediated mechanisms underpinning retrieval and extinction of fear memories in humans.

Minimally-verbal children with autism show deficits in theta and gamma oscillations during processing of semantically-related visual information	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SPECTRUM; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; INTEGRATION; MATURATION; DISORDERS; ATTENTION; RESPONSES	To acquire language, children must build phonemic representations of their native language, learn to associate auditory words to visual objects and assemble a lexicon. It is not clear however, whether the limited linguistic ability seen in minimally-verbal (MV) children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relates to deficits in cortical representation of an object and/or in linking an object to its semantic information. This EEG-based study investigated neural mechanisms underlying visual processing of common objects in MV-ASD and control children. Ten MV-ASD children, 4- to 7- years-old and 15 age/gender-matched controls, were presented with a picture-word matching paradigm. Time-frequency analyses were conducted at the sources generating the event-related responses at both early and late visual processing. Permutation testing identified spectral power and phase coherence clusters that significantly differed between the groups. As compared to controls, MV-ASD children exhibited smaller amplitudes and longer source latencies; decreased gamma and theta power with less theta phase coherence in occipital regions, and reduced frontal gamma power. Our results confirm that visual processing is altered in MV-ASD children and suggest that some of the linguistic differences observed in these children arise from impaired object/label cortical representations and reduced allocation of attention, which would impact lexical acquisition.

Local field potentials were recorded from the sensory thalamus of twelve neuropathic pain patients. Single and combinational neural states were defined by the activity state of a single or paired oscillations. Relationships between the duration or occurrence rate of neural state and pre-operative pain level or pain relief induced by deep brain stimulation were evaluated. Results showed that the occurrence rate of the single neural state of low-beta oscillation was significantly correlated with pain relief. The duration and occurrence rate of combinational neural states of the paired low-beta with delta, theta, alpha, high-beta or low-gamma oscillations were more significantly correlated with pain relief than the single neural states. Moreover, these significant combinational neural states formed a local oscillatory network with low-beta oscillation as a key node. The results also showed correlations between measures of combinational neural states and subjective pain level as well. The duration of combinational neural states of paired alpha with delta or theta oscillations and the occurrence rate of neural states of the paired delta with low-beta or low-gamma oscillations were significantly correlated with pre-operative pain level. In conclusion, this study revealed that the integration of oscillations and the functional dynamics of neural states were differentially involved in modulation and perception of neuropathic pain. The functional dynamics could be biomarkers for developing neural state-dependent deep brain stimulation for neuropathic pain.

Here we isolate a neural marker quantifying impaired visual coding of facial expression in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) using frequency-tagging with electroencephalography (EEG). Twenty-two 22q11DS participants and 22 healthy controls were presented with changes of facial expression displayed at low, moderate, and high intensities every five cycles in a stream of one neutral face repeating 6 times per second (i.e., at a 6 Hz base rate). The brain response to expression changes tagged at the 1.2 Hz (i.e., 6 Hz/5) predefined frequency was isolated over occipito-temporal regions in both groups of participants for moderate-and high-intensity facial expressions. Neural sensitivity to facial expression was reduced by about 36% in 22q11DS, revealing impaired visual coding of emotional facial signals. The significance of the expression-change response was estimated for each single participant thanks to the high SNR of the approach. Further analyses revealed the high reliability of the response and its immunity from other neurocognitive skills. Interestingly, response magnitude was associated with the severity of positive symptoms, pointing to a potential endophenotype for psychosis risk. Overall, the present study reveals an objective, selective, reliable, and behavior-free signature of impaired visual coding of facial expression implicitly quantified from brain activity with high SNR. This novel tool opens avenues for clinical practice, providing a potential early biomarker for later psychosis onset and offering an alternative for individual assessment of social-cognitive functioning in even difficult-to-test participants.

This sensory attenuation is thought to result from predictions about the sensory consequences of self-generated actions that rely on motor commands. Previous research has implicated brain oscillations in this process. However, the specific role of these oscillations in motor-auditory interactions during sensory attenuation is still unclear. In this study, we aimed at addressing this question by using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We recorded MEG in 20 healthy participants during listening to passively presented and self-generated tones. Our results show that the magnitude of sensory attenuation in bilateral auditory areas is significantly correlated with the modulation of beta-band (15-30 Hz) amplitude in the motor cortex. Moreover, we observed a significant directional coupling (Granger causality) in beta-band originating from the motor cortex toward bilateral auditory areas. Our findings indicate that beta-band oscillations play an important role in mediating top-down interactions between motor and auditory cortex and, in our paradigm, suppress cortical responses to predicted sensory input.

Alpha activity is reported to be attenuated in schizophrenia (SCZ). Understanding the interaction between alpha activity during rest and when cognitively engaged may provide insights into the neural circuitry, which is dysfunctional in SCZ. This study investigated the changes of alpha activity between resting state and cognitive engagement in SCZ patients. Methods Thirty-four SCZ patients and 29 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. EEG was performed in the resting state and during an auditory P300 task. All experimental procedures followed the relevant institutional guidelines and regulations. Results In SCZ, high-frequency alpha activity was reduced in the resting state. High-frequency alpha source density was decreased in both the resting-state and a P300 task condition in patients, compared to HC. HC, but not SCZ patients, showed a reduction in high-frequency alpha source density during the P300 task compared to the resting state. The negative correlation between high-frequency alpha source density in the resting state and positive symptoms was significant. Conclusions High-frequency alpha activity in SCZ patients and its unsuccessful reduction during cognitive processing may be biological markers of SCZ.

Conventionally, the Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT) is an established method for assessing perceptual ability. As perception and attention is highly correlated in terms of neuronal synchronization, it is thus hypothesized that the varying levels of human perception can be observed through the electroencephalogram (EEG). In this paper, characterization of different perception level based on resting EEG features is proposed. Data acquisition which consists of CTMT trials and EEG recording are obtained from 65 healthy samples. The CT MT scores and time taken to complete each trial are used to establish the control groups. Subsequently, EEG power ratio for theta, alpha and beta bands is evaluated to distinguish between different levels of perception. The proposed method has shown distinct pattern of theta, alpha and beta power ratio features among three levels of human perception. The findings demonstrate a correlation with alpha suppression and neuronal synchronization theories. Samples with high level of perceptual ability demonstrate the highest alpha ratio. Conversely, they exhibit the lowest theta and beta ratios. Meanwhile, samples with low perception level obtained the lowest alpha ratio. Contrariwise, they exhibit highest theta and beta power ratios. Those with high level of perception also demonstrate shorter answering time compared to low and medium perception level.

However, it remains unclear how elevated math-anxiety modulates brain activity while solving arithmetic problems. In the current study, we recorded electrophysiological responses throughout arithmetic problem solving, both at the period of anticipating an upcoming arithmetic problem and solving an arithmetic problem. Results showed that, after controlling for mathematical performance, people with higher math anxiety tended to show stronger beta band oscillation and P300 amplitude while expecting the arithmetic problems, as well as stronger gamma band activity while solving the arithmetic problems. These results suggest that individuals highly anxious about math might use more attentional resources during the course of anticipating the upcoming arithmetic problems, and showed greater attentional bias toward arithmetic problems during solving arithmetic problems.

However, evidence that this form of coding also holds for pathological networks, such as for distributed networks in epileptic disorders, does not yet exist. Here, we show in a mouse model of unilateral hippocampal epilepsy that epileptic fast ripples generated in the neocortex distant from the primary focus occur during transient trains of interictal epileptic discharges. During these epileptic paroxysms, local phase-locking of neuronal firing and a phase-amplitude coupling of the epileptic discharges over a slow oscillation at 3-5 Hz are detected. Furthermore, the buildup of the slow oscillation begins in the bihippocampal network that includes the focus, which synchronizes and drives the activity across the large-scale epileptic network into the frontal cortex. This study provides the first functional description of the emergence of neocortical fast ripples in hippocampal epilepsy and shows that cross-frequency coupling might be a fundamental mechanism underlying the spreading of epileptic activity.

However, it is unknown whether this facilitation reflects an influence on early perceptual processing, or instead post-perceptual processes. In three experiments, a combination of psychophysics and electroencephalography was used to investigate whether visual features are influenced by action preparation at the perceptual level. Participants were cued to prepare oriented reach-to-grasp actions before discriminating target stimuli oriented in the same direction as the prepared grasping action (congruent) or not (incongruent). As expected, stimuli were discriminated faster if their orientation was congruent, compared to incongruent, with the prepared action. However, action-congruency had no influence on perceptual sensitivity, regardless of cue-target interval and discrimination difficulty. The reaction time effect was not accompanied by modulations of early visual-evoked potentials. Instead, beta-band (13-30 Hz) synchronization over sensorimotor brain regions was influenced by action preparation, indicative of improved response preparation. Together, the results suggest that action preparation may not modulate early visual processing of orientation, but likely influences higher order response or decision related processing. While early effects of action on spatial perception are well documented, separate mechanisms appear to govern non-spatial feature selection.

Using multi-modal electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods, we illustrate that during religious chanting, the posterior cingulate cortex shows the largest decrease in eigenvector centrality, potentially due to regional endogenous generation of delta oscillations. Our data show that these functional effects are not due to peripheral cardiac or respiratory activity, nor due to implicit language processing. Finally, we suggest that the neurophysiological correlates of religious chanting are likely different from those of meditation and prayer, and would possibly induce distinctive psychotherapeutic effects.

New Method: We aim to improve epileptogenic zone localization by utilizing a computer-assisted tool for the automated grading of the seizure activity recorded in various locations for 20 patients undergoing stereo electroencephalography. Their epileptic seizures were processed to extract two potential biomarkers. The concentration of these biomarkers from within each patient's implantation were then graded to identify their epileptogenic zone and were compared to the clinical assessment. Results: Our technique was capable of ranking the clinically defined epileptogenic zone with high accuracy, above 95%, with a true to false positive ratio of 1:1.52, and was effective with both temporal and extra-temporal onset epilepsies. Comparison with Existing Method: We compared our method to two other groups performing localization using similar biomarkers. Our classification metrics, sensitivity and precision together were comparable to both groups and our overall accuracy from a larger population was also higher then both. Conclusions: Our method is highly accurate, automated and non-parametric providing clinicians another tool that can be used to help identify the epileptogenic zone in patients undergoing the stereo electroencephalography procedure for epilepsy monitoring.

The emergence of new technology and digital methods benefits epilepsy research with the identification and characterizing the SOZ by using HFOs. Invasive recordings, together with automatic detection methods, are at the forefront of epilepsy research, especially when surgery is inevitable for seizure-freedom. However, recent non-invasive HFOs recordings quickly gathered attention for validation to be implemented in future clinical research and practice.

Spatial filtering methods can fuse the information of different brain regions, which is beneficial for the enhancement of the active components of the SSMVEP. Traditional spatial filtering methods fuse electroencephalogram (EEG) in the time domain. Based on the idea of image fusion, this study proposed an SSMVEP enhancement method based on time-frequency (T-F) image fusion. The purpose is to fuse SSMVEP in the T-F domain and improve the enhancement effect of the traditional spatial filtering method on SSMVEP active components. Firstly, two electrode signals were transformed from the time domain to the T-F domain via short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The transformed T-F signals can be regarded as T-F images. Then, two T-F images were decomposed via two-dimensional multiscale wavelet decomposition, and both the high-frequency coefficients and low-frequency coefficients of the wavelet were fused by specific fusion rules. The two images were fused into one image via two-dimensional wavelet reconstruction. The fused image was subjected to mean filtering, and finally, the fused time-domain signal was obtained by inverse STFT (ISTFT). The experimental results show that the proposed method has better enhancement effect on SSMVEP active components than the traditional spatial filtering methods. This study indicates that it is feasible to fuse SSMVEP in the T-F domain, which provides a new idea for SSMVEP analysis.

However, using a more natural control scheme, such as decoding the trajectory of imagined 3D arm movements to move a prosthetic, robotic, or virtual arm has been reported in a limited amount of studies, all using offline feed-forward control schemes. Objective: In this study, we report the first attempt to realize online control of two virtual arms generating movements toward three targets/arm in 3D space. The 3D trajectory of imagined arm movements was decoded from power spectral density of mu, low beta, high beta, and low gamma EEG oscillations using multiple linear regression. The analysis was performed on a dataset recorded from three subjects in seven sessions wherein each session comprised three experimental blocks: an offline calibration block and two online feedback blocks. Target classification accuracy using predicted trajectories of the virtual arms was computed and compared with results of a filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) based multi-class classification method involving mutual information (MI) selection and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) modules. Main Results: Target classification accuracy from predicted trajectory of imagined 3D arm movements in the offline runs for two subjects (mean 45%, std 5%) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than chance level (33.3%). Nevertheless, the accuracy during real-time control of the virtual arms using the trajectory decoded directly from EEG was in the range of chance level (33.3%). However, the results of two subjects show that false-positive feedback may increase the accuracy in closed-loop. The FBCSP based multi-class classification method distinguished imagined movements of left and right arm with reasonable accuracy for two of the three subjects (mean 70%, std 5% compared to 50% chance level). However, classification of the imagined arm movement toward three targets was not successful with the FBCSP classifier as the achieved accuracy (mean 33%, std 5%) was similar to the chance level (33.3%). Sub-optimal components of the multi-session experimental paradigm were identified, and an improved paradigm proposed.

While causal inference is commonly performed through classical Granger causality (GC) based on multivariate autoregressive models, this method may encounter important limitations (e.g., data paucity) in the case of high dimensional data from densely connected systems like the brain. Additionally, physiological signals often present long-range dependencies which commonly require high autoregressive model orders/number of parameters. We present a generalization of autoregressive models for GC estimation based on Wiener-Volterra decompositions with Laguerre polynomials as basis functions. In this basis, the introduction of only one additional global parameter allows to capture arbitrary long dependencies without increasing model order, hence retaining model simplicity, linearity and ease of parameters estimation. We validate our method in synthetic data generated from families of complex, densely connected networks and demonstrate superior performance as compared to classical GC. Additionally, we apply our framework to studying the directed human brain connectome through MEG data from 89 subjects drawn from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database, showing that it is able to reproduce current knowledge as well as to uncover previously unknown directed influences between cortical and limbic brain regions.

Electroencephalogram power alterations in retinal degeneration mice after prolonged transcorneal electrical stimulation	2019 9TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE/EMBS International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAR 20-23, 2019	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMBS			EPIRETINAL PROSTHESIS; RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA; PRESERVATION; VISION; SYSTEM	To study electroencephalogram (EEG) power alterations in the brain of retinal degenerate (RD) models, wild type (WT) and RD mice were used in the experiments. The spontaneous neural activity in visual (Vcx) and pre-frontal (PFx) cortices was recorded from the cranium before and after prolonged transcorneal electrical stimulation (pTES). Three weeks after initial post-stimulation recording (stage one), spontaneous neural activity was recorded (post-stimulation stage two recording). Spontaneous EEG band power was determined during the pre- and post-stimulation stages in awake and anesthetized states of both control and experimental groups. The results showed that pTES possibly activates Vcx and PFx thus caused an increased trend in spontaneous EEG band power of awake RD mice. In this regard, delta band was the most dominant band in Vcx and PFx and significantly (p<0.05) had the highest spontaneous EEG power compared to other bands. Three weeks after initial post pTES recording, Vcx and PFx maintained increased spontaneous activity in only delta band of awake RD mice. With the crucial roles slow wave delta oscillations have been reported to play in neuroplasticity, our results could indicate a neuroplastic effect of pTES.

Due to the large number of studies linking amplitude and peak frequency to perception and neurological disorders, there is great interest in understanding the basis of inter-subject variability in gamma and alpha responses. To address this, we measured gamma and alpha amplitude and peak frequency of response to visual stimulation in 42 healthy humans. Using FMRI to delineate active cortical tissue in the same subjects, we correlated these neurophysiological metrics with two structural metrics: distance from active cortex to electrode, and dipole cancellation over active cortex. We find that distance strongly predicted inter-subject gamma amplitude, but had little effect on alpha amplitude, while cancellation had little effect on gamma or alpha amplitude. Neither alpha peak frequency nor gamma peak frequency correlated with our structural metrics. These results suggest that inter-subject variability in gamma amplitude may reflect gross morphology rather than neurophysiological variability, and should be interpreted with caution, while peak frequency may serve as a more sensitive metric of differences in neuronal activity across subjects.

Recently, a validated, non-invasive polysomnographic method has been developed for dogs, enabling the parallel recording of several neurophysiological signals on non-anesthetized family dogs, including brain activity (EEG), eye movements (EOG), cardiac (ECG), and respiratory activity (PNG). In this study, we examined the ECG (N = 30) and respiratory signals (N = 19) of dogs during a 3-h sleep period in the afternoon, under laboratory conditions. We calculated four time-domain heart rate variables [mean heart rate (HR), SDNN, RMSSD, and pNN50] from the ECG and the estimated average respiratory frequency from the respiratory signal. We analyzed how these variables are affected by the different sleep-wake phases (wakefulness, drowsiness, NREM, and REM) as well as the dogs' sex, age and weight. We have found that the sleep-wake phase had a significant effect on all measured cardiac parameters. In the wake phase, the mean HR was higher than in all other phases, while SDNN, RMSSD, and pNN50 were lower than in all other sleep phases. In drowsiness, mean HR was higher compared to NREM and REM phases, while SDNN and RMSSD was lower compared to NREM and REM phases. In REM, SDNN, and RMSSD was higher than in NREM. However, the sleep-wake phase had no effect on the estimated average respiratory frequency of dogs. The dogs' sex, age and weight had no effect on any of the investigated variables. This study represents a detailed analysis of the cardiac and respiratory activity of dogs during sleep. Since variations in these physiological signals reflect the dynamics of autonomic functions, a more detailed understanding of their changes may help us to gain a better understanding of the internal/emotional processes of dogs in response to different conditions of external stimuli. As such, our results are important since they are directly comparable to human findings and may also serve as a potential basis for future studies on dogs.

Changes in cortical source network after treatment need to be confirmed. The present study investigated the effect of 3-week rTMS therapy on the symptom severity and cortical source network in patients with unipolar depression. Methods: Thirty-five patients with unipolar major depressive disorder participated in the study. High-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS was applied at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during 3 weeks (five consecutive weekdays every week). Clinical symptoms were examined using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety. The resting state electroencephalography was recorded with 62 scalp channels before and after rTMS treatment. Results: Clinical symptoms significantly improved after rTMS treatment in both the active (p = 0.001) and sham groups (p = 0.002). However, an increased cortical source network in global and nodal levels was observed only in the active group after a 3-week treatment. Conclusions: The present study indicates that rTMS treatment leads to improved symptoms in patients with unipolar depression. Furthermore, treatment outcome of real effect was assured in changes of cortical source network.

Current models interpret such extreme vulnerability as the price to pay for optimal learning. Sleep would limit external interferences on memory consolidation(1-3) and allow neural systems to reset through synaptic downscaling(4). Yet, the sleeping brain continues generating neural responses to external events(5,6), revealing the preservation of cognitive processes ranging from the recognition of familiar stimuli to the formation of new memory representations(7-15). Why would sleepers continue processing external events and yet remain unresponsive? Here we hypothesized that sleepers enter a 'standby mode' in which they continue tracking relevant signals, finely balancing the need to stay inward for memory consolidation with the ability to rapidly awake when necessary. Using electroencephalography to reconstruct competing streams in a multitalker environment(16), we demonstrate that the sleeping brain amplifies meaningful speech compared to irrelevant signals. However, the amplification of relevant stimuli was transient and vanished during deep sleep. The effect of sleep depth could be traced back to specific oscillations, with K-complexes promoting relevant information in light sleep, whereas slow waves actively suppress relevant signals in deep sleep. Thus, the selection of relevant stimuli continues to operate during sleep but is strongly modulated by specific brain rhythms.

Preventing a Thought from Coming to Mind Elicits Increased Right Frontal Beta Just as Stopping Action Does	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						beta oscillations; inhibitory control; stop signal; think; no-think	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; UNWANTED MEMORIES; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SCALP EEG; SUPPRESSION; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; STIMULATION	In the stop-signal task, an electrophysiological signature of action-stopping is increased early right frontal beta band power for successful vs. failed stop trials. Here we tested whether the requirement to stop an unwanted thought from coming to mind also elicits this signature. We recorded scalp EEG during a Think/No-Think task and a subsequent stop signal task in 42 participants. In the Think/No-Think task, participants first learned word pairs. In a second phase, they received the left-hand word as a reminder and were cued either to retrieve the associated right-hand word ("Think") or to stop retrieval ("No-Think"). At the end of each trial, participants reported whether they had experienced an intrusion of the associated memory. Finally, they received the left-hand reminder word and were asked to recall its associated target. Behaviorally, there was worse final recall for items in the No-Think condition, and decreased intrusions with practice for No-Think trials. For EEG, we reproduced increased early right frontal beta power for successful vs. failed action stopping. Critically, No-Think trials also elicited increased early right frontal beta power and this was stronger for trials without intrusion. These results suggest that preventing a thought from coming to mind also recruits fast prefrontal stopping.

When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes (will), rather than instructions via external cues, we call this willed attention. In prior work, we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments, we found increases in frontal theta power (starting at 500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal-parietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally, the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention, and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results, replicated across 2 experiments, suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex, and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.

Neurophysiological Activity Following Rewards and Losses Among Female Adolescents and Young Adults With Borderline Personality Disorder	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						borderline personality disorder; adolescents; reward positivity; P300; time-frequency decomposition	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEURAL RESPONSES; MONETARY; POSITIVITY; THETA; IMPULSIVITY; DEPRESSION; PREDICTION; CHILDHOOD; VALIDITY	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex and debilitating psychiatric illness. Prior research in adults has shown that neurophysiological deficits in feedback processing and learning from rewards may be central to the development of BPD; however, little research has examined these markers in adolescents and young adults with BPD. The present study used event-related potentials and time-frequency decomposition analysis to probe neural responses to wins and losses in a guessing task among 68 females (13 to 23 years old) either with BPD (n = 35) or no history of mental disorders (healthy control [HC]; n = 33). Participants completed a guessing task wherein they won and lost money at equal frequencies while elecooencephalogram (EEG) data were acquired. Adolescents and young adults with BPD showed a smaller differentiation between wins and losses in the reward positivity (RewP) relative to HCs. Using time-frequency decomposition, we isolated distinct frequency bands sensitive to wins (delta = <3Hz) and losses (theta = 4 Hz to 7 Hz). Compared with BPD participants, HCs showed significantly larger delta power to wins, specifically. The groups did not differ in delta power to lasses, nor theta power to wins or losses. Collectively, findings implicate altered reward processing in the pathophysiology of BPD and may inform early identification and targeted intervention.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) were employed to fMRI functional network classification only very recently and its application to EEG-based connectome is largely unexplored. We propose a DNN with deep belief network (DBN) architecture for automated classification of schizophrenia (SZ) based on EEG effective connectivity. We used vector-autoregression-based directed connectivity (DC), graph-theoretical complex network (CN) measures and combination of both as input features. On a large resting-state EEG dataset, we found a significant decrease in synchronization of neural oscillations measured by partial directed coherence, and a reduced network integration in terms of weighted degrees and transitivity in SZ compared to healthy controls. The proposed DNN-DBN significantly outperforms three other traditional classifiers, due to its inherent capability as feature extractor to learn hierarchical representations from the aberrant brain network structure. Combined DC-CN features gives further improvement over the raw DC and CN features alone, achieving remarkable classification accuracy of 95% for the theta and beta bands.

A frequency-dependent implementation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence was used to characterize non-stationarity patterns. The results showed a statistically significant increase in non-stationarity for AD patients with respect to controls in the 1-70 Hz frequency range, as well as a less pronounced increase for MCI subjects with respect to controls. These results suggest that EEG activity during short time windows consists of more structured oscillations than that of AD patients or MCI subjects.

However, it is unknown which methods are optimally suited to evaluate the hypothesized phase effect. Using a simulation approach, we here test the ability of different methods to detect such an effect on dichotomous (e.g., "hit" vs "miss") and continuous (e.g., scalp potentials) response variables. We manipulated parameters that characterise the phase effect or define the experimental approach to test for this effect. For each parameter combination and response variable, we identified an optimal method. We found that methods regressing single-trial responses on circular (sine and cosine) predictors perform best for all of the simulated parameters, regardless of the nature of the response variable (dichotomous or continuous). In sum, our study lays a foundation for optimized experimental designs and analyses in future studies investigating the role of phase for neural and behavioural responses. We provide MATLAB code for the statistical methods tested.

Sleep spindles have been implicated in memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity during NREM sleep. Detection accuracy and latency in automatic spindle detection are critical for real-time applications. Approach. Here we propose a novel deep learning strategy (SpindleNet) to detect sleep spindles based on a single EEG channel. While the majority of spindle detection methods are used for off-line applications, our method is well suited for online applications. Main results. Compared with other spindle detection methods, SpindleNet achieves superior detection accuracy and speed, as demonstrated in two publicly available expert-validated EEG sleep spindle datasets. Our real-time detection of spindle onset achieves detection latencies of 150-350ms (similar to two-three spindle cycles) and retains excellent performance under low EEG sampling frequencies and low signal-to-noise ratios. SpindleNet has good generalization across different sleep datasets from various subject groups of different ages and species. Significance. SpindleNet is ultra-fast and scalable to multichannel EEG recordings, with an accuracy level comparable to human experts, making it appealing for long-term sleep monitoring and closed-loop neuroscience experiments.

These experiences are usually interpreted as an "encounters with light" and gain mystical meaning. Contrary to the well-studied intentional and controlled visual imagery, spontaneous imagery is poorly understood, yet it plays an important role in creativity of visual artists. The neural correlates of such experiences are indeed hard to capture in laboratory settings. In this case study we aimed to investigate the neural correlates of spontaneous visual imagery in an artist who experiences strong visual imagery during meditation. She uses these images to create visual art. We recorded her EEG during seven meditation sessions in which she experienced visual imagery episodes (visions). To examine the functional role of the neural oscillations we also conducted three separate meditation sessions under different transcranial alternating current (tACS) brain stimulation: alpha (10 Hz), gamma (40 Hz) and sham. We observed a robust increase in occipital gamma power (30-70 Hz) during the deepest stage of meditation across all sessions. This gamma increase was consistent with the experience of spontaneous visual imagery: higher during visions compared to no visions. Alpha tACS was found to affect the contents of her visual imagery, making them sharper, shorter and causing more visions to occur; the artist reported that these sharp images were too detailed to be used in her art. Interestingly, gamma and sham stimulation had no impact on the visual imagery contents. Our findings raise the hypothesis that occipital gamma might be a neural marker of spontaneous visual imagery, which emerges in certain meditation practices of experienced meditators.

This study sought to develop a statistical model for prediction of VNS efficacy. We hypothesized that reactivity of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to external stimuli measured during routine preoperative evaluation differs between VNS responders and non-responders. Materials and Methods: Power spectral analyses were computed retrospectively on pre-operative EEG recordings from 60 epileptic patients with VNS. Thirty five responders and 25 non-responders were compared on the relative power values in four standard frequency bands and eight conditions of clinical assessment-eyes opening/closing, photic stimulation, and hyperventilation. Using logistic regression, groups of electrodes within anatomical areas identified as maximally discriminative by n leave-one-out iterations were used to classify patients. The reliability of the predictive model was verified with an independent data-set from 22 additional patients. Results: Power spectral analyses revealed significant differences in EEG reactivity between responders and non-responders; specifically, the dynamics of alpha and gamma activity strongly reflected VNS efficacy. Using individual EEG reactivity to develop and validate a predictive model, we discriminated between responders and non-responders with 86% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, and 90% specificity. Conclusion: We present a new statistical model with which EEG reactivity to external stimuli during routine presurgical evaluation can be seen as a promising avenue for the identification of patients with favorable VNS outcome. This novel method for the prediction of VNS efficacy might represent a breakthrough in the management of drug-resistant epilepsy, with wide-reaching medical and economic implications.

Conversational expectations get revised as response latencies unfold	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Pragmatics; EEG; Silence; Language comprehension; Corpus	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; INTER-TURN SILENCE; WORD-FREQUENCY; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; EEG	The present study extends neuro-imaging into conversation through studying dialogue comprehension. Conversation entails rapid responses, with negative semiotics for delay. We explored how expectations about the valence of the forthcoming response develop during the silence before the response and whether negative responses have mainly cognitive or social-emotional consequences. EEG-participants listened to questions from a spontaneous spoken corpus, cross-spliced with short/long gaps and "yes"/"no" responses. Preceding contexts biased listeners to expect the eventual response, which was hypothesised to translate to expectations for a shorter or longer gap. "No" responses showed a trend towards an early positivity, suggesting socio-emotional consequences. Within the long gap, expecting a "yes" response led to an earlier negativity, as well as a trend towards stronger theta-oscillations, after 300 milliseconds. This suggests that listeners anticipate/predict "yes" responses to come earlier than "no" responses, showing strong sensitivities to timing, which presumably promote hastening the pace of verbal interaction.

The dopaminergic (DA) system has been shown to be involved in amyloid-beta transformations and neuronal plasticity; however, its role in functional network changes in familial AD still remains unclear. In 5xFAD and non-transgenic freely moving mice, electroencephalograms (EEGs) were simultaneously recorded from the secondary motor cortex (MC), superficial layers of the hippocampal CA1 area (HPC), substantia nigra (SN), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). EEGs and their frequency spectra were analyzed before and after systemic injection of a DA receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO). In the baseline EEG from MC and HPC of 5xFAD mice, delta and alpha oscillations were enhanced and beta activity was attenuated, compared to control mice. In VTA and SN of 5xFAD mice, delta-theta activity was decreased and beta oscillations dominated. In control mice, APO suppressed delta activity in VTA to a higher extent than in MC, whereas in 5xFAD mice, this difference was eliminated due to attenuation of the delta suppression in VTA. APO increased beta activity in MC of mice from both groups while significant beta suppression was observed in VTA of 5xFAD mice. These mice were characterized by significant decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive cells in both VTA and SN and of DA transporter in MC and hippocampal dentate gyrus. We suggest that the EEG modifications observed in 5xFAD mice are associated with alterations in dopaminergic transmission, resulting in adaptive changes in the cerebral networks in the course of familial AD development.

Up to now, various findings of activated patterns associated with different emotions have been reported. However, their stability over time has not been fully investigated yet. In this paper, we focus on identifying EEG stability in emotion recognition. We systematically evaluate the performance of various popular feature extraction, feature selection, feature smoothing and pattern classification methods with the DEAP dataset and a newly developed dataset called SEED for this study. Discriminative Graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine with differential entropy features achieves the best average accuracies of 69.67 and 91.07 percent on the DEAP and SEED datasets, respectively. The experimental results indicate that stable patterns exhibit consistency across sessions; the lateral temporal areas activate more for positive emotions than negative emotions in beta and gamma bands; the neural patterns of neutral emotions have higher alpha responses at parietal and occipital sites; and for negative emotions, the neural patterns have significant higher delta responses at parietal and occipital sites and higher gamma responses at prefrontal sites. The performance of our emotion recognition models shows that the neural patterns are relatively stable within and between sessions.

In this paper, we present MULTISAB, a web platform whose goal is to provide users with detailed analysis capabilities for heterogeneous biomedical time series. We describe the system architecture, including its subprojects: fron-tend, backend and processing. Emphasis is placed on the processing subproject, implemented in Java, which incorporates data analysis methods. The subproject is divided into several frameworks: record input handling, preprocessing, signal visualization, general time series features extraction, specific (domain) time series features extraction, expert system recommendations, data mining, and reporting. Common signal features extraction framework includes a great number of features in time (both linear and nonlinear), frequency and time-frequency domain. Currently, domain specific frameworks for heart rate variability, ECG and EEG feature extraction are supported, which also include preprocessing techniques for noise reduction and detection methods for characteristic waveforms (like QRS complexes, P and T waves in ECG). Parallelization is implemented for feature extraction to increase performance. It is realized using multi-threading on several levels: for multiple records, traces, and segments. Expert system is implemented, which provides automatic recommendation of the set of significant expert features that should be extracted from the analyzed signals, depending on the analysis scenario. The expert system, apart from the role in recommending features, can also participate in automatic diagnosis, after the features are extracted. Current expert system prototype contains diagnostic rules for acute myocardial ischemia, based on medical guidelines. Data mining framework contains dimensionality reduction methods and machine learning classifiers used to construct accurate and interpretable disorder models. A report is produced at the end of the process using openly available libraries. The platform includes best practices from medicine, biomedical engineering, and computer science in order to deliver detailed biomedical time series analysis services to its users.

Here, we investigated whether the CPP might also reflect the evidence for decisions based on a quantitative comparison between two sequentially presented stimuli (a signed quantity). We recorded EEG while participants decided whether the latter of two vibrotactile frequencies was higher or lower than the former in six variants of this task (n = 116). To account for biases in sequential comparisons, we applied a behavioral model based on Bayesian inference that estimated subjectively perceived frequency differences. Immediately after the second stimulus, parietal ERPs reflected the signed value of subjectively perceived differences and afterwards their absolute value. Strikingly, the modulation by signed difference was evident in trials without any objective evidence for either choice and correlated with choice-selective premotor beta band amplitudes. Modulations by the absolute strength of subjectively perceived evidence - a direct indicator of task difficulty - exhibited all features of statistical decision confidence. Together, our data suggest that parietal EEG signals first index subjective evidence, and later include a measure of confidence in the context of perceptual decision making.

However, the functional role and interplay of event-related alpha oscillations remains a regulatory domain that has not been sufficiently addressed, particularly with respect to different muscle activation types and durations in consecutive movement (i.e., motor) tasks. The aim of this study was to investigate alpha-band activity (7-13Hz) in longer vs. shortertimed isometric muscle activations at distinct torques (20% and 40% of maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) when combined in one motor task sequence. In a randomized and controlled design, 18 healthy males volunteered to perform 40 longer (i.e., 6s) and 40 shorter (i.e., 3s) motor task sequences, each comprising isometric contractions (i.e., palmar flexion) from baseline to 20% and 40% MVC subsequent to relaxations from 40% and 20% MVC to baseline. Continuous, synchronized EEG, EMG and torque recordings served to determine alpha-band activity over task-relevant motor areas at distinct torques. Main findings revealed increases in alpha activity during subsequent progressive muscle relaxation (from 20% MVC in long and short: p<.001; from 40% MVC in short: p<.05), whereas modulations in relevant motor areas were not significant (p=.84). It may be suggested that an active task-relevant inhibitory process indicates motor task sequence-related relaxation mirrored by an increasing alpha activity.

Home used, patient self-managed, brain-computer interface for the management of central neuropathic pain post spinal cord injury: usability study	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Central neuropathic pain; Neurofeedback; Spinal cord injury; Brain computer Interface; Usability	CLASSIFICATION; NEUROFEEDBACK; CORTEX; VALIDATION; GUIDELINES; DESIGN; LIFE	Background: Central Neuropathic Pain (CNP) is a frequent chronic condition in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Previously, we showed that using laboratory brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for neurofeedback (NFB) training, it was possible to reduce CNP in people with SCI. In this study, we show results of patient self-managed treatment in their homes with a BCI-NFB using a consumer EEG device. Methods: Users: People with chronic SCI (17 M, 3 F, 50.6 +/- 14.1 years old), and CNP >= 4 on a Visual Numerical Scale. Location: Laboratory training (up to 4 sessions) followed by home self-managed NFB. User Activity: Upregulating the EEG alpha band power by 10% above a threshold and at the same time downregulating the theta and upper beta (20-30 Hz) band power by 10% at electrode location C4. Technology: A consumer grade multichannel EEG headset (Epoch, Emotiv, USA), a tablet computer and custom made NFB software. Evaluation: EEG analysis, before and after NFB assessment, interviews and questionnaires. Results: Effectiveness: Out of 20 initially assessed participants, 15 took part in the study. Participants used the system for 6.9 +/- 5.5 (median 4) weeks. Twelve participants regulated their brainwaves in a frequency specific manner and were most successful upregulating the alpha band power. However they typically upregulated power around their individual alpha peak (7.6 +/- 0.8 Hz) that was lower than in people without CNP. The reduction in pain experienced was statistically significant in 12 and clinically significant (greater than 30%) in 8 participants. Efficiency: The donning was between 5 and 15 min, and approximately 10-20% of EEG data recorded in the home environment was noise. Participants were mildly stressed when self-administering NFB at home (2.4 on a scale 1-10). User satisfaction: Nine participants who completed the final assessment reported a high level of satisfaction (QUESQ, 4.5 +/- 0.8), naming effectiveness, ease of use and comfort as main priorities. The main factors influencing frequency of NFB training were: health related issues, free time and pain intensity. Conclusion: Portable NFB is a feasible solution for home-based self-managed treatment of CNP. Compared to pharmacological treatments, NFB has less side effects and provides users with active control over pain.	[Al-Taleb, M. K.

Also, increased theta and reduced beta power were observed during mind wandering (MW) compared to episodes of focused attention. Thus, increased resting-state frontal TBR could be related to MW, suggesting that previously observed relationships between TBR and attentional control could reflect MW episodes increasing the average resting state TBR in people with low attentional control. Goals: To replicate and extend the previous theta and beta MW effects for frontal TBR recordings and test if MW related changes in frontal TBR are related to attentional control. Method: Twenty-six healthy participants performed a 40-minute breath-counting task, after a baseline EEG recording, while EEG was measured and participants indicated MW episodes with button presses. Results: Frontal TBR was significantly higher during MW episodes than during on-task periods. However, no relation between frontal TBR and attentional control was found. Conclusions: This confirms that frontal TBR varies with MW, which is thought to reflect, among other things, a state of reduced top-down attentional control over thoughts.

To address this issue, EEG was employed while table tennis players and novices observed videos of serves in order to predict the expected ball direction based on the kinematics of a model's movement. Furthermore, we manipulated the congruency between the model's body kinematics and the subsequent ball trajectory while assessing the cerebral cortical activity of novices and experts to understand how experts respond to unexpected outcomes. Experts were more accurate in predicting the ball trajectories than novices and were further differentiated from novices in the cortical dynamics just prior to ball contact and during the period of observation of the ball trajectories. Consistent with the predicted response-outcome model, experts exhibited elevated theta oscillations during the incongruent relative to the congruent trajectories, while no such differences were observed in the novices. Source estimation for theta activity revealed stronger activation in the middle frontal gyrus for the experts in response to the incongruent trajectories. Collectively, the observed differences in cortical dynamics between the groups suggest that motor experience promotes central neural system adaptations that facilitate preparation for anticipated outcomes and contributes to adaptive cognitive-motor responses in the face of uncertainty.

The incubation phenomenon - a preparation to problem solving during a period of relative rest, with no signs of purposeful efforts to resolve the task - is known to scientists for decades. No doubt, some critically important for problem solving (first of all, insightful, as opposed to analytical problem solving) processes must take place during this time. Although a considerable number of studies have been conducted and plausible hypotheses have been formulated, the understanding of this phenomenon still remains far from being satisfying. In this review, a possible association of the incubation phenomenon with activity of the so-called "resting state networks" (RSN) will be scrutinized. The discovery of RSNs is considered a breakthrough in neuroscience of the 21st century, Three most important RSNs are the default mode network (DMN), the central executive network (CEN), and the salience network (SN). We describe them along with methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electro/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) that are most frequently used in studying these networks. We discuss new neurocognitive studies of creative thinking, in which an association of insightful problem solving with one of these networks or their combinations has been revealed. We also consider main hypotheses proposed to explain the overcoming of fixation on erroneous solutions during apparent inactivity in terms of network interactions. In our opinion, this new direction of research may help in interdisciplinary grounding earlier psychological explanations and, to some extent, in rehabilitating the "restful inactivity" to optimize the work scheduling of personnel in creative professions.

High-beta/low-gamma frequency activity reflects top-down predictive coding during a spatial working memory test	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Spatial working memory; EEG; T-maze; Predictive coding	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BAND ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYSFUNCTION; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; ABLATION	Numerous mental health disorders are characterized by cognitive impairments that result in poor vocational and social outcomes. Among the cognitive domains commonly affected, working memory deficits have been noted in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Martinussen et al. in J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 44:377-384, 2005), post-traumatic stress disorder (Honzel et al. in Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci 14:792-804, 2014), and consistently with schizophrenia patients (Callicott et al. in Cereb Cortex 10:1078-1092, 2000; Lewis et al. in Front Hum Neurosci 10:85, 2005; Amann et al. in Brain Res Bull 83:147-161, 2010; Limongi et al. in Schizophr Res 197:386-391, 2018). Oscillations in neural activity from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are decomposed by frequency, and band-specific decreases in gamma power (>30Hz) have been correlated with working memory ability. This study examined within-subject changes in power of frequency-specific bands during sample versus choice trials during a spatial working memory paradigm (T-maze). EEG was recorded using a relatively novel wireless EEG telemetry system fully implanted within the mouse, enabling uninhibited movement during behavioral tasks. No significant differences were found between sample and correct choice phases in the alpha, theta or gamma frequency ranges. Evoked power was significantly higher during the choice phase than the sample phase in the high-beta/low-gamma frequency range. This frequency range has been implicated in the propagation of cortical predictions to lower levels of stimuli encoding in a top-down hierarchical manner. Results suggest there is an increase in brain activity during correct trials when the mouse enters the opposite arm during the choice phase compared to the sample phase, likely due to prediction error resulting from a discrepancy between present and prior experience. Future studies should identify specific cortical networks involved and investigate neural activity at the neuronal level.

The development of this new technology has been devoted to safety, but comfortability for drivers has not been interested. The safety is necessary, but the comfortability should be considered to achieve a reliable technology. Thus we investigated how the mental state appears in physiological signals during autonomous driving. To this end, we explored the responses of physiological signals to normal and abnormal brake situation in a simulated autonomous car. It was assumed that a brake timing of drivers is different from each other. Thus, we created normal and abnormal brake scenes in autonomous driving simulation. Then, we recorded EEG and ECG signals during the normal and abnormal brake situations of autonomous driving. In the abnormal brake situation, after brake, an event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the frequency band of 8 to 13 Hz observed in some subjects. Those subjects showed higher tension by analysis RR interval of ECG: the ratio of LF power to HF power during abnormal brake situation was higher than normal brake situation.

In order to dissociate neural mechanisms specific to motor stopping from general control processes which are also relevant for other types of conflict adjustments, we compared midfronta I oscillatory activity in human volunteers via EEG between action inhibition and two other types of motor conflicts, unexpected action activation and unexpected action change. Error rates indicated that action activation was significantly easier than the other two equally demanding tasks. Midfrontal brain oscillations were significantly stronger for inhibition than for both other conflict types. This was driven by increases in the delta range (2-3 Hz), which were higher for inhibition than activation and action change. Increases in the theta range (4-7 Hz) were equally high for inhibition and change, but lower for action activation. These findings suggest that inhibition is facilitated by neural mechanisms specific to motor-stopping, with midfrontal delta being a potentially selective marker of motor inhibition.

Electroencephalographic data were recorded from 56 scalp electrodes in 13 football players and eight matched non-players during the observation of 70 videos with football actions lasting 2.5 s each. During these videos, the central fixation target changed color from red to blue or vice versa. The videos were watched two times. One time, the subjects were asked to estimate the distance between players during each action (FOOTBALL condition, visuospatial). Another time, they had to estimate if the fixation target was colored for a longer time in red or blue color (CONTROL condition, non-visuospatial). The order of the two conditions was pseudo-randomized across the subjects. Cortical activity was estimated as the percent reduction in power of scalp alpha rhythms (about 8-12 Hz) during the videos compared with a pre-video baseline (event-related desynchronization, ERD). In the FOOTBALL condition, a prominent and bilateral parietal alpha ERD (i.e., cortical activation) was greater in the football players than non-players (p < 0.05) in contrast with the neural efficiency hypothesis. In the CONTROL condition, no significant alpha ERD difference was observed. No difference in behavioral response time and accuracy was found between the two groups in any condition. In conclusion, a prominent parietal cortical activity related to visuospatial processes during football scenes was greater in the football players over controls in contrast with the neural efficiency hypothesis.

Lateralized Suppression of Alpha-Band EEG Activity As a Mechanism of Target Processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha-band; attention; EEG; lateralization; N2pc	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; SEARCH; RESOLUTION; MODULATION; ALLOCATION; RHYTHM	Alpha-band (8 - 12 Hz) EEG activity has been linked to visual attention since the earliest EEG studies. More recent studies using spatial cuing paradigms have shown that alpha is suppressed over the hemisphere contralateral to a to-be-attended location, suggesting that alpha serves as a mechanism of preparatory attention. Here, we demonstrate that alpha also plays a role in active target processing. EEG activity was recorded from a group of healthy male and female human subjects in two visual search experiments. In addition to alpha activity, we also assessed the N2pc event-related potential component, a lateralized transient EEG response that has been tightly linked with the focusing of attention on visual targets. We found that the visual search targets triggered both an N2pc component and a suppression of alpha-band activity that was greatest over the hemisphere contralateral to the target (which we call "target-elicited lateralized alpha suppression" or TELAS). In Experiment 1, both N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets presented in the lower visual field but were absent for upper-field targets. However, these two lateralized effects had different time courses and they responded differently to manipulations of crowding in Experiment 2. These results indicate that lateralized alpha-band activity is involved in active target processing and is not solely a preparatory mechanism and also that TELAS and N2pc reflect a related but separable neural mechanism of visuospatial attention.

However, constraints of this activation linked to linguistic and extra-linguistic context, function and timing have not yet been fully explored. Importantly, embodied cognition binds social and physical contexts to cognition, suggesting that more ecologically valid contexts will yield more valid measures of cognitive processing. Herein, we measured cortical motor activation during language processing in a fully immersive Cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). EEG was recorded while participants engaged in a Go/No-Go task. They heard action verbs and, for Go trials, performed a corresponding action on a virtual object. ERSP (event-related spectral perturbation) was calculated during verb processing, corresponding to the pattern of power suppression (event-related desynchronization ERD) and enhancement (event-related synchronization - ERS) relative to the reference interval. Significant ERD emerged during verb processing in both the mu (8-13 Hz) and beta band (20-30 Hz) for both Go and No-Go trials. mu ERD emerged in the 400-500 msec time window, associated with lexical-semantic processing. Greater mu ERD emerged for Go compared to No-Go trials. The present results provide compelling evidence in a naturalistic setting of how motor and linguistic processes interact.

J	Zhang, HH; Deng, ZC; Liu, S				Zhang, Honghui; Deng, Zichen; Liu, Shuang			Transition Dynamics of Generalized Periodic Discharges Observed in EEG Waveforms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Article						Generalized periodic discharge (GPD); epileptiform; mean field model; transition dynamics	CRITICALLY-ILL; PATTERNS; NETWORKS; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION	Generalized periodic discharges (GPD) are generalized waveforms that recur with a relatively uniform morphology and duration observed in EEG recordings of many types of metabolic encephalopathy, which are often referred to as epileptiform. In this paper, we try to link these spatiotemporal electrocortical activities and significant attributes of cortex based on Liley's mean field model, and seek possible generation mechanisms of GPD rhythms from several factors. To these ends, the dynamical properties of simulated EEG consistent with neurophysiological features of human cortex are investigated, among which GPD patterns are our focus. Firstly, with different value sets of model parameters, we reproduce some typical simulation waveforms which are analogous to mammalian normal or abnormal brain activities detected by EEG. Or in other words, we put more emphasis on brain waveforms of GPD states, normal states, and low firing rate states in our numerical simulations, and mode transitions among different firing states are our main interests. Secondly, through analysis of maximum Lyapunov exponents and frequency spectrum, we give several mode transitions by varying synaptic connections between excitatory and inhibitory populations, which support the conjecture that selective changes of synaptic connections can trigger GPD states, such as in excitatory (AMPA receptors) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA receptors). Thirdly, we stress the importance of time delay on neural population connections and find that they are free to transfer among different firing modes with appropriate time delays. Furthermore, considering the effects of external inputs to cerebral cortex, we verify that stimulation can lead to good controls on GPD patterns, including facilitation and elimination. Finally, we show that more dynamical rhythms can be produced when taking into account the cortico-cortical connections. These modeling results are expected to shed light into the pathophysiological mechanisms of GPD modes from a theoretical viewpoint.

Approach: We analyze short-term HRV in 37 children suffering from generalized or focal epilepsy, monitored 10 s, 300 s, 600 s and 1800 s both before and after seizure episodes. Nine indexes are computed in time (mean, standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals, root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD)), frequency (low-to-high frequency power ratio LF/HF, normalized LF and HF power) and information (entropy, conditional entropy and self-entropy) domains. Focal and generalized epilepsy are compared through statistical analysis of the indexes and using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Main results: In children with focal epilepsy, early post-ictal phase is characterized by significant tachycardia, depressed HRV, increased LF power and LF/HF, and decreased complexity, progressively recovered across time windows after the episodes. Children with generalized seizures instead show significant tachycardia, lower RMSSD, higher LF power and LF/HF ratio before the seizure. These different behaviors are exploited by LDA analysis to separate focal and generalized epilepsy up to an accuracy of 75%. Results suggest a shift of the sympatho-vagal balance towards sympathetic dominance and vagal withdrawal, noticeable just after the termination of seizure episodes and then reverted in focal epilepsy, and persistent during inter-ictal and pre-ictal periods in generalized epilepsy. Significance: Our analysis helps in elucidating the pathophysiology of inter-ictal HRV autonomic control and the differential diagnosis of generalized and focal epilepsy. These findings may have clinical relevance since altered sympatho-vagal control can be related to a higher danger of morbidity and mortality, may reduce thresholds for life-threatening arrhythmias, and could be a biomarker of risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

J	Pornpattananangkul, N; Grogans, S; Yu, RJ; Nusslock, R				Pornpattananangkul, Narun; Grogans, Shannon; Yu, Rongjun; Nusslock, Robin			Single-trial EEG dissociates motivation and conflict processes during decision-making under risk	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Decision under risk; Single-trial EEG; P3; Delta power; Alpha and beta suppression; Hierarchical Bayesian modeling	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; REWARD ANTICIPATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PROSPECT-THEORY; LOSS AVERSION; MONETARY LOSS; BRAIN; P300; COMPONENTS; MOTOR	In making decisions under risk (i.e., choosing whether to gamble when the outcome probabilities are known), two aspects of decision are of particular concern. The first, if gambling, is how large are potential gains compared to losses? The subjectively larger, the more rewarding to gamble. Thus, this aspect of decision-making, quantified through expected utility (EU), is motivation-related. The second concern is how easy is it to reach the decision? When subjective desirability between gambling and not-gambling is clearly different from each other (regardless of the direction), it is easier to decide. This aspect, quantified through utility distance (UD), is conflict-related. It is unclear how the brain simultaneously processes these two aspects of decision-making. Forty-five participants decided whether to gamble during electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. To compute trial-by-trial variability in EU and UD, we fit participants' choices to models inspired by Expected-Utility and Prospect theories using hierarchical-Bayesian modeling. To examine unique influences of EU and UD, we conducted model-based single trial EEG analyses with EU and UD as simultaneous regressors. While both EU and UD were positively associated with P3-like activity and delta-band power, the contribution of EU was around 200 ms earlier. Thus, during decision-making under risk, people may allocate their attention to motivation-related aspects before conflict related aspects. Next, following learning the options and before reporting their decision, higher EU was associated with stronger alpha and beta suppression, while higher UD was associated with a stronger contingent negativity -variation-like activity. This suggests distinct roles of EU and UD on anticipation-related processes. Overall, we identified time and frequency characteristics of EEG signals that differentially traced motivation related and conflict-related information during decision-making under risk.

Nonlinear effect of biological feedback on brain attentional state	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Visual attention; EEG analysis; Brain-computer interface; Biological feedback	VISUAL-PERCEPTION; WORKING-MEMORY; MENTAL FATIGUE; MODULATION; PLASTICITY; SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; STRATEGY; MODEL	A nonlinear effect of biological feedback on visual perception is studied when a brain-computer interface is applied. The implemented algorithm for estimation of visual attention is based on the time-frequency analysis of human electroencephalograms in real time by measuring the amplitude of the stimulus-related brain response, which takes subsequently positive and negative values. The analysis shows that time intervals with positive amplitude are associated with periods of sustained attention, whereas time intervals with negative amplitude are related to mental fatigue. The comparison of the results obtained in two groups of subjects, one without feedback and another with feedback, demonstrate that the feedback control prolongs the periods of sustained attention. The largest interval of sustained attention in the former group reached only 100 +/- 20 s versus 150 +/- 40 s in the latter group. However, the mean degree of attention, estimated by averaging the brain response amplitude over the whole interval, was 27% lower in the group with feedback than in another group. The obtained results evidence that cognitive resource is limited, and therefore, to maintain high performance for prolonged time, the brain has to work in a safe-mode regime.

Neural anticipatory mechanisms predict faster reaction times and higher fluid intelligence	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha power; anticipation; contingent negative variation; Hick paradigm; reaction time; uncertainty	AUDITORY-DISCRIMINATION TASK; ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPATIAL ATTENTION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; MENTAL-ABILITY; BASAL GANGLIA	Higher cognitive ability is reliably linked to better performance on chronometric tasks (i.e., faster reaction times, RT), yet the neural basis of these effects remains unclear. Anticipatory processes represent compelling yet understudied potential mechanisms of these effects, which may facilitate performance through reducing the uncertainty surrounding the temporal onset of stimuli (temporal uncertainty) and/or facilitating motor readiness despite uncertainty about impending target locations (target uncertainty). Specifically, the contingent negative variation (CNV) represents a compelling candidate mechanism of anticipatory motor planning, while the alpha oscillation is thought to be sensitive to temporal contingencies in perceptual systems. The current study undertook a secondary analysis of a large data set (n = 91) containing choice RT, cognitive ability, and EEG measurements to help clarify these issues. Single-trial EEG analysis in conjunction with mixed-effects modeling revealed that higher fluid intelligence corresponded to faster RT on average. When considered together, temporal and target uncertainty moderated the RT-ability relationship, with higher ability being associated with greater resilience to both types of uncertainty. Target uncertainty attenuated the amplitude of the CNV for all participants, but higher ability individuals were more resilient to this effect. Similarly, only higher ability individuals showed increased prestimulus alpha power (at left-lateralized sites) during longer, more easily anticipated interstimulus intervals. Collectively, these findings emphasize top-down anticipatory processes as likely contributors to chronometry-ability correlations.

Detecting Mental Workload in Surgical Teams Using a Wearable Single-Channel Electroencephalographic Device	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Surgical skills assessment; patient safety; neuroergonomics; coordination; brain synchrony	SKILLS ASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE; EEG; STRESS; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; PHYSICIANS; SLEEPINESS; ATTENTION; TEAMWORK	OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity of an electroencephalographic (EEG)-based index, the prefrontal beta power, to quantify the mental workload in surgeons in real scenarios. Such EEG-based index might offer unique and unbiased measures of overload, a crucial factor when designing learning and training surgical programs. DESIGN: The experiment followed a 2 x 2 x 2 within subjects design with 3 factors: (1) Surgical Role during the surgery (primary surgeon vs. assistant surgeon), (2) the Surgical Procedure (laparo-endoscopic single-site [LESS] surgery vs. multiport laparoscopic surgery [MPS]), and (3) the Suturing Techniques (interrupted vs. continuous suture). SETTING: The study was carried out at the Advanced Multi-Purpose Simulation and Technological Innovation Complex situated at IAVANTE (Granada, Spain). METHODS: Four surgical teams (primary surgeon and assistant surgeon, experts in MPS) performed 8 surgical exercises on porcine models, under different task complexities. They performed 2 suturing techniques (continuous and interrupted), employing a low complex procedure (MPS) and a high complex procedure (LESS). Surgeons acted as the primary surgeon during half of the exercises, and, as the assistant surgeon, during the rest of them. Simultaneously, we monitored EEG prefrontal EEG beta power spectra of both surgeons, using 2 synchronized wearable EEG devices. We also collected performance and subjective data. RESULTS: Surgical complexity modulated prefrontal beta power. LESS surgery caused significant higher prefrontal beta power for both suturing techniques for both surgical roles which indicates higher demands than MPS. Perceived task complexity, overall surgical evaluation, and laparoscopic execution time confirmed EEG-based results. Finally, subjective ratings of surgical complexity differentiated between surgical roles within the same exercise, even when prefrontal beta power did not. CONCLUSIONS: To detect mental overload when surgeons are engaged with complex surgeries, real or simulated, is still guesswork. EEG-based indices have great potential as objective and nonintrusive measures to assess mental overload in surgeons. Furthermore, EEG-based indices might play a relevant role in monitoring surgeons and residents' cognitive state during their training. ((C) 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Slower alpha rhythm associates with poorer seizure control in epilepsy	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; INFERENCE	Objective Slowing and frontal spread of the alpha rhythm have been reported in multiple epilepsy syndromes. We investigated whether these phenomena are associated with seizure control. Methods We prospectively acquired resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) in 63 patients with focal and idiopathic generalized epilepsy (FE and IGE) and 39 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects (HS). Patients were divided into good and poor (>= 4 seizures/12 months) seizure control groups based on self-reports and clinical records. We computed spectral power from 20-sec EEG segments during eyes-closed wakefulness, free of interictal abnormalities, and quantified power in high- and low-alpha bands. Analysis of covariance and post hoc t-tests were used to assess group differences in alpha-power shift across all EEG channels. Permutation-based statistics were used to assess the topography of this shift across the whole scalp. Results Compared to HS, patients showed a statistically significant shift of spectral power from high- to low-alpha frequencies (effect size g = 0.78 [95% confidence interval 0.43, 1.20]). This alpha-power shift was driven by patients with poor seizure control in both FE and IGE (g = 1.14, [0.65, 1.74]), and occurred over midline frontal and bilateral occipital regions. IGE exhibited less alpha power shift compared to FE over bilateral frontal regions (g = -1.16 [-0.68, -1.74]). There was no interaction between syndrome and seizure control. Effects were independent of antiepileptic drug load, time of day, or subgroup definitions. Interpretation Alpha slowing and anteriorization are a robust finding in patients with epilepsy and might represent a generic indicator of seizure liability.

J	Sassenhagen, J				Sassenhagen, Jona			How to analyse electrophysiological responses to naturalistic language with time- resolved multiple regression	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						ERP; story comprehension; EEG/MEG; rERP	TEMPORAL RECEPTIVE WINDOWS; DISTRIBUTED LAG; COMPONENT; INTEGRATION; HIERARCHY; SPEECH; WORDS	Naturalistic language processing cannot be approached with the analysis methods constructed to handle well-controlled experiments. Language is a multi- and cross-level phenomenon, with sequential interdependencies and correlations between various lexical dimensions. A recently-developed method allows the analysis of neural time series during natural story comprehension: time-resolved multiple regression. It consists in modelling continuous brain recordings with multiple regression after embedding linguistic features in a temporal-extension matrix (a distributed-lags model). It identifies neural correlates of linguistic processes, accounting for temporal interdependencies - simultaneously for, e.g. acoustics, phonology and semantics. This has resulted in impactful discoveries about how brains process coherent speech, potentially broadening the class of phenomena that can be studied. I discuss the method conceptually, highlight caveats, and relate it to similar as well as to traditional methods, all with a particular consideration for analysing the processing of coherent narratives. In a practical example, the word frequency-dependent N400 effect is estimated from a half-hour continuous narrative.

Delay differential analysis for dynamical sleep spindle detection	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article							EEG	Background: Sleep spindles are involved in memory consolidation and other cognitive functions. Numerous automated methods for detection of spindles have been proposed; most of these rely on spectral analysis in some form. However, none of these approaches are ideal, and novel approaches to the problem could provide additional insights. New method: Here, we apply delay differential analysis (DDA), a time-domain technique based on nonlinear dynamics to detect sleep spindles in human intracranial sleep data, including laminar electrode, stereoelectroencephalogram (sEEG), and electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings. Results: We show that this approach is computationally fast, generalizable, requires minimal preprocessing, and provides excellent agreement with human scoring. Comparison with existing methods: We compared the method with established methods on a set of intracranial recordings and this method provided the highest agreement with human expert scoring when evaluated with F-1 score while being the second-fastest to run. We also compared the results on the DREAMS surface EEG data, where the method produced a higher average F-1 score than all other tested methods except the automated detections published with the DREAMS data. Further, in addition to being a fast and reliable method for spindle detection, DDA also provides a novel characterization of spindle activity based on nonlinear dynamical content of the data. Conclusions: This additional, non-frequency-based perspective could prove particularly useful for certain atypical spindles, or identifying spindles of different types.

Despite increasing evidence revealing the relationship between task-related brain activity and decision-making, the association between resting-state functional connectivity and decision-making remains unknown. Approach. In this study, we investigated the potential relationship between the network revealed in the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) and decision responses and further predicted individuals' acceptance rates during the ultimatum game (UG) based on the functional connectivity revealed in the resting-state EEG. Main results. The results of this study demonstrated a significant relationship between the resting-state frontal-occipital connectivity and the UG acceptance rate in the alpha band. Increased acceptance rates were accompanied by a larger clustering coefficient and global and local efficiency as well as a shorter characteristic path length. Compared to the low-acceptance group, the high-acceptance group exhibited stronger frontal-occipital linkages. Finally, a multiple linear regression model based on the resting-state EEG network properties was adopted to predict the acceptance rates when subjects made their decision in the UG task. Significance. Together, the findings of this study may deepen our knowledge of decision-making and provide a potential physiological biomarker to predict the decision-making responses of subjects.

Discrete Structure of the Brain Rhythms	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NOISE; SYNCHRONIZATION; APPROXIMATION; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSFORM; SPINDLES; SLEEP; EEG	Neuronal activity in the brain generates synchronous oscillations of the Local Field Potential (LFP). The traditional analyses of the LFPs are based on decomposing the signal into simpler components, such as sinusoidal harmonics. However, a common drawback of such methods is that the decomposition primitives are usually presumed from the onset, which may bias our understanding of the signal's structure. Here, we introduce an alternative approach that allows an impartial, high resolution, hands-off decomposition of the brain waves into a small number of discrete, frequency-modulated oscillatory processes, which we call oscillons. In particular, we demonstrate that mouse hippocampal LFP contain a single oscillon that occupies the theta-frequency band and a couple of gamma-oscillons that correspond, respectively, to slow and fast gamma-waves. Since the oscillons were identified empirically, they may represent the actual, physical structure of synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles, whereas Fourier-defined "brain waves" are nothing but poorly resolved oscillons.

Here, we analyzed electroencephalogram (EEG) data from patients with AD and found an EEG signature of transient slowing of the cortical network that we termed paroxysmal slow wave events (PSWEs). The occurrence per minute of the PSWEs was correlated with level of cognitive impairment. Interictal (between seizures) PSWEs were also found in patients with epilepsy, localized to cortical regions displaying blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and in three rodent models with BBB pathology: aged mice, young 5x familial AD model, and status epilepticus-induced epilepsy in young rats. To investigate the potential causative role of BBB dysfunction in network modifications underlying PSWEs, we infused the serum protein albumin directly into the cerebral ventricles of naive young rats. Infusion of albumin, but not artificial cerebrospinal fluid control, resulted in high incidence of PSWEs. Our results identify PSWEs as an EEG manifestation of nonconvulsive seizures in patients with AD and suggest BBB pathology as an underlying mechanism and as a promising therapeutic target.

Given the aging society, it is important to understand the neural mechanisms constraining perception in the elderly. In young participants, the state of rhythmic brain activity prior to a stimulus has been shown to modulate the neural encoding and perceptual impact of this stimulus - yet it remains unclear whether, and if so, how, the perceptual relevance of pre-stimulus activity changes with age. Using the auditory system as a model, we recorded EEG activity during a frequency discrimination task from younger and older human listeners. By combining single-trial EEG decoding with linear modelling we demonstrate consistent statistical relations between pre-stimulus power and the encoding of sensory evidence in short-latency EEG components, and more variable relations between pre-stimulus phase and subjects' decisions in longer-latency components. At the same time, we observed a significant slowing of auditory evoked responses and a flattening of the overall EEG frequency spectrum in the older listeners. Our results point to mechanistically consistent relations between rhythmic brain activity and sensory encoding that emerge despite changes in neural response latencies and the relative amplitude of rhythmic brain activity with age.

Two types of electroencephalograms (EEG), P300 and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), have been widely used to enable paralyzed patients to communicate with others. Although there have been many signal processing algorithms focusing on target identification accuracies such as power spectral density analysis (PSDA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), their high computational complexity drives up the cost of such systems. In the proposed lightweight target identification algorithm, we have focused on developing an improved information transfer rate (ITR) for high-quality communication and reducing overall implementation cost. The proposed algorithm, CCA-Lite, includes two algorithmic optimizations-signal binarization and on-the-fly covariance matrix calculation- which have enabled the development of a low-cost, single-channel, and wearable BCI system using SSVEP. The prototypical BCI system makes use of an ARM Cortex-M3-based low-cost microcontroller unit (MCU), which has been built for 1.5s SSVEP recordings. Compared to the state-of-the-art CCA-based target identification algorithm, CCA-Lite exhibits 25% better ITR and has reduced memory requirements by 92% and single-target identification cycle time by 26%.

The correlation between EEG features and the training state of the subjects or their performance in WM tasks had been investigated by many researches. However, there was no research done on the comparison between the training and performance to investigate which one is more correlated with the EEG features and adequately developed practical application of this correlation by now. This paper used phase synchronization methods to build functional brain networks (FBN) of the subjects based on their task-related EEG. Based on this, we investigated the correlation of the global and local features of the FBNs and applied Quadratic Discriminant, Cosine KNN and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) to evaluate the performance and the training state. The accuracy of training state detection was 98.7%, while the accuracy of performance prediction (predict if the score>79) was 81.2% and the MSE of the score prediction was 144.24. The results suggested that the training state is more reliance to the FBN features than performance. The method had the potential to be extended to other fields to assess WM ability or proficiency of people. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, manipulation of the console by physicians themselves may not be possible because their hands may be otherwise engaged. In this study, an image manipulation system using an electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor mounted on the operator's head was developed. In this system, data acquired by the device is used to manipulate images, and the output can be converted to commands for various actions such as paging, which can be controlled by the operator's eye-blink, and zooming of a region indicated by the cursor, which can be controlled by the operator's mental concentration. In this study, the MindWave Mobile headset was used as EEG sensor, and AZEWIN for the display system. Ten observers were enrolled and fitted with EEG device to determine the threshold values of blink strength and attention; threshold value of 100 for blink strength and 65 for attention were determined. Thirty-one observers were enrolled and fitted with EEG device to investigate average response-time; the average response time for detecting paging was 0.43 +/- 0.02s, and that for zooming was 5.85 +/- 0.56s. Thus, the proposed image manipulation system using the operator's EEG signals enabled physicians to assess and manipulate images without using their hands.

Since EEG activities during sleep exhibit physiological and pathological situation of the brain, analyzing the oscillations during various sleep stages are of fundamental importance for the assessment of sleep disorders. On the other hand, recent developments in the fields of signal processing and pattern recognition have prompted sleep researchers to employ accurate and reliable computerized systems in diagnosis processes. The purpose of this paper was to develop a novel automated methodology for diagnosing apneic patients from healthy subjects using single channel EEG signal. To this end, it was concentrated on the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. A comprehensive time-domain based feature extraction scheme was proposed for extracting features from various EEG frequency bands of REM sleep. Uninformative features were eliminated by minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm. An ensemble learning method namely random undersampling boosting (RUSBoost) was then utilized for the purpose of classitication. The effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach were evaluated using k-fold cross-validation technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can be used as an efficient method for automated SAS screening with regard to promising classification performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

Methods: Eight combinations of four modalities of PSG signals, namely electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) were considered to find the optimal fusion of PSG signals. A total of 232 features, covering statistical characters, frequency characters, time-frequency characters, fractal characters, entropy characters and nonlinear characters, were derived from these PSG signals. To select the optimal features for each signal fusion, four widely used feature selection methods were compared. At the classification stage, five different classifiers were employed to evaluate the validity of the features and to classify sleep stages. Results: For the database in the present study, the best classifier, random forest, realized the optimal consistency of 86.24% with the sleep macrostructures scored by the technologists trained at the Sleep Center. The optimal accuracy was achieved by fusing four modalities of PSG signals. Specifically, the top twelve features in the optimal feature set were respectively EEG features named zero-crossings, spectral edge, relative power spectral of theta, Petrosian fractal dimension, approximate entropy, permutation entropy and spectral entropy, and EOG features named spectral edge, approximate entropy, permutation entropy and spectral entropy, and the mutual information between EEG and submental EMG. In addition, ECG features (e.g. Petrosian fractal dimension, zero-crossings, mean value of R amplitude and permutation entropy) were useful for the discrimination among W, S1 and R. Conclusions: Through exploring the different fusions of multi-modality signals, the present study concluded that the multi-modality of PSG signals' fusion contributed to higher accuracy, and the optimal feature set was a fusion of multiple types of features. Besides, compared with manual scoring, the proposed automatic scoring methods were cost-effective, which would alleviate the burden of the physicians, speed up sleep scoring, and expedite sleep research.

Resting EEG in alpha and beta bands predicts individual differences in attentional breadth	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Attentional breadth; Global/local; Alpha; Beta; Individual differences; Resting EEG; Attention	MOTIVATED POSITIVE AFFECT; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CORRELATE; STATES; BRAIN; BIAS	Whether individuals focus their attention on the global level (the forest), or local elements that make up the stimulus (the trees) remains relatively stable over a period of at least 10 days in multiple global/local measures. Greater attentional approach tendencies and vigilance, which are likely reflected by lower alpha and higher beta power, are associated with narrowed attentional breadth. The current study investigated whether individual differences in the propensity for individuals to focus on the global or local levels (attentional breadth) can be predicted based on EEG power in alpha and its neighbouring frequency bands during a preceding rest period. Greater levels of posterior alpha and preponderance of alpha-to-beta power at rest were associated with greater attentional breadth during the subsequent Navon letters task. These results suggest that neural indices of attentional approach when not engaged in a goal-orientated task are associated with individual differences in attentional breadth.

However, contingencies in our environment are not always explicitly present and sometimes need to be inferred. Heretofore, it remained unknown howpredictive information guides decision-making when explicit knowledge is absent and how the brain shapes such implicit inferences. In the present experiment, 17 human participants (9 females) performed a discrimination task in which a target stimulus was preceded by a predictive cue. Critically, participants had no explicit knowledge that some of the cues signaled an upcoming target, allowing us to investigate how implicit inferences emerge and guide decision-making. Despite unawareness of the cue-target contingencies, participants were able to use implicit information to improve performance. Concurrent EEG recordings demonstrate that implicit inferences rely upon interactions between internally and externally oriented networks, whereby prefrontal regions inhibit parietal cortex under internal implicit control.

We hypothesized that active stimulation targeting the DLPFC would enhance proactive control compared to sham, leading to changes in the pattern of error rates and gamma-band power on the Dot Pattern Expectancy (DPX) task. We recorded EEG while participants completed the DPX, after receiving either 20 minutes of active DLPFC stimulation at 2 mA or sham stimulation in a counterbalanced within-participants design. The results showed significant tDCS-induced changes in the pattern of error rates on the DPX task indicative of enhanced proactive control, as well as predicted increases in gamma power associated with the engagement of proactive control. These results provide support for the role of DLPFC-mediated gamma activity in proactive cognitive control, and further, indicate that proactive control can be enhanced with non-invasive neurostimulation.

However, the hemispheric predominance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during time reproduction after repetitive low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is relatively unexplored. Here, we study the effects of 1 Hz rTMS and sham stimulation applied medially over the superior parietal cortex (SPC) on the DLPFC alpha and beta band asymmetry and on time reproduction. Materials and methods: For this purpose, we have combined rTMS with electroencephalography in 20 healthy subjects who performed the time reproduction task in two conditions (sham and 1 Hz). Results: The worst performance was observed in sham and 1Hz conditions for longer time intervals (p < .05), with the 1Hz condition subjects sub-reproducing the time interval, closer to the target interval (p < .05). The right DLPFC hemispheric predominance was found in both conditions, but after low-frequency rTMS, the right hemisphere predominance increased in the 1Hz condition (p < .05). Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that rTMS applied over the SPC influences time interval interpretation and the DLPFC functions. Future studies would explore the effects of the rTMS application to other cortical areas, and study how it influences time interval interpretation.

However, little is known on predictive value of topological properties of widely distributed neural networks immediately following stroke on rehabilitation outcome and post-stroke recovery measured by early functional outcome. The utility of EEG network parameters (i.e. small world organization) analysis as a potential rough and simple biomarker for stroke outcome has been little explored and needs more validation. A total of 139 consecutive patients within a post-stroke acute stage underwent EEG recording. A group of 110 age paired healthy subjects constituted the control group. All patients were clinically evaluated with 3 scales for stroke: NIHSS, Barthel and ARAT. As a first result, NIHSS, Barthel and ARAT correlated with Small World index as provided by the proportional increment/decrement of low (delta) and vice-versa of high (beta2 and gamma) EEG frequency bands. Furthermore, in line with the aim of the present study, we found a strong correlation between NIHSS at follow up and gamma Small World index in the acute poststroke period, giving SW index a significant weight of recovery prediction. This study aimed to investigate possible correlations between functional abnormalities of brain networks, measured by small world characteristics detected in resting state EEG source investigation, and early post-stroke clinical outcome in order to find a possible predictive index of functional recovery to address and/or correct the rehabilitation program.

Sensorimotor system engagement during ASL sign perception: An EEG study in deaf signers and hearing non-signers	CORTEX			English	Article						Sign language; Action simulation; ASL; EEG	MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM; MU-RHYTHM; PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE; BETA OSCILLATIONS; IMITATION; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; COMMUNICATION; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION	When a person observes someone else performing an action, the observer's sensorimotor cortex activates as if the observer is the one performing the action, a phenomenon known as action simulation. While this process has been well-established for basic (e.g., grasping) and complex (e.g., dancing) actions, it remains unknown if the framework of action simulation is applicable to visual languages such as American Sign Language (ASL). We conducted an EEG experiment with deaf signers and hearing non-signers to compare overall sensorimotor EEG between groups, and to test whether sensorimotor systems are differentially sensitive to signs that are produced with one hand ("1H") or two hands ("2H"). We predicted greater alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (previously correlated with action simulation) during the perception of 2H ASL signs compared to 1H ASL signs, due to greater demands on sensorimotor processing systems required for producing two-handed actions. We recorded EEG from both groups as they observed videos of ASL signs, half 1H and half 2H. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) in the alpha and beta ranges were computed for the two conditions at central electrode sites overlying the sensorimotor cortex. Sensorimotor EEG responses in both Hearing and Deaf groups were sensitive to the observed gross motor characteristics of the observed signs. We show for the first time that despite hearing nonsigners showing overall more sensorimotor cortex involvement during sign observation, mirroring-related processes are in fact involved when deaf signers observe signs.

Beside effects on motor function STN-DBS influences many non-motor symptoms, among which decline of verbal fluency test performance is most consistently reported. The surgical procedure itself is the likely cause of this decline, while the influence of the electrical stimulation is still controversial. STN-DBS also produces widespread changes of cortical activity as visualized by quantitative EEG. The present study aims to link an alteration in verbal fluency performance by electrical stimulation of the STN to alterations in quantitative EEG. Methods: Sixteen patients with STN-DBS were included. All patients had a high density EEG recording (256 channels) while testing verbal fluency in the stimulator on/off situation. The phonemic, semantic, alternating phonemic and semantic fluency was tested (Regensburger Wortflussigkeits-Test). Results: On the group level, stimulation of STN did not alter verbal fluency performance. EEG frequency analysis showed an increase of relative alpha2 (10-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) power in the parieto-occipital region (p <= 0.01). On the individual level, changes of verbal fluency induced by stimulation of the STN were disparate and correlated inversely with delta power in the left temporal lobe (p < 0.05). Conclusion: STN stimulation does not alter verbal fluency performance in a systematic way at group level. However, when in individual patients an alteration of verbal fluency performance is produced by electrical stimulation of the STN, it correlates inversely with left temporal delta power.

The current study was designed to extend existing findings on social synchrony to the pendulum swinging task and simultaneously measured time unfolding behavioral synchrony and EEG estimation of mu activity during spontaneous, intentional in-phase and intentional anti-phase interpersonal coordination. As expected, the behavioral measures of synchrony demonstrated the expected pattern of weak synchronization for spontaneous coordination, moderate synchronization for intentional anti-phase coordination, and strong synchronization for in-phase coordination. With respect to the EEG measures, we found evidence for mu enhancement for spontaneous coordination in contrast to mu suppression for intentional coordination (both in phase and anti-phase), with higher levels of synchronization associated with higher levels of mu suppression in the right hemisphere. The implications of the research findings and methodology for understanding the underlying mechanisms contributing to social problems in psychological disorders, leader-follower relationships, and inter-brain dynamics are discussed.

The functional role of beta-oscillations in the supplementary motor area during reaching and grasping after stroke: A question of structural damage to the corticospinal tract	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						DTI; EEG; functional and structural neuroimaging; motor function; SMA; stroke recovery	PREMOTOR CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; FRONTAL-LOBE; RECOVERY; CONNECTIVITY; MOVEMENT; PLASTICITY; PATHWAYS; REPRESENTATION	Hand motor function is often severely affected in stroke patients. Non-satisfying recovery limits reintegration into normal daily life. Understanding stroke-related network changes and identifying common principles that might underlie recovered motor function is a prerequisite for the development of interventional therapies to support recovery. Here, we combine the evaluation of functional activity (multichannel electroencephalography) and structural integrity (diffusion tensor imaging) in order to explain the degree of residual motor function in chronic stroke patients. By recording neural activity during a reaching and grasping task that mimics activities of daily living, the study focuses on deficit-related neural activation patterns. The study showed that the functional role of movement-related beta desynchronization in the supplementary motor area (SMA) for residual hand motor function in stroke patients depends on the microstructural integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST). In particular, in patients with damaged CST, stronger task-related activity in the SMA was associated with worse residual motor function. Neither CST damage nor functional brain activity alone sufficiently explained residual hand motor function. The findings suggest a central role of the SMA in the motor network during reaching and grasping in stroke patients, the degree of functional relevance of the SMA is depending on CST integrity.

However, current methods typically analyse the raw data offline using complex time-consuming algorithms. We developed a compact neuromorphic sensory-processing system-on-chip that can monitor the iEEG signals and detect high frequency oscillations in real-time using spiking neural networks. To this end, we present an integrated device with an analog front-end that can extract predefined spectral features and encode them as address-events, and a neuromorphic processor core that implements a network of integrate and fire neurons with dynamic synapses. The device was fabricated using a standard 0.18 mu m CMOS technology node. The estimated power consumption of the front-end is 6.2 mu W/channel and the area-on-chip for a single channel is 0.15 square millimetres. The SNN classifier provides 90.5% sensitivity and 67.7% specificity for detecting high frequency oscillations. This is the first feasibility study towards identifying relevant features in intracranial human data in real-time on-chip using event-base processors.

FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA: PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT THEY WANT TO BELIEVE WHEN IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Cognition; social media; information quality; fake news; fact-checking; confirmation bias; cognitive dissonance; EEG; NeuroIS	DUAL-PROCESS THEORIES; CATEGORY ACCESSIBILITY; EEG DYNAMICS; INFORMATION; MEMORY; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; CONTEXT; THETA	Fake news (i.e., misinformation) on social media has sharply increased in the past few years. We conducted a behavioral experiment with EEG data from 83 social media users to understand whether they could detect fake news on social media, and whether the presence of a fake news flag affected their cognition and judgment. We found that the presence of a fake news flag triggered increased cognitive activity and users spent more time considering the headline. However, the flag had no effect on judgments about truth; flagging headlines as false did not influence users' beliefs. A post hoc analysis shows that confirmation bias is pervasive, with users more likely to believe news headlines that align with their political opinions. Headlines that challenge their opinions receive little cognitive attention (i.e., they are ignored) and users are less likely to believe them.

Several single channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) indices have been proposed for monitoring anesthetic drug effect. The most commonly used single channel commercial index is the Bispectral index (BIS). However, this monitor has shown some drawbacks. In this study, a nonlinear functional connectivity measure named Standardized Permutation Mutual Information (SPMI) is proposed to describe communication between two-channel EEG signals at frontal and temporal brain regions during a controlled propofol-induced anesthesia and recovery design from eight subjects. The SPMI index has higher correlation with estimated propofol effect-site concentration and has better ability to distinguish three anesthetic states of patient than the other functional connectivity indexes (cross-correlation, coherence, phase analysis) and also the BIS index. Moreover, the SPMI index has a faster reaction to the effect of drug concentration, less variability at the consciousness state and better robustness to noise than BIS.

Decades of research indicate that individuals higher on psychopathy exhibit abnormal allocation of attention during goal pursuit. However. the manner in which attention is allocated to goal-relevant information and the downstream neurocognitive consequences of this attention abnormality remain unclear. The present study addresses this gap by examining the relationship between psychopathy and the allocation of attention during an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based continuous performance task in a sample of 61 adolescents and young adults. Results indicate that individuals higher on psychopathy overallocate attention to visual cues during the task (i.e., enhanced parieto-occipital alpha suppression), and this overallocation of attention reduces the neural resources required for motor control (i.e., blunted central alpha activity during NoGo trials). Psychopathy appears related to a unique pattern of attention allocation that prioritizes neural resources for goal-relevant information, resulting in alterations in the neural response for downstream cognitive functions.

The reward network has been proposed to be critical in gambling behavior, but little is known about the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying individual differences that depend on gambling preference. The main goals of the present study were to explore brain oscillatory responses to gambling outcomes in regular gamblers and to assess differences between strategic gamblers, nonstrategic gamblers, and nongamblers. In all, 54 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Electroencephalography was recorded while participants were playing a slot machine task that delivered win, near-miss, and full-miss outcomes. Behaviorally, regular gamblers selected a larger percentage of risky bets, especially when they could select the image to play. The time-frequency results showed larger oscillatory theta power increases to near-misses and increased beta power to win outcomes for regular gamblers, as compared to nongamblers. Moreover, theta oscillatory activity after wins was only increased in nonstrategic gamblers, revealing differences between the two groups of gamblers. The present results reveal differences between regular gamblers and nongamblers in both their behavioral and neural responses to gambling outcomes. Moreover, the results suggest that different brain oscillatory mechanisms might underlie the studied gambling profiles, which might have implications for both basic and clinical studies.

This current exploratory study compared the neural basis between social creativity and general creativity and explored the effect of creative personality on their neural basis by employing multiple regression analysis. The EEG activities of 34 participants were recorded during social or general creative tasks. The results indicated that a stronger alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) was presented during the social creative task than during the general creative task. High creative personality individuals were found to exhibit higher event-related desynchronization (ERD) only for the upper alpha band. Additionally, high creative personality individuals revealed no significant task differences regarding the alpha ERS. However, low creative personality individuals exhibited a stronger alpha ERS for social creative tasks than they did for general creative tasks. The current investigation could lead to new approaches for examining the brain correlates of creativity from different domains and their correlations with respect to creative personality.

No studies have directly compared specific age-related differences in social exclusion across children, adolescents, and adults using event-related oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics. The authors examined event-related theta EEG power and phase coherence in fair play and social exclusion conditions during the Cyberball task in 166 participants: 42 children (ages 10-12), 56 adolescents (ages 14-17), and 68 adults (ages 18-28). Children and adolescents displayed the greatest theta power to rejection events, whereas adults displayed the greatest theta power to " not my turn" events. Moreover, the functional link between theta power to rejection and self-reported distress was strongest among the adolescents. These findings suggest that an enhanced neural response to social exclusion is present by preadolescence, but the association between neural and subjective responses is most prominent during adolescence.

Individuals with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) are characterized by impaired prefrontal cortex function and cognitive control. This results in an increase in stimulus-driven habitual behavior, particularly related to pathological gaming. In the present study, we investigated the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in individuals with IGD. Twenty-four individuals with IGD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were recruited. We analyzed their EEG activity while the subjects played their favorite game (30-40 min duration). We compared the band power between the two groups. During gaming, the left frontal theta, alpha, and beta band activities were lower in subjects with IGD than in HCs. Moreover, the left frontal theta power negatively correlated with IGD severity. These results indicate that left frontal theta power could be used as a neurophysiological biomarker for the detection of diminished cognitive control patterns in individuals with IGD.

Motion based stimulation has been proven to be less annoying, while at the same time it elicits a comparably strong response as the commonly used SSVEP. In this paper, we present a BCI system that utilizes an oscillation-like (pendulum) behavior for generating steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP), and evaluate its practical use in a four target BCI spelling application. The SSMVEP was investigated with three different frequency sets (Low 3.00-4.29 Hz, Mid 6.00-8.57 Hz, and High 9.23-12.00 Hz) and compared to the standard SSVEP stimulation. In the online experiment seven participants reached average accuracies of 99.0%, 100%, and 98.65% and average information transfer rates of 25.4, 32.5, and 31.05 bits/min for the Low, Mid and High frequency sets, respectively, with the SSMVEP paradigm. The results showed that the presented SSMVEP approach is suitable for BCI application without the typical discomfort for the user. Interestingly, the Low frequency set evoked a relatively strong harmonic response in this study, with performance comparable to the higher frequency sets.

J	Daube, C; Ince, RAA; Gross, J				Daube, Christoph; Ince, Robin A. A.; Gross, Joachim			Simple Acoustic Features Can Explain Phoneme-Based Predictions of Cortical Responses to Speech	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							INFORMATION; DYNAMICS; COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; PRINCIPLES; FREQUENCY; ENVELOPE; MODELS; MEG	When we listen to speech, we have to make sense of a waveform of sound pressure. Hierarchical models of speech perception assume that, to extract semantic meaning, the signal is transformed into unknown, intermediate neuronal representations. Traditionally, studies of such intermediate representations are guided by linguistically defined concepts, such as phonemes. Here, we argue that in order to arrive at an unbiased understanding of the neuronal responses to speech, we should focus instead on representations obtained directly from the stimulus. We illustrate our view with a data-driven, information theoretic analysis of a dataset of 24 young, healthy humans who listened to a 1 h narrative while their magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was recorded. We find that two recent results, the improved performance of an encoding model in which annotated linguistic and acoustic features were combined and the decoding of phoneme subgroups from phoneme-locked responses, can be explained by an encoding model that is based entirely on acoustic features. These acoustic features capitalize on acoustic edges and outperform Gabor-filtered spectrograms, which can explicitly describe the spectrotemporal characteristics of individual phonemes. By replicating our results in publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) data, we conclude that models of brain responses based on linguistic features can serve as excellent benchmarks. However, we believe that in order to further our understanding of human cortical responses to speech, we should also explore low-level and parsimonious explanations for apparent high-level phenomena.

While accuracy within such tasks can be measured in real time, subjective impressions about the difficulty of a task are more elusive to obtain. Prior work utilizing electrophysiology (EEG) has found robust support that cognitive load and working memory can be monitored in real time using EEG data.Methods In this study, we replicated a 3D navigation task (within the context of image-guided surgery) while recording data pertaining to participants' cognitive load through the use of EEG relative alpha-band weighting data. Specifically, 13 subjects navigated a tracked surgical tool to randomly placed 3D virtual locations on a CT cerebral angiography volume while being aided by visual, aural, or both visual and aural feedback. During the study EEG data were captured from the participants, and after the study a NASA TLX questionnaire was filled out by the subjects. In addition to replicating an existing experimental design on auditory display within image-guided neurosurgery, our primary aim sought to determine whether EEG-based markers of cognitive load mirrored subjective ratings of task difficultyResults Similar to existing literature, our study found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that auditory display can increase the accuracy of navigating to a specified target. We also found significant differences in cognitive working load across different feedback modalities, but none of which supported the experiments hypotheses. Finally, we found mixed results regarding the relationship between real-time measurements of cognitive workload and a posteriori subjective impressions of task difficulty.Conclusions Although we did not find a significant correlation between the subjective and physiological measurements, differences in cognitive working load were found. As well, our study further supports the use of auditory display in image-guided surgery.

(2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine exerts mGlu(2) receptor-dependent antidepressant actions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						ketamine; hydroxynorketamine; antidepressant; mGlu(2) receptor; cortical EEG	METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; GAMMA FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; FORCED SWIM TEST; GROUP-II; KETAMINE METABOLITE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AMPA RECEPTOR; ANTIPSYCHOTIC PROFILES	Currently approved antidepressant drugs often take months to take full effect, and similar to 30% of depressed patients remain treatment resistant. In contrast, ketamine, when administered as a single subanesthetic dose, exerts rapid and sustained antidepressant actions. Preclinical studies indicate that the ketamine metabolite (2R, 6R)-hydroxynorketamine [(2R, 6R)-HNK] is a rapid-acting antidepressant drug candidate with limited dissociation properties and abuse potential. We assessed the role of group II metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes 2 (mGlu(2)) and 3 (mGlu3) in the antidepressant-relevant actions of (2R, 6R)-HNK using behavioral, genetic, and pharmacological approaches as well as cortical quantitative EEG (qEEG) measurements in mice. Both ketamine and (2R, 6R)-HNK prevented mGlu(2/3) receptor agonist (LY379268)-induced body temperature increases in mice lacking the Grm3, but not Grm2, gene. This action was not replicated by NMDA receptor antagonists or a chemical variant of ketamine that limits metabolism to (2R, 6R)-HNK. The antidepressant-relevant behavioral effects and 30-to 80-Hz qEEG oscillation (gamma-range) increases resultant from (2R, 6R)-HNK administration were prevented by pretreatment with an mmGlu(2/3) receptor agonist and absent in mice lacking the Grm2, but not Grm3(-/-), gene. Combined subeffective doses of the mGlu(2/3) dreceptor antagonist LY341495 and (2R, 6R)HNK exerted synergistic increases on gamma oscillations and antidepressant-relevant behavioral actions. These findings highlight that (2R, 6R)-HNK exerts antidepressant-relevant actions via a mechanism converging with mmGlu(2) receptor signaling and suggest enhanced cortical gamma oscillations as a marker of target engagement relevant to antidepressant efficacy. Moreover, these results support the use of (2R, 6R)-HNK and inhibitors of mmGlu(2) receptor function in clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression either alone or in combination.

In adults, gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated agents disrupt integration of information from local to the whole-brain scale. Beginning around 3 to 4 months postnatal age, gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated anesthetics such as sevoflurane generate alpha-electroencephalography oscillations. In previous studies of sevoflurane-anesthetized infants 0 to 3.9 months of age, alpha-oscillations were absent, and power spectra did not distinguish between anesthetized and emergence from anesthesia conditions. Few studies detailing functional connectivity during general anesthesia in infants exist. This study's aim was to identify changes in functional connectivity of the infant brain during anesthesia. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed using multichannel electroencephalograph recordings of 20 infants aged 0 to 3.9 months old who underwent sevoflurane anesthesia for elective surgery. Whole-brain functional connectivity was evaluated during maintenance of a surgical state of anesthesia and during emergence from anesthesia. Functional connectivity was represented as networks, and network efficiency indices (including complexity and modularity) were computed at the sensor and source levels. Results: Sevoflurane decreased functional connectivity at the delta-frequency (1 to 4 Hz) in infants 0 to 3.9 months old when comparing anesthesia with emergence. At the sensor level, complexity decreased during anesthesia, showing less whole-brain integration with prominent alterations in the connectivity of frontal and parietal sensors (median difference, 0.0293; 95% CI, -0.0016 to 0.0397). At the source level, similar results were observed (median difference, 0.0201; 95% CI, -0.0025 to 0.0482) with prominent alterations in the connectivity between default-mode and frontoparietal regions. Anesthesia resulted in fragmented modules as modularity increased at the sensor (median difference, 0.0562; 95% CI, 0.0048 to 0.1298) and source (median difference, 0.0548; 95% CI, -0.0040 to 0.1074) levels. Conclusions: Sevoflurane is associated with decreased capacity for efficient information transfer in the infant brain. Such findings strengthen the hypothesis that conscious processing relies on an efficient system of integrated information transfer across the whole brain.

The present study utilized cortical EEG and brain microdialysis in rats to compare the effects of MDPV (0.25, 1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) with the hallucinogenic drugs MK-801 (0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and ketamine (5, 15 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.). Results revealed that MDPV similar to MK-801 and ketamine caused a dose-dependent increase in the cortical EEG synchronization. In addition, all three drugs produced an increase in DA efflux in the prefrontal cortex (FCx). However, there existed difference between the three drugs. In contrast to MDPV, MK-801 and ketamine had only moderate or little effects on DA efflux in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Except for ketamine, the effects of MDPV and MK-801 on EEG synchronization were blocked by the D-1 receptor antagonist SCH23990 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and D-2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (100 mg/kg, i.p.). SCH23990 or sulpiride had no effect on ketamine-induced increases in EEG synchronization. In summary, the present comparative studies suggest that DA in the FCx, but unlikely the NAcc, exerts a critical role in increasing EEG synchronization associated with the excited delirium syndrome. Neural circuits consisting of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons responsible for the hallucinogenic effect are discussed in the context of hyperdopamine and dysconnection theories for hallucinatory behaviors.

Neurofeedback Training of Gamma Oscillations in Monkey Primary Visual Cortex	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cognition; neurofeedback; nonhuman primates; oscillations; visual cortex	ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; VOLUNTARY CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; HIGH-FREQUENCY; BAND ACTIVITY; AREAS V1	In humans, neurofeedback (NFB) training has been used extensively and successfully to manipulate brain activity. Feedback signals were derived from EEG, fMRI, MEG, and intracranial recordings and modifications were obtained of the BOLD signal, of the power of oscillatory activity in distinct frequency bands and of single unit activity. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether neuronal activity could also be controlled by NFB in early sensory cortices whose activity is thought to be influenced mainly by sensory input rather than volitional control. We trained 2 macaque monkeys to enhance narrow band gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex by providing them with an acoustic signal that reflected the power of gamma oscillations in a preselected band and rewarding increases of the feedback signal. Oscillations were assessed from local field potentials recorded with chronically implanted microelectrodes. Both monkeys succeeded to raise gamma activity in the absence of visual stimulation in the selected frequency band and at the site from which the NFB signal was derived. This suggests that top-down signals are not confined to just modulate stimulus induced responses but can actually drive or facilitate the gamma generating microcircuits even in a primary sensory area.

A fast and general method to empirically estimate the complexity of brain responses to transcranial and intracranial stimulations	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Single pulse electrical stimulation; EEG; Intracranial; Brain complexity; Consciousness	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; INTEGRATED INFORMATION; CONSCIOUSNESS; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; STEREOELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; NETWORKS; PROPOFOL	Background: The Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) was recently introduced to assess the capacity of thalamocortical circuits to engage in complex patterns of causal interactions. While showing high accuracy in detecting consciousness in brain-injured patients, PCI depends on elaborate experimental setups and offline processing, and has restricted applicability to other types of brain signals beyond transcranial magnetic stimulation and high-density EEG (TMS/hd-EEG) recordings. Objective: We aim to address these limitations by introducing PCIST, a fast method for estimating perturbational complexity of any given brain response signal. Methods: PCIST is based on dimensionality reduction and state transitions (ST) quantification of evoked potentials. The index was validated on a large dataset of TMS/hd-EEG recordings obtained from 108 healthy subjects and 108 brain-injured patients, and tested on sparse intracranial recordings (SEEG) of 9 patients undergoing intracranial single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) during wakefulness and sleep. Results: When calculated on TMS/hd-EEG potentials, PCIST performed with the same accuracy as the original PCI, while improving on the previous method by being computed in less than a second and requiring a simpler set-up. In SPES/SEEG signals, the index was able to quantify a systematic reduction of intracranial complexity during sleep, confirming the occurrence of state-dependent changes in the effective connectivity of thalamocortical circuits, as originally assessed through TMS/hd-EEG. Conclusions: PCIST represents a fundamental advancement towards the implementation of a reliable and fast clinical tool for the bedside assessment of consciousness as well as a general measure to explore the neuronal mechanisms of loss/recovery of brain complexity across scales and models.

J	Yavuz, E; Eyupoglu, C				Yavuz, Erdem; Eyupoglu, Can			A cepstrum analysis-based classification method for hand movement surface EMG signals	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Surface electromyogram; Cepstrum analysis; Cepstral coefficients; Prosthetic hand; Radial basis function; Generalized regression neural network	FILTER-BANK; EEG; RECOGNITION; FREQUENCY; POSTURE; TIME	It is of great importance to effectively process and interpret surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals to actuate a robotic and prosthetic exoskeleton hand needed by hand amputees. In this paper, we have proposed a cepstrum analysis-based method for classification of basic hand movement sEMG signals. Cepstral analysis technique primarily used for analyzing acoustic and seismological signals is effectively exploited to extract features of time-domain sEMG signals by computing mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The extracted feature vector consisting of MFCCs is then forwarded to feed a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) so as to classify basic hand movements. The proposed method has been tested on sEMG for Basic Hand movements Data Set and achieved an average accuracy rate of 99.34% for the five individual subjects and an overall mean accuracy rate of 99.23% for the collective (mixed) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses most of the previous studies in point of classification accuracy. Discrimination ability of the cepstral features exploited in this study is quantified using Kruskal-Wallis statistical test. Evidenced by the experimental results, this study explores and establishes applicability and efficacy of cepstrum-based features in classifying sEMG signals of hand movements. Owing to the non-iterative training nature of the artificial neural network type adopted in the study, the proposed method does not demand much time to build up the model in the training phase.

J	Cao, LY; Handel, B				Cao, Liyu; Haendel, Barbara			Walking enhances peripheral visual processing in humans	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							CENTER-SURROUND INTERACTIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PERCEIVED CONTRAST; LOCOMOTION; EEG; SUPPRESSION; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; MOTION; STATE	Cognitive processes are almost exclusively investigated under highly controlled settings during which voluntary body movements are suppressed. However, recent animal work suggests differences in sensory processing between movement states by showing drastically changed neural responses in early visual areas between locomotion and stillness. Does locomotion also modulate visual cortical activity in humans, and what are the perceptual consequences? Our study shows that walking increased the contrast-dependent influence of peripheral visual input on central visual input. This increase is prevalent in stimulus-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) responses (steady-state visual evoked potential [SSVEP]) alongside perceptual performance. Ongoing alpha oscillations (approximately 10 Hz) further positively correlated with the walking-induced changes of SSVEP amplitude, indicating the involvement of an altered inhibitory process during walking. The results predicted that walking leads to an increased processing of peripheral visual input. A second study indeed showed an increased contrast sensitivity for peripheral compared to central stimuli when subjects were walking. Our work shows complementary neurophysiological and behavioural evidence corroborating animal findings that walking leads to a change in early visual neuronal activity in humans. That neuronal modulation due to walking is indeed linked to specific perceptual changes extends the existing animal work.

J	Herbst, SK; Obleser, J				Herbst, Sophie K.; Obleser, Jonas			Implicit temporal predictability enhances pitch discrimination sensitivity and biases the phase of delta oscillations in auditory cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TIME; EXPECTATION; PREDICTION; ENTRAINMENT; MODULATION	Can human listeners use implicit temporal contingencies in auditory input to form temporal predictions, and if so, how are these predictions represented endogenously? To assess this question, we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability in an auditory pitch discrimination task: unbeknownst to participants, the pitch of the standard tone could either be deterministically predictive of the temporal onset of the target tone, or convey no predictive information. Predictive and non-predictive conditions were presented interleaved in one stream, and separated by variable inter-stimulus intervals such that there was no dominant stimulus rhythm throughout. Even though participants were unaware of the implicit temporal contingencies, pitch discrimination sensitivity (the slope of the psychometric function) increased when the onset of the target tone was predictable in time (N = 49, 28 female, 21 male). Concurrently recorded EEG data (N = 24) revealed that standard tones that conveyed temporal predictions evoked a more negative N1 component than non-predictive standards. We observed no significant differences in oscillatory power or phase coherence between conditions during the foreperiod. Importantly, the phase angle of delta oscillations (1-3 Hz) in auditory areas in the post-standard and pre-target time windows predicted behavioral pitch discrimination sensitivity. This suggests that temporal predictions are encoded in delta oscillatory phase during the foreperiod interval. In sum, we show that auditory perception benefits from implicit temporal contingencies, and provide evidence for a role of slow neural oscillations in the endogenous representation of temporal predictions, in absence of exogenously driven entrainment to rhythmic input.

Since the boundaries between these units are not always indicated by acoustic cues, they must often be computed internally. Signatures of this internal computation were reported by Ding et al. (2016), who presented isochronous sequences of mono-syllabic words that combined to form phrases that combined to form sentences, and showed that cortical responses simultaneously encode boundaries at multiple levels of the linguistic hierarchy. In the present study, we designed melodic sequences that were hierarchically organized according to Western music conventions. Specifically, isochronous sequences of "sung" nonsense syllables were constructed such that syllables combined to form triads outlining individual chords, which combined to form harmonic progressions. EEG recordings were made while participants listened to these sequences with the instruction to detect when violations in the sequence structure occurred. We show that cortical responses simultaneously encode boundaries at multiple levels of a melodic hierarchy, suggesting that the encoding of hierarchical structure is not unique to speech. No effect of musical training on cortical encoding was observed.

However, the nature of that role is unclear. In the present study, we examined event-related desynchronization of alpha and beta (alpha/beta-ERD) elicited by visual tasks with and without a memory component to measure the impact of a WM demand on this electrophysiological marker. We recorded EEG from 60 healthy participants while they completed three variants on a typical change detection task: one in which participants passively viewed the sample array, passive (WM-); one in which participants viewed and attended the sample array in search of a target color but did not memorize the colors, active (WM-); and one in which participants encoded, attended to, and memorized the sample array, active (WM+). Replicating previous findings, we found that active (WM+) elicited robust alpha/beta-ERD in frontal and posterior electrode clusters and that alpha-ERD was significantly associated with WM capacity. By contrast, alpha/beta-ERD was significantly smaller in the passive (WM-) and active (WM-) tasks, which did not consistently differ from one another. Furthermore, no such relationship was observed between WM capacity and desynchronization in the passive (WM-) or active (WM-) tasks. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha-ERD during memory formation reflects a memory-specific process such as consolidation or maintenance, rather than serving a generalized role in perceptual gating or engagement of attention.

Atypical SWDs however were reported in studies in which the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor AY-9944 was administered to neonatal Wistar rats, causing absence-like seizures later in life. Atypical SWDs seemed to differ from typical SWDs in 3 aspects: lower peak frequency, longer duration, and involvement of the hippocampus. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of AY-9944 on typical SWDs. Male Wistar and WAG/Rij rats were injected with 7.5 mg/kg AY-9944 or saline postnatally. After 6 months, EEGs were recorded from the cortex and the hippocampus. Incidence, duration and peak frequency of the SWDs were determined. The SWD stopping probability was estimated by hazard rate analysis. Hippocampal involve. ment was assessed by cross correlation analysis of the hippocampus and cortex channels. The Wistar rats unexpectedly showed a high incidence of spontaneous SWDs. The AY-treatment increased the total SWD duration in both Wistar and WAG/Rij rats: the incidence was 1.6 times higher and the mean SWD duration was 1.4 times longer than in the saline-treated rats. The peak frequency of the SWDs did not change. The hazard rates were lower in the AY-treated rats, so some very long SWDs were observed. Cross correlations of spiky activity in the hippocampus pointed to volume conduction rather than to genuine SWD activity in this area. In summary, we found no indication that SWDs in AY-treated animals differ from typical SWDs. However, since saline-treated rats had many spontaneous SWDs, other rat strains might respond differently. With respect to the mechanism, the appearance of long SWDs suggests that the SWD stopping mechanism is affected by the treatment. We speculate that this effect is due to changes in the distribution of GABA-ergic and glutamatergic receptors in lipid rafts.	[Perescis, Martin F.

In this study, we show that the human insula exhibits activity preferential for sustained thermonociception. Using intracerebral EEG recorded from the insula of 8 patients (2 females) undergoing a presurgical evaluation of focal epilepsy (53 contacts: 27 anterior, 26 posterior), we "frequency-tagged" the insular activity elicited by sustained thermonociceptive and vibrotactile stimuli, by periodically modulating stimulation intensity at a fixed frequency of 0.2 Hz during 75 s. Both types of stimuli elicited an insular response at the frequency of stimulation (0.2 Hz) and its harmonics, whose magnitude was significantly greater in the posterior insula compared to the anterior insula. Compared to vibrotactile stimulation, thermonociceptive stimulation exerted a markedly greater 0.2 Hz modulation of ongoing theta-band (4-8 Hz) and alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations. These modulations were also more prominent in the posterior insula compared to the anterior insula. The identification of oscillatory activities preferential for thermonociception could lead to new insights into the physiological mechanisms of nociception and pain perception in humans.

However, reliable, easily acquirable and interpretable neurophysiological markers of the presence of consciousness in unresponsive states are still missing. A promising marker is based on the decay-rate of the power spectral density (PSD) of the resting EEG. We acquired resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in three groups of healthy participants (n = 5 each), before and during anesthesia induced by either xenon, propofol or ketamine. Dosage of each anesthetic agent was tailored to yield unresponsiveness (Ramsay score = 6). Delayed subjective reports assessed whether conscious experience was present ('Conscious report') or absent/inaccessible to recall ('No Report'). We estimated the decay of the PSD of the resting EEG-after removing oscillatory peaks-via the spectral exponent beta, for a broad band (1-40 Hz) and narrower sub-bands (1-20 Hz, 20-40 Hz). Within-subject anesthetic changes in beta were assessed. Furthermore, based on beta, 'Conscious report' states were discriminated against 'no report' states. Finally, we evaluated the correlation of the resting spectral exponent with a recently proposed index of consciousness, the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI), derived from a previous TMS-EEG study. The spectral exponent of the resting EEG discriminated states in which consciousness was present (wakefulness, ketamine) from states where consciousness was reduced or abolished (xenon, propofol). Loss of consciousness substantially decreased the (negative) broad-band spectral exponent in each subject undergoing xenon or propofol anesthesia-indexing an overall steeper PSD decay. Conversely, ketamine displayed an overall PSD decay similar to that of wakefulness-consistent with the preservation of consciousness-yet it showed a flattening of the decay in the high-frequencies (20-40 Hz)-consistent with its specific mechanism of action. The spectral exponent was highly correlated to PCI, corroborating its interpretation as a marker of the presence of consciousness. A steeper PSD of the resting EEG reliably indexed unconsciousness in anesthesia, beyond sheer unresponsiveness.

An experimental process was set in 8 sec as followings; fixation image display (1 sec), drink image display (2.5 sec), intention check (1.5 sec), fixation image display (1 sec), and speech imagery period (2 sec). It was repeated 100 times. EEC was measured with 10-20 system in a magnetically-shielded room with BPF (0.08-100Hz) and notch-filter (50Hz) for 10 participants. In the analysis, it was averaged with 35 trials dividing between "with/without speech imagery" in an epoch (fixation image display and speech-imagery) of 2.9 sec. Event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) were examined with event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and t-test. ERS were observed in a band on the left-hemisphere in case of "with speech imagery" for latency of 500-1500 ms and the significant differences (p<0.05) were shown in the left-hemisphere and occipital-region. It is suggested the useful information of selecting electrode positions to detect EEC frequency components for judgment of "with/without speech imagery" in the intention. From these results, we examined the electrodes localization in the with/without speech imagery identification.

DFA is mainly introduced to solve the problem that VMD requires the number of modes to be predefined. The scaling exponent obtained by DFA is a robust metric to measure the long-range correlations and can be used to adjust the number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) automatically. To reconstruct the denoised signal, a scaling exponent is also used as a threshold to identify and remove the noisy modes. We define a novel robust threshold of random noise in seismic data, because the predefined noise boundaries for other time series cannot perform perfectly when dealing with seismic data. The proposed robust DFA-VMD is an almost parameters-free denoising approach and we apply it in the (f-x) domain for seismic denoising. We have verified its performance by comparing it with the results from several other methods including (f-x) deconvolution and the conventional DFA-VMD. Two synthetic examples and three field-data examples revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in applications to random and coherent noise attenuation.

Distributed slow-wave dynamics during sleep predict memory consolidation and its impairment in schizophrenia	NPJ SCHIZOPHRENIA			English	Article							LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; K-COMPLEX; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL RIPPLES; LOCAL SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL; SPINDLES; COHERENCE; DEFICITS; COMMUNICATION	The slow waves (SW) of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep reflect neocortical components of network activity during sleep-dependent information processing; their disruption may therefore impair memory consolidation. Here, we quantify sleep-dependent consolidation of motor sequence memory, alongside sleep EEG-derived SW properties and synchronisation, and SW-spindle coupling in 21 patients suffering from schizophrenia and 19 healthy volunteers. Impaired memory consolidation in patients culminated in an overnight improvement in motor sequence task performance of only 1.6%, compared with 15% in controls. During sleep after learning, SW amplitudes and densities were comparable in healthy controls and patients. However, healthy controls showed a significant 45% increase in frontal-to-occipital SW coherence during sleep after motor learning in comparison with a baseline night (baseline: 0.22 +/- 0.05, learning: 0.32 +/- 0.05); patient EEG failed to show this increase (baseline: 0.22 +/- 0.04, learning: 0.19 +/- 0.04). The experience-dependent nesting of spindles in SW was similarly disrupted in patients: frontal-to-occipital SW-spindle phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) significantly increased after learning in healthy controls (modulation index baseline: 0.17 +/- 0.02, learning: 0.22 +/- 0.02) but not in patients (baseline: 0.13 +/- 0.02, learning: 0.14 +/- 0.02). Partial least-squares regression modelling of coherence and PAC data from all electrode pairs confirmed distributed SW coherence and SW-spindle coordination as superior predictors of overnight memory consolidation in healthy controls but not in patients. Quantifying the full repertoire of NREM EEG oscillations and their long-range covariance therefore presents learning-dependent changes in distributed SW and spindle coordination as fingerprints of impaired cognition in schizophrenia.

In humans, HC-SWR have only been recorded with electrodes implanted to localize epileptogenicity. Here, we characterize human HC-SWR with rigorous rejection of epileptiform activity, requiring multiple oscillations and coordinated sharp waves. We demonstrated typical SWR in those rare HC recordings which lack interictal epileptiform spikes (IIS) and with no or minimal seizure involvement. These HC-SWR have a similar rate (12 min(-1) on average, variable across NREM stages and anterior/posterior HC) and apparent intra-HC topography (ripple maximum in putative stratum pyramidale, slow wave in radiatum) as rodents, though with lower frequency (85 Hz compared to 140 Hz in rodents). Similar SWR are found in HC with IIS, but no significant seizure involvement. These SWR were modulated by behavior, being largely absent (<2 min(-1)) except during NREM sleep in both Stage 2 (9 min(-1)) and Stage 3 (15 min(-1)), distinguishing them from IIS. This study quantifies the basic characteristics of a strictly selected sample of SWR recorded in relatively healthy human hippocampi.

J	Pscherer, C; Muckschel, M; Summerer, L; Bluschke, A; Beste, C				Pscherer, Charlotte; Mueckschel, Moritz; Summerer, Lena; Bluschke, Annet; Beste, Christian			On the relevance of EEG resting theta activity for the neurophysiological dynamics underlying motor inhibitory control	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						beamforming; EEG; response inhibition; resting state; theta oscillations	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FREQUENCY BAND; BRAIN ACTIVITY; CONFLICT	The modulation of theta frequency activity plays a major role in inhibitory control processes. However, the relevance of resting theta band activity and of the ability to spontaneously modulate this resting theta activity for neural mechanisms underlying inhibitory control is elusive. Various theoretical conceptions suggest to take these aspects into consideration. In the current study, we examine whether the strength of resting theta band activity or the ability to modulate the resting state theta activity affects response inhibition. We combined EEG-time frequency decomposition and beamforming in a conflict-modulated Go/Nogo task. A sample of N = 66 healthy subjects was investigated. We show that the strength of resting state theta activity modulates the effects of conflicts during motor inhibitory control. Especially when resting theta activity was low, conflicts strongly affected response inhibition performance and total theta band activity during Nogo trials. These effects were associated with theta-related activity differences in the superior (BA7) and inferior parietal cortex (BA40). The results were very specific for total theta band activity since evoked theta activity and measures of intertrial phase coherency (phase-locking factor) were not affected. The data suggest that the strength of resting state theta activity modulates processing of a theta-related alarm or surprise signal during inhibitory control. The ability to voluntarily modulate theta band activity did not affect conflict-modulated inhibitory control. These findings have important implications for approaches aiming to optimize human cognitive control.

Auditory steady-state EEG response across the schizo-bipolar spectrum	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory steady-state response; EEG biomarkers; Psychosis; Bipolar disorder; Schizophrenia; Gamma oscillations	PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; GAMMA RHYTHMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYNCHRONIZATION; PSYCHOSIS; DISORDER; IDENTIFICATION; ABNORMALITIES; OSCILLATIONS	Deviant auditory steady-state responses (aSSRs) in the gamma range (30-90 Hz) may be translational biomarkers for schizophrenia (SZ). This study tests whether aSSR deviations are (i) specific to SZ across the psychosis dimension, (ii) specific to particular frequency bands, and ( iii) present in bipolar I disorder without psychosis (BDNP). Methods: Beta (20-), low- (40-), and high-gamma (80-Hz) aSSRs were measured with EEG and compared across 113 SZ, 105 schizoaffective disorder (SAD), 99 bipolar disorder with psychosis (BDP), 68 BDNP, and 137 healthy comparison subjects (HC). Standard aSSR measures (single-trial power ISTP] and inter-trial phase coherence [ITC]), as well as evoked responses to stimulus onsets/offsets and pre-stimulus power, were quantified. Multivariate canonical discriminant analysis was used to summarize variables that efficiently and maximally differentiated groups. Results: (i) Psychosis groups showed reduced responses on ITC 20 Hz. STP/ITC 40 Hz, STP/ITC 80 Hz, indicating dimensional reductions in aSSR across the psychosis spectrum not specific to aSSR frequency. For the 40- and 80-Hz ITCs there was greater reduction in SZ compared to SAD, possibly indexing cortical disruptions linked to psychosis without mood symptoms. (ii) All probands had elevated pre-stimulus power, possibly compromising neural entrainment to the steady-state stimuli. (iii) Onset/Offset and 80 Hz ITC responses were most important for group discrimination and showed dimensional reduction across the schizo-bipolar spectrum. Conclusions: Deviant aSSRs were found across the schizo-bipolar spectrum at multiple frequencies with psychosis status and severity linked to greatest reductions at low and high gamma.

Pre-stimulus brain state predicts auditory pattern identification accuracy	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Oscillation; Inter-trial phase consistency; Attention; Alpha; Time-frequency	PHASE ENTRAINMENT; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; ENHANCEMENTS; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; DECISION	Recent studies show that pre-stimulus band-specific power and phase in the electroencephalogram (EEG) can predict accuracy on tasks involving the detection of near-threshold stimuli. However, results in the auditory modality have been mixed, and few works have examined pre-stimulus features when more complex decisions are made (e.g. identifying supra-threshold sounds). Further, most auditory studies have used background sounds known to induce oscillatory EEG states, leaving it unclear whether phase predicts accuracy without such background sounds. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study examined pre-stimulus EEG as it relates to accuracy in a tone pattern identification task. On each trial, participants heard a triad of 40-ms sinusoidal tones (separated by 40-ms intervals), one of which was at a different frequency than the other two. Participants' task was to indicate the tone pattern (low-low-high, low-high-low, etc.). No background sounds were employed. Using a phase opposition measure based on inter-trial phase consistencies, pre-stimulus 7-10 Hz phase was found to differ between correct and incorrect trials similar to 200 to 100 ms prior to tone-pattern onset. After sorting trials into bins based on phase, accuracy was found to be lowest at around (+)(-)pi relative to individuals' most accurate phase bin. No significant effects were found for pre-stimulus power. In the context of the literature, findings suggest an important relationship between the complexity of task demands and pre-stimulus activity within the auditory domain. Results also raise interesting questions about the role of induced oscillatory states or rhythmic processing modes in obtaining pre-stimulus effects of phase in auditory tasks.

Transcranial Recording of Electrophysiological Neural Activity in the Rodent Brain in vivo Using Functional Photoacoustic Imaging of Near-Infrared Voltage-Sensitive Dye	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						photoacoustic; neuroimaging; near-infrared; voltage-sensitive dye; transcranial; seizure	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SEIZURES; NEUROMODULATION; MODELS; TIME; TOMOGRAPHY; ANESTHESIA; RESPONSES; DOPAMINE; RATS	Minimally-invasive monitoring of electrophysiological neural activities in real-time-that enables quantification of neural functions without a need for invasive craniotomy and the longer time constants of fMRI and PET-presents a very challenging yet significant task for neuroimaging. In this paper, we present in vivo functional PA (fPA) imaging of chemoconvulsant rat seizure model with intact scalp using a fluorescence quenching-based cyanine voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) characterized by a lipid vesicle model mimicking different levels of membrane potential variation. The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Our normalized time-frequency analysis presented in vivo VSD response in the seizure group significantly distinguishable from those of the control groups at sub-mm spatial resolution. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that the near-infrared fPA VSD imaging is a promising tool for in vivo recording of brain activities through intact scalp, which would pave a way to its future translation in real time human brain imaging.

Parafoveal Previews and Lexical Frequency in Natural Reading: Evidence From Eye Movements and Fixation-Related Potentials	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL			English	Article						eye movements; fixation-related potentials; parafoveal-on-foveal effects; preview effects; lexical frequency	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INTEGRATING INFORMATION; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; TIME-COURSE; FOVEAL; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	Participants' eye movements and electroencephalogram (EEG) signal were recorded as they read sentences displayed according to the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm. Two target words in each sentence were manipulated for lexical frequency (high vs. low frequency) and parafoveal preview of each target word (identical vs. string of random letters vs. string of Xs). Eye movement data revealed visual parafoveal-on-foveal (PoF) effects, as well as foveal visual and orthographic preview effects and word frequency effects. Fixation-related potentials (FRPs) showed visual and orthographic PoF effects as well as foveal visual and orthographic preview effects. Our results replicated the early preview positivity effect (Dimigen, Kliegl, & Sommer, 2012) in the X-string preview condition, and revealed different neural correlates associated with a preview comprised of a string of random letters relative to a string of Xs. The former effects seem likely to reflect difficulty associated with the integration of parafoveal and foveal information, as well as feature overlap, while the latter reflect inhibition, and potentially disruption, to processing underlying reading. Interestingly, and consistent with Kretzschmar, Schlesewsky, and Staub (2015), no frequency effect was reflected in the FRP measures. The findings provide insight into the neural correlates of parafoveal processing and written word recognition in reading and demonstrate the value of utilizing ecologically valid paradigms to study well established phenomena that occur as text is read naturally.

Latent Phase Detection of Hypoxic-Ischemic Spike Transients in the EEG of Preterm Fetal Sheep Using Reverse Biorthogonal Wavelets & Fuzzy Classifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); automatic detection and quantification; high frequency micro-scale gamma spikes; wavelet transform; fuzzy; EEG; ECoG; high frequency oscillations (HFO)	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; WHITE-MATTER INJURY; CEREBRAL HYPOTHERMIA; NEONATAL SEIZURES; METHODOLOGY; ASPHYXIA; MODELS; DIAGNOSIS; ONTOGENY; SYSTEM	Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) studies in preterms lack reliable prognostic biomarkers for diagnostic tests of HI encephalopathy (HIE). Our group's observations from in utero fetal sheep models suggest that potential biomarkers of HIE in the form of developing HI micro-scale epileptiform transients emerge along suppressed EEG/ECoG background during a latent phase of 6-7 h post-insult. However, having to observe for the whole of the latent phase disqualifies any chance of clinical intervention. A precise automatic identification of these transients can help for a well-timed diagnosis of the HIE and to stop the spread of the injury before it becomes irreversible. This paper reports fusion of Reverse-Biorthogonal Wavelets with Type-1 Fuzzy classifiers, for the accurate real-time automatic identification and quantification of high-frequency HI spike transients in the latent phase, tested over seven in utero preterm sheep. Considerable high performance of 99.78 +/- 0.10% was obtained from the Rbio-Wavelet Type-1 Fuzzy classifier for automatic identification of HI spikes tested over 42 h of high-resolution recordings (sampling-freq:1024 Hz). Data from post-insult automatic time-localization of high-frequency HI spikes reveals a promising trend in the average rate of the HI spikes, even in the animals with shorter occlusion periods, which highlights considerable higher number of transients within the first 2 h post-insult.

Altered neural oscillations within and between sensorimotor cortex and parietal cortex in chronic jaw pain	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL BRAIN ACTIVITY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; BACK-PAIN; MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; MOTOR VARIABILITY; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; STATE; ATTENTION	Pain perception is associated with priming of the motor system and the orienting of attention in healthy adults. These processes correspond with decreases in alpha and beta power in the sensorimotor and parietal cortices. The goal of the present study was to determine whether these findings extend to individuals with chronic pain. Individuals with chronic jaw pain and pain-free controls anticipated and experienced a low pain or a moderate pain-eliciting heat stimulus. Although stimuli were calibrated for each subject, stimulus temperature was not different between groups. High-density EEG data were collected during the anticipation and heat stimulation periods and were analyzed using independent component analyses, EEG source localization, and measure projection analyses. Direct directed transfer function was also estimated to identify frequency specific effective connectivity between regions. Between group differences were most evident during the heat stimulation period. We report three novel findings. First, the chronic jaw pain group had a relative increase in alpha and beta power and a relative decrease in theta and gamma power in sensorimotor cortex. Second, the chronic jaw pain group had a relative increase in power in the alpha and beta bands in parietal cortex. Third, the chronic jaw pain group had less connectivity strength in the beta and gamma bands between sensorimotor cortex and parietal cortex. Our findings show that the effect of chronic pain attenuates rather than magnifies neural responses to heat stimuli. We interpret these findings in the context of system-level changes in intrinsic sensorimotor and attentional circuits in chronic pain.	[Wang, Wei-en; Roy, Arnab; Ho, Rachel L.

In this work, a method based on sparse kernel machines is proposed for the discrimination of Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials responses. More specifically, a new kernel based on Partial Least Squares is introduced to describe the similarities between EEG trials, while the estimation of regression weights is performed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning framework. The experimental results obtained on two benchmarking datasets, have shown that the proposed method provides significantly better performance compared to state of the art approaches of the related literature.

Dynamics of movement-related cortical potentials and sensorimotor oscillations during palmar grasp movements	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; ERD; grasp; MRCP	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION; POWER	Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) and sensorimotor oscillatory electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (event-related desynchronization/synchronization-ERD/ERS) provide complementary information of the associated motor activity. The aim of this study was to provide comparative spatio-temporal analysis of both EEG phenomena associated with palmar grasping motions including hand opening and closing phases. Nine healthy participants were instructed to perform self-paced, right hand grasping movements. EEG was recorded from 28 sites synchronous with electromyography (EMG) of wrist/fingers extensors and flexors. Statistical analysis of the EEG data revealed significant differences (p < .05) between the idle state (baseline) and motor preparation/execution periods in majority of recorded channels. The earliest statistical significance in MRCPs was observed for channel FC3 at -460.9 ms, while the earliest significant ERD was observed at 164.1 ms for channel C3. MRCP and ERD/ERS topographies in our study are in line with the results of previous studies comparing MRCP and ERD/ERS spatio-temporal patterns during upper limb movements, however, results of our study show that MRCP significant differences compared to the baseline appear in most channels earlier than ERD (on average 613.6 +/- 191.5 ms earlier). This implies an advantage of MRCP signals for grasping movements' prediction, which is in contrast to previous reports. Moreover, combined spatio-temporal information on MRCP and ERD/ERS presented in this paper may serve for future optimization of grasp movement prediction/detection hybrid algorithms in the context of restorative brain-computer interface technology.

However, the cortical mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. In general, mnemonic processes are thought to rely on changes in oscillatory brain activity across several frequencies as well as their interaction. Lower frequencies, mainly theta-band (3-7 Hz) and alpha-band (8-14 Hz) activity, are attributed to executive control and resource management, respectively; whereas recent studies revealed higher frequencies, e.g. gamma-band (>25 Hz) activity, to reflect the activation of cortical object representations. Furthermore, low-frequency phase to high-frequency amplitude coupling (PAC) was recently found to coordinate the involved mnemonic networks. To further unravel the processes behind memorization of repeatedly presented stimuli, we applied a continuous item recognition task with up to five presentations per item (mean time between repetitions similar to 10 s) while recording high-density EEG. We examined spectral amplitude modulations as well as PAC. We observed theta amplitudes reaching a peak at second presentation, a reduction of alpha suppression after second presentation, decreased response time, as well as reduced theta-gamma PAC (3 to 7 to -30 to 45 Hz) at frontal sites after third presentation. We conclude a shift from an explicit- to an implicit-like mnemonic processing, occurring around third presentation, with theta power to signify encoding of repetition-based episodic information and PAC as a neural correlate of the coordination of local neural networks.

Additionally, the influence of the autonomic nervous system may also be reflected in the electrocardiogram (ECG) trace. In both biosignals (EEG and ECG), differences have been reported between normal epochs, known as interictal periods and the interval preceding seizures, preictal period. However, the existence of a preictal state indicating the transition between epileptic brain states has not yet been clinically defined. In fact, some studies report differences in preictal location and duration among patients and among seizures occurring in the same patient as well. Based on the above, a study was designed in order to investigate the existence of a preictal interval specific for each seizure, using heart rate variability (HRV) features. Time and frequency domain features (linear and non-linear) were extracted from ECG data acquired in 37 drug-resistant epilepsy patients, comprised in EPILEPSIAE database. A total of 209 seizures occurring in the temporal lobe were analysed. The existence of a transition period before the seizure onset was inspected using a linear discriminant analysis classifier. The overall best performance (88.04% +/- 12.30% of accuracy) was obtained by combining RRMean, NN50 and SD2 features when discriminating the 50 min of interictal located farthest from seizure onset from the nearest preictal 50 min.

Methods: Magnetoencephalography data were recorded in 35 participants with combat exposure and various degrees of PTSD symptom severity while they performed a modified Sternberg working memory task: briefly presented sets of two or six letters had to be held in memory and participants indicated whether subsequent probe letters were present or absent from these sets. Results: PTSD scores were positively correlated with the false positive rate in the high memory load condition. Higher rates of false recognition were associated with negative probes that were seen in recent previous trials (negative probe recency effect) or were physically similar with the list letters. The relative alpha band power in the left middle frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with both PTSD scores and false positive rates. Conclusions: Reduced task specific modulation of alpha band oscillations in left middle frontal cortex may reflect alterations in the functions of pattern separation and suppression of memory traces for irrelevant or no longer relevant information in PTSD. Significance: The lower amplitude of prefrontal alpha band oscillations may represent an important physiological basis for core PTSD symptoms and can provide a target for interventions to augment response to treatment.

The capacity to understand and mirror others' feelings could result in a mutual adaptation that generates interpersonal tuning (IT). In the present study, we measured IT by applying a hyperscanning approach with simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from two participants interacting together. Eleven leaders and 11 employees were recruited and asked to role-play an employee performance review with a rating (R) or no rating (NR) condition. In the NR condition leaders describe by words the employee's proficiency, while in R they provided a quantitative rating. The NR condition emerged as a more engaging situation in terms of empathic responses and mirroring. This difference was detectable from the localization of neurophysiological effects over the frontopolar and frontal brain areas, and the higher synchronization of EEG delta frequency coherence. Behavioral results also revealed an increase of self-perceived emotional tuning, agreement on content, and interpersonal cooperation in the NR condition compared to R condition. These effects were present in both leaders and employees and have several implications for social and company well-being.

In fact, in the 1971 seminal paper by Tassinari's group and in the following studies on this syndrome, the amount of epileptiform discharges (EDs) was calculated as the percentage of slow sleep occupied by spike-and-waves and referred to as "spike and wave index" (SWI). However, nowadays it is becoming increasingly clear that the SWI alone does not explain the whole clinical course of patients affected by ESES. In this paper, we aim to provide a state-of-the-art summary of the quantitative EEG methods currently used in the ESES/CSWS literature, highlighting the possible pitfalls and discrepancies explaining the unsatisfactory correlation between SWI and clinical course. Furthermore; we illustrate a number of methodological refinements -taking into account inter-individual, intra-individual, and temporal variability of EDs - alongside "new" quantitative variables -including ED-related and sleep-related features - potentially useful to reach a reliable electro-clinical correlation in patients with ESES.

Increased mirror overflow movements in ADHD are associated with altered EEG alpha/beta band desynchronization	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; moderation analysis; motor control; sensory-motor rhythm	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SUBTLE SIGNS; MOTOR; CHILDREN; ACTIVATION; AGE; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; MODULATION	Children with ADHD show developmentally abnormal levels of mirror overflow-unintentional movements occurring symmetrically opposite of intentional movements. Because mirror overflow correlates with ADHD behavioral symptoms, the study of disinhibition in motor control may shed light on physiologic mechanisms underlying impaired behavioral/cognitive control. This is a case-controlled study of EEG recording from 25 children with ADHD and 25 typically developing (TD) controls performing unilateral sequential finger tapping, with overflow movements measured using electronic goniometers. Consistent with previously published findings, children with ADHD showed increased mirror overflow as compared with TD peers. EEG findings revealed less lateralized alpha modulation (event-related desynchronization; ERD) and decreased magnitude of beta ERD in ADHD; both alpha and beta ERD reflect cortical activation. Moderation analysis revealed a significant association between beta ERD and overflow, independent of diagnosis; and an equivocal (p = .08) effect of diagnosis on the relationship between alpha ERD and overflow, with a significant effect in children with ADHD but not TD children. These results suggest two mechanisms involved with mirror overflow: one reflected in beta ipsilateral to the intentional movement and relevant to both children with ADHD and controls, and the other seemingly more specific to ADHD (alpha, contralateral to movement).

During signal recording, various forms of noises distort data. Physiological signals are highly noise sensitive and to evaluate them powerful filtering approaches must be applied. The aim of this study is to compare modern filtering approaches on scalp signals. Brain activities were generally examined by brain signals like EEG and evoked potentials (EP). In this study, data were recorded from university students whose age between 18 and 25 years with visual and auditory stimuli. Discrete wavelet transforms, singular spectrum analysis, empirical mode decomposition and discrete Fourier transform based filters were used and compared with raw data on classification performance. Higuchi fractal dimension and entropy features were extracted from EEG; P300 features were extracted from EP signals. Classification was applied with support vector machines. All filtered data gave better scores than raw data. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Fourier-based filter yielded lower results than the discrete wavelet-based filter. Singular spectrum analysis gave the best result at 84.32%. The current study suggests that singular spectrum analysis removes noise from sensitive physiological signals, and EMD requires new mode selection procedures before resynthesizing.

Several studies investigated frontal asymmetry in alpha oscillation (FAA) as an early marker for ASD. However, no study has examined the mediational effect of FAA between parental autistic traits and child ASD symptoms in the general population. We carried out a prospective study of 103 typically developing infants and measured FAA as a mediator between both maternal and paternal autistic traits and child ASD traits. We recorded infant baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) at 6 months of age. Child ASD symptoms were measured at age 24 months by the Child Behavior Checklist 11/2-5 Pervasive Developmental Problems Scale, and parental autistic traits were scored by the Autism spectrum Quotient questionnaire. The mediation model showed that paternal vs. maternal autistic traits are associated with greater left FAA which, in turn, is associated with more child ASD traits with a significant indirect effect only in female infants vs. male infants. Our findings show a potential cascade of effects whereby paternal autistic traits drive EEG markers contributing to ASD risk.

Reading Shakespearean tropes in a foreign tongue: Age of L2 acquisition modulates neural responses to functional shifts	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Functional shifts; Second-language processing; Age of acquisition; ERPs; Time frequency	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; THETA-POWER; PROFICIENCY; BILINGUALS; FMRI; EEG; ERP; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION	Functional shifts (FSs) - morphosyntactically marked words evoking coherent but novel meanings are ubiquitous in English and, specially, in Shakespearean literature. While their neural signatures have been explored in native speakers, no study has targeted foreign-language users, let alone comparing early and late bilinguals. Here, we administered a validated FS paradigm to subjects from both populations and evaluated time-frequency modulations evoked by FS and control sentences. Early bilinguals exhibited greater sensitivity towards FSs, indexed by reduced fronto-posterior theta-band oscillations across semantic- and structural-integration windows. Such oscillatory modulations may represent a key marker of age-of-acquisition effects during foreign language wordplay processing.

Human experience in an architectural space is defined as the state of mind that is reflected on our physiological, emotional, and cognitive statuses. Previous studies attempted to explain the relation between architectural design features (e.g., the existence of daylight and connectivity to nature) and human experience. However, the extent of how different design features influence human experience has not been fully quantified yet. This study provides an integrated method that fuses virtual reality and noninvasive body area sensor networks (BSNs) to quantify human experience in architectural spaces. Using a set of biometric sensors, several physiological metrics such as skin conductance, brain activity, and heart rate were captured and examined while subjects were navigating and performing tasks in virtual environments (VEs). The integrated platform has been used to quantify the sense of stress and anxiety through structured user experiments in a visualization laboratory using alternate VEs configured by varying the related set of architectural design features. To generalize the findings of this study, a large pool of participants was invited to the experiments, where statistically significantly different results could be obtained. The analysis of the collected body sensor data showed that the human response changes with architectural design, with more than 40% of the electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations having higher values across all channels on all frequency bands, 141% having an increase in galvanic skin response (GSR) readings, and lower heart rate variability in photoplethysmogram (PPG) in the stress-reducing environment as compared with the stress-inducing environment. The presented approach provides a systematic way for architectural design firms to get user feedback before the design is finalized for achieving the ultimate experience among the proposed design alternatives.

Whether burst-suppression causes POD or merely reflects susceptibility to POD is unclear. We hypothesized decreased intraoperative alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-33 Hz) power prior to the occurrence of burst-suppression in susceptible patients. Methods: We analyzed intraoperative electroencephalogram data of cardiac surgical patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We detected the incidence and duration of CPB burst-suppression with an automated burst-suppression detection algorithm. We analyzed EEG data with multitaper spectral estimation methods. We assessed associations between patient characteristics and burst-suppression using Binomial and Zero-inflated Poisson Regression Models. Results: We found significantly decreased alpha and beta power (7.8-22.95 Hz) in the CPB burst suppression cohort. The odds ratio for the association between point estimates for alpha and beta power (7.8-22.95 Hz) and the incidence of burst-suppression was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79-0.98). The incidence rate ratio for the association between point estimates for power between the alpha and beta range and the duration of burst-suppression was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93). Conclusion: Decreased intra-operative power within the alpha and beta range was associated with susceptibility to burst-suppression during CPB. Significance: This dynamic may be used to develop principled neurophysiological-based approaches to aid the preemptive identification and targeted care of POD vulnerable patients.

In a group of male and female subjects affected by essential tremor and undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery, ventral intermediate nucleus low-frequency oscillations (<30 Hz) entrain the corticomotor high broadband activity (>40 Hz) during rest, relinquishing that role during movement execution. This finding suggests that there is significant cross-rhythm communication between thalamocortical regions, and motor behavior corresponds to changes in thalamocortical phaseamplitude coupling profiles. Herein, we demonstrate that thalamocortical coupling is a crucial mechanism for gating motor behavior.

Inconsistent findings of an augmented Stroop effect limit identification of relevant dysfunctional mechanism(s) in schizophrenia. The present study sought to advance understanding of normal and impaired neural oscillatory dynamics by distinguishing interference detection and response preparation during the Stroop task in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders via analysis of behavioral performance and 4-7 Hz (theta) and 10-30 Hz (alpha/beta) EEG oscillations in 40 patients (SZ) and 27 healthy comparison participants (HC). SZ responded more slowly and showed less dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) theta enhancement during INC trials, less enhancement of dACC-sensorimotor cortex connectivity (theta phase synchrony) during INC trials, more alpha/beta suppression though less enhancement of that suppression during INC trials, and slower post-response alpha/beta rebound than did HC Reaction time distributions showed larger group and Stroop effects during the 25% of trials with the slowest responses. Poorer theta phase coherence in patients indicates impaired communication between regions associated with interference processing (dACC) and response preparation (sensorimotor cortex). Results suggest a failure cascade in which compromised behavioral Stroop effects are driven at least in part by dysfunctional interference processing (less theta power increase) prompting dysfunctional motor response preparation (less alpha/beta power suppression). Inconsistent Stroop effects in past studies of schizophrenia may result from differing task parameters sampling different degrees of Stroop task difficulty. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, posterior brain lesions, which damage the neural circuits of the visual system might induce alterations in the alpha oscillatory activity. To investigate this hypothesis, EEG activity was recorded during eyes-closed resting state in patients with hemianopia with posterior brain lesions, patients without hemianopia with anterior brain lesions and age-matched healthy controls. Patients with posterior lesions revealed a selective slowdown of individual alpha frequency in both the intact and the lesioned hemisphere and a reduction of alpha amplitude in the lesioned hemisphere, resulting in an interhemispheric imbalanced oscillatory alpha activity, while no significant alterations in the alpha range were found in patients with anterior lesions. This suggests a crucial role of posterior cortices in coordinating alpha oscillations in the visual system. Moreover, right posterior lesions had a more severe reduction of individual alpha frequency and altering of the interhemispheric distribution of the alpha amplitude, in line with the notion of the prominence of the right posterior cortices in balancing the interhemispheric functioning. Crucially, the duration of the in individual alpha frequency and the interhemispheric imbalance in alpha amplitude were directly linked to visuospatial performance across all participants and to impaired visual detection abilities in hemianopics, therefore supporting a functional role of alpha oscillations in visual processing and suggesting that activity in this frequency range at rest represents a neurophysiological marker reliably reflecting the integrity and the functionality of the visual system in humans.

To evaluate these hypotheses, a suitable preclinical model of AD is needed. We performed a comprehensive assessment of circadian rhythms and sleep in the APP(swe)/PS1(dE9) (APP/PS1) mouse model using long-term in vivo electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and behavioral assays from 5 to 22 months of age. APP/PS1 mice were crossed with a PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) mouse model to evaluate synchrony among peripheral circadian oscillators. The APP/PS1 mice exhibited a mild but persistent phase delay of nocturnal activity onset in 12:12h light: dark conditions, as well as a shift toward higher frequencies in the EEG power spectra compared to littermate controls. Our results suggest that APP/PS1 mice may not be the optimal preclinical model for studying the specific circadian changes associated with AD but that quantitative EEG may offer a sensitive measure of AD-associated changes in sleep quality that can be modeled in APP/PS1 mice.

Brain metabolism modulates neuronal excitability in a mouse model of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							AMINO-ACID-METABOLISM; C-13 NMR; RAT-BRAIN; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; ENERGY-METABOLISM; ACETATE TRANSPORT; HIPPOCAMPAL; ASTROCYTES; GLUTAMATE; RESPONSES	Glucose is the ultimate substrate for most brain activities that use carbon, including synthesis of the neuro-transmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid via mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Brain metabolism and neuronal excitability are thus interdependent. However, the principles that govern their relationship are not always intuitive because heritable defects of brain glucose metabolism are associated with the paradoxical coexistence, in the same individual, of episodic neuronal hyperexcitation (seizures) with reduced basal cerebral electrical activity. One such prototypic disorder is pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency (PDHD). PDH is central to metabolism because it steers most of the glucose-derived flux into the TCA cycle. To better understand the pathophysiology of PDHD, we generated mice with brain-specific reduced PDH activity that paralleled salient human disease features, including cerebral hypotrophy, decreased amplitude electroencephalogram (EEG), and epilepsy. The mice exhibited reductions in cerebral TCA cycle flux, glutamate content, spontaneous, and electrically evoked in vivo cortical field potentials and gamma EEG oscillation amplitude. Episodic decreases in gamma oscillations preceded most epileptiform discharges, facilitating their prediction. Fast-spiking neuron excitability was decreased in brain slices, contributing to in vivo action potential burst prolongation after whisker pad stimulation. These features were partially reversed after systemic administration of acetate, which augmented cerebral TCA cycle flux, glutamate-dependent synaptic transmission, inhibition and gamma oscillations, and reduced epileptiform discharge duration. Thus, our results suggest that dysfunctional excitability in PDHD is consequent to reduced oxidative flux, which leads to decreased neuronal activation and impaired inhibition, and can be mitigated by an alternative metabolic substrate.

The temporal features of both amplitude modulations and rise times characterize the speech envelope. Previous studies uncovered the inefficiency of the dyslexic brain to follow different amplitude modulations in speech. However, it remains to be investigated how the envelope's rise time mediates this neural processing. In this study we examined neural synchronization in students with and without dyslexia using auditory steady-state responses at theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma range oscillations (i.e., 4, 10, 20 and 40 Hz) to stimuli with different envelope rise times. Our results revealed reduced neural synchronization in the alpha, beta and low-gamma frequency ranges in dyslexia. Moreover, atypical neural synchronization was modulated by rise time for alpha and beta oscillations, showing that deficits found at 10 and 20 Hz were only evident when the envelope's rise time was significantly shortened. This impaired tracking of rise time cues may very well lead to the speech and phonological processing difficulties observed in dyslexia. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An electrophysiological analysis of the time course of phonological and orthographic encoding in written word production	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Handwriting; written production; orthography; phonology; electrophysiology; Chinese	LEXICAL ACCESS; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; SPEECH PRODUCTION; SPOKEN; CHINESE; SINGLE; FACILITATION; HYPOTHESIS; RETRIEVAL; FREQUENCY	Recent evidence suggests that individuals generate written words based on both spelling and sound. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the relative time course of orthographic and phonological activation. We adopted Chinese as a target language in which spelling and sound are largely dissociated. Native speakers of Chinese Mandarin were presented with coloured pictures and wrote down colour and picture names as adjective-noun phrases. Colour and picture names were either phonologically related, orthographically related, or unrelated. EEG revealed phonological effects in the 200-500 ms time window, starting at 206 ms after picture onset, and orthographic effects in the 300-400 ms time window, starting at 298 ms. The results of our study suggest that activation of phonological codes takes place approximately 100 ms earlier than access to orthographic codes, which provides evidence for phonological encoding as early sources of constraint in written word production.

Controversial results have been reported regarding the existence of spontaneous phase-phase coupling in the hippocampus. Here, we investigated this phenomenon in intracranial EEG recordings from the human hippocampus acquired during waking state and different sleep stages. We estimated the strength of interactions between different pairs of frequency bands and evaluated the statistical significance of findings using surrogates that build on different null hypotheses. Indications for spontaneous phase-phase coupling were only observed when testing with less rigorous surrogates. When requiring that all four surrogate tests be passed, however, there were no significant indications for phase-phase coupling. In conclusion, we did not detect evidence for spontaneous cross-frequency phase-phase coupling in the human hippocampus.

A number of researches on the efficiency of tACS discovered that it could directly modulate human cortex function by applying of oscillatory currents on the human scalp. Until now, the electrophysiological evidence of tACS remains unclear. In this study, we delivered alpha-tACS or sham stimulation over the prefrontal cortex of 20 healthy participants and recorded the rest EEG before and after the stimulation to calculate alpha power. The results showed that alpha-power of both fixed and individual alpha-band elevated after alpha-tACS, while the phenomenon did not appear in sham group. We could draw a conclusion that alpha-tACS could enhance alpha-oscillation and modulate rhythmic brain activity specifically.

Naive nonparametric estimates of the spectral density, such as the periodogram, are inconsistent, and the more advanced lag window or multitaper estimators are often still too noisy. We propose an L-1 penalized quasi-likelihood Whittle framework based on multitaper spectral estimates which performs semiparametric spectral estimation for regularly sampled univariate stationary time series. Our new approach circumvents the problematic Gaussianity assumption required by least square approaches and achieves sparsity for a wide variety of basis functions. We present an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem, and develop universal threshold and generalized information criterion (GIC) strategies for efficient tuning parameter selection that outperform cross-validation methods. Theoretically, a fast convergence rate for the proposed spectral estimator is established. We demonstrate the utility of our methodology on simulated series and to the spectral analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) data.

However, its neurobiological mechanisms have not yet been fully understood. In this brief article we propose a hypothesis that a recently introduced neurophysiologically based three-dimensional construct model for experiential selfhood may help to fill this gap by providing the necessary neurobiological rationale of EMDR. In support of this proposal we briefly overview the neurophysiology of eye movements and the triad selfhood components, as well as EMDR therapy neuroimaging studies.

This functional coupling reflects the involvement of the sensorimotor cortex, the corticospinal pathway, and likely also ascending sensory feedback in the task at hand. However, little is known about the developmental trajectory of task-related corticomuscular connectivity relating to the voluntary control of the ankle muscles. To address this, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from the vertex (Cz) and electromyography (EMG) from ankle muscles (proximal and distal anterior tibial, TA; soleus, SOL; gastrocnemius medialis, GM) in 33 participants aged 7-23 yr during tonic dorsi- and plantar flexion requiring precise maintenance of a submaximal torque level. Coherence was calculated for Cz-TA, Cz-SOL, TA-TA, and SOL-GM signal pairs. We found strong, positive associations between age and beta band coherence for Cz-TA, Cz-SOL, and TA-TA, suggesting that oscillatory corticomuscular connectivity is strengthened during childhood development and adolescence. Directionality analysis indicated that the primary interaction underlying this age-related increase was in the descending direction. In addition, performance during dorsi- and plantar flexion tasks was positively associated with age, indicating more precise control of the ankle joint in older participants. Performance was also positively associated with beta band coherence, suggesting that participants with greater coherence also exhibited greater precision. We propose that these results indicate an age-related increase in oscillatory corticospinal input to the ankle muscle motoneuron pools during childhood development and adolescence, with possible implications for maturation of precision force control. Within the theoretical framework of predictive coding, we suggest that our results may reflect an age-related increase in reliance on feed-forward control as the developing nervous system becomes better at predicting the sensory consequences of movement. These findings may contribute to the development of novel intervention strategies targeting improved sensorimotor control in children and adolescents with central motor disorders.

Functionally Distinct Gamma Range Activity Revealed by Stimulus Tuning in Human Visual Cortex	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							BAND ACTIVITY; NEURONAL POPULATION; FEATURE INTEGRATION; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; SPIKING; POWER; BOLD	Neocortical gamma activity has long been hypothesized as a mechanismfor synchronizing brain regions to support visual perception and cognition more broadly. Although early studies focused on narrowband gamma oscillations (similar to 20-60 Hz), recent work has emphasized a more broadband "high-gamma'' response (similar to 70-150+ Hz). These responses are often conceptually or analytically treated as synonymous markers of gamma activity. Using high-density intracranial recordings from the human visual cortex, we challenge this view by showing distinct spectral, temporal, and functional properties of narrow and broadband gamma. Across four experiments, narrowband gamma was strongly selective for gratings and long-wavelength colors, displaying a delayed response onset, sustained temporal profile, and contrast-dependent peak frequency. In addition, induced narrowband gamma oscillations lacked phase consistency across stimulus repetitions and displayed highly focal inter-site synchronization. In contrast, broadband gamma was consistently observed for all presented stimuli, displaying a rapid response onset, transient temporal profile, and invariant spectral properties. We exploited stimulus tuning to highlight the functional dissociation of these distinct signals, reconciling prior inconsistencies across species and stimuli regarding the ubiquity of visual gamma oscillations during natural vision. The occurrence of visual narrowband gamma oscillations, unlike broadband high gamma, appears contingent on specific structural and chromatic stimulus attributes intersecting with the receptive field. Together, these findings have important implications for the study, analysis, and functional interpretation of neocortical gamma-range activity.

J	Dalla Porta, L; Copelli, M				Dalla Porta, Leonardo; Copelli, Mauro			Modeling neuronal avalanches and long-range temporal correlations at the emergence of collective oscillations: Continuously varying exponents mimic M/EEG results	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; CORTEX; MEG	We revisit the CROS (CRitical OScillations) model which was recently proposed as an attempt to reproduce both scale-invariant neuronal avalanches and long-range temporal correlations. With excitatory and inhibitory stochastic neurons locally connected in a two-dimensional disordered network, the model exhibits a transition where alpha-band oscillations emerge. Precisely at the transition, the fluctuations of the network activity have nontrivial detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) exponents, and avalanches (defined as supra-threshold activity) have power law distributions of size and duration. We show that, differently from previous results, the exponents governing the distributions of avalanche size and duration are not necessarily those of the mean-field directed percolation universality class (3/2 and 2, respectively). Instead, in a narrow region of parameter space, avalanche exponents obtained via a maximum-likelihood estimator vary continuously and follow a linear relation, in good agreement with results obtained from M/EEG data. In that region, moreover, the values of avalanche and DFA exponents display a spread with positive correlations, reproducing human MEG results. Author summary Since the first experimental observation of scale-invariant neuronal avalanches, the idea that the brain could be operating near a phase transition has received much attention. But if the brain is critical, what is the phase transition? Experimentally, the sizes and durations of local field potential (LFP) avalanches were power-law distributed with exponents 3/2 and 2. Theoretically, these are the exponents of a critical branching process, a coincidence which has inspired many models with a common feature: a phase transition from a silent (absorbing) to an active phase. These models, however, struggle with another experimental result: brain activity can also exhibit long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs, another fingerprint of a critical system). An attempt to model both phenomena was put forward via the CROS (CRitical OScillations) model, in which neuronal avalanches and LRTCs were observed at a transition where alpha-band oscillations emerge. We show that the avalanche exponents of the CROS model do not necessarily agree with those of a critical branching process, but can vary near the transition region, just like the exponents governing LRTCs. Moreover, the spread of exponents observed in the model is in good agreement with experimental results from human MEG data.

Saccadic suppression measured by steady-state visual evoked potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						perception and action; saccadic eye movements; saccadic suppression; spectrum analysis; SSVEP	NEURONAL MECHANISMS; HUMAN LGN; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; VISION; ATTENTION	Visual sensitivity is severely impaired during the execution of saccadic eye movements. This phenomenon has been extensively characterized in human psychophysics and nonhuman primate single-neuron studies, but a physiological characterization in humans is less established. Here, we used a method based on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), an oscillatory brain response to periodic visual stimulation, to examine how saccades affect visual sensitivity. Observers made horizontal saccades back and forth. while horizontal black-and-white gratings flickered at 5-30 Hz in the background. We analyzed EEG epochs with a length of 0.3 s either centered at saccade onset (saccade epochs) or centered at fixations half a second before the saccade (fixation epochs). Compared with fixation epochs. saccade epochs showed a broadband power increase, which most likely resulted from saccade-related EEG activity. The execution of saccades, however, led to an average reduction of 57% in the SSVEP amplitude at the stimulation frequency. This result provides additional evidence for an active saccadic suppression in the early visual cortex in humans. Compared with previous functional MRI and EEG studies, an advantage of this approach lies in its capability to trace the temporal dynamics of neural activity throughout the time course of a saccade. In contrast to previous electrophysiological studies in nonhuman primates, we did not find any evidence for postsaccadic enhancement, even though simulation results show that our method would have been able to detect it. We conclude that SSVEP is a useful technique to investigate the neural correlates of visual perception during saccadic eye movements in humans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We make fast ballistic saccadic eye movements a few times every second. At the time of saccades, visual sensitivity is severely impaired. The present study uses steady-state visually evoked potentials to reveal a neural correlate of the fine temporal dynamics of these modulations at the time of saccades in humans. We observed a strong reduction (57%) of visually driven neural activity associated with saccades but did not find any evidence for postsaccadic enhancement.

Different computer-based signal analysis methods have thus been developed for objectively quantifying ictal FA. Whether these methods detect FA in all forms of focal epilepsies, whether they provide similar information than visual analysis (VA), and whether they might help for the surgical decision remain crucial issues. We thus conducted a retrospective study in 21 consecutive patients suffering from drug-resistant seizures studied by SEEG recordings. Ictal FA were quantified using the Epileptogenicity Maps (EM) method that we recently developed and which generates, by adopting a neuroimaging approach, statistical parametric maps of FA ranging from 60 to 100 Hz (FA(60-100)). Ictal FA were analyzed blindly using VA and EM, and the prognostic significance of removing areas exhibiting FA(60-100) at seizure onset was evaluated. A significant ictal FA(60-100) activation was found in all patients, and in 92.6% of all the 68 seizures recorded, whatever the epilepsy type. The overlap ratio (OR) between VA and EM was significantly better for defining the regions spared at seizure onset than those from which seizure arose (p < 0.001), especially in temporal or temporal "plus" epilepsies. EM and VA were much more discordant to define the EZ, with a mean number of electrode contacts involved at seizure onset significantly higher with EM than with VA (p = <0.0001). Seizure outcome correlated with the resection ratio for FA(60-100), which was significantly higher in seizure-free (Engel's class Ia) than in non seizure-free patients (class Ic-IV) (p = 0.048). The quantification of FA at seizure onset can bring information additional to clinical expertise that might contribute to define accurately the cortical region to be resected.

We examine this nexus during response inhibition in n = 47 healthy participants. Using high-density EEG recordings, we estimate neural noise by calculating "1/f noise" of those data and integrate these EEG parameters with pupil diameter data as an established indirect index of NE system activity. We show that neural noise is reduced when cognitive control processes to inhibit a prepotent/automated response are exerted. These neural noise variations were confined to the theta frequency band, which has also been shown to play a central role during response inhibition and cognitive control. There were strong positive correlations between the 1/f neural noise parameter and the pupil diameter data within the first 250 ms after the Nogo stimulus presentation at centro-parietal electrode sites. No such correlations were evident during automated responding on Go trials. Source localization analyses using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography show that inferior parietal areas are activated in this time period in Nogo trials. The data suggest an interrelation of NE system activity and neural noise within early stages of information processing associated with inferior parietal areas when cognitive control processes are required. The data provide the first direct evidence for the nexus between NE system activity and the modulation of neural noise during inhibitory control in humans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study showing that there is a nexus between norepinephrine system activity and the modulation of neural noise or scale-free neural activity during inhibitory control in humans. It does so by integrating pupil diameter data with analysis of EEG neural noise.

Postictal clinical and electroencephalographic activity following intracranially recorded bilateral tonic-clonic seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						EEG; focal epilepsy; high-frequency activity; intracranial EEG; postictal state	GENERALIZED EEG SUPPRESSION; OSCILLATIONS; PATTERNS; AROUSAL	Objective The dynamics of the postictal period, which may demonstrate such dramatic clinical phenomena as focal neurological deficits, prolonged coma and immobility, and even sudden death, are poorly understood. We sought to classify and characterize postictal phases of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures based on electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria and associated clinical features. Methods We performed a detailed electroclinical evaluation of the postictal period in a series of 31 bilateral tonic-clonic seizures in 16 patients undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluations for focal pharmacoresistant epilepsy with intracranial electrodes and time-locked video. Results The postictal EEG demonstrated three clearly differentiated phases as follows: attenuation, a burst-attenuation pattern, and a return to continuous background, with abrupt, synchronized transitions between phases. Postictal attenuation was common, occurring in 84% of seizures in 94% of patients in this study. There was increased power in gamma frequencies (>25 Hz) during postictal attenuation periods relative to preictal baseline in 88% of seizures demonstrating the attenuation pattern (n = 25 seizures, P < 0.002). Such increases were seen in >90% of channels in 13 seizures (52%) and <10% of channels in three seizures (12%). Postictal immobility was seen in 87% of seizures, with either a flaccid (58%) or rigid/dystonic (29%) appearance. Clinical motor manifestations, including focal dystonic posturing, automatisms, head and eye deviation, and myoclonic jerking, continued or emerged within the first minute following seizure termination in 48% of seizures, regardless of EEG appearance. Significance Intracranial postictal attenuation, which may be diffuse or focal, is so common that it should be regarded as a ubiquitous feature of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, rather than an unusual event. The prominence of high-frequency activity coupled with emerging clinical features, including rigid immobility and semiologies such as automatisms, during the postictal period supports the presence of ongoing seizure-related neuronal activity in unrecorded brain regions.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 81 patients undergoing awake craniotomy between 9/29/2016 and 7/5/2018. Intraoperative HD-ECoG was performed with direct electrocortical stimulation (DECS) for functional brain mapping. Real-time interpretation was performed and compared to scalp EEG when performed. Perioperative seizures, surgical complications, and characteristics of PFEDs were assessed. Results: 69/81 patients (mean age 48.5 years) underwent awake surgery; 55 operated for brain tumor, 11 for epilepsy and 3 for cavernomas. A focal abnormality on brain MRI was present in 63/69 (91.3%) patients. 43/69 (62.3%) patients had seizures preoperatively, 4/69 (5.7%) had seizures during DECS. PFEDs were identified in 11 patients (15.9%); 2 on depth recording and 9 during intraoperative HD-ECoG. 32 patients (46.3%) had preoperative EEG. HD-ECoG detected more epileptiform discharges (EDs) than standard EEG (32/43; 74.4% vs 9/32; 28.1%) (p = < 0.001). Of 9/43 patients with PFEDs on HD-ECoG, 7 patients also had scalp EEG but only one case had EDs (p = 0.02), and 0/32 had periodic EDs. Conclusions: Intraoperative PFEDs are novel, highly focal EDs approximating a single gyrus. In patients with brain tumors, PFEDs did not demonstrate a relationship to pre-operative seizures though has similarities to other common waveforms in patients with epilepsy. Significance: PFEDs expand our understanding of the interictal-ictal continuum and highlight improved temporo-spatial information obtained from increasing sensor density during intracranial EEG recording.

Using the unique ability of intracranial electroencephalography to study in situ brain physiology, this study assesses regional variations of electroencephalographic sleep activity and creates the first atlas of human sleep using recordings from the first sleep cycle. Methods Intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings with channels displaying physiological activity from nonlesional tissue were selected from 91 patients of 3 tertiary epilepsy centers. Sections during non-rapid eye movement sleep (stages N2 and N3) and rapid eye movement sleep (stage R) were selected from the first sleep cycle for oscillatory and nonoscillatory signal analysis. Results of 1,468 channels were grouped into 38 regions covering all cortical areas. Results We found regional differences in the distribution of sleep transients and spectral content during all sleep stages. There was a caudorostral gradient, with more slow frequencies and fewer spindles in temporoparieto-occipital than in frontal cortex. Moreover, deep-seated structures showed spectral peaks differing from the baseline electroencephalogram. The regions with >60% of channels presenting significant rhythmic activity were either mesial or temporal basal structures that contribute minimally to the scalp electroencephalogram. Finally, during deeper sleep stages, electroencephalographic analysis revealed a more homogeneous spatial distribution, with increased coupling between high and low frequencies. Interpretation This study provides a better understanding of the regional variability of sleep, and establishes a baseline for human sleep in all cortical regions during the first sleep cycle. Furthermore, the open-access atlas will be a unique resource for research ().

In addition to the importance of the consolidation of relevant memories, the capacity to forget unwanted memories is also crucial. We investigated the effect of suppressing unwanted memories on electroencephalography activity of subsequent sleep using a motivated forgetting (MF) paradigm as compared with a control non-forgetting task. Subjects were randomly assigned to nap or no-nap groups. We used a modified version of the think/no-think paradigm with dominant number of no-think words cued to be forgotten and included only subjects capable of suppressing unwanted memories by performing an initial subject inclusion experiment. In both groups and conditions, the performance of the subjects in recalling the word pairs learned in the beginning of the day was evaluated in a final recall test. We found that both nap and no-nap groups recalled significantly less no-think words in the MF condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, for the nap group, in the MF compared to the control condition, spindle power and density increased during stage 2 (S2) whereas they decreased during slow wave sleep (SWS). Interestingly, recall performance of no-think words was negatively correlated with spindle power during S2 whereas it was positively correlated with spindle power during SWS. These results indicate that sleep spindles are sensitive to the previous MF experiences and suggest a differential role of sleep spindles during S2 and SWS in memory processing during sleep.

Cortical Activation Elicited by Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation Predicts Postoperative Motor Side Effects	NEUROMODULATION			English	Article						Cortical evoked potential; deep brain stimulation; EEG; high frequency activity; Parkinson's disease; subthalamic nucleus	SHORT-LATENCY ACTIVATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NUCLEUS; CORTEX; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; OUTCOMES	Objective Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for movement disorders, improvement varies substantially in individuals, across clinical trials, and over time. Noninvasive biomarkers that predict the individual response to DBS could be used to optimize outcomes and drive technological innovation in neuromodulation. We sought to evaluate whether noninvasive event related potentials elicited by subthalamic DBS during surgical targeting predict the tolerability of a given stimulation site in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Methods Using electroencephalography, we measured event related potentials elicited by 20 Hz DBS over a range of stimulus intensities across the spatial extent of the implanted electrode array in 11 patients. We correlated event related potential timing and morphology with the stimulus amplitude thresholds for motor side effects during postoperative programming at >= 130 Hz. Results During surgical targeting, DBS at 20 Hz elicits large amplitude, high frequency activity (evoked HFA) with mean onset latency of 9.0 +/- 0.3 msec and a mean frequency of 175.8 +/- 7.8 Hz. The lowest DBS amplitude that elicits the HFA predicts thresholds for motor side effects during postoperative stimulation at >= 130 Hz (p < 0.001, ANOVA). Conclusion Event related potentials elicited by DBS can predict clinically relevant corticospinal activation by stimulation after surgery. Noninvasive scalp physiology requires no patient interaction and could serve as a biomarker to guide targeting, postoperative programming, and emerging technologies such as directional and closed-loop stimulation.

The neurophysiological data of 30 chronic stroke patients with severe upper-limb paralysis are the basis of the observational study presented here. These patients underwent an intervention including movement training based on combined brain-machine interfaces and physiotherapy of several weeks recorded in a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. We analyzed the alpha oscillations over the motor cortex of 22 of these patients employing multilevel linear predictive modeling. We identified a significant correlation between the evolution of the alpha desynchronization during rehabilitative intervention and clinical improvement. Moreover, we observed that the initial alpha desynchronization conditions its modulation during intervention: Patients showing a strong alpha desynchronization at the beginning of the training improved if they increased their alpha desynchronization. Patients showing a small alpha desynchronization at initial training stages improved if they decreased it further on both hemispheres. In all patients, a progressive shift of desynchronization toward the ipsilesional hemisphere correlates significantly with clinical improvement regardless of lesion location. The results indicate that initial alpha desynchronization might be key for stratification of patients undergoing BMI interventions and that its interhemispheric balance plays an important role in motor recovery.

This review analyzes the macrostructural and microstructural sleep features, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria (PRISMA). We included the polysomnographic studies published in the last 15 years. The results of macrostructural parameters are mixed. Almost half of the 18 selected investigations did not find differences between sleep architecture of children with ADHD and controls. Five studies observed that children with ADHD show a longer Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep duration than controls. Eight studies included microstructural measures. Remarkable alterations in sleep microstructure of ADHD are related to slow wave activity (SWA) and theta oscillations, respectively, during Non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep. Specifically, some studies found higher SWA in the ADHD group than controls. Similarly, higher theta activity appears to be detrimental for memory performance and inhibitory control in ADHD. These patterns could be interpreted as a maturational delay in ADHD. Also, the increased amount of these activities would be consistent with the hypothesis that the poor sleep could imply a chronic sleep deprivation in children with ADHD, which in turn could affect their cognitive functioning.

Crossmodal influence in this illusion has been shown to be associated with activity in visual and temporal areas. In this electroencephalography study, we investigated the relationship between oscillatory brain activity prior to stimulus presentation and subsequent perception of the illusion on the level of single trials. Using logistic regression, we modeled the perceptual outcome dependent on oscillatory power. We found that 25 Hz to 41 Hz activity over occipital electrodes from 0.17 s to 0.05 s prior to stimulus onset predicted the perception of the illusion. A t-test of power values, averaged over the significant cluster, between illusion and no-illusion trials showed higher power in illusion trials, corroborating the modeling result. We conclude that the observed power modulation predisposes the integration of audiovisual signals, providing further evidence for the governing role of prestimulus brain oscillations in multisensory perception.

Neural evidence accounting for interindividual variability of the McGurk illusion	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Alpha oscillations; Audiovisual integration; Cross-modal perception; McGurk illusion; Sensory-gating	SPEECH; PERCEPTION; FUSION	The McGurk illusion is experienced to various degrees among the general population. Previous studies have implicated the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) and auditory cortex (AC) as regions associated with this interindividual variability. We sought to further investigate the neurophysiology underlying this variability using a variant of the McGurk illusion design. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while human subjects were presented with videos of a speaker uttering the consonant-vowels (CVs) /ba/ and /fa/, which were mixed and matched with audio of /ba/ and /fa/ to produce congruent and incongruent conditions. Subjects were also presented with unimodal stimuli of silent videos and audios of the CVs. They responded to whether they heard (or saw in the silent condition) /ba/ or /fa/. An illusion during the incongruent conditions was deemed successful when individuals heard the syllable conveyed by mouth movements. We hypothesized that individuals who experience the illusion more strongly should exhibit more robust desynchronization of alpha (7-12 Hz) at fronto-central and temporal sites, emphasizing more engagement of neural generators at the AC and STS. We found, however, that compared to weaker illusion perceivers, stronger illusion perceivers exhibited greater alpha synchronization at fronto-central and posterior temporal sites, which is consistent with inhibition of auditory representations. These findings suggest that stronger McGurk illusion perceivers possess more robust crossmodal sensory gating mechanisms whereby phonetic representations not conveyed by the visual system are inhibited, and in turn reinforcing perception of the visually targeted phonemes.

Researchers use causality detection techniques, such as Granger causality, to infer connectivity among brain areas from time series. Generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC) is a frequency domain linear method based on vector autoregressive model, which has been applied in electroencephalography, local field potential, and blood oxygenation level-dependent signals. Despite its widespread usage, previous attempts to validate GPDC use oversimplified simulated data, which do not reflect the nonlinearities and network couplings present in biological signals. In this work, we evaluated the GPDC performance when applied to simulated LFP signals, i.e., generated from networks of spiking neuronal models. We created three models, each containing five interacting networks, and evaluated whether the GPDC method could accurately detect network couplings. When using a stronger coupling, we showed that GPDC correctly detects all existing connections from simulated LFP signals in the three models, without false positives. Varying the coupling strength between networks, by changing the number of connections or synaptic strengths, and adding noise in the times series, altered the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, ranging from perfect to chance level retrieval. We also showed that GPDC values correlated with coupling strength, indicating that GPDC values can provide useful information regarding coupling strength. These results reinforce that GPDC can be used to detect causality relationships over neural signals.

Role of subjective and objective measures of cognitive processing during learning in explaining the spatial contiguity effect	LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION			English	Article						Spatial contiguity; EEG; Eye tracking; Cognitive load; Multimedia learning	MENTAL WORKLOAD; LOAD THEORY; EEG-ALPHA; TASK ENGAGEMENT; ATTENTION; PERFORMANCE; SINGLE; OSCILLATIONS; EFFICIENCY; DESIGN	The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of combining subjective and objective measures of learning process to uncover the mechanisms underlying the spatial contiguity effect in multimedia learning. The subjective measures of learning process were self-reported cognitive load ratings and the objective measures were eye-tracking and EEG measures. Learning outcome was measured by scores on retention and transfer posttests. A sample of 78 university students participated in a between-subjects design in which a multimedia slideshow lesson on how lightning storms develop was presented either with printed text as a caption at the bottom of each illustration (separated presentation) or with printed text placed next to the corresponding part of each illustration (integrated presentation). Regarding spatial contiguity, the integrated group spent significantly more time looking at the text (d = 0.64), but significantly less time looking at irrelevant illustrations (d = 1.10), and reported a significantly lower level of extraneous load (d = 0.57), compared to the separated group. As expected, they also scored significantly higher on the transfer test (d = 0.49). Students who performed best on posttests reported a lower level of extraneous load (d = 0.56). Furthermore, EEG based alpha band activity was predictive of intrinsic cognitive load but not predictive of extraneous cognitive load, and EEG based theta activity was not predictive of intrinsic or extraneous load. The results suggest that subjective and objective measures of cognitive load can provide different information to test the theoretical mechanisms involved in multimedia learning.

This intercortical communication is disrupted in the neural networks of patients with focal epilepsy, and epileptic activity can exert widespread effects within the brain. Using large-scale human intracranial electroencephalography recordings, we show that interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are significantly coupled with spindles in discrete, individualized brain regions outside of the epileptic network. We found that a substantial proportion of these localized spindles travel across the cortical surface. Brain regions that participate in this IED-driven oscillatory coupling express spindles that have a broader spatial extent and higher tendency to propagate than spindles occurring in uncoupled regions. These altered spatiotemporal oscillatory properties identify areas that are shaped by epileptic activity independent of IED or seizure detection. Our findings suggest that IED-spindle coupling may be an important mechanism of interictal global network dysfunction that could be targeted to prevent disruption of normal neural activity.

Methods: Graph parameters of 41 consecutive stroke patients (<5 days from the event) were studied using eLORETA EEG sources. Network rearrangements of stroke patients were investigated in delta, alpha 2, beta 2 and gamma bands in comparison with healthy subjects. Results: The delta network remodeling was similar in cerebellar and middle cerebral artery strokes, with a reduction of small-worldness. Beta 2 and gamma small-worldness, in the right hemisphere of patients with cerebellar stroke, increase respect to healthy subjects, while alpha 2 small-worldness increases only among patients with a middle cerebral artery stroke. Conclusions: The network remodeling characteristics are independent on the size of the ischemic lesion. In the early post-acute stages cerebellar stroke differs from the middle cerebral artery one because it does not cause alpha 2 network remodeling while it determines a high frequency network reorganization in beta 2 and gamma bands with an increase of small-worldness characteristics. Significance: These findings demonstrate changes in the balance of local segregation and global integration induced by cerebellar acute stroke in high EEG frequency bands. They need to be integrated with appropriate follow-up to explore whether further network changes are attained during post-stroke outcome stabilization.

J	Castano-Candamil, S; Meinel, A; Tangermann, M				Castano-Candamil, Sebastian; Meinel, Andreas; Tangermann, Michael			Post-hoc Labeling of Arbitrary M/EEG Recordings for Data-Efficient Evaluation of Neural Decoding Methods	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						neural decoding; M/EEG labeling; data-driven neural decoding; brain computer interfaces; band-power decoding	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ALPHA; MEG	Many cognitive, sensory and motor processes have correlates in oscillatory neural source activity, which is embedded as a subspace in the recorded brain signals. Decoding such processes from noisy magnetoencephalogram/electroencephalogram (M/EEG) signals usually requires data-driven analysis methods. The objective evaluation of such decoding algorithms on experimental raw signals, however, is a challenge: the amount of available M/EEG data typically is limited, labels can be unreliable, and raw signals often are contaminated with artifacts. To overcome some of these problems, simulation frameworks have been introduced which support the development of data-driven decoding algorithms and their benchmarking. For generating artificial brain signals, however, most of the existing frameworks make strong and partially unrealistic assumptions about brain activity. This limits the generalization of results observed in the simulation to real-world scenarios. In the present contribution, we show how to overcome several shortcomings of existing simulation frameworks. We propose a versatile alternative, which allows for an objective evaluation and benchmarking of novel decoding algorithms using real neural signals. It allows to generate comparatively large datasets with labels being deterministically recoverable from the arbitrary M/EEG recordings. A novel idea to generate these labels is central to this framework: we determine a subspace of the true M/EEG recordings and utilize it to derive novel labels. These labels contain realistic information about the oscillatory activity of some underlying neural sources. For two categories of subspace-defining methods, we showcase how such labels can be obtained-either by an exclusively data-driven approach (independent component analysis-ICA), or by a method exploiting additional anatomical constraints (minimum norm estimates-MNE). We term our framework post-hoc labeling of M/EEG recordings. To support the adoption of the framework by practitioners, we have exemplified its use by benchmarking three standard decoding methods-i.e., common spatial patterns (CSP), source power-comodulation (SPoC), and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)-wrt. Varied dataset sizes, label noise, and label variability. Source code and data are made available to the reader for facilitating the application of our post-hoc labeling framework.

J	Colley, ID; Dean, RT				Colley, Ian D.; Dean, Roger T.			Origins of 1/f noise in human music performance from short-range autocorrelations related to rhythmic structures	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SELF; ORGANIZATION; STABILITY; DYNAMICS	1/f fluctuations have been described in numerous physical and biological processes. This noise structure describes an inverse relationship between the intensity and frequency of events in a time series (for example reflected in power spectra), and is believed to indicate long-range dependence, whereby events at one time point influence events many observations later. 1/f has been identified in rhythmic behaviors, such as music, and is typically attributed to long-range correlations. However short-range dependence in musical performance is a well-established finding and past research has suggested that 1/f can arise from multiple continuing short-range processes. We tested this possibility using simulations and time-series modeling, complemented by traditional analyses using power spectra and detrended fluctuation analysis (as often adopted more recently). Our results show that 1/f type fluctuations in musical contexts may be explained by short-range models involving multiple time lags, and the temporal ranges in which rhythmic hierarchies are expressed are apt to create these fluctuations through such short-range autocorrelations. We also analyzed gait, heartbeat, and resting-state EEG data, demonstrating the coexistence of multiple short-range processes and 1/f fluctuation in a variety of phenomena. This suggests that 1/f fluctuation might not indicate long-range correlations, and points to its likely origins in musical rhythm and related structures.

The hypothesis was that dream recall will produce an increased activation of fronto-limbic areas during an emotional task. Thirty-seven women were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups. Both groups were exposed to a visual task with emotional images (positive vs. negative) presented in two stages (T0 and T1). Between T0 and T1, in the experimental group, women were asked to recall and report a dream; whereas, in the control group, they were asked to report their work experiences. Electroencephalography data were continuously recorded in each participant, except during the personal report session. Event-related potential analyses showed an interaction effect of Time (T0 vs. T1) x Condition (positive vs. negative) x Group (experimental vs. control) in temporo-parietal montage at P100; and Condition x Hemisphere x Group in frontal montage from 200 to 1,000 ms. Standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography results showed an increased activation of the fronto-limbic areas and a decreased activation of the anterior middle frontal gyrus and temporo-parietal junction at T1 compared with T0 in the experimental group. Conversely, in the control group, a decreased activation in limbic areas was found. Dream recall was associated with an increased intensity of the limbic and temporal circuits during emotional exposition, suggesting that dream recall seems to favor an emotional response.

Distraction by salient objects can be reduced by suppressing the location where they are likely to appear. The question we addressed here was whether suppression of frequent distractor locations is already implemented beforehand, in anticipation of the stimulus. Using EEG, we recorded cortical activity of human participants searching for a target while ignoring a salient distractor. The distractor was presented more often at one location than at any other location. We found reduced capture for distractors at frequent locations, indicating that participants learned to avoid distraction. Critically, we found evidence for "proactive suppression" as already "prior to display onset," there was enhanced power in parieto-occipital alpha oscillations contralateral to the frequent distractor location-a signal known to occur in anticipation of irrelevant information. Locked to display onset, ERP analysis showed a distractor suppression-related distractor positivity (P-D) component for this location. Importantly, this P-D was found regardless of whether distracting information was presented at the frequent location. In addition, there was an early P-D component representing an early attentional index of the frequent distractor location. Our results show anticipatory (proactive) suppression of frequent distractor locations in visual search already starting prior to display onset.

Method of invasive monitoring in epilepsy surgery and seizure freedom and morbidity: A systematic review	EPILEPSIA			English	Review						drug-resistant epilepsy; electroencephalography; neurology; neurosurgery; stereoelectroencephalography; subdural grid	STEREO-ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY SEEG; IMPLANTED SUBDURAL ELECTRODES; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; DEPTH ELECTRODES; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; INTRACRANIAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; INTRACEREBRAL ELECTRODES; PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION; RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS	Objective Invasive monitoring is sometimes necessary to guide resective surgery in epilepsy patients, but the ideal method is unknown. In this systematic review, we assess the association of postresection seizure freedom and adverse events in stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and subdural electrodes (SDE). Methods We searched three electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials]) from their inception to January 2018 with the keywords "electroencephalography," "intracranial grid," and "epilepsy." Studies that presented primary quantitative patient data for postresection seizure freedom with at least 1 year of follow-up or complication rates of SEEG- or SDE-monitored patients were included. Two trained investigators independently collected data from eligible studies. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) were used as a measure of the association of SEEG or SDE with seizure freedom and with adverse event outcomes. Results Of 11 462 screened records, 48 studies met inclusion criteria. These studies reported on 1973 SEEG patients and 2036 SDE patients. Our systematic review revealed SEEG was associated with 61.0% and SDE was associated with 56.4% seizure freedom after resection (WMD = +5.8%, 95% CI = 4.7-6.9%, P = .001). Furthermore, SEEG was associated with 4.8% and SDE was associated with 15.5% morbidity (WMD = -10.6%, 95% CI = -11.6 to -9.6%, P = .001). SEEG was associated with 0.2% mortality and SDE was associated with 0.4% mortality (WMD = -0.2%, 95% CI = -0.3 to -0.1%, P = .001). Significance In this systematic review of SEEG and SDE invasive monitoring techniques, SEEG was associated with fewer surgical resections yet better seizure freedom outcomes in those undergoing resections. SEEG was also associated with lower mortality and morbidity than SDE. Clinical studies directly comparing these modalities are necessary to understand the relative rates of seizure freedom, morbidity, and mortality associated with these techniques.

Benign Rolandic epilepsy: widespread increases in connectivity in a focal epilepsy syndrome	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						coherence; oscillations; power; BECTS; centrotemporal spikes; self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes	CHILDHOOD ABSENCE EPILEPSY; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; CENTROTEMPORAL SPIKES; INTERICTAL SPIKES; PAROXYSMAL FOCI; CHILDREN; SPECTRUM; AUTISM; SEIZURE	Aim. Benign Rolandic epilepsy (benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes; recently renamed self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes) is associated with widespread deficits in cognition and behavior, suggesting abnormalities in networks that extend beyond the centrotemporal region. To assess functional connectivity in children with benign Rolandic epilepsy, we assessed EEG spectral power and coherence during awake and sleep records in 27 children with centrotemporal spikes. Coherence represents the consistency of the phase difference between two EEG signals when compared over time and serves as a measure of synchronization between two EEG signals based mainly on phase consistency.Methods. Epochs of EEG with and without centrotemporal spikes were compared during both waking and sleep.Results. During the spike epochs, there was an increase in spectral power at all frequencies, although statistical significance was seen primarily in the delta, theta and alpha bandwidths. This increase in absolute power was seen at all electrode sites and was similar in left and right-sided electrodes. During centrotemporal spikes, there were significant changes in coherence compared to the EEG segments without spikes. In the theta, alpha and beta bandwidths, there were significant increases in coherence. The increases in coherences were widespread and bilateral, and involved electrode pairs outside the central and temporal regions. To determine if there was a relationship between location of the spikes and coherence values, right-sided, left-sided and bilateral centrotemporal spikes were compared. There was no relationship between location of the centrotemporal spikes and power or coherence values.Conclusion. These findings indicate that benign Rolandic epilepsy results in generalized changes in spectral power and connectivity and raises the suggestion that from a functional standpoint, benign Rolandic epilepsy resembles a generalized rather than focal seizure disorder.

But seldom researches explore the effects of mental fatigue on the small-world brain functional network organization. In the present study, 20 healthy individuals were included to do a consecutive mental arithmetic task to induce mental fatigue, and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded before and after the task. Correlations between all pairs of EEG channels were determined by mutual information (MI). The resulting adjacency matrices were converted into brain functional networks by applying a threshold, and then, the clustering coefficient (C), characteristic path length (L), and corresponding small-world feature were calculated. Through performing analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the mean MI for every EEG rhythm, only the data of alpha 1 rhythm during the task state were emerged for the further explorations of mental fatigue. For a wide range of thresholds, C increased and L and small-world feature decreased with the deepening mental fatigue. The pattern of the small-world characteristic still existed when computed with a constant degree. Our present findings indicated that more functional connectivities were activated at the mental fatigue stage for efficient information transmission and processing, and mental fatigue can be characterized by a reduced small-world network characteristic. Our results provide a new perspective to understand the neural mechanisms of mental fatigue based on complex network theories.

Yet their cognitive content and function during awake, conscious behavior remains unclear. We directly examined this question using intracranial recordings in human patients engaged in episodic free recall of previously viewed photographs. Our results reveal a content-selective increase in hippocampal ripple rate emerging 1 to 2 seconds prior to recall events. During recollection, high-order visual areas showed pronounced SWR-coupled reemergence of activation patterns associated with recalled content. Finally, the SWR rate during encoding predicted subsequent free-recall performance. These results point to a role for hippocampal SWRs in triggering spontaneous recollections and orchestrating the reinstatement of cortical representations during free episodic memory retrieval.

ReCCognition Study Grp	Dynamic Cortical Connectivity during General Anesthesia in Healthy Volunteers	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-DENSITY-ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CONSCIOUSNESS; PROPOFOL; NETWORK; SEVOFLURANE; KETAMINE; RECOVERY; STATES; EEG	Background: Recent studies of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness in healthy volunteers have focused on functional brain connectivity patterns, but the protocols rarely parallel the depth and duration of surgical anesthesia. Furthermore, it is unknown whether there is a single functional connectivity pattern that correlates with general anesthesia for the duration of prolonged anesthetic exposure. Methods: The authors analyzed electroencephalographic data in 30 healthy participants who underwent induction of anesthesia with propofol followed by 3 h of isoflurane anesthesia at age-adjusted 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration. Functional connectivity was assessed by frequency-resolved weighted phase lag index between frontal and parietal channels and between prefrontal and frontal channels, which were classified into a discrete set of states through k-means cluster analysis. Temporal dynamics were evaluated by the occurrence rate and dwell time distribution for each state as well as the transition probabilities between states. Results: Burst suppression was present, with mean suppression ratio reducing from 44.8 +/- 32.3% to 14.0 +/- 20.2% (mean +/- SD) during isoflurane anesthesia (P < 0.001). Aside from burst suppression, eight connectivity states were classified by optimizing the reproducibility of clustering solutions, with each characterized by distinct properties. The temporal progression of dominant states revealed a successive shifting trajectory from the state associated with alpha frontal-parietal connectivity to those associated with delta and alpha prefrontal-frontal connectivity during induction, which was reversed during emergence. Cortical connectivity was dynamic during maintenance period, and it was more probable to remain in the same state (82.0 +/- 8.3%) than to switch to a different state (P < 0.001). However, transitions to other states were structured, i. e., occurred more frequently than expected by chance. Conclusions: Anesthesia-induced alterations of functional connectivity are dynamic despite the stable and prolonged administration of isoflurane, in the absence of any noxious stimuli. Changes in connectivity over time will likely yield more information as a marker or mechanism of surgical anesthesia than any single pattern.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of DR compared to screen-based intervention on electrophysiological markers supporting narrative comprehension using EEG. Methods Thirty-two typically developing preschoolers, ages 4 to 6 years, were assigned to one of two intervention groups: Dialogic Reading Group (DRG, n = 16) or Screen Story Group (SSG, n = 16). We examined the effect of intervention type using behavioral assessment and a narrative comprehension task with EEG. Results The DRG showed improved vocabulary and decreased functional connectivity during the stories-listening task, whereas the SSG group showed no changes in vocabulary or connectivity. Significantly decreased network strength and transitivity and increased network efficiency were observed in the DRG following intervention. Greater network strength and transitivity at follow-up were correlated with increased vocabulary. Conclusions The results suggest the beneficial effect of DR in preschool-age children on vocabulary and EEG-bands related to attention in the ventral stream during narrative comprehension. Decreased functional connectivity may serve as a marker for language gains following reading intervention. Significance DR intervention for preschool-age children may reduce interfering connections related to attention, which is related to better narrative comprehension.

This paper proposes a method to identify automatically the complexes and provides preliminary tests on paediatric patients with encephalitis. Approach: a prototype waveform was computed aligning and averaging complexes manually identified during years of investigation. A wide range of amplitudes and durations was noticed. The proposed automatic method is based on the cross-correlation of the tested EEG with scaled versions of the prototype waveform. The waves with high correlation with the prototype are identified as complexes if their amplitude and duration are reasonable and if they do not appear as pseudo-periodic oscillations. Main results: the algorithm was tested on a dataset of 128 EEGs from healthy controls and patients (for which the follow-up was also available). Experts assigned to each trace a severity score with 5 levels considering both electrophysiological and clinical manifestations. The number and amplitude of complexes are markers of encephalitis, they show statistically significant differences across EEGs with different severity scores and correlate with the condition of patients during the follow-up (median correlation about 80%). Significance: inflammatory brain pathologies can have serious sequelae. Quickness of diagnosis and targeted therapeutic interventions are essential to avoid or limit the damages. The proposed automated method is feasible for the fast, accurate and non-invasive diagnosis of encephalitis and the follow-up of patients.

To test this hypothesis, electroencephalograms (EEGs) from 20 high-level shooting athletes and 20 age- and gender-matched non-athletes are collected in an eyes-closed resting state. The frequency spectrum was divided into four bands according to the individual alpha frequency of each participant: delta, theta, alphal, and alpha2. The phase-locking values of the EEG in each frequency band are calculated and graph theory is used to analyze the topology of the EEG brain functional network based on the phase-locking-value connection. The results show that, compared with non-athletes, high-level shooters have higher connectivity in the left-temporal region, left-posterior temporal region, left-frontal region, left-central region, and right-parietal region. The network-clustering coefficients and small-world characteristics of athletes in the theta and alphal bands are significantly greater than that of non-athletes. These results support the hypothesis that brain function coupling in high-level shooting athletes is more connected than that in non-athletes, and the brain networks of high-level athlete have stronger small-world characteristics than those of non-athletes.

These abilities have been associated with activation of the parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. It has been suggested that the reasoning involved in solving logical-mathematical problems requires the coordinated functionality of all these cortical areas. In this study was evaluated the activation and electroencephalographic (EEG) correlation of the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal regions in young men while solving logical-mathematical word problems with two degrees of difficulty: simple and complex. During the solving of complex problems, higher absolute power and EEG correlation of the alpha and fast bands between the left frontal and parietal cortices were observed. A temporal deactivation and functional decoupling of the right parietal-temporal cortices also were obtained. Solving complex problems probably require activation of a left prefrontal-parietal circuit to maintain and manipulate multiple pieces of information. The temporal deactivation and decreased parietal-temporal correlation could be associated to text processing and suppression of the content-dependent reasoning to focus cognitive resources on the mathematical reasoning. Together, these findings support a pivotal role for the left prefrontal and parietal cortices in mathematical reasoning and of the temporal regions in text processing required to understand and solve written mathematical problems.

Coupling Between Brain Structures During Visual and Auditory Working Memory Tasks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Working memory; EEG activity transmission; directed transfer function; coupling between brain regions; assortative mixing	DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VOLUME CONDUCTION; INFORMATION-FLOW; FRONTAL THETA; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MAINTENANCE; COHERENCE; SELECTION	Transmission of EEG activity during a visual and auditory version of the working memory task based on the paradigm of linear syllogism was investigated. Our aim was to find possible similarities and differences in the synchronization patterns between brain structures during the same mental activity performed on different modality stimuli. The EEG activity transmission was evaluated by means of full frequency Directed Transfer Function (ffDTF) and short-time Directed Transfer Function (SDTF). SDTF provided information on dynamical propagation of EEG activity. The assortative mixing approach was applied to quantify coupling between regions of interest encompassing frontal, central and two posterior modules. The results showed similar schemes of coupling for both modalities with stronger coupling within the regions of interests than between them, which is concordant with the theories concerning efficient wiring and metabolic energy saving. The patterns of transmission showed main sources of activity in the anterior and posterior regions communicating intermittently in a broad frequency range. The differences between the patterns of transmission between the visual and auditory versions of working memory tasks were subtle and involved bigger propagation from the posterior electrodes towards the frontal ones during the visual task as well as from the temporal sites to the frontal ones during the auditory task.

Relationship of gamma activity with symptom severity was also examined, since gamma activity is considered to be an index of network functions in the brain that underlie higher-order cognitive processes. Methods: Spontaneous EEG was recorded in adult ADHD subjects (N = 42; 25 methylphenidate-naive and 17 on methylphenidate treatment) and controls (N = 59) with eyes open. EEG absolute power gamma was investigated in the gamma(1) (30.25-39 Hz) and gamma(2) (39.25-48 Hz) frequency bands. Results: Gamma(1) and gamma(2) activity was diminished in ADHD compared with healthy control subjects. The difference between ADHD and controls was the most pronounced in the right centroparietal region for both gamma(1) and gamma(2). Inverse associations were found between gamma(1) and gamma(2) activity and ADHD symptoms in centroparietal scalp regions. Conclusions: Gamma activity is reduced in adult ADHD, and the reduction has a predominantly right centroparietal distribution. Our findings are consistent with childhood ADHD literature with respect to diminished posterior gamma activity in patients, which may reflect altered dorsal attention network functions. Gamma abnormalities might provide a link between neurophysiological functioning and neuropsychological deficiencies, thereby offering an opportunity to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the clinical symptoms of ADHD.

Methods: Subjects were 21 children with ADHD and 18 aged-matched, typically developing children (TDC). ADHD subjects were divided into groups of only ADHD and ADHD + autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We employed the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) to measure attention. We focused on sleep spindle frequencies (12-14 Hz) in sleep stage 2 and performed a power spectral analysis using fast Fourier transform techniques and compared sleep spindles with the variability of reaction time in CPT. Results: In the CPT, reaction variabilities in ADHD and ADHD + ASD significantly differed from those in TDC. Twelve-hertz spindles were mainly distributed in the frontal pole and frontal area and 14-Hz spindles in the central area. The ratio of 12-Hz frontal spindle power was higher in ADHD than in TDC, especially in ADHD + ASD. Significant correlation between the ratio of 12-Hz spindles and reaction time variability was observed. Conclusions: Twelve-hertz frontal spindle EEG activity may have positive associations with sustained attention function. Slow frontal spindles may be useful as a biomarker of inattention in children with ADHD. (C) 2019 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to compare between a bimanual task (BM) and a MVF task, within functionally rather than geometrically defined cortical domains. Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) approach was applied to compare the dynamic oscillatory activity (event-related synchronization/desynchronization ERS/ERD) between and within domains. EEG was recorded in 14 healthy participants performing a BM and an MVF task with the right hand. The MPA was applied on fitted equivalent current dipoles based on independent components to define domains containing functionally similar areas. The measure of intradomain similarity was a "signed mutual information," a parameter based on the coherence. Domain analysis was performed for joint tasks (BM and MVF) and for each task separately. MVF created 9 functional domains while MB task had only 4 functionally distinctive domains, two over the left hemispheres and two bilateraly. For all domains identified for BM task alone, similar domains could be identified in MVF and joint tasks analysis. In addition MVF had domains related to motor planning on the right hemisphere and to self-recognition of action. For joint tasks analysis, seven domains were identified, with similar functions for the left and the right hand with exception of a domain covering BA32 (self-recognition of action) of the left hand only. In joint task domain analysis, the ERD/ERS showed a larger difference between domains than between tasks. All domains which involved the sensory cortex had a visible beta ERS at the onset of movement, and post movement beta ERS. The frequency of ERD varied between domains. Largest difference between tasks existed in domains responsible for the awareness of action. In conclusion, functionally distinctive domains have different ERD/ERS patterns, similar for both tasks. MVF activates contralateral hemisphere in similar manner to BM movements, while at the same time also activating the ipsilateral hemisphere. Significance: Following stroke cortical activation and interhemispheric inhibition from the contralesional side is reduced. MVF creates stronger ipsilateral activity than BM, which is highly relevant of neurorehabilitation of movements.	[Al-Wasity, Salim M.

Methods: We studied patients who underwent temporal lobe and/or insular resections for epilepsy surgery between April 2010 and June 2015 at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (UHCMC). Presurgical T1-weighted MPRAGE, standard T1,T2 and FLAIR sequences were compared with postsurgical MRI by a neuro-radiologist and classified as type 0 (no involvement of insula), type 1 (minimal involvement of insular margin), type 2 (insular involvement <25%), and type 3 (insular involvement >= 25%). Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) was carried out in pre- and postoperative video-electroencephalography (vEEG) recording. Time-domain parameters were calculated: (mean of the RR intervals (MNN), root mean square difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), standard deviation of the RR intervals (SDNN), and coefficient of variation (CV)). In addition, frequency-domain parameters were calculated: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF). Results: Twenty-one patients (14 females) with mean age of 36.2 +/- 14.4 years (30; 22-75) were studied. Insular involvement was classified as type 0 (4 patients [19%]), type 1 (9 [43%]), type 2 (7 [33%]), and type 3 (1 [5%]). Significant decrease in RMSSD (p = 0.025) and CV (p = 0.008) was seen in insular damage types 2 and 3 compared with no or minimal insular involvement (types 0 and 1). Right-sided resections were associated with increase in IF power (p = 0.010) and the LF/HF ratio (p = 0.017). Conclusions: This study indicates that insular resection may lead to autonomic function changes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evidence obtained from these studies indicate that HFOs mirror pathological network activity that may initiate and sustain ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. HFOs are observed in temporal lobe regions of epileptic animals during interictal periods but they also occur before seizure onset and during the ictal period, suggesting that they can pinpoint to the mechanisms of seizure generation. Accordingly, ripples and fast ripples predominate during two specific seizure onset patterns termed low-voltage fast and hypersynchronous, respectively. In this review we will: (i) summarize these experimental studies; (ii) consider the evolution of HFOs over time during epileptogenesis; (iii) address data obtained with optogenetic stimulating procedures both in vitro and in vivo, and (iv) take into account the impact of anti-epileptic drugs on HFOs. We expect these findings to contribute to understanding the neuronal mechanisms leading to ictogenesis and epileptogenesis thus leading to the development of mechanistically targeted anti-epileptic strategies.

Depending on the attendant conditions, walking patterns must be modified to optimally meet the demands of the task. Assessing neuromuscular control during dynamic conditions is methodologically highly challenging and prone to artifacts. Here we aim at assessing corticospinal involvement during different locomotor tasks using non-invasive surface electromyography. Activity in tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscles was monitored by electromyograms (EMGs) in 27 healthy volunteers (11 female) during regular walking, walking while engaged in simultaneous cognitive dual tasks, walking with partial visual restriction, and skilled, targeted locomotion. Whereas EMG intensity of the TA and GM was considerably altered while walking with partial visual restriction and during targeted locomotion, dual-task walking induced only minor changes in total EMG intensity compared to regular walking. Targeted walking resulted in enhanced EMG intensity of GM in the frequency range associated with Piper rhythm synchronies. Likewise, targeted walking induced enhanced EMG intensity of TA at the Piper rhythm frequency around heelstrike, but not during the swing phase. Our findings indicate task- and phase-dependent modulations of neuromuscular control in distal leg muscles during various locomotor conditions in healthy subjects. Enhanced EMG intensity in the Piper rhythm frequency during targeted walking points toward enforced corticospinal drive during challenging locomotor tasks. These findings indicate that comprehensive time-frequency EMG analysis is able to gauge cortical involvement during different movement programs in a non-invasive manner and might be used as complementary diagnostic tool to assess baseline integrity of the corticospinal tract and to monitor changes in corticospinal drive as induced by neurorehabilitation interventions or during disease progression.

This is specifically the case when processing resources decline with advancing adult age. Such decline likely affects the encoding of sentences into working memory, which constitutes the basis for successful comprehension. To assess age differences in encoding-related electrophysiological activity, we recorded the electroencephalogram from three age groups (24, 43, and 65 years). Using an auditory sentence comprehension task, age differences in encoding-related oscillatory power were examined with respect to the accuracy of the given response. That is, the difference in oscillatory power between correctly and incorrectly encoded sentences, yielding subsequent memory effects (SME), was compared across age groups. Across age groups, we observed an age-related SME inversion in the alpha band from a power decrease in younger adults to a power increase in older adults. We suggest that this SME inversion underlies age-related comprehension difficulties. With alpha being commonly linked to inhibitory processes, this shift may reflect a change in the cortical inhibition-disinhibition balance. A cortical disinhibition may imply enriched sentence encoding in younger adults. In contrast, resource limitations in older adults may necessitate an increase in cortical inhibition during sentence encoding to avoid an information overload. Overall, our findings tentatively suggest that age-related comprehension difficulties are associated with alterations to the electrophysiological dynamics subserving general higher cognitive functions.

Despite these advantages, MST has been rarely used to study network abnormalities in schizophrenia. An MST graph mapping a network structure is its simplification, therefore, it is important to verify whether the reconfigured network is significantly related to the behavioural dimensions of the clinical picture of schizophrenia. 35 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 35 matched healthy controls underwent an assessment of information processing speed, cognitive inter-trial variability modelled with ex-Gaussian distributional analysis of reaction times and resting-state EEG recordings to obtain frequency-specific functional connectivity matrices from which MST graphs were computed. The patients' network had a more random structure and star-like arrangement with overloaded hubs positioned more posteriorly than it was in the case of the control group. Deficient processing speed in the group of patients was predicted by increased maximal betweenness centrality in beta and gamma bands, while decreased consistency in cognitive processing was predicted by the betweenness centrality of posterior nodes in the gamma band, together with duration of illness. The betweenness centrality of posterior nodes in the gamma band was also significantly correlated with positive psychotic symptoms in the clinical group.

Early Electrophysiological Disintegration of Hippocampal Neural Networks in a Novel Locus Coeruleus Tau-Seeding Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; ANIMAL-MODELS; PROTEIN-TAU; BRAIN	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of synapses and disrupted functional connectivity (FC) across different brain regions. Early in AD progression, tau pathology is found in the locus coeruleus (LC) prior to amyloid-induced exacerbation of clinical symptoms. Here, a tau-seeding model in which preformed synthetic tau fibrils (K18) were unilaterally injected into the LC of P301L mice, equipped with multichannel electrodes for recording EEG in frontal cortical and CA1-CA3 hippocampal areas, was used to longitudinally quantify over 20 weeks of functional network dynamics in (1) power spectra; (2) FC using intra- and intersite phase-amplitude theta-gamma coupling (PAC); (3) coherence, partial coherence, and global coherent network efficiency (Eglob) estimates; and (4) the directionality of functional connectivity using extended partial direct coherence (PDC). A sustained leftward shift in the theta peak frequency was found early in the power spectra of hippocampal CA1 networks ipsilateral to the injection site. Strikingly, hippocampal CA1 coherence and Eglob measures were impaired in K18-treated animals. Estimation of instantaneous EEG amplitudes revealed deficiency in the propagation directionality of gamma oscillations in the CA1 circuit. Impaired PAC strength evidenced by decreased modulation of the theta frequency phase on gamma frequency amplitude further confirms impairments of the neural CA1 network. The present results demonstrate early dysfunctional hippocampal networks, despite no spreading tau pathology to the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The ability of the K18 seed in the brainstem LC to elicit such robust functional alterations in distant hippocampal structures in the absence of pathology challenges the classic view that tau pathology spread to an area is necessary to elicit functional impairments in that area.

Here, we evaluated the neurophysiological effectiveness of direct brain control of robotic exoskeleton that provides movement support contingent with brain activity. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neurofeedback intervention, we assessed resting-state functional connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI) between the ipsilesional sensory and motor cortices before and after a single 1-h intervention. Eighteen stroke patients were randomly assigned to crossover interventions in a doubleblind and sham-controlled design. One patient dropped out midway through the study, and 17 patients were included in this analysis. Interventions involved motor imagery, robotic assistance, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation administered to a paretic finger. The neurofeedback intervention delivered stimulations contingent on desynchronized ipsilesional electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations during imagined movement, and the control intervention delivered sensorimotor stimulations that were independent of EEG oscillations. There was a significant time x intervention interaction in rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex. Post-hoc analysis showed a larger gain in increased functional connectivity during the neurofeedback intervention. Although the neurofeedback intervention delivered fewer total sensorimotor stimulations compared to the sham-control, rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices was increased during the neurofeedback intervention compared to the sham-control. Higher coactivation of the sensory and motor cortices during neurofeedback intervention enhanced rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices. This study showed neurophysiological evidence that EEG-contingent neurofeedback is a promising strategy to induce intrinsic ipsilesional sensorimotor reorganization, supporting the importance of integrating closed-loop sensorimotor processing at a neurophysiological level.

In psychiatric conditions, such as psychosis, these processes are altered. Interestingly, REM sleep where most dreams occurs, shares electrophysiological, pharmacological, and neurochemical features with psychosis. Because of this fact, REM sleep is considered a natural model of psychosis. Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that at sub-anesthetic dose induces psychotomimetic-like effects in humans and animals, and is employed as a pharmacological model of psychosis. Oscillations in the gamma frequency band of the electroencephalogram (EEG), mainly at about 40 Hz, have been involved in cognitive functions. Hence, the present study was conducted to analyze the EEG low gamma (30-45 Hz) band power and coherence of the cat, in natural (REM sleep) and pharmacological (sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine) models of psychosis. These results were compared with the gamma activity during alert (AW) and quiet wakefulness (OW), as well as during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Five cats were chronically prepared for polysomnographic recordings, with electrodes in different cortical areas. Basal recordings were obtained and ketamine (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg, i.m.) was administrated. Gamma activity (power and coherence) was analyzed in the abovementioned conditions. Compared to wakefulness and NREM sleep, following ketamine administration gamma coherence decreased among all cortical regions studied; the same coherence profile was observed during REM sleep. On the contrary, gamma power was relatively high under ketamine, and similar to OW and REM sleep. We conclude that functional interactions between cortical areas in the gamma frequency band decrease in both experimental models of psychosis. This uncoupling of gamma frequency activity may be involved in the cognitive features shared by dreaming and psychosis.

Thus, we have used three cases where people face three different types of physical interaction with a neutral person, Nadine social robot and the person on which Nadine was modelled, Professor Nadia Thalmann. To support our research, we have used EEG recordings to capture the physiological signals derived from the brain during each interaction, audio recordings to compare speech features and a questionnaire to provide psychometric data that can complement the above. Our results mainly showed the existence of frontal theta oscillations while interacting with the humanoid that probably shows the higher cognitive effort of the participants, as well as differences in the occipital area of the brain and thus, the visual attention mechanisms. The level of concentration and motivation of participants while interacting with the robot were higher indicating also higher amount of interest. The outcome of this experiment can broaden the field of human-robot interaction, leading to more efficient, meaningful and natural human-robot interaction.

Ternary meter from spatial sounds: Differences in neural entrainment between musicians and non-musicians	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Beat perception; Meter induction; Spatial audition; EEG; Frequency-tagging	INTERAURAL TIME; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; PERCEPTION; RHYTHM; REPRESENTATION; LOCALIZATION; DOMINANCE; ATTENTION; RESPONSES	The present study explores the relationship between the rhythmic structure of music and the spatial dimension of sound. We study how the brain interacts with spatially-separated sounds to build up a metrical structure. Participants listened to sequences of isochronous sounds that came from different positions on the azimuth plane: 0 degrees (control condition), +/- 30 degrees, +/- 60 degrees or +/- 90 degrees (spatial conditions). Ternary meter was signaled by the alternation of one sound on one side and two sounds on the symmetrical side. In Experiment 1, musicians and non-musicians paid attention to the spatial sounds. In Experiment 2, participants paid attention to a visual distractor. We recorded their electroencephalograms and performed frequency-tagging analyses. In both experiments, the isochronous beat elicited steady-state evoked-potentials at the frequency of the beat (2.4 Hz). While in Experiment 1 the alternation produced clear responses at the frequency of the ternary meter (0.8 Hz), in Experiment 2 these responses were only significant in the Spatial 90 degrees condition, and mainly in musicians. This suggests that top-down attentional mechanisms are in play for meter induction. Besides, musicians showed stronger responses to beat and meter than non-musicians, suggesting that formal musical training enhances the neural entrainment to spatially-defined rhythms.

Musical rhythm perception typically involves two steps: beat extraction and metrical structure assignment (meter perception). The entrainment theories propose that different neuronal oscillations entrain to different levels of metrical structure in the rhythm (e.g., beat and meter) and thereby form a representation of the rhythm in the mind. Thus, neuronal populations that entrain to beat and meter should theoretically be different. However, although entrainment theories have been supported by many studies, the neuronal populations that entrain to beat and meter remain largely unknown. In this study, we used a paradigm to induce neuronal entrainment to beat and meter and obtained images of the neuronal populations with an electroencephalogram functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) fusion method. We observed that some neuronal populations, including the bilateral putamen, bilateral caudate, left thalamus, and supplementary motor area (SMA), entrain to both beat and meter. We also observed that the bilateral putamen entrains more to meter and the SMA entrains more to beat. Our results suggest that the bilateral putamen plays an important role in meter perception.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the medical records of epilepsy outpatients was done. Patients with epilepsy, MCD, and >= 18 years of age were included and classified according to the Barkovich classification (BC). Results: The files of 2027 patients were assessed, and 17 out of 1395 epilepsy patients who were followed-up were found to have MCD. The mean age was 26.5 years. Ten patients were male and 7 were female. The mean time of seizure onset was 13 years. In terms of seizure type, 11 patients had focal, 10 had generalized tonic-clonic, 1 had absence, 1 had tonic-atonic, and 1 had myoclonic. MRI showed 7 patients with cortical dysplasia, 4 with heterotopia, 2 with periventricular nodular heterotopia, 2 with schiezencephaly, 2 with lissencephaly, 1 with agyria, 1 with pachygyria, 1 with macrogyria, 1 with polymicrogyria, and 1 with tuberous sclerosis. EEG revealed focal epileptiform discharges in 5 patients, high-frequency activity in 2, generalized epileptiform discharge in 1, diffuse disorganized background activity in 1, and focal disorganized background activity in 1. EEG was normal in 7 patients. Four of them were on monotherapy and 13 on polytherapy. Conclusion: The MCDs classified in group 1 and 2 according to BC are more frequent. Treatment-resistant or good responsive cases can be seen and seizures can begin at any age. We concluded that the prevalence of MCD is 1.21%.The spectrum of epilepsy seen is extensive and the most common type of MCD is focal cortical dysplasia.

EEG was recorded from pairs of participants who performed coordinated actions that could result in different postural configurations. To isolate individual and joint action planning processes, a pre-cue specified in advance the individual actions and/or the joint configuration. Participants had 1200 ms to prepare their actions. Then a Go cue specified all action parameters and participants performed a synchronized action as quickly as possible. Action onsets were shorter when the pre-cue specified the joint configuration, regardless of whether individual action was also specified. EEG analyses showed that specifying joint action parameters in advance reduced ambiguity in a structured joint action plan (reflected in the decrease of the amplitude of the P600) and helped with representing action goals and interpersonal coordination patterns in sensorimotor brain areas (reflected in increased alpha/mu suppression and CNV amplitudes). These results provide clear evidence that joint action is driven not only by action plans that specify individual contributions, but also by action plans that specify joint action outcomes at the group level.

To this end, electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) and a behavioral recall test were used to address speech perception while processing pieces of information conveyed in a single- or mixed-language speech carrier. Measurements of spectral power in the continuous EEG signal accompanying perception of speech were directly compared between conditions. The direction of the switch was also assessed. Our principal finding was a reduced oscillatory power in the beta frequencies when bilinguals are attentively listening to informative speech streams in which the two known languages are intermixed. The memory recall test showed equivalent performance across the different language conditions. These results suggest that the cognitive cost of processing speech containing inter-sentential language switches is reflected at a neural level but that it has no measurable impact on the recall of long steams of information. Listening speech in which the two languages known to a bilingual are mixed at a sentence level, may have no clear behavioral drawback, but implies some neural processing cost.

Executive control processes, in particular the reallocation of attentional resources, are crucial for coping with interruptions. Although the age-related decline in cognitive control functions is well described, the consequences of such changes for the ability to deal with interruptions are as of yet unclear. In the present study, we examined behavioral performance as well as electrophysiological parameters associated with executive control processes in older and younger participants using a nested task design: In one third of all trials, an ongoing working memory task was interrupted by a math task. We found that the impact of interruptions on primary task performance was more severe in the older age group. In the EEG, older adults showed stronger frontal midline theta activation and fronto-parietal connectivity in the theta range in response to the cue indicating the relevant attentional set. Younger participants, on the other hand, showed distinct and specific increases in cognitive control as indexed by frontal midline theta in response to the stimulus signaling an upcoming interruption. Overall, the results reveal strategic differences between the age groups, as older participants seem to prioritize the primary task more strongly. The data furthermore indicate that the combination of a rapid succession of events and the decreased ability to shift executive resources renders older adults' performance particularly vulnerable to the occurrence of interruptions.

The Cognitive Demands of Gait Retraining in Runners: An EEG Study	JOURNAL OF MOTOR BEHAVIOR			English	Article						cognitive load; gait; learning; mobile brain; body imaging (MoBI)	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; STRESS-FRACTURES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; TREADMILL WALKING; DISTANCE RUNNERS; INJURIES; INHIBITION; SYNCHRONIZATION; INCREASES; PREMOTOR	High impact forces during running have been associated with tibial stress injuries. Previous research has demonstrated increasing step rate will decrease impact forces during running. However, no research has determined the cognitive demand of gait retraining. The primary purpose was to determine the cognitive demand and effectiveness of field-based gait retraining. We hypothesized that in-field gait retraining would alter running mechanics without increasing cognitive workload as measured by EEG following learning. Runners with a history of tibial injury completed a gait retraining protocol which included a baseline run, retraining phase, practice phase, and re-assessment following retraining protocol. Results demonstrated an increase in the theta, beta, and gamma power within prefrontal cortex during new learning and corresponding return to baseline following skill acquisition and changes across alpha, beta, gamma, mu, and theta in the motor cortex (p < .05). In the midline superior parietal cortex, spectral power was greater for theta activity during new learning with a corresponding alpha suppression. Overall, the results demonstrated the use of EEG as an effective tool to measure cognitive demand for implicit motor learning and the effectiveness of in-field gait retraining.
