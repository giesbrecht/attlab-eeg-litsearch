The aim of the present study was to describe and compare the brain electrical activity pattern of chess players in two different situations under time pressure to make the move rapid, 15 min, plus 10 s additional time per move and lightning, a one-minute game. Thus, lightning game offers an appropriate environment to isolate memory chunks and rapid game will offer the perspective of a working memory task. Encephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained while a total of 14 male chess players (age: 35.36 +/- 13.77 and ELO: 1921.07 +/- 170.67) played lightning and rapid chess games. Results indicate that different activity patterns between the rapid and the lightning games were found. Increments in theta power during lightning game in posterior regions could indicate that theta power might be related with chunks retrieval. Moreover, right hemisphere is more activated in chess games, probably caused by visuospatial processing. These brain patterns characterizations could be useful for chess training or clinicians in the field of neuroscience.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry studies have implicated asymmetric cortical activation, especially in frontal cortex, in approach-withdrawal motivation. In this study, we examined the relationship between the CAR and lateralized cortical activity under rest in 55 university male students. Saliva samples were collected at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min after awakening on the two consecutive workdays. The lateralized cortical activity at frontocentral sites was examined by alpha asymmetry score. The results showed that a higher CAR was positively associated with alpha asymmetry score, which indicated that the higher CAR is linked with more left-sided cortical activity at frontocentral sites under resting state. This association still existed even after controlling psychological and sleep quality variables. These results suggested that appropriately mobilizing energy resource storage after awakening revealed as CAR might be associated with goal-directed approach tendencies before any eventual stressful situation, characteristic of more left than right resting-state frontocentral cortical activity.

Reduced Theta Power During Memory Retrieval in Depressed Adults	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Depression; EEG; Memory; Retrieval; Theta; Time frequency	EPISODIC MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS; BRAIN NETWORKS; DEFAULT-MODE; GAMMA-BAND; RECOLLECTION; RECOGNITION; OSCILLATIONS; FAMILIARITY	BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with poor recollection, but the neural mechanisms responsible for this deficit are unclear. Recollection is supported by interactions between the hippocampus and cortex that appear to be mediated by oscillatory activity in the theta band (4-7 Hz) and that are elicited during source memory retrieval. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that evoked theta power during source memory retrieval would be reduced in MDD, as this would provide a physiological basis for deficient recollection in adults with depression. METHODS: Morlet wavelets were applied to event-related potentials collected from 24 unmedicated adults with MDD and 24 healthy control adults during the retrieval of source and semantic memories. Whole-scalp analyses focused on group differences in evoked theta power. RESULTS: There were no group differences in behavior. Nevertheless, from 400 to 799 ms, theta power was broadly reduced in adults with depression versus healthy adults. This reduction was observed during source and semantic retrieval. Parietal midline electrodes showed significantly reduced theta power during source-but not semantic-retrieval in adults with depression versus healthy adults in this interval. Furthermore, theta power over parietal midline sites from 400 to 799 ms was more strongly related to source memory accuracy in healthy adults versus adults with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to healthy control adults, adults with depression showed reduced theta power during memory retrieval and a weaker relationship between parietal midline theta power and source memory accuracy. These findings indicate that abnormal theta signals may contribute to memory deficits in adults with MDD.

Brain hypoxia is believed to be the main but not the single etiology of post CPR cognitive impairment. Theta and lower theta waves of the EEG have essential role in proper functioning of the memory performance. Both endotracheal incubation and atropine administration in CPR process can abolish these waves. We hypothesize that CI in CPR survivors can be caused by disturbance in aforementioned waves due to endotracheal intubation and atropine administration.

Instead, we show that individuals implement decision bias by shifting the rate of sensory evidence accumulation toward a decision bound. Participants performed a target detection task while we recorded EEG. We experimentally manipulated participants' decision criterion for reporting targets using different stimulus-response reward contingencies, inducing either a liberal or a conservative bias. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that a liberal strategy biased sensory evidence accumulation toward target-present choices. Moreover, a liberal bias resulted in stronger midfrontal pre-stimulus 2-6 Hz (theta) power and suppression of pre-stimulus 8-12 Hz (alpha) power in posterior cortex. Alpha suppression in turn was linked to the output activity in visual cortex, as expressed through 59-100 Hz (gamma) power. These findings show that observers can intentionally control cortical excitability to strategically bias evidence accumulation toward the decision bound that maximizes reward.

This study offered an alternative to overcome all the limitations provided by the conventional system to detect sleepiness based on the driver's brain electrical activity using wearable electroencephalogram (EEG), which is lighter and easy to use. The EEG signals were collected using EMOTIV Epoc + and then were decomposed into narrowband frequency, such as delta, theta, alpha, and beta using DWT. The relative power, as the result of feature extraction, then were processed further by calculating its variance using the common spatial pattern (CSP) method to optimize the accuracy of extreme learning machine (ELM). Comparison of relative power between awake and drowsy state showed that during the drowsy state, theta-wave, alpha-wave, and beta-wave were tend to be higher than in the awake state. However, despite with the help of ELM, the accuracy was not too high (below 87%). The feature extraction which continued by calculating its variance using CSP algorithm before classified by ELM obtained a high accuracy, even with small amount of data training. This showed that CSP combining with ELM could be useful to shorten the time in training/calibration session, yet still, obtained high accuracy in classifying the awake state and drowsy state. The overall average accuracy of testing ranged from 91.67% to 93.75%. This study could increase the ability of EEG in detecting drowsiness that is important to prevent the risk caused by driving in a drowsy state.

Human observers typically arbitrate between integration and segregation consistent with Bayesian Causal Inference, but the neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we presented people with audiovisual sequences that varied in the number of flashes and beeps, then combined Bayesian modelling and EEG representational similarity analyses. Our data suggest that the brain initially represents the number of flashes and beeps independently. Later, it computes their numbers by averaging the forced-fusion and segregation estimates weighted by the probabilities of common and independent cause models (i.e. model averaging). Crucially, prestimulus oscillatory alpha power and phase correlate with observers' prior beliefs about the world's causal structure that guide their arbitration between sensory integration and segregation.

J	Bricker, AM				Bricker, Adam Michael			Neural phase: a new problem for the modal account of epistemic luck	SYNTHESE			English	Article						Veritic luck; Knowledge; Epistemology; EEG; Visual detection; Perception		One of the most widely recognised intuitions about knowledge is that knowing precludes believing truly as a matter of luck. On Pritchard's highly influential modal account of epistemic luck, luckily true beliefs are, roughly, those for which there are many close possible worlds in which the same belief formed in the same way is false. My aim is to introduce a new challenge to this account. Starting from the observation-as documented by a number of recent EEG studies-that our capacity to detect visual stimuli fluctuates with the phase of our neural oscillations, I argue that there can be very close possible worlds in which an actual-world detectable stimulus is undetectable. However, this doesn't diminish our willingness to attribute knowledge in the case that the stimulus is detectable, even when undetectability would result in the same belief formed in the same way being false. As I will argue at length, the modal account appears unable to accommodate this result.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of deepening levels of sedation induced by propofol and how they compare to natural sleep. Methods: Fifty consecutive neurologically normal patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy while sedated with propofol were included. Topographic EEG spectral maps and the bispectral index (BIS) values were obtained at four time points: wakefulness, mild sedation, deep sedation and recovery. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Results: Propofol induced increased delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and gamma (25-40 Hz) power throughout sedation. In addition, there was decreased alpha power (9-11.5 Hz) in the occipital area and increased global beta (12-25 Hz)/gamma (25-40 Hz) power during mild sedation. Deep sedation was associated with increased theta (4-7 Hz)/alpha (9-11.5 Hz)/beta (12-25 Hz) power, which was maximal frontally. Conclusion: There are distinct changes associated with deepening levels of propofol induced sedation that distinguish it from natural sleep.

Load modulates the alpha and beta oscillatory dynamics serving verbal working memory	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Oscillation; Encoding; Maintenance; Theta	HUMAN BRAIN; N-BACK; NEURONAL DYNAMICS; VISUAL PATHWAYS; EEG-THETA; ATTENTION; MAINTENANCE; SIGNAL; LATERALIZATION; ACTIVATION	A network of predominantly left-lateralized brain regions has been linked to verbal working memory (VWM) performance. However, the impact of memory load on the oscillatory dynamics serving VWM is far less understood. To further investigate this, we had 26 healthy adults perform a high-load (6 letter) and low-load (4 letter) variant of a VWM task while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG data were evaluated in the time-frequency domain and significant oscillatory responses spanning the encoding and maintenance phases were reconstructed using a beamformer. To determine the impact of load on the neural dynamics, the resulting images were examined using paired-samples t-tests and virtual sensor analyses. Our results indicated stronger increases in frontal theta activity in the high- relative to low-load condition during early encoding. Stronger decreases in alpha/beta activity were also observed during encoding in bilateral posterior cortices during the high-load condition, and the strength of these load effects increased as encoding progressed. During maintenance, stronger decreases in alpha activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and inferior parietal cortices were detected during high- relative to low-load performance, with the strength of these load effects remaining largely static throughout maintenance. Finally, stronger increases in occipital alpha activity were observed during maintenance in the high- load condition, and the strength of these effects grew stronger with time during the first half of maintenance, before dissipating during the latter half of maintenance. Notably, this was the first study to utilize a whole-brain approach to statistically evaluate the temporal dynamics of load-related oscillatory differences during encoding and maintenance processes, and our results highlight the importance of spatial, temporal, and spectral specificity in this regard.

A Long Short-Term Memory neural network for the detection of epileptiform spikes and high frequency oscillations	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HZ	Over the last two decades, the evidence has been growing that in addition to epileptic spikes high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are important biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue. New methods of artificial intelligence such as deep learning neural networks can provide additional tools for automated analysis of EEG. Here we present a Long Short-Term Memory neural network for detection of spikes, ripples and ripples-on-spikes (RonS). We used intracranial EEG (iEEG) from two independent datasets. First dataset (7 patients) was used for network training and testing. The second dataset (5 patients) was used for cross-institutional validation. 1000 events of each class (spike, RonS, ripple and baseline) were selected from the candidates initially found using a novel threshold method. Network training was performed using random selections of 50-500 events (per class) from all patients from the 1st dataset. This 'global' network was then tested on other events for each patient from both datasets. The network was able to detect events with a good generalisability namely, with total accuracy and specificity for each class exceeding 90% in all cases, and sensitivity less than 86% in only two cases (82.5% for spikes in one patient and 81.9% for ripples in another patient). The deep learning networks can significantly accelerate the analysis of iEEG data and increase their diagnostic value which may improve surgical outcome in patients with localization-related intractable epilepsy.

In this paper stress and relaxation of brain is identified from the activation of alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) EEG bands depending on their power spectral density (PSD). Stress occurs due to sustained mental task in a test (Bengali, English, Math) environment and the work has been performed in to Reading, Writing and Mathematical problem-solving stages. When beta/alpha power ratio is 1.5 or more it indicates stress. The relaxation of the brain is estimated taking the PSD at different time interval after the brain activity and when the beta/alpha ratio returns to the value of relax state then it is determined that relaxation is obtained. Finally brain relaxation is modeled with mathematical formulation based on beta/alpha power ratio.

A first step for this would be to predict on the task difficulty level. While this is possible through subjective questionnaire, it could lead to misleading outcome and it would be better to do this by tapping the actual thought process in the brain while the subject is performing the task, which can be done using electroencephalogram. We set out on this objective and show that it is possible to predict easy and difficult levels of mental tasks when subjects are attempting to solve Java programming problems. Using a proposed confidence threshold, we obtained a classification performance of 87.05% thereby showing that it is possible to use brain data to determine the teaching material difficulty level which will be useful in educational environments.

However, few studies focused on the neuronal oscillatory coupling between neuronal assembles during face perception. In this study, we investigated the neuronal oscillatory coupling when human was in a face/non-face perceptual task. Nine normal individuals were included in the study, electro-encephalogram (EEG) was recorded and the phase lagged index (PLI) was used to assess the neuronal oscillatory coupling. Compared with non-face stimuli, for face stimuli, enhanced neuronal oscillatory coupling was observed in theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) band over the left frontal region, in gamma1 (30-49 Hz) band over the left posterior and occipito-temporal regions, and in gamma2 (51-75 Hz) over the right temporal region. The results suggested that more top-down control process and information integration were included during face perception than non-face perception.

Recently, a growing number of studies suggest that attention is implemented through a temporal organization process during which resources are dynamically allocated over a multitude of objects, yet the associated neural evidence, particularly in low-level sensory areas, is still limited. Here we used EEG recordings in combination with a temporal response function (TRF) approach to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of neuronal impulse response in covert selective attention. We demonstrate two distinct alpha-band components - one in post-central parietal area and one in contralateral occipital area - that are involved in coordinating neural representations of attended and unattended stimuli. Specifically, consistent with previous findings, the central alpha-band component showed enhanced activities for unattended versus attended stimuli within the first 200 ms temporal lag of TRF response, suggesting its inhibitory function in attention. In contrast, the contralateral occipital component displayed relatively earlier activation for the attended than unattended one in the TRF response. Furthermore, the central component but not the occipital component was correlated with attentional behavioral performance. Finally, the parietal area exerted directional influences on the occipital activity through alpha-band rhythm. Taken together, spatial attention involves two hierarchically organized alpha-band components that are associated with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics and presumably play different functions.

In this study, we addressed the question if and how preparing to ignore an anticipated distractor differs from preparing for an anticipated target. We measured EEG while participants memorized a laterally presented color, which was cued to be either a target or a distractor in two subsequent visual search tasks. Decoding the location of items in the search display from EOG channels revealed that, initially, the anticipated distractor attracted attention and could only be ignored later during the trial. This suggests that distractors could not be suppressed in advance but were represented in an active, attention-guiding format. Consistent with this, lateralized posterior alpha power did not dissociate between target and distractor templates during the delay periods, suggesting similar encoding and maintenance. However, distractor preparation did lead to relatively enhanced nonlateralized posterior alpha power, which appeared to gate sensory processing at search display onset to prevent attentional capture in general. Finally, anticipating distractors also led to enhanced midfrontal theta power during the delay period, a signal that was predictive of how strongly both target and distractor were represented in the search display. Together, our results speak against a distractor-specific advance inhibitory template, thus contrary to the preactivation of specific target templates. Rather, we demonstrate a general selection suppression mechanism, which serves to prevent initial involuntary capture by anticipated distracting input.	[de Vries, Ingmar E.

This study aimed at investigating the beat-to-beat influence of the brain cortex over the heart through a high temporal resolution estimation of brain-heart coupling. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) from 32 scalp positions were recorded at rest for 5 min in 38 participants. To assess beat-to-beat cortical control on vagal activity, the longest and shortest inter-beat intervals (IBIs) were identified for each participant. Then, the EEG activity was time-locked to R waves in the ECG signal and analyzed using a time-frequency approach. Logistic regression models were applied to predict the trial-by-trial occurrence of long and short IBIs from cardiac-related EEG activity. Delta power reduction over prefrontal and frontocentral areas preceding the R-wave increased the probability for a long IBI to occur, as compared to a short one. Moreover, reduced prefrontal delta power preceding the R wave was correlated to higher cardiac vagal control, as reflected by the High Frequency (HF) power of HRV calculated on the whole recording time.

However, similar to 20-50% of cases have intractable seizures post-surgery due to the imprecise determination of epileptogenic zone. Recent intracranial studies suggest that high frequency oscillations between 80 and 200 Hz could serve as one of the consistent epileptogenicity biomarkers for localization of the epileptogenic zone. However, these high frequency oscillations are not adopted in the clinical setting because of difficult non-invasive detection. Here, we investigated non-invasive detection and localization of high frequency oscillations and its clinical utility in accurate pre-surgical assessment and post-surgical outcome prediction. We prospectively recruited 52 patients with medically refractory epilepsy who underwent standard pre-surgical workup including magnetoencephalography (MEG) followed by resective surgery after determination of the epileptogenic zone. The post-surgical outcome was assessed after 22.14 +/- 10.05 months. Interictal epileptic spikes were expertly identified, and interictal epileptic oscillations across the neural activity frequency spectrum from 8 to 200 Hz were localized using adaptive spatial filtering methods. Localization results were compared with epileptogenic zone and resected cortex for congruence assessment and validated against the clinical outcome. The concordance rate of high frequency oscillations sources (80-200 Hz) with the presumed epileptogenic zone and the resected cortex were 75.0% and 78.8%, respectively, which is superior to that of other frequency bands and standard dipole fitting methods. High frequency oscillation sources corresponding with the resected cortex, had the best sensitivity of 78.0%, positive predictive value of 100% and an accuracy of 78.84% to predict the patient's surgical outcome, among all other frequency bands. If high frequency oscillation sources were spatially congruent with resected cortex, patients had an odds ratio of 5.67 and 82.4% probability of achieving a favourable surgical outcome. If high frequency oscillations sources were discordant with the epileptogenic zone or resection area, patient has an odds ratio of 0.18 and only 14.3% probability of achieving good outcome, and mostly tended to have an unfavourable outcome (chi(2) = 5.22; P = 0.02; = -0.317). In receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, only sources of high-frequency oscillations demonstrated the best sensitivity and specificity profile in determining the patient's surgical outcome with area under the curve of 0.76, whereas other frequency bands indicate a poor predictive performance. Our study is the first non-invasive study to detect high frequency oscillations, address the efficacy of high frequency oscillations over the different neural oscillatory frequencies, localize them and clinically validate them with the post-surgical outcome in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The evidence presented in the current study supports the fact that HFOs might significantly improve the presurgical assessment, and post-surgical outcome prediction, where it could widely be used in a clinical setting as a non-invasive biomarker.

For this purpose, a novel approach that brings reorganization in acquired task-functional magnetic resonance imaging information based on hemodynamic characteristics of every task stimulus is proposed and validated. At first, modulations in functional networks of visual target detection task were estimated at every voxel through proposed methodology. It revealed task stimulus dependency in the modulation of default mode network (DMN). The DMN modulated as task negative network (TNN) during target stimulus. On the contrary, it was not entirely TNN during nontarget stimulus. The frontal-parietal and visual networks modulated as task positive network during both task stimuli. Further, modulations of neurovascular underpinnings associated with engagement of task were estimated by correlating the hemodynamically reorganized task blood oxygen level dependent information with simultaneously acquired electroencephalography frequency powers. It revealed the strong association of neurovascular underpinnings with their modulation of functional networks and the associated neuronal activity during task engagement. Finally, graph theoretical parameters such as local, global efficiency and clustering coefficient were also measured at the specific regions for validating the results of proposed method. Modulation observed in graph theory measures clearly validated the activation and deactivation of functional networks observed by the proposed method during task engagement. Thus, the voxel-wise estimation of task-related modulation of functional networks and associated neurovascular underpinnings through proposed technique provide better insights into neuronal mechanism involved during engagement in a task.

Theta Modulated Neural Phase Coherence Facilitates Speech Fluency in Adults Who Stutter	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neural communication; speech; phase coherence; motor control; stuttering	SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; EEG; COMMUNICATION; TRANSIENT; DYNAMICS; CHILDREN; NETWORK	Adults who stutter (AWS) display altered patterns of neural phase coherence within the speech motor system preceding disfluencies. These altered patterns may distinguish fluent speech episodes from disfluent ones. Phase coherence is relevant to the study of stuttering because it reflects neural communication within brain networks. In this follow-up study, the oscillatory cortical dynamics preceding fluent speech in AWS and adults who do not stutter (AWNS) were examined during a single-word delayed reading task using electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. Compared to AWNS, fluent speech preparation in AWS was characterized by a decrease in theta-gamma phase coherence and a corresponding increase in theta-beta coherence level. Higher spectral powers in the beta and gamma bands were also observed preceding fluent utterances by AWS. Overall, there was altered neural communication during speech planning in AWS that provides novel evidence for atypical allocation of feedforward control by AWS even before fluent utterances.

Effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate on neurophysiological correlates of performance and conflict monitoring	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Gamma-hydroxybutryrate; GHB; Error processing; Performance monitoring; Conflict monitoring; EEG	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; DOPAMINE; FMRI; GHB; PHARMACOKINETICS; PHARMACODYNAMICS; NEURONS; DRUG	Performance and conflict monitoring (PM and CM) represent two essential cognitive abilities, required to respond appropriately to demanding tasks. PM and CM can be investigated using event-related brain potentials (ERP) and associated neural oscillations. Namely, the error-related negativity (ERN) represents a correlate of PM, whereas the N2 component reflects the process of CM. Both ERPs originate in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and PM specifically has been shown to be susceptible to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor activation. Contrarily, the specific effects of GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R) stimulation on PM and CM are unknown. Thus, the effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB; 20 and 35 mg/kg), a predominant GABA(B)R agonist, on behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of PM and CM were here assessed in 15 healthy male volunteers, using the Eriksen-Flanker paradigm in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were analyzed in the time and time-frequency domains. GHB prolonged reaction times, without affecting error rates or post-error slowing. Moreover, GHB decreased ERN amplitudes and associated neural oscillations in the theta/alpha1 range. Similarly, neural oscillations associated with the N2 were reduced in the theta/alpha1 range, while N2 amplitude was conversely increased. Hence, GHB shows a dissociating effect on electrophysiological correlates of PM and CM. Reduced ERN likely derives from a GABA(B)R-mediated increase in dopaminergic signaling, disrupting the generation of prediction errors, whereas an enhanced N2 suggests an increased susceptibility towards external stimuli. Conclusively, GHB is the first drug reported, thus far, to have opposite effects on PM and CM, underlined by its unique electrophysiological signature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

In this respect, we have tested the therapeutic effect of occipital lobe oriented rTMS application and its electrophysiological correlates that led to significant improvement in the hallucinatory symptomatology of the patient after two weeks. We have revealed that the improved hallucinatory symptoms after rTMS application resolved completely after switching from the pramipexole treatment to L-Dopa indicating that there could be a combined therapeutic effect of L-Dopa and rTMS. Furthermore, Quantitative-Electroencephalography analysis has shown that the therapeutic effects of rTMS and L-Dopa were seen with the improvement of impaired gamma power spectrum. Although the main limitation of this report is that this a single case study and that these findings need to be replicated in a larger sample, e.g., as part of a controlled trial, our present findings help us to enlighten the unknown pathophysiological overlapping between the visual hallucinations in PD and Charles Bonnet Syndrome. Finally, our study revealed increased gamma coherence and power spectrum which is seen with visual hallucinations and improved after the application of 1 Hz rTMS on the occipital lobe. These findings together suggest that rTMS could be used as a therapeutic tool for parkinsonian complex VH and probably due affecting gamma coherence and power spectrum. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Decoding the tradeoff between encoding and retrieval to predict memory for overlapping events	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; MVPA; Episodic memory; Encoding; Retrieval; Subsequent memory effect	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; EPISODIC MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-STIMULATION; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; INFORMATION; FREQUENCY; STATES	When new events overlap with past events, there is a natural tradeoff between encoding the new event and retrieving the past event. Given the ubiquity of overlap among memories, this tradeoff between memory encoding and retrieval is of central importance to computational models of episodic memory (O'Reilly & McClelland 1994; Hasselmo 2005). However, prior studies have not directly linked neural markers of encoding/retrieval tradeoffs to behavioral measures of how overlapping events are remembered. Here, by decoding patterns of scalp electro-encephalography (EEG) from male and female human subjects, we show that tradeoffs between encoding and retrieval states are reflected in distributed patterns of neural activity and, critically, these neural tradeoffs predict how overlapping events will later be remembered. Namely, new events that overlapped with past events were more likely to be subsequently remembered if neural patterns were biased toward a memory encoding state-or, conversely, away from a retrieval state. Additionally, we show that neural markers of encoding vs. retrieval states are surprisingly independent from previously-described EEG predictors of subsequent memory. Instead, we demonstrate that previously-described EEG predictors of subsequent memory are better explained by task engagement than by memory encoding, per se. Collectively, our findings provide important insight into how the memory system balances memory encoding and retrieval states and, more generally, into the neural mechanisms that support successful memory formation.

Here, we investigated the presence and cortical distribution of negative delta (1-4 Hz) waves in human REM sleep by analyzing high-density EEG sleep recordings obtained in 28 healthy subjects. We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster characterized by similar to 2.5-3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called "sawtooth waves") that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a medialoccipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower (<2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found inNREMsleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part of REM sleep in humans and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. Sawtooth waves, which are exclusive to REM sleep, share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and may represent the human equivalent or a closely related event, whereas medial-occipital slow waves appear similar to NREM sleep slow waves.

However, engagement is a complex construct that, at the psychological level, has been mainly operationalised through indicators of attentional and emotional processes, often overlooking motivational factors. We claim that in the context of news consumption, motivation, operationalised as intrinsic interest for consuming a given content, needs to be factored in together with attentional and emotional processes. The present work provides an objective metric for motivation based on electroencephalographic (EEG) registration of users' neural activity, while they read sets of news pre-classified in terms of their potential interest. We focus on a metric that has been used as an indicator of the degree to which an item or event induces the motivation to approach or escape, the so called frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). Moreover, in addition to the traditional approach to the analysis of EEG signals, we also introduce a more novel technique based on estimating the entropy of the signals. Results confirm that FAA is indeed a good proxy for objective monitoring of interest in media contents and that entropy analysis, although its interpretation in terms of information processing warrants further investigation, is also sensitive to the manipulation of interest, providing results that complement traditional power spectrum analysis.

A dose-finding study of oxytocin using neurophysiological measures of social processing	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; NEUROPEPTIDES; PERCEPTION; PUPILLARY; RESPONSES; COGNITION; SPECTRUM	Recent interest has focused on oxytocin (OT), a neurotransmitter that promotes social processing, to improve social functioning in people with schizophrenia. However, little information is available regarding the doses of OT that are effective for influencing social processing in the brain (i.e., target engagement). In this study, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over dose ranging study of OT. In total 47 patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to one of eight doses of OT (8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, or 84 IU). Patients completed two social processing tasks: one electroencephalography (EEG) task, a biological motion Musuppression task (i.e., identifying the gender, emotion, or direction of walking of point-light animations of human movement); and one pupillometry task, pupil dilation in response to viewing affective faces. Participants completed these tasks twice, one week apart, and were randomly administered drug or placebo intranasally 30 min prior to each session. Mu-suppression, i.e., suppression of oscillations in the 8-12 Hz range over central electrodes in response to social stimuli, was significantly enhanced at doses of 36 and 48 IU in comparison to placebo, but not at other doses. Significant pupil dilation was observed in response to faces vs. non-face stimuli, though there were no drug effects at any dose. Results suggest that OT affects central measures of social information processing in patients with schizophrenia and is optimal at a mid-range dose (36-48 IU). These results provide dosing guidance for future studies of OT to be used to enhance social processing in people with schizophrenia.

However, there has been debate regarding the number of items that can be concurrently represented in this active neural state, which is often called the "focus of attention." Some models propose a strict single-item limit, such that just 1 item can be neurally active at once while other items are relegated to an activity-silent state. Although past studies have decoded multiple items stored in WM, these studies cannot rule out a switching account in which only a single item is actively represented at a time. Here, we directly tested whether multiple representations can be held concurrently in an active state. We tracked spatial representations inWM using alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity, which encodes spatial positions held in WM. Human observers remembered 1 or 2 positions over a short delay while we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data. Using a spatial encoding model, we reconstructed active stimulus-specific representations (channel-tuning functions [CTFs]) from the scalp distribution of alpha-band power. Consistent with past work, we found that the selectivity of spatial CTFs was lower when 2 items were stored than when 1 item was stored. Critically, data-driven simulations revealed that the selectivity of spatial representations in the two-item condition could not be explained by models that propose that only a single item can exist in an active state at once. Thus, our findings demonstrate that multiple items can be concurrently represented in an active neural state.	[Sutterer, David W.; Foster, Joshua J.; Adam, Kirsten C.

Early Heart Rate Variability and Electroencephalographic Abnormalities in Acutely Brain-Injured Children Who Progress to Brain Death	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						brain death; children; electroencephalogram; heart rate variability	POWER SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; INFANTS; GUIDELINES; FEATURES; UPDATE; TRAUMA; CARE; EEG; AGE	Objectives: Heart rate variability is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. After brain death, this autonomic control stops, and heart rate variability is significantly decreased. However, it is unknown if early changes in heart rate variability are predictive of progression to brain death. We hypothesized that in brain-injured children, lower heart rate variability is an early indicator of autonomic system failure, and it predicts progression to brain death. We additionally explored the association between heart rate variability and markers of brain dysfunction such as electroencephalogram and neurologic examination between brain-injured children who progressed to brain death and those who survived. Design: Retrospective case-control study. Setting: PICU, single institution. Patients: Children up to 18 years with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 8 admitted between August of 2016 and December of 2017, who had electrocardiographic data available for heart rate variability analysis, were included. Exclusion criteria: patients who died of causes other than brain death. Twenty-three patients met inclusion criteria: six progressed to brain death (cases), and 17 survived (controls). Five-minute electrocardiogram segments were used to estimate heart rate variability in the time domain (sd of normal-normal intervals, root mean square successive differences), frequency domain (low frequency, high frequency, low frequency/high frequency ratio), Poincare plots, and approximate entropy. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patients who progressed to brain death exhibited significantly lower heart rate variability in the time domain, frequency domain, and Poincare plots (p < 0.01). The odds of death increased with decreasing low frequency (odds ratio, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.2-13.6) and high frequency (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.4) heart rate variability power (p < 0.03). Heart rate variability was significantly lower in those with discontinuous or attenuated/featureless electroencephalogram versus those with slow/disorganized background (p < 0.03). Conclusions: These results support the concept of autonomic system failure as an early indicator of impending brain death in brain-injured children. Furthermore, decreased heart rate variability is associated with markers of CNS dysfunction such as electroencephalogram abnormalities.

Neurobiological mechanisms of TENS-induced analgesia	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS); Pain; Analgesia; Electroencephalography (EEG); Resting state; Human	ELECTRICAL NERVE-STIMULATION; CORTICAL FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; HIGH-FREQUENCY; INDUCED ANTIHYPERALGESIA; INHIBITORY CONTROLS; EXPERIMENTAL PAIN; BRAIN POTENTIALS; OPIOID RECEPTORS; CAUSAL RELATIONS	Pain inhibition by additional somatosensory input is the rationale for the widespread use of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to relieve pain. Two main types of TENS produce analgesia in animal models: high-frequency (similar to 50-100 Hz) and low-intensity 'conventional' TENS, and low-frequency (similar to 2-4 Hz) and high-intensity 'acupuncture-like' TENS. However, TENS efficacy in human participants is debated, raising the question of whether the analgesic mechanisms identified in animal models are valid in humans. Here, we used a sham-controlled experimental design to clarify the efficacy and the neurobiological effects of 'conventional' and 'acupuncture-like' TENS in 80 human volunteers. To test the analgesic effect of TENS we recorded the perceptual and brain responses elicited by radiant heat laser pulses that activate selectively A delta and C cutaneous nociceptors. To test whether TENS has a long-lasting effect on brain state we recorded spontaneous electrocortical oscillations. The analgesic effect of 'conventional' TENS was maximal when nociceptive stimuli were delivered homotopically, to the same hand that received the TENS. In contrast, 'acupuncture-like' TENS produced a spatially-diffuse analgesic effect, coupled with long-lasting changes both in the state of the primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) and in the functional connectivity between S1/M1 and the medial prefrontal cortex, a core region in the descending pain inhibitory system. These results demonstrate that 'conventional' and 'acupuncture-like' TENS have different analgesic effects, which are mediated by different neurobiological mechanisms.	[Peng, W.

Sci Transl Med. 2019;11(480). pii: eaan0457. doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.aan0457. Glucose is the ultimate substrate for most brain activities that use carbon, including synthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid via mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Brain metabolism and neuronal excitability are thus interdependent. However, the principles that govern their relationship are not always intuitive because heritable defects of brain glucose metabolism are associated with the paradoxical coexistence, in the same individual, of episodic neuronal hyperexcitation (seizures) with reduced basal cerebral electrical activity. One such prototypic disorder is pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency (PDHD). Pyruvate dehydrogenase is central to metabolism because it steers most of the glucose-derived flux into the TCA cycle. To better understand the pathophysiology of PDHD, we generated mice with brain-specific reduced PDH activity that paralleled salient human disease features, including cerebral hypotrophy, decreased amplitude electroencephalogram (EEG), and epilepsy. The mice exhibited reductions in cerebral TCA cycle flux, glutamate content, spontaneous, and electrically evoked in vivo cortical field potentials and gamma EEG oscillation amplitude. Episodic decreases in gamma oscillations preceded most epileptiform discharges, facilitating their prediction. Fast-spiking neuron excitability was decreased in brain slices, contributing to in vivo action potential burst prolongation after whisker pad stimulation. These features were partially reversed after systemic administration of acetate, which augmented cerebral TCA cycle flux, glutamate-dependent synaptic transmission, inhibition and gamma oscillations, and reduced epileptiform discharge duration. Thus, our results suggest that dysfunctional excitability in PDHD is consequent to reduced oxidative flux, which leads to decreased neuronal activation and impaired inhibition, and can be mitigated by an alternative metabolic substrate.

Besides the motor symptoms, tremor, and dysfunction of sensory systems. In the literature, there was limited studies which investigates the basic sensorial processing in PD. Therefore, we aimed to establish the sensorial processing of simple auditory stimulations in naive PD comparing to healthy controls (HC) via delta, theta, and alpha brain oscillatory responses. 12 naive PD and 12 HC participated to the study. Brain responses recorded via the 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system in an electromagnetically and acoustically isolated room. The auditory stimuli (1500 Hz, 60 dB SPL, 500 ms) were delivered to the subjects via a head-phone. The inter-stimulus interval was ranged between 2.5-4.5 s. The peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes were measured in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands on 11 electrodes (including the frontal, central and parietal areas) for the statistical analysis in which one-way ANOVA test was employed for the comparisons between PD and HC. For the delta oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in frontal, central and parietal areas in comparison with HC. For the theta and alpha oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in parietal areas in comparison with HC. As a result, amplitudes of brain oscillatory responses in PD group were significantly bigger than the HC. In this context, decreased inhibitory mechanisms of cortical auditory processing due to the dysfunction of the dopaminergic activity may lead the increased evoked responses in PD group.

Speech-specific audiovisual integration modulates induced theta-band oscillations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SEEING-VOICES; VISUAL SPEECH; HEARING-LIPS; EEG; COMPREHENSION; FACILITATION; PERCEPTION	Speech perception is influenced by vision through a process of audiovisual integration. This is demonstrated by the McGurk illusion where visual speech (for example /ga/) dubbed with incongruent auditory speech (such as /ba/) leads to a modified auditory percept (/da/). Recent studies have indicated that perception of the incongruent speech stimuli used in McGurk paradigms involves mechanisms of both general and audiovisual speech specific mismatch processing and that general mismatch processing modulates induced theta-band (4-8 Hz) oscillations. Here, we investigated whether the theta modulation merely reflects mismatch processing or, alternatively, audiovisual integration of speech. We used electroencephalographic recordings from two previously published studies using audiovisual sine-wave speech (SWS), a spectrally degraded speech signal sounding nonsensical to naive perceivers but perceived as speech by informed subjects. Earlier studies have shown that informed, but not naive subjects integrate SWS phonetically with visual speech. In an N1/P2 event-related potential paradigm, we found a significant difference in theta-band activity between informed and naive perceivers of audiovisual speech, suggesting that audiovisual integration modulates induced theta-band oscillations. In a McGurk mismatch negativity paradigm (MMN) where infrequent McGurk stimuli were embedded in a sequence of frequent audio-visually congruent stimuli we found no difference between congruent and McGurk stimuli. The infrequent stimuli in this paradigm are violating both the general prediction of stimulus content, and that of audiovisual congruence. Hence, we found no support for the hypothesis that audiovisual mismatch modulates induced theta-band oscillations. We also did not find any effects of audiovisual integration in the MMN paradigm, possibly due to the experimental design.

Serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors strongly influence prefronto-hippocampal neural networks in alert mice: Contribution to the actions of risperidone	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Antipsychotic drug; Prefrontal cortex; Hippocampus; Neural synchronization; In vivo electrophysiology	PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; SYNCHRONY; CORTEX; EEG; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; DIVERSITY; CLOZAPINE	Atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) used to treat positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia block serotonin receptors 5-HT2AR and dopamine receptors D2R and stimulate 5-HT1AR directly or indirectly. However, the exact cellular mechanisms mediating their therapeutic actions remain unresolved. We recorded neural activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) of freely-moving mice before and after acute administration of 5HT(1A)R, 5-HT2AR and D2R selective agonists and antagonists and atypical APD risperidone. We then investigated the contribution of the three receptors to the actions of risperidone on brain activity via statistical modeling and pharmacological reversal (risperidone + 5-HT1AR antagonist WAY-100635, risperidone + 5-HT2A/2CR agonist DOI, risperidone + D2R agonist quinpirole). Risperidone, 5-HT1AR agonism with 8-OH-DPAT, 5-HT2AR antagonism with M100907, and D2R antagonism with haloperidol reduced locomotor activity of mice that correlated with a suppression of neural spiking, power of theta and gamma oscillations in PFC and HPC, and reduction of PFCHPC theta phase synchronization. By contrast, activation of 5-HT2AR with DOI enhanced high-gamma oscillations in PFC and PFC-HPC high gamma functional connectivity, likely related to its hallucinogenic effects. Together, power changes, regression modeling and pharmacological reversals suggest an important role of 5-HT1AR agonism and 5-HT2AR antagonism in risperidone-induced alterations of delta, beta and gamma oscillations, while D2R antagonism may contribute to risperidone-mediated changes in delta oscillations. This study provides novel insight into the neural mechanisms for widely prescribed psychiatric medication targeting the serotonin and dopamine systems in two regions involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

The present study aimed to assess the whole-brain functional networks underlying a) the process of focusing attention on a single speech stream vs. dividing attention between two streams and 2) speech processing on different time-scales and depth. Two spoken narratives were presented simultaneously while listeners were instructed to a) track and memorize the contents of a speech stream and b) detect the presence of numerals or syntactic violations in the same ("focused attended condition") or in the parallel stream ("divided attended condition"). Speech content tracking was found to be associated with stronger connectivity in lower frequency bands (delta band-0,5-4 Hz), whereas the detection tasks were linked with networks operating in the faster alpha (8-10 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands. These results suggest that the oscillation frequencies of the dominant brain networks during speech processing may be related to the duration of the time window within which information is integrated. We also found that focusing attention on a single speaker compared to dividing attention between two concurrent speakers was predominantly associated with connections involving the frontal cortices in the delta (0.5-4 Hz), alpha (8-10 Hz), and beta bands (1330 Hz), whereas dividing attention between two parallel speech streams was linked with stronger connectivity involving the parietal cortices in the delta and beta frequency bands. Overall, connections strengthened by focused attention may reflect control over information selection, whereas connections strengthened by divided attention may reflect the need for maintaining two streams in parallel and the related control processes necessary for performing the tasks.

Children with cerebral palsy display altered neural oscillations within the visual MT/V5 cortices	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Visual perception; Magnetoencephalography; Brain imaging; Visuomotor; Vision	PERCEPTUAL IMPAIRMENT; MOVEMENT; MOTION; MOTOR; MEG; ABNORMALITIES; COHERENT; MOBILITY; MUSCLE; EEG	Cortical visual processing in visual MT/V5 is necessary for tracking movement and performing reliable visuomotor transformations. Although the role of this cortical area is well recognized, the activity of the visual MT/V5 cortical area in children with cerebral palsy (CP) has not been examined nor has its potential role in the atypical motor actions of these children been considered. This study used magnetoencephalography to image the neural activity in the motion-sensitive MT/V5 cortices of typically developing (TD) children (n = 21; mean age 14 yrs. +/- 2, 12 males) and children with CP (n = 21; mean age 16 yrs. +/- 4, 13 males) as they viewed a horizontally moving stimulus. Behavioral measures of visual perception were additionally assessed by having the participants press a button when the visual stimulus changed to moving in vertical direction. Our results showed that the horizontal movement of the visual stimulus evoked changes in the strength of the theta-alpha (5-10 Hz) and alpha-beta (8-20 Hz) oscillations in the visual MT/V5 area of all participants. Compared with the TD children, the children with CP had weaker alpha-beta oscillations in the visual MT/V5 cortices. In addition, the children with CP took longer to perceive a directional change of the visual stimulus and made more errors in detecting the change. Lastly, weaker alpha-beta oscillations were correlated with slower detection of the change in motion direction and less accuracy in identifying the change. This study shows that the uncharacteristic neural oscillations in the visual MT/V5 cortical area may partially account for the abnormal perceptions and motor decisions seen in children with CP.

This study aims to integrate eye-tracking metrics and EEG measurements to distinguish and quantify the visual aesthetics of a product. Thirty-two 3D prototypes of LED desk lamp with multiple views were designed to simulate an aesthetic appreciation flow. Eye-tracking and EEG signals were simultaneously recorded when participants were freely browsing each lamp. The evaluation of subjective visual aesthetics was conducted after each browsing. The results demonstrated that fixation time ratio and dwell time ratio significantly differed among the three clusters of visual aesthetic lamps. Meanwhile, average fixation duration only significantly differed between low and high aesthetic lamps and pupil size had no significant variation. Moreover, low aesthetic lamps evoked significantly weakened relative alpha power and enhanced relative gamma power. Thus, the eye-tracking metrics and the EEG measurements can distinguish the visual aesthetics of lamps. Regarding the results of quantification, the integrated multimodal physiological signals achieved an improved and reasonable accuracy. It seems beneficial to integrate multimodal physiological signals involved in different flows of visual aesthetic appreciation in quantifying the visual aesthetics of a product. Relevance to industry: As a premise of attracting consumers' attention, visual aesthetics has been identified as a crucial role in product design and marketing. Thus, thorough research on the variations of multimodal physiological signals involved in information retrieval and processing in appreciation flow can provide a distinction between product visual aesthetics. The quantification method can be utilized by designers in measuring the visual aesthetics of their products.

Methods: We reviewed a database of 73 comatose post-cardiac arrest patients who underwent therapeutic hypothermia to assess for the presence of BSP and clinical outcomes. In a subsample of patients with BSP (n = 14), spectral content of burst and suppression periods were quantified using multitaper method. Results: Burst-suppression pattern was seen in 45/73 (61%) patients. Comparable numbers of patients with (31.1%) and without (35.7%) BSP regained consciousness by the time of hospital discharge. In addition, in two unique cases, BSP initially resolved and then spontaneously reemerged after completion of therapeutic hypothermia and cessation of sedative medications. Both patients recovered consciousness. Spectral analysis of bursts in all patients regaining consciousness (n = 6) showed a prominent theta frequency (5-7 Hz) feature, but not in agematched patients with induced BSP who did not recover consciousness (n = 8). Conclusions: The prognostic implications of BSP after hypoxic brain injury may vary based on the intrinsic properties of the underlying brain state itself. The presence of theta activity within bursts may index potential viability of neuronal networks underlying recovery of consciousness; emergence of spontaneous BSP in some cases may indicate an innate neuroprotective mechanism. This study highlights the need for better characterization of various BSP patterns after cardiac arrest.

Here, we investigated the impact of prestimulus neural fluctuations on the content of perception-that is, whether one or another object is perceived. We recorded neural activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) before and while participants briefly viewed an ambiguous image, the Rubin face/vase illusion, and required them to report their perceived interpretation in each trial. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we showed robust decoding of the perceptual report during the poststimulus period. Applying source localization to the classifier weights suggested early recruitment of primary visual cortex (V1) and similar to 160-ms recruitment of the category-sensitive fusiform face area (FFA). These poststimulus effects were accompanied by stronger oscillatory power in the gamma frequency band for face vs. vase reports. In prestimulus intervals, we found no differences in oscillatory power between face vs. vase reports in V1 or in FFA, indicating similar levels of neural excitability. Despite this, we found stronger connectivity between V1 and FFA before face reports for low-frequency oscillations. Specifically, the strength of prestimulus feedback connectivity (i.e., Granger causality) from FFA to V1 predicted not only the category of the upcoming percept but also the strength of poststimulus neural activity associated with the percept. Our work shows that prestimulus network states can help shape future processing in category-sensitive brain regions and in this way bias the content of visual experiences.

Research shows that the degree of EC-to-EO alpha blocking or alpha desynchronization, termed alpha reactivity here, is a neural marker of cognitive health. We tested the role of acetylcholine in EC-to-EO alpha reactivity by applying a multimodal neuroimaging approach to a cohort of young adults and a cohort of older adults. In the young cohort, simultaneous EEG-fMRI was recorded from twenty-one young adults during both EO and EC resting. In the older cohort, functional MRI was recorded from forty older adults during EO and EC resting, along with FLAIR and diffusion MRI. For a subset of twenty older adults, EEG was recorded during EO and EC resting in a separate session. In both young and older adults, functional connectivity between the basal nucleus of Meynert (BNM), the major source of cortical acetylcholine, and the visual cortex increased from EC to EO, and this connectivity increase was positively associated with alpha reactivity; namely, the stronger the BNM-visual cortex functional connectivity increase from EC to EO, the larger the EC-to-EO alpha desynchronization. In older adults, lesions of the fiber tracts linking BNM and visual cortex quantified by leukoaraiosis volume, associated with reduced alpha reactivity. These findings support a role of acetylcholine and particularly cholinergic pathways in mediating EC-to-EO alpha reactivity and suggest that impaired alpha reactivity could serve as a marker of the integrity of the cholinergic system.

Beta Oscillations in Working Memory, Executive Control of Movement and Thought, and Sensorimotor Function	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; FIELD POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; SCALP EEG; GAMMA; SYNCHRONIZATION	Beta oscillations (similar to 13 to 30 Hz) have been observed during many perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes in a plethora of brain recording studies. Although the function of beta oscillations (hereafter "beta" for short) is unlikely to be explained by any single monolithic description, we here discuss several convergent findings. In prefrontal cortex (PFC), increased beta appears at the end of a trial when working memory information needs to be erased. A similar "clear-out" function might apply during the stopping of action and the stopping of long-term memory retrieval (stopping thoughts), where increased prefrontal beta is also observed. A different apparent role for beta in PFC occurs during the delay period of working memory tasks: it might serve to maintain the current contents and/or to prevent interference from distraction. We confront the challenge of relating these observations to the large literature on beta recorded from sensorimotor cortex. Potentially, the clear-out of working memory in PFC has its counterpart in the postmovement clear-out of the motor plan in sensorimotor cortex. However, recent studies support alternative interpretations. In addition, we flag emerging research on different frequencies of beta and the relationship between beta and single-neuron spiking. We also discuss where beta might be generated: basal ganglia, cortex, or both. We end by considering the clinical implications for adaptive deep-brain stimulation.

The cerebral correlates of sleep inertia assessed using combined behavioral, EEG and fMRI measures	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Awakening; Default mode network; NREM sleep; Sleep deprivation; Nap; Functional connectivity	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEPRIVATION; WAKEFULNESS; CONNECTOME; IDENTIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; ARCHITECTURE; ALERTNESS	The first minutes following awakening from sleep are typically marked by reduced vigilance, increased sleepiness and impaired performance, a state referred to as sleep inertia. Although the behavioral aspects of sleep inertia are well documented, its cerebral correlates remain poorly understood. The present study aimed at filling this gap by measuring in 34 participants the changes in behavioral performance (descending subtraction task, DST), EEG spectral power, and resting-state fMRI functional connectivity across three time points: before an early-afternoon 45-min nap, 5 min after awakening from the nap and 25 min after awakening. Our results showed impaired performance at the DST at awakening and an intrusion of sleep-specific features (spectral power and functional connectivity) into wakefulness brain activity, the intensity of which was dependent on the prior sleep duration and depth for the functional connectivity (14 participants awakened from N2 sleep, 20 from N3 sleep). Awakening in N3 (deep) sleep induced the most robust changes and was characterized by a global loss of brain functional segregation between task-positive (dorsal attention, salience, sensorimotor) and task-negative (default mode) networks. Significant correlations were observed notably between the EEG delta power and the functional connectivity between the default and dorsal attention networks, as well as between the percentage of mistake at the DST and the default network functional connectivity. These results highlight (1) significant correlations between EEG and fMRI functional connectivity measures, (2) significant correlations between the behavioral aspect of sleep inertia and measures of the cerebral functioning at awakening (both EEG and fMRI), and (3) the important difference in the cerebral underpinnings of sleep inertia at awakening from N2 and N3 sleep.

Yet, little is known about the electrophysiological profile of states of absorption, possibly due to the difficulty to induce this state in the lab. While most studies have used a visual Ganzfeld (homogeneous perceptual field), here we use a novel technique of full immersion-the OVO Whole-Body Perceptual Deprivation (OVO-WBPD) chamber, which is an altered sensory environment in the form of a human-sized egg. Consequently, the aims of the current study were to investigate whether the OVO-WBPD chamber induces state absorption, using first-person reports, as well as to examine electrophysiological change following immersion in this altered sensory environment. Fourteen participants volunteered to participate in the study. Trait absorption was measured using the Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS). State absorption was assessed by analyzing the content of the subjective reports, using sub-categories of the absorption construct (e.g., synesthesia). EEG was measured before and during a 20-min OVO-WBPD experience. Using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), we analyzed change in oscillatory EEG activity and localized the generators of the scalp EEG power spectra following the OVO-WBPD. Our results show that OVO-WBPD immersion leads to a state of absorption in all participants. We also report significant increased oscillatory activity in the delta and beta bands, in the left inferior frontal cortex, with a peak in the sub-lobar of the left insula. In addition, a positive correlation was found between change in delta activity and trait absorption. The results are discussed in light of other meditative practices and altered states of consciousness.

Deep brain stimulation of the internal capsule enhances human cognitive control and prefrontal cortex function	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							VENTRAL CAPSULE/VENTRAL STRIATUM; REGRESSION-BASED ESTIMATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; MECHANISMS; CIRCUIT; MODEL; EEG; MEG; NEUROMODULATION	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a circuit-oriented treatment for mental disorders. Unfortunately, even well-conducted psychiatric DBS clinical trials have yielded inconsistent symptom relief, in part because DBS' mechanism(s) of action are unclear. One clue to those mechanisms may lie in the efficacy of ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum (VCVS) DBS in both major depression (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). MDD and OCD both involve deficits in cognitive control. Cognitive control depends on prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions that project into the VCVS. Here, we show that VCVS DBS' effect is explained in part by enhancement of PFC-driven cognitive control. DBS improves human subjects' performance on a cognitive control task and increases theta (5-8Hz) oscillations in both medial and lateral PFC. The theta increase predicts subjects' clinical outcomes. Our results suggest a possible mechanistic approach to DBS therapy, based on tuning stimulation to optimize these neurophysiologic phenomena.	[Widge, A.

In this study, a total of 30 patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 25 patients with MCI of Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) were compared with 28 aged-, gender-, education-matched healthy control (HC) participants using visual event-related delta, theta, alpha oscillatory responses by methods of event related spectral perturbation and inter-trial coherence. PD-MCI and aMCI groups commonly share a decreased theta power, but all electrophysiological deviations from the controls were more prominent in PD-MCI than aMCI in all frequency bands. Additionally, decreased phase-locking in all studied frequency bands was encountered only in PD-MCI group, but it was preserved in aMCI. These findings indicate that visual networks in PD-MCI are more severely affected than aMCI. Reduced phase-locking in PD-MCI may possibly relate to dysfunctioning subcortical modulating centers that take a role in the generation of event-related responses.

To broaden the application of BCIs, researchers have focused on the increasement of the BCI instruction number in recent years. However, with a large number of instructions, the BCI calibration time will be too long to be accepted in practical usage. This study proposed a new coding method based on multifocal steady-state visual evoked potentials (mfSSVEPs), in which 16 targets were binary coded by 4 frequencies. Notably, the training data needed for calibration corresponded to only five out of the sixteen targets. Five volunteers were recruited to test this paradigm. Task-related component analysis combined with a probabilistic model were employed for target recognition. As a result, the accuracy could reach as high as 93.1% with Is-length data. The highest information transfer rate (ITR) was 101.1 bits/min with an average of 73.9 bits/min. The results indicate that this new paradigm is promising to encode a large BCI instruction set with less trainings.

Researchers have synthesized these data to postulate several models of functional specialization, However, the issue has not been explored in detail using direct brain recordings. We recently published evidence that theta power increases during episodic memory encoding occur in the posterior hippocampus in humans. In our current investigation we analyzed an expanded data set of 32 epilepsy patients undergoing stereo EEG seizure mapping surgery with electrodes precisely targeted to the anterior and posterior hippocampus simultaneously who performed an episodic memory task. Using a repeated measures design, we looked for an interaction between encoding versus retrieval differences in gamma oscillatory power and anterior versus posterior hippocampal location. Our findings are consistent with a recently articulated model (the HERNET model) favoring posterior hippocampal activation during retrieval related processing. We also tested for encoding versus retrieval differences in the preferred gamma frequency band (high versus low gamma oscillations) motivated by published rodent data.

MCI patients have a high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and for that reason the introduction of novel and reliable biomarkers is of significant clinical importance. Motivated by recent findings on the rich information of dynamic functional connectivity graphs (DFCGs) about brain (dys) function, we introduced a novel approach of identifying MCI based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting state recordings. The activity of different brain rhythms {delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 1, gamma 2} was first beamformed with linear constrained minimum norm variance in the MEG data to determine 90 anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). A DFCG was then estimated using the imaginary part of phase lag value (iPLV) for both intra-frequency coupling (8) and cross-frequency coupling pairs (28). We analyzed DFCG profiles of neuromagnetic resting state recordings of 18 MCI patients and 22 healthy controls. We followed our model of identifying the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DICM) across MEG sources and temporal segments, which further leads to the construction of an integrated DFCG (iDFCG). We then filtered statistically and topologically every snapshot of the iDFCG with data-driven approaches. An estimation of the normalized Laplacian transformation for every temporal segment of the iDFCG and the related eigenvalues created a 2D map based on the network metric time series of the eigenvalues (NMTSeigs). The NMTSeigs preserves the non-stationarity of the fluctuated synchronizability of iDCFG for each subject. Employing the initial set of 20 healthy elders and 20 MCI patients, as training set, we built an overcomplete dictionary set of network microstates (n mu states). Afterward, we tested the whole procedure in an extra blind set of 20 subjects for external validation. We succeeded in gaining a high classification accuracy on the blind dataset (85%), which further supports the proposed Markovian modeling of the evolution of brain states. The adaptation of appropriate neuroinformatic tools that combine advanced signal processing and network neuroscience tools could properly manipulate the non-stationarity of time-resolved FC patterns revealing a robust biomarker for MCI.

Cortical tracking of rhythm in music and speech	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Entrainment; Rhythm; Music; Speech; Music training	NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; METRIC STRUCTURE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; N1 WAVE; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; METER; BEAT; TIME; SYNCHRONIZATION	Neural activity phase-locks to rhythm in both music and speech. However, the literature currently lacks a direct test of whether cortical tracking of comparable rhythmic structure is comparable across domains. Moreover, although musical training improves multiple aspects of music and speech perception, the relationship between musical training and cortical tracking of rhythm has not been compared directly across domains. We recorded the electroencephalograms (EEG) from 28 participants (14 female) with a range of musical training who listened to melodies and sentences with identical rhythmic structure. We compared cerebral-acoustic coherence (CACoh) between the EEG signal and single-trial stimulus envelopes (as measure of cortical entrainment) across domains and correlated years of musical training with CACoh. We hypothesized that neural activity would be comparably phase-locked across domains, and that the amount of musical training would be associated with increasingly strong phase locking in both domains. We found that participants with only a few years of musical training had a comparable cortical response to music and speech rhythm, partially supporting the hypothesis. However, the cortical response to music rhythm increased with years of musical training while the response to speech rhythm did not, leading to an overall greater cortical response to music rhythm across all participants. We suggest that task demands shaped the asymmetric cortical tracking across domains.

Gating by inhibition during top-down control of willed attention	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; decision-making; alpha; theta; inhibition; EEG	FRONTAL ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CORTEX; SUPPRESSION; THETA; CONNECTIVITY; INTERFERENCE; ENHANCEMENT; MODULATION	In natural settings, the control of attention may be influenced both by external information as well as internal decision-making processes driven by intent (e.g. free will). In past studies of spatial attention, we and others have developed experimental paradigms that permit individuals to choose where to direct their attention on a trial-by-trial basis in the absence of instructive external cues - we term this willed attention. Here we investigate the electrophysiological correlates of willed attention by recording EEG activity when subjects decided to focus covert attention on one of two lateralized target locations versus when they decided to maintain attention at fixation. Independent of the direction of attention, decisions to attend, relative to decisions not to attend, resulted in significant increases in both frontal theta (4-7 Hz) power and central alpha (8-13 Hz) power. We found that focusing spatial attention, as indexed by occipital alpha lateralization was predicted across subjects by the decision-related alpha increases over central scalp regions, but not changes in frontal theta power. This finding is interpreted in terms of the Gating by Inhibition model, where the central alpha EEG signals reflect cortical inhibition of decision processes that lead to the expression of willed attention.

Automated unsupervised behavioral state classification using intracranial electrophysiology	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						intracranial EEG; behavioral states; sleep staging; machine learning; classification; epilepsy; deep brain stimulation	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE DETECTION; LONG-TERM; SLEEP; PREDICTION; EPILEPSY	Objective. Automated behavioral state classification in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings may be beneficial for iEEG interpretation and quantifying sleep patterns to enable behavioral state dependent neuromodulation therapy in next generation implantable brain stimulation devices. Here, we introduce a fully automated unsupervised framework to differentiate between awake (AW), sleep (N2), and slow wave sleep (N3) using intracranial EEG (iEEG) only and validated with expert scored polysomnography. Approach. Data from eight patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery (age 40 +/- 11, three female) with intracranial depth electrodes for iEEG monitoring were included. Spectral power features (0.1-235 Hz) spanning several frequency bands from a single electrode were used to classify behavioral states of patients into AW, N2, and N3. Main results. Overall, classification accuracy of 94%, with 94% sensitivity and 93% specificity across eight subjects using multiple spectral power features from a single electrode was achieved. Classification performance of N3 sleep was significantly better (95%, sensitivity 95%, specificity 93%) than that of the N2 sleep phase (87%, sensitivity 78%, specificity 96%). Significance. Automated, unsupervised, and robust classification of behavioral states based on iEEG data is possible, and it is feasible to incorporate these algorithms into future implantable devices with limited computational power, memory, and number of electrodes for brain monitoring and stimulation.

The gamma 2 subunit is a typical constituent. At least 11 mutations in the gamma 2 subunit cause human epilepsies, making the role of gamma 2-containing receptors in brain function of keen basic and translational interest. How small changes to inhibition may cause brain abnormalities, including seizure disorders, is unclear. In mice, we perturbed fast inhibition with a point mutation T272Y (T6'Y in the second membrane-spanning domain) to the gamma 2 subunit. The mutation imparts resistance to the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin, allowing verification of mutant subunit incorporation. We confirmed picrotoxin resistance and biophysical properties in recombinant receptors. T6'Y gamma 2-containing receptors also exhibited faster deactivation but unaltered steady-state properties. Adult T6'Y knockin mice exhibited myoclonic seizures and abnormal cortical EEG, including abnormal hippocampal-associated theta oscillations. In hippocampal slices, picrotoxin-insensitive inhibitory synaptic currents exhibited fast decay. Excitatory/inhibitory balance was elevated by an amount expected from the IPSC alteration. Partial pharmacological correction of gamma 2-mediated IPSCs with diazepam restored total EEG power toward baseline, but had little effect on the abnormal low-frequency peak in the EEG. The results suggest that at least part of the abnormality in brain function arises from the acute effects of truncated inhibition.

Mental workload of young and older adults gauged with ERPs and spectral power during N-Back task performance	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; P300-ERP; N-Back task; Alpha theta bands; Mental workload; Young older adults	WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ALPHA SYNCHRONIZATION; P300; EEG; AGE; ATTENTION; LOAD; P3A; OSCILLATIONS	Mental workload has been shown to correlate with alpha and theta band power but only few EEG studies focused on the relation between these bands and Event Related Potentials (ERPs), more specifically the P300 component. We report on an EEG study on mental workload where not only young but also older adults performed an N-Back task. Participants watched a sequence of visual pictures and indicated whether the current picture was the same as the one shown N pictures before. We considered N = 4 difficulty levels and analyzed the relation between these and P300 amplitude and theta and alpha band power, and also examined the effect of age, level of education, work activities, and task accuracy. Our results revealed a decrease in P300 amplitude and alpha band activity for higher difficulty levels for young adults in the parietal region. However, for older adults, fatigue played a more important role than we could anticipate as the alpha band power increased for the highest task difficulty level, and since performance accuracy also decreased, it could even be a sign of task disengagement. Beside alpha band, theta band activity showed a positive correlation with task difficulty level for both young and older adults. Additionally, we found higher P300 amplitudes for young adults compared to older adults, in line with their higher performance accuracies and lower reaction times. In conclusion, we showed that P300 amplitude and alpha and theta bands power provide complementary information for judging mental workload during N-Back performance for young and older subjects and for detecting mental fatigue and task disengagement.

Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream affect. Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is considered a marker of affective states and traits as well as affect regulation in the waking state. Here, we explored whether FAA during REM sleep and during evening resting wakefulness is related to affective experiences in REM sleep dreams. EEG recordings were obtained from 17humanparticipants (7men) whospent 2 nights in the sleep laboratory. Participants were awakened 5minafter the onset of everyREMstage after which they provided a dream report and rated their dream affect. Two-minute preawakening EEG segments were analyzed. Additionally, 8 min of evening presleep and morning postsleep EEG were recorded during resting wakefulness. Mean spectral power in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and correspondingFAAwere calculated over the frontal (F4-F3) sites. Results showed thatFAAduring REM sleep, and during evening resting wakefulness, predicted ratings of dream anger. This suggests that individuals with greater alpha power in the right frontal hemisphere may be less able to regulate (i. e., inhibit) strong affective states, such as anger, in dreams. Additionally, FAA was positively correlated across wakefulness and REM sleep. Together, these findings imply that FAA may serve as a neural correlate of affect regulation not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.

Prosodic pitch processing is represented in delta-band EEG and is dissociable from the cortical tracking of other acoustic and phonetic features	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; pitch; prosody	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NATURAL SPEECH; RESPONSES; LATERALIZATION; PERCEPTION; COMPREHENSION; MODULATIONS; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION	Speech is central to communication among humans. Meaning is largely conveyed by the selection of linguistic units such as words, phrases and sentences. However, prosody, that is the variation of acoustic cues that tie linguistic segments together, adds another layer of meaning. There are various features underlying prosody, one of the most important being pitch and how it is modulated. Recent fMRI and ECoG studies have suggested that there are cortical regions for pitch which respond primarily to resolved harmonics and that high-gamma cortical activity encodes intonation as represented by relative pitch. Importantly, this latter result was shown to be independent of the cortical tracking of the acoustic energy of speech, a commonly used measure. Here, we investigate whether we can isolate low-frequency EEG indices of pitch processing of continuous narrative speech from those reflecting the tracking of other acoustic and phonetic features. Harmonic resolvability was found to contain unique predictive power in delta and theta phase, but it was highly correlated with the envelope and tracked even when stimuli were pitch-impoverished. As such, we are circumspect about whether its contribution is truly pitch-specific. Crucially however, we found a unique contribution of relative pitch to EEG delta-phase prediction, and this tracking was absent when subjects listened to pitch-impoverished stimuli. This finding suggests the possibility of a separate processing stream for prosody that might operate in parallel to acoustic-linguistic processing. Furthermore, it provides a novel neural index that could be useful for testing prosodic encoding in populations with speech processing deficits and for improving cognitively controlled hearing aids.

J	Basaklar, T; Tuncel, Y; Ider, YZ				Basaklar, Toygun; Tuncel, Yigit; Ider, Yusuf Ziya			Effects of high stimulus presentation rate on EEG template characteristics and performance of c-VEP based BCIs	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						EEG; code modulated visual evoked potential; c-VEP; principle component analysis; monitor refresh rate; brain computer interface; BCI	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; TIME	Objective: This study aims at investigating the effects of high stimulus presentation rates on the characteristics of c-VEP responses along with the change in performance depending on the stimulus presentation rate by utilizing a c-VEP based speller BCI. Approach: Twenty subjects participated in three different experiments with refresh rates of 60 Hz (E1), 120 Hz (E2) and 240 Hz (E3), where a 127-bit m-sequence is used. To observe the change in frequency content of c-VEP responses, PSD estimates of c-VEP responses were evaluated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to observe how many distinguishable responses could be evoked with a 127-bit length m-sequence for three different refresh rates. Main Results: Average ITR and accuracy values are 85.87 bits min(-1) and 92% for E1, 94.21 bits min(-1) and 97% for E2, and 78.65 bits min(-1) and 87% for E3 respectively. The c-VEP responses are band-limited although the bandwidth of the input signal significantly increases as the refresh rate increases. The spectral densities of c-VEP templates are concentrated on several frequency intervals, especially for E3, which eventually results in a target misclassification. PCA shows that the number of well distinguishable responses decreases with the increasing refresh rate. Considering all results and observations, we suggest that 120 Hz refresh rate is best to use in BCIs with high number of targets whereas 240 Hz refresh rate may be prefered for low number of targets. Significance: This study mainly investigates the alterations in the characteristics of c-VEP responses according to the stimulus presentation rate which have never been investigated thoroughly before. Our results show that increasing refresh rate does not necessarily increase the overall performance of the system due to the changes in characteristics of c-VEP responses. Further applications and designs of a c-VEP based BCIs will benefit from the observations and results of this study.

To obtain a better understanding of the underlying cortical neural mechanism of the disease we analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of people with SD during voice production. Method: Ten SD individuals and 10 healthy volunteers produced 50 vowel vocalization epochs of 2500 ms duration. Two EEG features were derived: (1) event-related change in spectral power during vocalization relative to rest, (2) inter-regional spectral coherence. Results: During early vocalization (500-1000 ms) the SD group showed significantly larger alpha band spectral power over the left motor cortex. During late vocalization (1000-2500 ms) SD patients showed a significantly larger gamma band coherence between left somatosensory and premotor cortical areas. Conclusions: Two atypical patterns of cortical activity characterize the pathophysiology of spasmodic dysphonia during voice production: (1) a reduced movement-related desynchronization of motor cortical networks, (2) an excessively large synchronization between left somatosensory and premotor cortical areas. Significance: The pathophysiology of SD is characterized by an abnormally high synchronous activity within and across cortical neural networks involved in voice production that is mainly lateralized in the left hemisphere.

Despite much interest in this topic, our understanding of the developmental and neural involvement for empathic processing is limited. Recent evidence suggests the Mirror Neuron System (MNS) may play a role in this behavior, and that mu rhythm suppression found over the sensorimotor cortices may be a proxy for the MNS. Therefore, we aimed to measure mu rhythm oscillations in response to empathic processing during observation of painful action-based situations using electroencephalogram (EEG). Our second goal was to examine how perceived parental emotional invalidation (EI) during childhood may relate to empathy and influence mu suppression. Our results showed that mu rhythm suppression was strongest over the right hemisphere. EI had a significant influence on this suppression between painful and non-painful images, and was negatively correlated with behavioral measures of empathy. Our findings suggest that perceived childhood EI may decrease empathizing abilities and influence neural responses to the painful experiences of others. Implications from this study could entail clinical intervention targeted at emotional invalidation to foster the healthy development of empathy.

Brief executive function training for individuals with severe mental illness: Effects on EEG synchronization and executive functioning	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Cognitive remediation; Schizophrenia; Severe mental illness; EEG; Executive functioning; Memory	NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; COGNITIVE REMEDIATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ALPHA; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; INCREASES; DYNAMICS	Background: Executive Functioning (EF) is an important factor for community functioning for people with severe mental illness. Cognitive remediation programs often improve EF, but do so by using multiple therapeutic techniques. Little is known regarding how individual treatment elements promote cognitive improvement. Oscillatory brain activity is a potential neurophysiological mechanism that may change as a result of targeted training on computerized exercises. The current study aimed to examine the effects of a brief EF training program on EEG and neurocognitive measures. Methods: 25 people with severe mental illness were randomized to either 2 weeks of computerized EF training or control training. Training consisted of 1 h training sessions 3 times per week and 40 min of daily home training. Assessments examined EEG theta and alpha band oscillatory power during EF tasks and neurocognitivemeasures of EF. Results: EF training resulted in greater frontal theta power and reduced posterior alpha power during computerized EF tasks than control training. Power in the alpha frequency band over frontal electrode sites did not significantly differ between the two groups as a result of training. Additionally, participants in the EF training experienced significantly greater improvement in EF ability as measured by neurocognitive tests than the control condition. Conclusions: Two weeks of EF training is sufficient to produce neurophysiological and neurocognitive change. Frontal theta power and posterior alpha power may be important neurophysiological markers to consider in cognitive remediation studies, and the addition of a brief executive function training procedure to other psychosocial interventions is worth examining.

The Impact of Math Anxiety on Working Memory: A Cortical Activations and Cortical Functional Connectivity EEG Study	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Mathematical anxiety; math anxiety; working memory; EEG; cortical functional connectivity	MATHEMATICS ANXIETY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BAND OSCILLATIONS; CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN; PAIN; RESPONSES; ALPHA; INFORMATION; MODULATION	Mathematical anxiety (MA) is defined as a feeling of tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with mathematical performance in various daily or academic situations. Cognitive consequences of MA have been studied a lot and revealed that MA seriously affects solving the complex problem due to the corruption of working memory (WM). The corruption of WM caused by MA is well documented in behavioral level, but the involved neurophysiological processes have not been properly addressed, despite the recent attention drawn on the neural basis of MA. This is the second part of our study that intents to investigate the neurophysiological aspects of MA and its implications to WM. In the first study, we saw how MA affects the early stages of numeric stimuli processes as the WM indirectly using event-related potentials in scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This paper goes one step further to investigate the cortical activations, obtained by the multichannel EEG recordings as well as the cortical functional networks in three WM tasks with increasing difficulty. Our results indicate that the high-math anxious (HMA) group activated more areas linked with negative emotions, pain, and fear, while the low-math anxious (LMA) group activated regions related to the encoding and retrieval processes of the WM. Functional connectivity analysis also reveals that the LMAs' brain has got more structured cortical networks with increased connectivity in areas related to WM, such as the frontal cortex, while the HMAs' brain has a more diffused and unstructured network, superimposing the evidence that the structured processes of WM are corrupted.

As little is known about the discriminant and convergent validity of these putative biomarkers, a thorough evaluation of these psychometric properties was conducted toward the goal of improving clinical utility of these markers. Resting 71-channel EEG recorded from 35 healthy adults at two sessions (1-week retest) were used to systematically compare different quantification techniques for theta and alpha sources at scalp (surface Laplacian or current source density [CSD]) and brain (distributed inverse; exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography [eLORETA]) level. Signal quality was evaluated with signal-to-noise ratio, participant-level spectra, and frequency PCA covariance decomposition. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed within a multitrait-multimethod framework. Posterior alpha was reliably identified as two spectral components, each with unique spatial patterns and condition effects (eyes open/closed), high signal quality, and good convergent and discriminant validity. In contrast, frontal theta was characterized by one low-variance component, low signal quality, lack of a distinct spectral peak, and mixed validity. Correlations between candidate biomarkers suggest that posterior alpha components constitute reliable, convergent, and discriminant biometrics in healthy adults. Component-based identification of spectral activity (CSD/eLORETA-fPCA) was superior to fixed, a priori frequency bands. Improved quantification and conceptualization of frontal theta is necessary to determine clinical utility.

Previous investigations have demonstrated a strong neural overlap between self-related activity and resting state activity. This suggests that information about self-relatedness is encoded in our brain's spontaneous activity. The exact neuronal mechanisms of such rest-self containment, however, remain unclear. The present EEG study investigated temporal measures of resting state EEG to relate them to self-consciousness. This was obtained with the self-consciousness scale (SCS) which measures Private, Public, and Social dimensions of self. We demonstrate positive correlations between Private self-consciousness and three temporal measures of resting state activity: scale-free activity as indexed by the power-law exponent (PLE), the auto-correlation window (ACW), and modulation index (MI). Specifically, higher PLE, longer ACW, and stronger MI were related to higher degrees of Private self-consciousness. Finally, conducting eLORETA for spatial tomography, we found significant correlation of Private self-consciousness with activity in cortical midline structures such as the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. These results were reinforced with a data-driven analysis; a machine learning algorithm accurately predicted an individual as having a high or low Private self-consciousness score based on these measures of the brain's spatiotemporal structure. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Private self-consciousness is related to the temporal structure of resting state activity as featured by temporal nestedness (PLE), temporal continuity (ACW), and temporal integration (MI). Our results support the hypothesis that self-related information is temporally contained in the brain's resting state. Rest-self containment can thus be featured by a temporal signature.

A prime example of this is the suggested relevance of frontal asymmetry of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in emotional processing. Yet, while neuroimaging defines relevant networks, it can only establish correlations and not causality. Objective: We address this deficiency by applying cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to twenty-seven healthy, human participants (both genders represented equally). ccPAS involves TMS applied to two brain regions contemporaneously, changing the connectivity via Hebbian mechanisms. Methods: We evaluate modifications in connectivity following ccPAS between the right and left LPFC that are dependent on the direction of ccPAS, i.e., which hemisphere is stimulated first. Participants performed an emotional reactivity task, assessed by measuring attentional bias, and brain activity was recorded with electroencephalogram (EEG) both at rest and in response to TMS pulses. Results: We find that ccPAS modulates attentional bias bidirectionally depending on the order of stimulation. Furthermore, this modulation is accompanied by a change in frontal asymmetry. Measuring the direction of the information flow using TMS evoked potentials provides evidence that ccPAS strengthens inhibition from the hemisphere stimulated first to the hemisphere stimulated second. Conclusions: Our findings provide causal evidence for the role of frontal asymmetry in emotional processing and establish ccPAS combined with the EEG measures as a tool to causally characterize functionality of neuronal circuits.

J	Etard, O; Reichenbach, T				Etard, Octave; Reichenbach, Tobias			Neural Speech Tracking in the Theta and in the Delta Frequency Band Differentially Encode Clarity and Comprehension of Speech in Noise	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						envelope tracking; neural oscillations; speech comprehension; speech processing	CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; INTELLIGIBILITY; ENVELOPE; LANGUAGE; MODULATION; RESPONSES; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Humans excel at understanding speech even in adverse conditions such as background noise. Speech processing may be aided by cortical activity in the delta and theta frequency bands, which have been found to track the speech envelope. However, the rhythm of non-speech sounds is tracked by cortical activity as well. It therefore remains unclear which aspects of neural speech tracking represent the processing of acoustic features, related to the clarity of speech, and which aspects reflect higher-level linguistic processing related to speech comprehension. Here we disambiguate the roles of cortical tracking for speech clarity and comprehension through recording EEG responses to native and foreign language in different levels of background noise, for which clarity and comprehension vary independently. We then use a both a decoding and an encoding approach to relate clarity and comprehension to the neural responses. We find that cortical tracking in the theta frequency band is mainly correlated to clarity, whereas the delta band contributes most to speech comprehension. Moreover, we uncover an early neural component in the delta band that informs on comprehension and that may reflect a predictive mechanism for language processing. Our results disentangle the functional contributions of cortical speech tracking in the delta and theta bands to speech processing. They also show that both speech clarity and comprehension can be accurately decoded from relatively short segments of EEG recordings, which may have applications in future mind-controlled auditory prosthesis.

The proposed system consists of a custom-designed headset, a new virtual keyboard with 58 characters, special symbols, and digits, and a five-target steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) utilizing one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) for SSVEP frequency detection. The deep learning model is implemented and trained under the training mode before being applied in the operation mode of the system. To validate the proposed model, we acquire the training dataset with numerous testing conditions, including different frequency resolutions of the feature and different time-window lengths of analysis. Two types of features based on the frequency domain are investigated to compare their performances in terms of classification accuracy of the model. The experimental results from eight subjects shows that on average, the proposed model can classify five-class SSVEP data with a high accuracy of 99.2%. The proposed BCI is then employed in an online experiment of spelling the word "SPELLER" using 2-s time window. Consequently, the system achieves an average accuracy of 97.4% and an information transfer rate of 49 +/- 7.7 bpm, showing the practicality and feasibility of implementing a reliable single-channel SSVEP-based speller utilizing 1-D CNN.

To comprehend more suitable anesthetic drug rate during surgery is a crucial aspect. The main objective of this proposal is to design robust automated control system that work efficiently in most of the patients with smooth BIS and minimum variations of propofol during surgery to avoid adverse post reactions and instability of anesthetic parameters. And also, to design advanced computer control system that improves the health of patient with short recovery time and less clinical expenditures. Unlike existing research work, this system administrates propofol as a hypnotic drug to regulate BIS, with fast bolus infusion in induction phase and slow continuous infusion in maintenance phase of anesthesia. The novelty of the paper lies in possibility to simplify the drug sensitivity-based adaption with infusion delay approach to achieve closed-loop control of hypnosis during surgery. Proposed work uses a brain concentration as a feedback signal in place of the BIS signal. Regression model based estimated sensitivity parameters are used for adaption to avoid BIS signal based frequent adaption procedure and large offset error. Adaptive smith predictor with lead-lag filter approach is applied on 22 different patients' model identified by actual clinical data. The actual BIS and propofol infusion signals recorded during clinical trials were used to estimate patient's sensitivity parameters EC50 and lambda. Simulation results indicate that patient's drug sensitivity parameters based adaptive strategy facilitates optimal controller performance in most of the patients. Results are obtained with proposed scheme having less settling time, BIS oscillations and small offset error leads to adequate depth of anesthesia. A comparison with manual control mode and previously reported system shows that proposed system achieves reduction in the total variations of the propofol dose. Proposed adaptive scheme provides better performance with less oscillation in spite of computation delay, surgical stimulations and patient variability. Proposed scheme also provides improvement in robustness and may be suitable for clinical practices.

Studies using electroencephalography have characterized changes in neural oscillations in the cortex at specific frequency bands during propofol-induced anaesthesia and modelling work suggests these changes result from changes in thalamocortical functional connectivity. However, it is unclear if the neurophysiological changes seen at the cortex are due to enhanced or disrupted thalamocortical communication. Direct recordings from these sites during anaesthesia that could be used to confirm such models are rare. We recorded local field potentials from the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus and electrocorticography signals from the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex in 10 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Signals were acquired during induction of propofol anaesthesia while subjects were resting. After confirming direct structural connectivity between the thalamus and the cortical recording site, we investigated propofol-associated changes in thalamic and cortical local power as well as thalamocortical functional connectivity, as measured with coherence, debiased weighted phase lag index, and phase amplitude coupling. Propofol anaesthesia resulted in local power increases at a frequencies (8-12 Hz) across both thalamic and cortical areas. At sensorimotor cortices, there was a broadband power increase (12-100 Hz), while the power of this same broad frequency band was suppressed within the thalamus. Despite the increase in local alpha power both within the thalamus and cortex, thalamocortical coherence and debiased weighted phase lag index in the alpha/low beta frequencies (8-16 Hz, which was present in the awake state) significantly decreased with propofol administration (P < 0.05, two group test of coherence). Likewise, propofol administration resulted in decreased phase amplitude coupling between the phase of alpha/low beta in the thalamus and the amplitude of broadband gamma (50-200 Hz) in the cortex (P = 0.031, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). We also report phase amplitude coupling between the phase of slow wave oscillations (0.1-1 Hz) and amplitude of broadband frequencies (8-200 Hz) within the cortex and across thalamocortical connections, during anaesthesia, both following a peak-max pattern. While confirming alpha-power increases with propofol administration both in thalamus and cortex, we observed decreased thalamocortical connectivity, contradicting models that suggest increasing cortical low frequency power is necessarily related to increased thalamocortical coherence but in support of the theory that propofol-induced loss of consciousness is associated with disrupted thalamocortical communication.

Cue-related processing accounts for age differences in phasic alerting	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Aging; Alerting; Arousal; Alpha oscillations; Phase locking; EEG	WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; AMPLITUDE MODULATIONS; ORIENTING ATTENTION; EEG ALPHA; NETWORK; PERFORMANCE; ALERTNESS; DYNAMICS; INFORMATION	Alertness is fundamental for the efficiency of information processing. A person's level of alertness refers to the system's state of general responsiveness and can be temporarily increased by presenting a neutral warning cue shortly before an event occurs (Posner and Petersen, 1990). However, effects of alerts on subsequent stimulus processing are less consistent in older than in younger individuals. In this study, we investigated the neural underpinnings of age differences in processing of auditory alerting cues. We measured electroencephalographic power and phase locking in response to alerting cues in a visual letter report task, in which younger but not older adults showed a cue-related behavioral advantage. Alerting cues evoked a significant increase in power as well as in inter-trial phase locking, with a maximum effect in the alpha frequency (8-12 Hz) in both age groups. Importantly, these cue-related increases in phase locking and power were stronger in older than in younger adults and were negatively correlated with the behavioral alerting effect in the older sample. Our results are in accordance with the assumption that older adults' neural responses may be more strongly driven by external input and less variable than younger adults'. A stronger neural response of the system to the auditory cue may have hindered older adults' effective use of the warning signal to foster processing of the following visual stimulus.

To test the causal effect of gamma-band oscillations on face and object perception we applied transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) in healthy volunteers (N = 60). In this single-blind, sham-controlled study, we examined whether the administration of offline tACS at gamma-frequency (40 Hz) over the right occipital cortex enhances performance of perception and memory of face and object stimuli. We hypothesized that gamma tACS would enhance the perception of both categories of visual stimuli. Results, in line with our hypothesis, show that 40 Hz tACS enhanced both face and object perception. This effect is process-specific (i.e., it does not affect memory), frequency-specific (i.e., stimulation at 5 Hz did not cause any behavioural change), and site-specific (i.e., stimulation of the sensory-motor cortex did not affect performance). Our findings show that high-frequency tACS modulates human visual perception, and it is in line with neurophysiological studies showing that the perception of visual stimuli (i.e., faces and objects) is mediated by oscillations in the gamma-band range. Furthermore, this study adds insight about the design of effective neuromodulation protocols that might have implications for interventions in clinical settings.

Both of them, often associated with neuronal oscillations, an emergent property of brain networks, are governed by temporal lobe (TL) functional connectivity. An impairment of oscillatory mechanisms indeed often leads to TL-dependent cognitive deficits. While the classical view assigned the TL a major role in spatial information processing, new theories rather confer to the TL a more general function in cognitive processes beyond space representation. The present review covers, both in humans and in animal models, (a) the updated role of the TL in cognitive processes, addressing current debates in the field and proposing a scenario on how TL structures cooperate in order to bind an integrated representation of afferent information, (b) the oscillatory mechanisms underlying these TL-dependent cognitive functions (theta, gamma, sharp wave ripples) and (c) how TL-dependent cognition is altered during temporal lobe epilepsy, proposing a scenario on how reorganized TL networks in TLE leads to rhythmopathies and cognitive deficits. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a well-studied neurological disease. Patients do not only suffer from epileptic seizures but also from cognitive and behavioral deficits between their seizures called comorbidities. TLE animal models are therefore used to understand how and when these comorbidities arise and what their underlying mechanisms are.

Considering the overlapping neural circuits between self-pain and other-pain perceptions, the present study investigated how the predictability of forthcoming pain modulates the anticipation and perception of self-pain and other-pain. We used a balanced, within-participant experimental design in which a visual cue indicating the recipient, intensity and predictability of an upcoming painful electrical stimulation was presented before its delivery. Subjective ratings and electroencephalography activities to the anticipation and perception of self-pain and other-pain were recorded and compared between certain and uncertain conditions. Results showed that predictability affected the perception of self-pain and other-pain in a similar manner such that the differences in behavioral ratings and event-related potentials to high-intensity and low-intensity pain were significantly reduced when the intensity was uncertain. The strengths of predictability-induced modulation of self-pain and other-pain perceptions were positively correlated with each other. Furthermore, predictability also modulated the anticipation of both self-pain and other-pain such that pre-stimulus high-frequency a-oscillation power at sensorimotor electrodes contralateral to the stimulation side was maximally suppressed when anticipating certain high-intensity pain. These findings demonstrate that predictability-induced modulation on pain anticipation and perception was similarly applied to both self-pain and other-pain.

However, it may also play a role in dynamic interactive communication. Accordingly, the current study used the electroencephalogram (EEG) to simultaneously record neural oscillations from 13 paired unbalanced Chinese-English bilinguals during cooperative picture-naming in either first language (L1) or second language (L2) according to cues. We found that the speaker and listener achieved synchronization by inhibiting interference from the nontarget language (cross-language interference) and partner (interpersonal interference) through language control. Furthermore, the more the language control resources were used, the higher the level of neural synchronization. These findings indicate that language control is associated with neural synchronization of cross-language communication. Altogether, the IC model should highlight the role of language control in inhibiting not only cross-language interference but also interpersonal interference during dynamic cross-language communication.

Thalamocortical dysrhythmia in intraoperative recordings of focal epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						biomarkers; cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling; high-frequency oscillations	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ABSENCE SEIZURES; PHASE; DYNAMICS; NETWORK; EEG; STIMULATION; THALAMUS	Resonant interactions between the thalamus and cortex subserve a critical role for maintenance of consciousness as well as cognitive functions. In states of abnormal thalamic inhibition, thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) has been described. The characteristics of TCD include a slowing of resting oscillations, ectopic high-frequency activity, and increased cross-frequency coupling. Here, we demonstrate the presence of TCD in four patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery with chronically implanted electrodes under anesthesia, continuously recording activity from brain regions at the periphery of the epileptogenic zone before and after resection. Following resection, we report an acceleration of the large-scale network resting frequency coincident with decreases in cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling. Interregional functional connectivity in the surrounding cortex was also increased following resection of the epileptogenic focus. These findings provide evidence for the presence of TCD in focal epilepsy and highlight the importance of reciprocal thalamocortical oscillatory interactions in defining novel biomarkers for resective surgeries. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) occurs in the context of thalamic dysfacilitation and is characterized by slowing of resting oscillations. ectopic high-frequency activity, and cross-frequency coupling. We provide evidence for TCD in focal epilepsy by studying electrophysiological changes occurring at the periphery of the resection margin. We report acceleration of resting activity coincident with decreased cross-frequency coupling and increased functional connectivity. The study of TCD in epilepsy has implications as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

Here, we test whether this link between prestimulus alpha power and decision confidence, previously established in vision and somatosensation, also holds in the auditory modality. Moreover, confidence usually depends on the physical evidence available in the stimulus as well as on decision accuracy. It is unclear in how far the link between prestimulus alpha power and confidence holds when physical stimulus evidence is entirely absent, and thus accuracy does not vary. We here analysed electroencephalography data from a paradigm where human listeners (N = 17) rated their confidence in the discrimination of the pitch of two tones that were, unbeknownst to the listeners, identical. Lower prestimulus alpha power as recorded at central channel sites was predictive of higher confidence ratings. Furthermore, this link was not mediated by auditory evoked activity. Our results support a direct link between prestimulus alpha power and decision confidence. This effect, first, shows up in the auditory modality similar to vision and somatosensation, and second, is present also in the complete absence of physical evidence in the stimulus and in the absence of varying accuracy. These findings speak to a model wherein low prestimulus alpha power increases neural baseline excitability, which is reflected in enhanced stimulus-evoked neural responses and higher confidence.

This paper will summarize recent work that has investigated changes in oscillatory activity and event-related potentials with Electro/Magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) in participants at high-risk for the development of schizophrenia, highlighting disruptions in sensory and cognitive operations prior to the onset of the syndrome. Changes in EEG/MEG-data are consistent with evidence for alterations in Glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission as disclosed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and brain stimulation, indicating changes in Excitation/Inhibition balance parameters prior to the onset of psychosis. Together these data emphasize the importance of research into neuronal dynamics as a crucial approach to establish functional relationships between impairments in neural circuits and emerging psychopathology that together could be fundamental for early intervention and the identification of novel treatments for emerging psychosis.

In rats and mice, respiratory frequencies occupy the same band as the hippocampal theta-rhythm, which has been shown to be a key player in memory processes. Hippocampal and olfactory bulb rhythms were previously found to be uncorrelated except in specific odor-contingency learning circumstances. However, many recent electrophysiological studies in both rodents and humans reveal a surprising cycle-by-cycle influence of nasal respiration on neuronal activity throughout much of the cerebral cortex beyond the olfactory system, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and subcortical structures. In addition, respiratory phase has been shown to influence higher-frequency oscillations associated with cognitive functions, including attention and memory, such as the power of gamma-rhythms and the timing of hippocampal sharp wave ripples. These new findings support respiration's role in cognitive function, which is supported by studies in human subjects, in which nasal respiration has been linked to memory processes. Here, we review recent reports from human and rodent experiments that link respiration to the modulation of memory function and the neurophysiological processes involved in memory in rodents and humans. We argue that respiratory influence on the neuronal activity of two key memory structures, the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, provides a potential neuronal mechanism behind respiratory modulation of memory.

Attention modulates event-related spectral power in multisensory self-motion perception	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Self-motion perception; Multisensory; Congruency; Vision; Vestibular; Event-related spectral power	BETA-BAND ACTIVITY; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR; INTEGRATION; RHYTHMS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENTS; CORTEX	Humans integrate visual and physical (vestibular and proprioceptive) cues to motion during self-motion perception. Theta and alpha-band oscillations have been associated with the processing of visual motion (e.g. optic flow). Alpha and beta-band oscillations have been shown to be associated with sensory-motor processing (e.g. walking). The present study examined modulation of theta, alpha, and beta oscillations while participants made heading direction judgments during a passive self-motion task which required selective attention to one of the simultaneously presented visual or physical motion stimuli. Attention to physical (while ignoring visual) motion produced a different time course of changes in spectral power compared to attention to visual (while ignoring physical) motion. We observed weaker theta event-related synchronization (ERS), as well as stronger beta and later onset of alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the attend-physical condition compared to the attend-visual condition. We observed individual differences in terms of ability to perform the task. Specifically, some participants were not able to ignore or discount the visual input when visual and physical heading direction was incongruent; this was reflected by similar event-related spectral power for both conditions. The results demonstrated a possible electrophysiological signature of the time course of 1) cue conflict (congruency effects), 2) attention to specific motion cues, and 3) individual differences in perceptual weighting of motion stimuli (high-vs. low-accuracy effects).

J	Alexander, DM; Ball, T; Schulze-Bonhage, A; van Leeuwen, C				Alexander, David M.; Ball, Tonio; Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas; van Leeuwen, Cees			Large-scale cortical travelling waves predict localized future cortical signals	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; SINGLE-TRIAL; EEG; PHASE; INFORMATION; INTERVALS; GRADIENTS	Predicting future brain signal is highly sought-after, yet difficult to achieve. To predict the future phase of cortical activity at localized ECoG and MEG recording sites, we exploit its predominant, large-scale, spatiotemporal dynamics. The dynamics are extracted from the brain signal through Fourier analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) only, and cast in a data model that predicts future signal at each site and frequency of interest. The dominant eigenvectors of the PCA that map the large-scale patterns of past cortical phase to future ones take the form of smoothly propagating waves over the entire measurement array. In ECoG data from 3 subjects and MEG data from 20 subjects collected during a self-initiated motor task, mean phase prediction errors were as low as 0.5 radians at local sites, surpassing state-of-the-art methods of within-time-series or event-related models. Prediction accuracy was highest in delta to beta bands, depending on the subject, was more accurate during episodes of high global power, but was not strongly dependent on the time-course of the task. Prediction results did not require past data from the to-be-predicted site. Rather, best accuracy depended on the availability in the model of long wavelength information. The utility of large-scale, low spatial frequency traveling waves in predicting future phase activity at local sites allows estimation of the error introduced by failing to account for irreducible trajectories in the activity dynamics. Author summary Prediction is an important step in scientific progress, often leading to real-world applications. Prediction of future brain activity could lead to improvements in detecting driver and pilot error or real-time brain testing using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Previous studies have either supposed that the 'noise' level in the cortex is high, setting the prediction bar rather low; or used localized measurements to predict future activity, with modest success. A long-held but controversial hypothesis is that the cortex is best characterized as a multi-scale dynamic structure, in which the flow of activity at one scale, say, the area responsible for motor control, is inextricably tied to activity at smaller and larger scales, for example within a cortical column and the whole cortex. We test this hypothesis by analyzing large-scale traveling waves of cortical activity. Like waves arriving on a beach, the ongoing wave motion allows better prediction of future activity compared to monitoring the local rise and fall; in the best cases the future wave cycle is predicted with as low as 20 degrees average error angle. The prediction techniques developed for the present research rely on mathematics related to quantifying large-scale weather patterns or analysis of fluid dynamics.

Semantic and perceptual priming activate partially overlapping brain networks as revealed by direct cortical recordings in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Invasive EEG; Perceptual priming; Semantic priming; Object processing; Spatio-temporal dynamics	WORKING-MEMORY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FMRI; GAMMA; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; PICTURE; TASK; ECOG	Facilitation of object processing in the brain due to a related context (priming) can be influenced by both semantic connections and perceptual similarity. It is thus important to discern these two when evaluating the spatio-temporal dynamics of primed object processing. The repetition-priming paradigm frequently used to study perceptual priming is, however, unable to differentiate between the mentioned priming effects, possibly leading to confounded results. In the current study, we recorded brain signals from the scalp and cerebral convexity of nine patients with refractory epilepsy in response to related and unrelated image-pairs, all of which shared perceptual features while only related ones had a semantic connection. While previous studies employing a repetition-priming paradigm observed largely overlapping networks between semantic and perceptual priming effects, our results suggest that this overlap is only partial (both temporally and spatially). These findings stress the importance of controlling for perceptual features when studying semantic priming.

Although the overlap between REM sleep and dreaming has been overcome, several studies point out that emotional and perceptually vivid contents are more frequent when reported upon awakenings from this sleep stage. Actually, it is well-known that REM sleep plays a pivotal role in the processing of salient and emotional waking-life experiences, strongly contributing to the emotional memory consolidation. In this vein, we highlighted that, to some extent, neuroimaging studies showed that the processes that regulate dreaming and emotional salience in sleep mentation share similar neural substrates of those controlling emotions during wakefulness. Furthermore, the research on EEG correlates of the presence/ absence of DE and the results on EEG pattern related to the incorporated memories converged to assign a crucial role of REM theta oscillations in emotional re-processing. In particular, the theta activity is involved in memory processes during REM sleep as well as during the waking state, in line with the continuity hypothesis. Also, the gamma activity seems to be related to emotional processes and dream recall as well as to lucid dreams. Interestingly, similar EEG correlates of DE have been found in clinical samples when nightmares or dreams occur. Research on clinical samples revealed that promoting the rehearsal of frightening contents aimed to change them is a promising method to treat nightmares, and that lucid dreams are associated with an attenuation of nightmares. In this view, DE can defuse emotional traumatic memories when the emotional regulation and the fear extinction mechanisms are compromised by traumatic and frightening events. Finally, dreams could represent a sort of simulation of reality, providing the possibility to create a new scenario with emotional mastery elements to cope with dysphoric items included in nightmares. In addition, it could be hypothesized that the insertion of bizarre items besides traumatic memories might be functional to "impoverish" the negative charge of the experiences.

However, reliable results are only obtained if artefacts are removed or excluded. Artefact detection is often performed manually during sleep stage scoring, which is time consuming and prevents application to large datasets. We aimed to test the performance of mostly simple algorithms of artefact detection in polysomnographic recordings, derive optimal parameters and test their generalization capacity. We implemented 14 different artefact detection methods, optimized parameters for derivation C3A2 using receiver operator characteristic curves of 32 recordings, and validated them on 21 recordings of healthy participants and 10 recordings of patients (different laboratory) and considered the methods as generalizable. We also compared average power density spectra with artefacts excluded based on algorithms and expert scoring. Analyses were performed retrospectively. We could reliably identify artefact contaminated epochs in sleep electroencephalogram recordings of two laboratories (healthy participants and patients) reaching good sensitivity (specificity 0.9) with most algorithms. The best performance was obtained using fixed thresholds of the electroencephalogram slope, high-frequency power (25-90 Hz or 45-90 Hz) and residuals of adaptive autoregressive models. Artefacts in electroencephalogram data can be reliably excluded by simple algorithms with good performance, and average electroencephalogram power density spectra with artefact exclusion based on algorithms and manual scoring are very similar in the frequency range relevant for most applications in sleep research and sleep medicine, allowing application to large datasets as needed to address questions related to genetics, epidemiology or precision medicine.

Past work has shown that the efficiency with which the frontostriatal circuit filters out task-irrelevant distracting information is positively correlated with WMC. Recent work has demonstrated a role of posterior alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in providing a sensory gating mechanism. We investigated the relationship between memory load modulation of alpha power and WMC in two verbal working memory experiments. In both experiments, we found that posterior alpha power increased with memory load during memory, in agreement with previous reports. Across individuals, the degree of alpha power modulation by memory load was negatively associated with WMC, namely, the higher the WMC, the less alpha power was modulated by memory load. After the administration of topiramate, a drug known to affect alpha oscillations and have a negative impact on working memory function, the negative correlation between memory load modulation of alpha power and WMC was no longer statistically significant but still somewhat detectable. These results suggest that (1) individuals with low WMC demonstrate stronger alpha power modulation by memory load, reflecting possibly an increased reliance on sensory gating to suppress task-irrelevant information in these individuals, in contrast to their high WMC counterparts who rely more on frontal areas to perform this function and (2) this negative association between memory load modulation of alpha oscillations and WMC is vulnerable to drug-related cognitive disruption.

We explore whether infraslow EEG activity (<0.1 Hz) modulates corticomotor excitability by evaluating the presence of temporal and phase clustering of TMS-induced MEPs. In addition, we evaluate the dependence of MEP amplitude on the phase of the infraslow activity. Twenty-three subjects were stimulated at an intensity above the resting motor threshold (rMT) and ten at the rMT. We evaluated whether temporal and phase clustering of MEP size and MEP generation were present. using 1,0(X) surrogates with a similar amplitude or occurrence distribution. To evaluate the MEP amplitude dependence, we used the least-square method to approximate the linear circular data by fitting a sine function. We observed significant temporal clustering at a group level, in all individual subjects stimulated at rMT and in the majority of those stimulated above rMT, suggesting underlying determinism of corticomotor excitability instead of randomly generated fluctuations. The majority of subjects showed significant phase clustering for MEP size and for MEP occurrence, and significant phase clustering was found at the group level. Furthermore, in approximately one-quarter to one-half of the subjects we found a significant correlation and dependence of MEP amplitude on the phase of infraslow activity, respectively. Although other mechanisms very likely contribute as well, our findings seem to suggest that infraslow activity is involved in the variability of cortical excitability and TMS-induced responses. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cortical excitability measures are highly variable during transcranial magnetic stimulation. Although ongoing brain oscillations are assumed to modulate excitability, no consistent associations are found for the traditional frequency bands. We focus on the role of infraslow EEG activity, defined as rhythms with frequencies < 0.1 Hz. We provide experimental evidence suggesting that infraslow activity most likely modulates corticomotor excitability and that response variation could be reduced when stimulation is targeted at a specific infraslow phase.

We investigated the theta, alpha and beta event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) while holding the forearm in different positions into the PPS of the face. Fifty healthy individuals were subjected to EEG recording while being provided with median nerve electric stimulation at the wrist of the right hand held at different hand-to-face distances. Theta and beta rhythms were significantly perturbed depending on the hand-to-face distance, whereas alpha oscillations reflected a more general, non-specific oscillatory response to the motor task. The perturbation of theta and beta frequency bands may reflect the processes of top-down modulation overseeing the conscious spatiotemporal encoding of sensory-motor information within the PPS. In other words, such perturbation reflects the continuous update of the conscious internal representations of the PPS to build up a purposeful and reflexive motor response.

Optimal repetition time reduction for single subject event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						autoregressive model; EEG-fMRI; event related; fMRI; multiband; simultaneous multislice	RESOLUTION; BRAIN; FMRI	Purpose: Short TRs are increasingly used for fMRI as fast sequences such as simultaneous multislice excitation become available. These have been associated with apparent sensitivity improvements, although greater temporal autocorrelation at shorter TRs can inflate sensitivity measurements leading to uncertainty regarding the optimal approach. Methods: In volunteers (n = 10), the optimal TR was assessed at the single subject level for event-related designs (visual stimulation) with 4 frequencies of presentation at 4 TR values (412-2550 ms). T-values in the visual cortex localized in each individual were obtained and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed by counting voxels within and outside expected task active regions at different thresholds. This analysis was repeated using 4 different autoregressive (AR) models; SPM AR(1) and SPM AR(fast) which globally estimate autocorrelation, and fMRIstat AR(1) and AR(5) that use a local estimate. Results: The use of modest multiband factors of 2 or 3 with a reduction in TR to 1000 +/- 200 ms had greater sensitivity and specificity as shown by higher T-values in visual cortex and ROC analysis. At these TRs, the ROC analysis demonstrated that a local AR model fit improved performance while high order AR models were unnecessary. Conclusions: Modest TR reductions (to 1000 +/- 200 ms) optimally improved event-related fMRI performance independent of design frequency. Autoregressive models with a local as opposed to global fit performed better, while low order autoregressive models were sufficient at the optimal TR.

State-Space Global Coherence to Estimate the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of the Coordinated Brain Activity	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY					Characterizing coordinated brain dynamics present in high-density neural recordings is critical for understanding the neurophysiology of healthy and pathological brain states and to develop principled strategies for therapeutic interventions. In this research, we propose a new modeling framework called State Space Global Coherence (SSGC), which allows us to estimate neural synchrony across distributed brain activity with fine temporal resolution. In this modeling framework, the cross-spectral matrix of neural activity at a specific frequency is defined as a function of a dynamical state variable representing a measure of Global Coherence (GC); we then combine filter-smoother and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate GC and the model parameters. We demonstrate a SSGC analysis in a 64-channel EEG recording of a human subject under general anesthesia and compare the modeling result with empirical measures of GC. We show that SSGC not only attains a finer time resolution but also provides more accurate estimation of GC.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the duration of the symptoms on the cortical activity of women with fibromyalgia using electroencephalogram power spectrum analyses in an eye-closed resting state. Twenty-nine women participated in this cross-sectional study (N: 29; age: 55.59 [9.50]). Theta, alpha, beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3 frequency bands were analyzed using EEGLAB. Theta power significantly correlated with the duration of the symptoms, but not with age. In addition, participants were divided into two groups according to number the years for which they were suffering from fibromyalgia. Participants who had a longer duration of symptoms obtained higher theta power in the frontal (Fp1, F4, F7, F8, and Fz), central (C3, C4, and Cz), and parietal (P3 and Pz) areas than those who had a shorter duration of symptoms, which may be related to brain aging. This exploratory study demonstrates for the first time that the frontal, central, and parietal areas may be influenced by the years in which they were suffering from the symptoms of fibromyalgia. This might indicate that the duration of these symptoms may have a higher impact on brain aging than the actual age of the patient.

Neuronal excitability and damage were also evaluated. Methods: A Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced acute seizure model and a kainic acid (KA)-induced temporal epilepsy model were used in adult mice. The mice were given tenidap 30 min before PTZ injection or were given tenidap for 7 days after entering the chronic stage of the KA model. Video monitoring and EEG recordings were performed for comparisons. Immunofluorescence of c-fos was detected in the PTZ model, and Nissl staining was performed in the KA model. Results: Tenidap intervention significantly reduced the duration and severity of PTZ-induced acute seizures, which conformed with the power-spectrum analyses of the EEG and the quantification of spikes on EEG. c-fos expression representing neuronal excitability was also reduced with tenidap pretreatment. However, the latency time to seizure onset was unaltered. Seven days of tenidap treatment in the chronic KA model significantly attenuated seizure and spike frequencies compared to the same animal before administration. Nissl staining showed reduced hilar neuron loss in the tenidap-intervention group but showed no difference in the width of the granule cell layer. Conclusion: To our knowledge, few studies have reported the relevance of Kir2.3 to epilepsy. The present data suggested that activation of Kir2.3 exerts an anticonvulsant effect in acute seizures and the chronic stage of TLE, which makes this channel a potent therapeutic target.

This study examined frontal midline theta deficits in patients with heroin dependence during a Go/No-go task which explicitly involved cognitive control. Electroencephalography readings were collected from 15 male heroin addicts and 17 demographically matched healthy controls during an equal probability Go/No-go task. The findings revealed that heroin addicts responded significantly slower to the Go stimulus as compared to the healthy control. Heroin addicts also showed less frontal midline theta modulations between the Go and No-go conditions. These findings provided further evidence toward understanding the nature of drug addiction-related cognitive dysfunction. Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

Measures of both abilities are impaired by anxiety, which is often inversely linked with mindfulness. It has been shown that a combination of high mindfulness and low anxiety is associated with better conflict control and WMC. The current study explored the electrophysiology related to such behavioral differences. Two experimental groups, one with high mindfulness and low anxiety (HMLA) and one with low mindfulness and high anxiety (LMHA), performed a color Stroop task and a change detection task, both with simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. An advanced EEG analytical approach, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) analysis, was employed. This is regarded as a robust method to analyze non-linear and non-stationary signals. Lower delta activity at posterior temporal and occipital regions was seen in the HMLA group for the Stroop conflict conditions and might be generally associated with higher accuracy in this group and indicative of higher attentiveness. Higher accuracy rates and WMC were seen in the HMLA group and might be specifically associated with the higher alpha activity observed in prefrontal cortex, fronto-central and centro-parietal regions in this group. Future studies should explore how mindfulness and anxiety can independently affect these cognitive functions and their associated neurophysiology.

This study aims at investigating the potential mechanism of period doubling (PD) (subharmonic generation) in human steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) by using a mathematical model. Approach. Robinson's Corticothalamic Model, which includes three main neuronal populations (cortical, thalamic reticular, and thalamic relay neurons) was employed. SSVEP experiments were simulated using this model and dependence of PD behavior in relation to the values of model parameters was investigated. The feedback loop in the model that is responsible for the generation of subharmonic components was thus identified, and this loop was isolated from the rest of the model and analyzed with a describing function approach. Main Results. It has been found in general, for a wide range of parameter values, that if the excitation frequency or half of it is close to the native oscillation frequency of the system, the native oscillation ceases to exist and oscillations at either the excitation frequency or half of it are observed. This observation is in line with the experimental findings except for some discrepancies which are also discussed. The intrathalamic feedback loop is identified to be the potential source of subharmonic oscillations. When isolated from the rest of the model and simulated by itself, it has been found that this feedback loop can show a resonance phenomenon at the subharmonic frequency. By deriving a set of equations based on the necessary conditions for a resonance phenomenon, a semi-analytical method was developed by which one can predict the existence of subharmonic generation for a given set of parameters and stimulus frequency. Significance. This study is the first model-based investigation of the mechanism of subharmonic oscillations. The proposed semi-analytical method can replace extensive time and memory consuming parameter sweep studies.

Action video game players require greater EEG coupling between prefrontal cortices to adequately perform a dual task	ENTERTAINMENT COMPUTING			English	Article						Working memory; Dual task; EEG correlation; Frontopolar and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices	WORKING-MEMORY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ATTENTION; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; ALPHA; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION	Action video games require the ability to perform multiple complex activities concurrently, while dual-tasking has been associated with functional changes in sub-regions of the prefrontal cortex, such as the frontopolar (FPPC) and dorsolateral (DLPC) cortices. However, the degree of electroencephalographic synchronization or correlation (rEEG) between these areas has not yet been examined. Thus, the aim of the present study was to characterize rEEG of action video game players (AVGPs) and compare it to inexperienced video game players (NVGPs) during performance of a dual working memory task. rEEG were recorded in AVGPs and NVGPs while performing three distinct working memory tasks: (1) Corsi block-tapping task (CBTT); (2) N-back task; and (3) dual task, which involved performing both CBTT and N-back tasks simultaneously. AVGPs achieved a higher number of correct trials and greater memory span during the dual task than NVGPs, as well as an increased intrahemispheric FPPC-DLPC rEEG, left (Fp1-F3) and right (Fp2-F4), in the beta1, beta2 and gamma bands, and an increased interhemispheric rEEG FPPC (Fp1-Fp2) in all EEG bands. Our results suggest that AVGPs had higher working memory skills as the level of task complex increased, and that they required higher FPPC-DLPC coupling to adequately perform the dual task.

This impairment might stem from deficient motivation processes, in addition to reduced reward sensitivity. In this study, we recorded 64-channel EEG in a large cohort of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients and matched healthy controls (HC) while they performed a standard RL task. Participants were asked to discover, by trial and error, several hidden stimulus-response associations having different reward probabilities, as enforced using evaluative feedback. We extracted induced fronto-midline Theta (FMT) power time-locked to the response and feedback as neurophysiological index of RL. Furthermore, we assessed approach-related motivation by measuring frontal alpha asymmetry concurrently. At the behavioral level, MDD patients and HCs showed comparable RL. At the EEG level, FMT power systematically varied as a function of reward probability, with opposing effects found at the response and feedback levels. Although this global pattern was spared in MDD, at the feedback level these patients showed however a steep FMT power decrease across trials when reward probability was low. Moreover, they showed impaired approach-related motivation during task execution, as reflected by frontal Alpha asymmetry. These results suggest a dissociation between (globally spared) RL and (impaired) approach motivation in MDD.

Thought and language disorders typical of schizophrenia are presumably connected with the aberrant ability to filter out irrelevant associations. We hypothesized that EEG biomarkers in healthy population could be detected, extracted and validated with regard to the ability to abstract a general principle underlying presented words while ignoring irrelevant associations and retaining only relevant ones. We developed three models of abstract reasoning: a direct generalization presented by nouns from the same semantic category, a latent association based on a loose relation between the presented words, and no associations introduced by non-related words. In the present EEG study 17 healthy participants solved tasks trying to figure out a general principle in a group of words. Subsequently, we carried out a functional connectivity analysis in order to restore synchronous neuronal interactions in the theta-alpha frequency range. We used the obtained spatial patters restored individually and relevant phase locking values (PLVs) as features for the Support Vector Machine classifier with Gaussian kernel. The accuracy rating validated on an independent sample made up 62.5% which is a promising result if inter-subject variability in cognitive processing is taken into account. Being validated on the same sample, the accuracy reached 82%. The results indicate that spatial patterns of functional connectivity and PLVs can be used as predictors of types of abstract reasoning.

Dynamics of sleep spindles and coupling to slow oscillations following motor learning in adult mice	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Rotarod; Motor learning; Spindles; Slow oscillation; Delta waves; Coupling	WAVE SLEEP; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL RIPPLES; DEPENDENT CHANGES; REM-SLEEP; PLASTICITY; TASK; REACTIVATION; SUPPRESSION; INCREASES	Sleep spindles have been implicated in motor learning in human subjects, but their occurrence, timing in relation to cortical slow oscillations, and relationship to offline gains in motor learning have not been examined in animal models. In this study, we recorded EEG over bilateral primary motor cortex in conjunction with EMG for 24 h following a period of either baseline handling or following rotarod motor learning to monitor sleep. We measured several biophysical properties of sleep spindles and their temporal coupling with cortical slow oscillations (SO, < 1 Hz) and cortical delta waves (1-4 Hz). Following motor learning, we found an increase in spindles during an early period of NREM sleep (1-4 h) without changes to biophysical properties such as spindle power, peak frequency and coherence. In this same period of early NREM sleep, both SO and delta power increased after motor learning. Notably, a vast majority of spindles were associated with minimal SO power, but in the subset that were associated with significant SO power ( > 1 z-score above the population mean), spindle-associated SO power was greater in spindles following motor learning compared to baseline sleep. Also, we did not observe a group-level preferred phase in spindle-SO or spindle-delta coupling. While SO power alone was not predictive of motor performance in early NREM sleep, both spindle density and the difference in the magnitude of the mean resultant vector length of the phase angle for SO-associated spindles, a measure of its coupling precision, were positively correlated with offline change in motor performance. These findings support a role for sleep spindles and their coupling to slow oscillations in motor learning and establish a model in which spindle timing and the brain circuits that support offline plasticity can be mechanistically explored.

Neural indicators of perceptual variability of pain across species	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						pain; individual variability; gamma oscillations; neural marker; human	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG RESPONSES; HUMAN BRAIN; C-FIBER; A-DELTA; OSCILLATIONS; REFLECT; STIMULATION; SENSITIVITY; MODULATION	Individuals exhibit considerable and unpredictable variability in painful percepts in response to the same nociceptive stimulus. Previous work has found neural responses that, while not necessarily responsible for the painful percepts themselves, can still correlate well with intensity of pain perception within a given individual. However, there is no reliable neural response reflecting the variability in pain perception across individuals. Here, we use an electrophysiological approach in humans and rodents to demonstrate that brain oscillations in the gamma band [gamma-band event-related synchronization (gamma-ERS)] sampled by central electrodes reliably predict pain sensitivity across individuals. We observed a clear dissociation between the large number of neural measures that reflected subjective pain ratings at within-subject level but not across individuals, and gamma-ERS, which reliably distinguished subjective ratings within the same individual but also coded pain sensitivity across different individuals. Importantly, the ability of gamma-ERS to track pain sensitivity across individuals was selective because it did not track the between-subject reported intensity of nonpainful but equally salient auditory, visual, and nonnociceptive somatosensory stimuli. These results also demonstrate that graded neural activity related to within-subject variability should be minimized to accurately investigate the relationship between nociceptive-evoked neural activities and pain sensitivity across individuals.

For episodic memory, learning of competing information upon reactivation either integrates the new information into the reactivated memory or disrupts the reactivated memory directly, but the two effects were found in distinct experimental paradigms and their neural mechanisms are largely unknown. The current study explored the effects and neural mechanisms of episodic memory reactivation using behavioural and MEG techniques. Taking advantage of an independent-cue retrieval procedure, we revealed both the integration and the forgetting effects by a single post-reactivation interference paradigm. However, while the integration effect followed the reconsolidation window, the forgetting effect did not, suggesting only the integration effect being caused by memory reconsolidation. MEG measurements further revealed beta-band power decrease during reactivation and alpha-band power decrease during post-reactivation interference, both of which parametrically predicted the degree of memory integration. But neither the beta nor the alpha desynchronization was related to the forgetting of the original memory. Our results suggest original memory forgetting and new information integration happen in different time periods after memory reactivation, and beta and alpha desynchronizations underlie reconsolidation-mediated episodic memory updating.

Methods: Computer simulations were made for a pathological model in which Alzheimer's disease was simulated by synaptic degradation in the hippocampus. Pathology modeling was based on sequentially turning off the connections with entorhinal cortex layer 2 (EC2) and the dentate gyrus on CA3 pyramidal neurons. Gamma induction modeling consisted of simulating the oscillation provided by the septo-hippocampal pathway with band frequencies from 40-130 Hz. Pathological models with and without gamma induction were compared with a control. Results: In the hippocampal regions of DG, CA3, and CA1, and jointly DG-CA3-CA1 and CA3-CA1, gamma induction resulted in a statistically significant improvement in terms of increased numbers of spikes, spikes per burst, and burst duration as compared with the model simulating Alzheimer's disease (AD). The positive maximal Lyapunov exponent was negative in both the control model and the one with gamma induction as opposed to the pathological model where it was positive within the DG-CA3-CA1 region. Gamma induction resulted in decreased transfer entropy in accordance with the information flow in DG -> CA3 and CA3 -> CA1. Conclusions: The results of simulation studies show that inducing gamma oscillations in the hippocampus may reduce Alzheimer's disease related pathology. Pathologically higher transfer entropy values after gamma induction returned to values comparable to the control model.

In this study, a new CAD system based on EEG signals was developed. The motivation for the development of the CAD system was to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) disease during covert visual attention tasks. It is worth noting that research of this kind on the efficacy of attention tasks is limited in scope for MS patients; therefore, it is vital to develop a feature of EEG to characterize the patient's state with high sensitivity and specificity. Methods: We evaluated the use of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of EEG signals to diagnose MS. It is assumed that the role of PAC for information encoding during visual attention in MS is greatly unknown; therefore, we made an attempt to investigate it via CAD systems. The EEG signals were recorded from healthy and MS patients while performing new visual attention tasks. Machine learning algorithms were also used to identify the EEG signals as to whether the disease existed or not. The challenge regarding the dimensionality of the extracted features was addressed through selecting the relevant and efficient features using T-test and Bhattacharyya distance criteria, and the validity of the system was assessed through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method. Results: Our findings indicated that online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) classifier with T-test feature selection method yielded peak accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in both color and direction tasks. These values were 91%, 83% and 96% for color task, and 90%, 82% and 96% for the direction task. Conclusions: Based on the results, it can be concluded that this procedure can be used for the automatic diagnosis of early MS, and can also facilitate the treatment assessment in patients.

Seizure localization using pre ictal phase-amplitude coupling in intracranial electroencephalography	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; HIGH GAMMA	Understanding changes in brain rhythms provides useful information to predict the onset of a seizure and to localize its onset zone in epileptic patients. Brain rhythms dynamics in general, and phase-amplitude coupling in particular, are known to be drastically altered during epileptic seizures. However, the neural processes that take place before a seizure are not well understood. We analysed the phase-amplitude coupling dynamics of stereoelectroencephalography recordings (30 seizures, 5 patients) before and after seizure onset. Electrodes near the seizure onset zone showed higher phase-amplitude coupling. Immediately before the beginning of the seizure, phase-amplitude coupling dropped to values similar to the observed in electrodes far from the seizure onset zone. Thus, our results bring accurate information to detect epileptic events during pre-ictal periods and to delimit the zone of seizure onset in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.

Methods: EEG was recorded while 21 control participants and 21 patients with SCZ performed emotional framing tasks (assessing a key aspect of emotion regulation (ER)) before and after a laboratory stress challenge (Trier Social Stress Test). EEG spectral perturbations evoked in response to neutral and aversive stimuli (presented with positive or negative contextual cues) were extracted in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) frequencies. Results: Patients demonstrated aberrant theta and beta oscillatory activity, with impaired frontal theta-mediated framing and beta-derived motivated attention processes relative to controls. Following stress exposure, controls exhibited impaired frontal theta-mediated emotional framing, similar to the oscillatory profile observed in patients before stress. Conclusions: The acute stress-induced oscillatory changes observed in controls were persistently present in patients, indicating an inefficiency of fronto-limbic adaptation to stress exposure. Significance: Results provide novel insight on the electrophysiological correlates of arousal and affect regulation, which are core homogeneous symptom dimensions shared across neuropsychiatric disorders, and shed light on putative mechanisms in the translation of stress into psychopathology.

In addition, abnormality in a neurophysiological phenomenon labeled sensory attenuation has been found in patients with PD. The current study explored the hypothesis that the abnormal sensory attenuation has a causal link with the typical abnormality in beta oscillations in PD. Methods: The study tested sixteen right-handed patients with a diagnosis of PD and 22 healthy participants, which were matched by age and gender. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited through electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Electrical activity was recorded at the scalp using a 128 channels EEG. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in 2 conditions: at rest and at the onset of a voluntary movement, which was a self-paced abduction movement of the right thumb. Results: Healthy participants showed a reduction of the N20-P25 amplitude at the onset of the right thumb abduction compared to the rest condition (P < 0.05). When patients were OFF medication, they showed mild reduction of the N20-P25 component at movement onset (P < 0.05). On the contrary, they did show greater attenuation of the N20-P25 component at the onset of movement compared to the rest condition when ON medication (P < 0.05). There was no significant evidence of a link between the degree of sensory attenuation and the change in beta oscillations in our cohort of patients. Conclusion: These results confirmed a significant link between dopaminergic modulation and sensory attenuation. However, the sensory attenuation and beta oscillations were found as two independent phenomena.

This trial-by-trial neural variability is dramatically reduced ("quenched") after the presentation of sensory stimuli. Likewise, the power of neural oscillations, primarily in the alpha-beta band, is also reduced after stimulus onset. Despite their similarity, these phenomena have so far been studied and discussed independently. We hypothesized that the two phenomena are tightly coupled in electrophysiological recordings of large cortical neural populations. To test this, we examined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of healthy subjects viewing repeated presentations of a visual stimulus. The timing, amplitude, and spatial topography of variability-quenching and power-suppression were remarkably similar. Neural variability quenching was eliminated by excluding the alpha-beta band from the recordings, but not by excluding other frequency-bands. Moreover, individual magnitudes of alphabeta band-power explained 86% of between-subject differences in variability quenching. An alternative mechanism that may generate variability quenching is increased phase alignment across trials. However, changes in inter-trial-phase-coherence (ITPC) exhibited distinct timing and no correlations with the magnitude of variability quenching in individual participants. These results reveal that neural variability quenching is tightly coupled with stimulus-induced changes in the power of alpha-beta band oscillations, associating two phenomena that have so far been studied in isolation.

Because olfaction is an ancient sensory system that provided a template for brain evolution, we hypothesized that this link persisted, and therefore nasal inhalations may also tune the brain for acquisition of non-olfactory information. To test this, we measured nasal airflow and electroencephalography during various non-olfactory cognitive tasks. We observed that participants spontaneously inhale at non-olfactory cognitive task onset and that such inhalations shift brain functional network architecture. Concentrating on visuospatial perception, we observed that nasal inhalation drove increased task-related brain activity in specific task-related brain regions and resulted in improved performance accuracy in the visuospatial task. Thus, mental processes with no link to olfaction are nevertheless phase-locked with nasal inhalation, consistent with the notion of an olfaction-based template in the evolution of human brain function.

Modulation of large-scale cortical coupling by transcranial alternating current stimulation	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Noninvasive brain stimulation; Alpha oscillation; Functional connectivity; Electroencephalogram; Spike-timing dependent plasticity	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Background: Long-range functional connectivity in the brain is considered fundamental for cognition and is known to be altered in many neuropsychiatric disorders. To modify such coupling independent of sensory input, noninvasive brain stimulation could be of utmost value. Objective: First, we tested if transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is able to influence functional connectivity in the human brain. Second, we investigated the specificity of effects in frequency and space. Methods: Participants were stimulated bifocally with high-definition tACS in counterbalanced order (1) in-phase, with identical electric fields in both hemispheres, (2) anti-phase, with phase-reversed electric fields in the two hemispheres, and (3) jittered-phase, generated by subtle frequency shifts continuously changing the phase relation between the two fields. EEG aftereffects were analyzed systematically in sensor and source space. Results: While total power and spatial distribution of the fields were comparable between conditions, global pre-post stimulation changes in EEG connectivity were larger after in-phase stimulation than after anti-phase or jittered-phase stimulation. Those differences in connectivity were restricted to the stimulated frequency band and decayed within the first 120 s after stimulation offset. Source reconstruction localized the maximum effect between the stimulated occipito-parietal areas. Conclusion: The relative phase of bifocal alpha-tACS modulated alpha-band connectivity between the targeted regions. As side effects are not expected to differ between the stimulation conditions, we conclude that neural activity was phase-specifically influenced by the electric fields. We thus suggest bifocal high-definition tACS as a tool to manipulate long-range cortico-cortical coupling which outlasts the stimulation period. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although research has shown that we spend a substantial amount of time focused on thoughts and feelings that are intrinsically generated, evaluating such internal states, purely on psychological grounds can be restrictive. In this review of the different methods used to examine patterns of ongoing thought, we emphasise how the process of triangulation between neuroimaging techniques, with self-reported information, is important for the development of a more empirically grounded account of ongoing thought. Specifically, we show how imaging techniques have provided critical information regarding the presence of covert states and can help in the attempt to identify different aspects of experience.

Electrophysiological indices of anterior cingulate cortex function reveal changing levels of cognitive effort and reward valuation that sustain task performance	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Sustained effort; Reward valuation; Cognitive control; Anterior cingulate cortex; Electrophysiology	FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; MENTAL FATIGUE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; FEEDBACK; PREDICTION; DEPRESSION; MOTIVATION; BEHAVIOR; OSCILLATIONS	Successful execution of goal-directed behaviors often requires the deployment of cognitive control, which is thought to require cognitive effort. Recent theories have proposed that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) regulates control levels by weighing the reward-related benefits of control against its effort-related costs. However, given that the sensations of cognitive effort and reward valuation are available only to introspection, this hypothesis is difficult to investigate empirically. We have proposed that two electrophysiological indices of ACC function, frontal midline theta and the reward positivity (RewP), provide objective measures of these functions. To explore this issue, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from participants engaged in an extended, cognitively-demanding task. Participants performed a time estimation task for 2 h in which they received reward and error feedback according to their task performance. We observed that the amplitude of the RewP, a feedback-locked component of the event related brain potential associated with reward processing, decreased with time-on-task. Conversely, frontal midline theta power, which consists of 4-8 Hz EEG oscillations associated with cognitive effort, increased with time-on-task. We also explored how these phenomena changed over time by conducting within-participant multi-level modeling analyses. Our results suggest that extended execution of a cognitively-demanding task is characterized by an early phase in which high control levels foster rapid improvements in task performance, and a later phase in which high control levels were necessary to maintain stable task performance, perhaps counteracting waning reward valuation.

Cerebellar neurostimulation thus likely affects cortical circuits, as has been shown in studies using cerebellar stimulation to treat neurological disorders through modulation of frontal EEG oscillations. Here we studied the effects of different frequencies of cerebellar stimulation on oscillations and coherence in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Local field potentials were recorded in the right lateral cerebellum (Crus I/II) and bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex (frontal association area, FrA) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Stimulation was delivered to the cerebellar vermis (lobule VII) using single pulses (0.2 Hz for 60 s), or repeated pulses at 1 Hz (30 s), 5 Hz (10 s), 25 Hz (2 s), and 50 Hz (1 s). Effects of stimulation were influenced by the initial state of EEG activity which varies over time during urethane-anesthesia; 1 Hz stimulation was more effective when delivered during the slow-wave state (Stage 1), while stimulation with single-pulse, 25, and 50 Hz showed stronger effects during the activated state (Stage 2). Single-pulses resulted in increases in oscillatory power in the delta and theta bands for the cerebellum, and in frequencies up to 80 Hz in cortical sites. 1 Hz stimulation induced a decrease in 0-30 Hz activity and increased activity in the 30-200 Hz range, in the right FrA. 5 Hz stimulation reduced power in high frequencies in Stage 1 and induced mixed effects during Stage 2. 25 Hz stimulation increased cortical power at low frequencies during Stage 2, and increased power in higher frequency bands during Stage 1. Stimulation at 50 Hz increased delta-band power in all recording sites, with the strongest and most rapid effects in the cerebellum. 25 and 50 Hz stimulation also induced state-dependent effects on cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical coherence at high frequencies. Cerebellar stimulation can therefore entrain field potential activity in the FrA and drive synchronization of cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical networks in a frequency-dependent manner. These effects highlight the role of the cerebellar vermis in modulating large-scale synchronization of neural networks in non-motor frontal cortex.

However, the neurophysiological correlates of these effects are unclear. The present study addressed the question whether neural activity in the prefrontal cortex could be modulated by 10 Hz tACS and how this would affect phonological decisions. Methods: In three sessions, 24 healthy participants received tACS at 10 Hz or 16.18 Hz (control frequency) or sham stimulation over the bilateral prefrontal cortex before task processing. Resting state EEG was recorded before and after tACS. We also recorded EEG during task processing. Results: Relative to sham stimulation, 10 Hz tACS significantly facilitated phonological response speed. This effect was task-specific as tACS did not affect a simple control task. Moreover, 10 Hz tACS significantly increased theta power during phonological decisions. The individual increase in theta power was positively correlated with the behavioral facilitation after 10 Hz tACS. Conclusion: Our results show a facilitation of phonological decisions after 10 Hz tACS over the bilateral prefrontal cortex. This might indicate that 10 Hz tACS increased task-related activity in the stimulated area to a level that was optimal for phonological performance. The significant correlation with the individual increase in theta power suggests that the behavioral facilitation might be related to increased theta power during language processing.

In the first part of this review, we describe, in a unified mathematical framework, a large set of metrics used to estimate MEG functional connectivity at the same or at different frequencies. The different metrics are presented according to their characteristics: same-frequency or cross-frequency, univariate or multivariate, directed or undirected. We focus on phase coupling metrics given that phase coupling of neuronal oscillations is a putative mechanism for inter-areal communication, and that MEG is an ideal tool to non-invasively detect such coupling. In the second part of this review, we present examples of the use of specific phase methods on real MEG data in the context of resting state, visuospatial attention and working memory. Overall, the results of the studies provide evidence for frequency specific and/or cross-frequency brain circuits which partially overlap with brain networks as identified by hemodynamic-based imaging techniques, such as functional Magnetic Resonance (fMRI). Additionally, the relation of these functional brain circuits to anatomy and to behavior highlights the usefulness of MEG phase coupling in systems neuroscience studies. In conclusion, we believe that the field of MEG functional connectivity has made substantial steps forward in the recent years and is now ready for bringing the study of brain networks to a more mechanistic understanding.

Here, we test whether electrically stimulating frontal and parietal regions at the frequency of interaction is effective in modulating working memory. We identify working memory nodes that are functionally connected in theta and alpha frequency bands and intracranially stimulate both nodes simultaneously in participants performing working memory tasks. We find that in-phase stimulation results in improvements in performance compared to sham stimulation. In addition, in-phase stimulation results in decreased phase lag between regions within working memory network, while anti-phase stimulation results in increased phase lag, suggesting that shorter phase lag in oscillatory connectivity may lead to better performance. The results support the idea that phase lag may play a key role in information transmission across brain regions. Thus, brain stimulation strategies to improve cognition may require targeting multiple nodes of brain networks.

We recently identified a "fingerprint" of the EZ as a time-frequency pattern that is defined by a combination of preictal spike(s), fast oscillatory activity, and concurrent suppression of lower frequencies. Here we examine the generalizability of the fingerprint in application to an independent series of patients (11 seizure-free and 13 non-seizure-free after surgery) and show that the fingerprint can also be identified in seizures with lower frequency (such as beta) oscillatory activity. In the seizure-free group, only 5 of 47 identified EZ contacts were outside the resection. In contrast, in the non-seizure-free group, 104 of 142 identified EZ contacts were outside the resection. We integrated the fingerprint prediction with the subject's MR images, thus providing individualized anatomical estimates of the EZ. We show that these fingerprint-based estimates in seizure-free patients are almost always inside the resection. On the other hand, for a large fraction of the nonseizure-free patients the estimated EZ was not well localized and was partially or completely outside the resection, which may explain surgical failure in such cases. We also show that when mapping fast activity alone onto MR images, the EZ was often over-estimated, indicating a reduced discriminative ability for fast activity relative to the full fingerprint for localization of the EZ.

Methods: Twenty-two children with CSWS were prospectively enrolled and received methylprednisolone therapy. Interictal scalp HFOs, spike wave index (SWI) and intelligence quotient (IQ) were assessed before and after the treatment. The children were divided into two groups based on the early seizure reduction ratio at 2 weeks 50%, "response group"; otherwise "non-response group"). The "response group" was further divided into two subgroups ("relapse" and "non-relapse" subgroups) according to the late seizure outcome (after 3 months). Results: Interictal HFOs and electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) (defined as SWI >= 85%) were detected in all children at the baseline. In the response with relapse group (n = 11), the detection ratio of HFOs was significantly higher than that of ESES at 2 weeks (81.2 vs. 27.3%), 3 months (90.9 vs. 36.4%), and 6 months (100 vs. 54.5%) post-therapy. In the non-response group (n = 4), both HFOs and ESES persisted in all children. The average IQ improved significantly only in the response with non-relapse group. The persistence of HFOs negatively correlated with both the average IQ, yet the persistence of ESES did not. Conclusion: Interictal scalp HFOs may be a favorable non-invasive biomarker of predicting seizure and cognitive outcome in CSWS.

However, it is still unknown how they might be related with the architecture of the brain. A recent study has proved the relevance of the imagined activity when investigating neuronal diseases by comparing variations in the neuronal activity of patients with brain diseases and healthy subjects. One important aspect of the scientific methodologies focused on neuronal diseases is therefore to provide a trustable methodology that could allow us to distinguish between realized and imagined activities in the brain. The electroencephalogram is the result of synchronized action of the cerebrum, and our end is portraying the network dynamics through the neuronal responses when the subjects perform visuomotor and specific imaginary assignments. We use a subtle information theoretical approach accounting for the time causality of the signal and the closeness centrality of the different nodes. More specifically we perform estimations of the probability distribution of the data associated to each node using the Bandt and Pompe approach to account for the causality of the electroencephalographic signals. We calculate the Jensen-Shannon distance across different nodes, and then we quantify how fast the information flow would be through a given node to other nodes computing the closeness centrality. We perform a statistical analysis to compare the closeness centrality considering the different rhythmic oscillation bands for each node taking into account imagined and visuomotor tasks. Our discoveries stress the pertinence of the alpha band while performing and distinguishing the specific imaginary or visuomotor assignments.

GBO are modulated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter, which is continuously discussed to shape the complex symptom spectrum in schizophrenia. The current study examined the effects of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, on the auditory-evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) and psychopathological outcomes in healthy volunteers to investigate neuronal mechanisms of psychotic behavior. In a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, the aeGBR power, phase-locking factor (PLF) during a choice reaction task, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale were assessed in 25 healthy subjects. Ketamine was applied in a subanaesthetic dose. Lowresolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for EEG source localization. Significant reductions of the aeGBR power and PLF were identified under ketamine administration compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Source-space analysis of aeGBR generators revealed significantly reduced current source density (CSD) within the anterior cingulate cortex during ketamine administration. Ketamine induced an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01) and increased response times (p < 0.001) and error rates (p < 0.01). Only negative symptoms were significantly associated with an aeGBR power decrease (p = 0.033) as revealed by multiple linear regression. These findings argue for a substantial role of the glutamate system in the mediation of dysfunctional gamma band responses and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia and are compatible with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia.

Behavioral, Neurochemical and Brain Oscillation Abnormalities in an Experimental Model of Acute Liver Failure	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hepatic encephalopathy; acute liver failure; brain dysfunction; glutamatergic system; behavior; neurochemical oscillation	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS; AMMONIA; RATS; ENCEPHALOPATHY; HYPERAMMONEMIA; MANAGEMENT; CIRRHOSIS; NEUROTRANSMISSION; TRANSPLANTATION	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) represents a brain dysfunction caused by both acute and chronic liver failures, and its severity deeply affects the prognosis of patients with impaired liver function. In its pathophysiology, ammonia levels and glutamatergic system hyperactivity seem to play a pivotal role in the disruption of brain homeostasis. Here, we investigate important outcomes involved in behavioral performance, electroencephalographic patterns, and neurochemical parameters to better characterize the well-accepted animal model of acute liver failure (ALF) induced by subtotal hepatectomy (92% removal of tissue) that produces ALF. This study was divided into three cohorts: (1) rats clinically monitored after hepatectomy every 6 h for 96 h or until death; (2) rats tested in an open-field task (OFT) before and after surgery and had blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain tissue collected after the last OFT; and (3) rats that had continuous EEGs recorded before and after surgery for 3 days. The hepatectomized rats presented significant motor behavioral changes accompanied by important abnormalities in classical blood laboratory parameters of ALF, and EEG features suggestive of HE and deep disturbances in the brain glutamatergic system. Using an animal model of ALF induced via subtotal hepatectomy, this work provides a comprehensive and reliable experimental model that increases the opportunity for studying the effects of new treatment strategies to be explored in an unprecedented way. It also presents insights into the pathophysiology of HE in a reproducible model of ALF, which correlates important neurochemical and EEG aspects of the syndrome. (C) 2018 IBRO.

Forming temporal expectations and continuously matching them with perceptual input can facilitate this process. In humans, temporal expectations are typically assessed using behavioral measures, which provide only retrospective but no real-time estimates during target anticipation, or by using electrophysiological measures, which require extensive preprocessing and are difficult to interpret. Here we show a new correlate of temporal expectations based on oculomotor behavior. Observers performed an orientation-discrimination task on a central grating target, while their gaze position and EEG were monitored. In each trial, a cue preceded the target by a varying interval ("foreperiod"). In separate blocks, the cue was either predictive or non-predictive regarding the timing of the target. Results showed that saccades and blinks were inhibited more prior to an anticipated regular target than a less-anticipated irregular one. This consistent oculomotor inhibition effect enabled a trial-by-trial classification according to interval-regularity. Additionally, in the regular condition the slope of saccade-rate and drift were shallower for longer than shorter foreperiods, indicating their adjustment according to temporal expectations. Comparing the sensitivity of this oculomotor marker with those of other common predictability markers (e.g. alpha-suppression) showed that it is a sensitive marker for cue-related anticipation. In contrast, temporal changes in conditional probabilities (hazard-rate) modulated alpha-suppression more than cue-related anticipation. We conclude that pre-target oculomotor inhibition is a correlate of temporal predictions induced by cue-target associations, whereas alpha-suppression is more sensitive to conditional probabilities across time.

Comprehensive sleep monitoring and analysis using multivariate polysomnography (PSG) records has achieved significant efforts to prevent sleep-related disorders. To alleviate the time consumption caused by manual visual inspection of PSG, automatic multivariate sleep stage classification has become an important research topic in medical and bioinformatics. Results We present a unified hybrid self-attention deep learning framework, namely HybridAtt, to automatically classify sleep stages by capturing channel and temporal correlations from multivariate PSG records. We construct a new multi-view convolutional representation module to learn channel-specific and global view features from the heterogeneous PSG inputs. The hybrid attention mechanism is designed to further fuse the multi-view features by inferring their dependencies without any additional supervision. The learned attentional representation is subsequently fed through a softmax layer to train an end-to-end deep learning model. Conclusions We empirically evaluate our proposed HybridAtt model on a benchmark PSG dataset in two feature domains, referred to as the time and frequency domains. Experimental results show that HybridAtt consistently outperforms ten baseline methods in both feature spaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of HybridAtt in the task of sleep stage classification.

J	Steinmann, S; Leicht, G; Mulert, C				Steinmann, Saskia; Leicht, Gregor; Mulert, Christoph			The interhemispheric miscommunication theory of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory verbal hallucinations; Schizophrenia; Interhemispheric miscommunication theory; Gamma band oscillations; NMDA receptor hypofunction; Glutamate-GABA deficits	LONG-RANGE SYNCHRONY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; GLUTAMATE; KETAMINE; SYMPTOMS; HEALTHY; SPEECH; CORTEX; 1ST-EPISODE	Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia and have been linked to abnormal activation, connectivity and integration within the auditory, language, and memory brain networks. The interhemispheric miscommunication theory of AVH is based on a steadily growing number of studies using a variety of modalities (EEG, fMRI, DTI) reporting that both altered integrity of the interhemispheric auditory pathways and disturbed functional gamma-band synchrony between right and left auditory cortices significantly contribute to abnormal auditory processing and the emergence of AVH. Moreover, initial studies using pharmacological EEG and H-1 MR spectroscopy provided first insights into the underlying neurochemistry of AVH. It has been suggested that the observed interhemispheric gamma-band alterations might be mediated by an excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance due to dysfunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). In support, a potential NMDAR hypofunction is proposed to be compensated by increased levels of glutamate in prefrontal and auditory brain areas. In this mini-review paper, we used the levels of explanation approach and present how interhemispheric brain connectivity (brain-imaging level) corresponds to auditory perception (cognitive level), and eventually how these parameters are related to changes in neurotransmission (cellular level) and to the occurrence of AVH (clinical level). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first overview that overcomes traditional boundaries and presents converging evidence from different levels of knowledge that validate and support each other, and particularly point toward the role of an interhemispheric miscommunication in AVH.

Medial septal stimulation increases seizure threshold and improves cognition in epileptic rats	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Deep brain stimulation; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Medial septal nucleus; Theta oscillations; Pilocarpine	DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA RHYTHM; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MEMORY ENHANCEMENT; SPATIAL MEMORY; PILOCARPINE; OSCILLATIONS; WORKING; MODULATION; DEFICITS	Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy is most prevalent among focal epilepsies, and nearly one-third of patients are refractory to pharmacological intervention. Persistent cognitive and neurobehavioral comorbidities also occur due to the recurrent nature of seizures and medication-related side effects. Hypothesis: Electrical neuromodulation is an effective strategy to reduce seizures both in animal models and clinically, but its efficacy to modulate cognition remains unclear. We hypothesized that theta frequency stimulation of the medial septum would increase septohippocampal oscillations, increase seizure threshold, and improve spatial learning in a rat model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Methods: Sham and pilocarpine rats were implanted with electrodes in the medial septum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. EEG was assessed days prior to and following stimulation. Sham and pilocarpine-treated rats received either no stimulation, continuous (throughout each behavior), or pre-task (one minute prior to each behavior) 7.7 Hz septal stimulation during the Barnes maze spatial navigation test and also during assessment of flurothyl-induced seizures. Results: Both continuous and pre-task stimulation prevented epilepsy-associated reductions in theta oscillations over time. Additionally, both stimulation paradigms significantly improved spatial navigation in the Barnes maze, reducing latency and improving search strategy. Moreover, stimulation led to significant increases in seizure threshold in pilocarpine-treated rats. There was no evidence of cognitive enhancement or increased seizure threshold in stimulated sham rats. Conclusion: These findings have profound implications as theta stimulation of the septum represents a single frequency and target that has the potential to both improve cognition and reduce seizures for patients with refractory epilepsy.

Pre-training is common to carry out before each experiment, which affects the practicability of the EEC system. In order to solve this problem, the most feasible method is to design a unified framework for deep learning optimization, which could capture the spatial and spectral dependence of original motor imagery EEC signals according to the features extracted by CNN and the temporal dependence extracted by RNN-LSTM. The framework is superimposed from both end-to-end and time-frequency domains so as to retain and learn interpretable motor imagery features. In addition, artificial EEC signals can be automatically generated by training the generated adversarial network, which can generate the feature distribution similar to the original EEC signals, increase the capacity of EEC samples, and ultimately improve the classification performance and robustness of EEC motor imagery recognition. This deep learning framework can improve the classification accuracy of motor imagery for different subjects. In addition, the network can learn from the original data with the least amount of preprocessing, thus eliminating the time-consuming data preparation process.

However, whether motor resonant oscillations (i.e. beta and gamma) modulate long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity of the primary motor cortex (M1) is still unclear. Objective: To address this issue, we combined transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a technique able to entrain cortical oscillations, with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol commonly used to induce LTD-like plasticity in M1. Methods: Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single-pulse TMS, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were evaluated before and 5, 15 and 30 min after cTBS alone or cTBS delivered during beta-tACS (cTBS-beta) or gamma-tACS (cTBS-gamma). Moreover, we tested the effects of beta-tACS (alone) on short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and gamma-tACS on SICI in order to verify whether tACS-related interneuronal modulation contributes to the effects of tACS-cTBS co-stimulation. Results: cTBS-gamma turned the expected after-effects of cTBS from inhibition to facilitation. By contrast, responses to cTBS-beta were similar to those induced by cTBS alone. beta- and gamma-tACS did not change MEPs evoked by single-pulse TMS. beta-tACS reduced SAI and gamma-tACS reduced SICI. However, the degree of gamma-tACS-induced modulation of SICI did not correlate with the effects of cTBS-gamma. Conclusion: gamma-tACS reverses cTBS-induced plasticity of the human M1. gamma-oscillations may therefore regulate LTD-like plasticity mechanisms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Altered neural dynamics in occipital cortices serving visual-spatial processing in heavy alcohol users	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Alcohol; magnetoencephalography; visual-spatial; occipital; oscillations; alpha	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; VENTRAL ATTENTION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; EEG; MODULATION; ABSTINENT; MEG	Background: Visual-spatial processing deficits have been previously linked to heavy alcohol use, but the underlying neurological mechanisms are poorly understood. Neuroimaging studies have shown alcohol-related aberrations in occipital cortices that appear to be associated with these neuropsychological deficits in visual-spatial processing, however the neural dynamics underlying this altered processing remains unknown. Methods: Twenty-three adults with high scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (male: > 5, female: > 4) were compared to 30 demographically-matched controls with low Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption scores (<= 2). All participants completed a visual-spatial processing task while undergoing high-density magnetoencephalography. Time-frequency windows of interest were determined using a data-driven method, and spectrally-specific neural activity was imaged using a beamforming approach. Permutation testing of peak voxel time series was then used to statistically compare across groups. Results: Participants with heavy alcohol use responded slower on the task and their performance was more variable. The magnetoencephalography data indicated strong theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (10-16 Hz), and gamma (62-72 Hz) responses in posterior brain regions across both groups. Following voxel time-series extraction, significant group differences were found in the left and right visual association cortices from about 375-550 ms post-stimulus, such that adults with heavy alcohol use had blunted alpha responses compared to controls. Conclusion: Individuals with heavy alcohol use exhibited aberrant occipital alpha activity during visual-spatial processing. These data are the first to show spectrally-specific differences during visual-spatial processing related to heavy alcohol use, and highlight alcohol's effect on systems-level neural activity.

Here we evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 10 Hz, which we hypothesized would improve clinical symptoms by renormalizing alpha oscillations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). To this end, 32 participants with MDD were randomized to 1 of 3 arms and received daily 40 min sessions of either 10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, or active sham stimulation for 5 consecutive days. Symptom improvement was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) as the primary outcome. High-density electroencephalograms (hdEEGs) were recorded to measure changes in alpha oscillations as the secondary outcome. For the primary outcome, we did not observe a significant interaction between treatment condition (10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, sham) and session (baseline to 4 weeks after completion of treatment); however, exploratory analyses show that 2 weeks after completion of the intervention, the 10 Hz-tACS group had more responders (MADRS and HDRS) compared with 40 Hz-tACS and sham groups (n = 30, p = 0.026). Concurrently, we found a significant reduction in alpha power over the left frontal regions in EEG after completion of the intervention for the group that received per-protocol 10 Hz-tACS (n = 26, p < 0.05). Our data suggest that targeting oscillations with tACS has potential as a therapeutic intervention for treatment of MDD.

Cerebellar Theta Frequency Transcranial Pulsed Stimulation Increases Frontal Theta Oscillations in Patients with Schizophrenia	CEREBELLUM			English	Article						Cerebellum; Neuromodulation; Noninvasive stimulation; Cognitive task; Schizophrenia	COGNITIVE DYSMETRIA; WORKING-MEMORY; DYSFUNCTION; CORTEX; MOTOR	Cognitive dysfunction is a pervasive and disabling aspect of schizophrenia without adequate treatments. A recognized correlate to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is attenuated frontal theta oscillations. Neuromodulation to normalize these frontal rhythms represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy. Here, we evaluate whether noninvasive neuromodulation of the cerebellum in patients with schizophrenia can enhance frontal theta oscillations, with the future goal of targeting the cerebellum as a possible therapy for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. We stimulated the midline cerebellum using transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), a noninvasive transcranial direct current that can be delivered in a frequency-specific manner. A single 20-min session of theta frequency stimulation was delivered in nine patients with schizophrenia (cathode on right shoulder). Delta frequency tPCS was also delivered as a control to evaluate for frequency-specific effects. EEG signals from midfrontal electrode Cz were analyzed before and after cerebellar tPCS while patients estimated the passage of 3- and 12-s intervals. Theta oscillations were significantly larger following theta frequency cerebellar tPCS in the midfrontal region, which was not seen with delta frequency stimulation. As previously reported, patients with schizophrenia showed a baseline reduction in accuracy estimating 3- and 12-s intervals relative to control subjects, which did not significantly improve following a single-session theta or delta frequency cerebellar tPCS. These preliminary results suggest that single-session theta frequency cerebellar tPCS may modulate task-related oscillatory activity in the frontal cortex in a frequency-specific manner. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation to evaluate whether multiple sessions delivered daily may have an impact on cognitive performance and have therapeutic implications for schizophrenia.

Adolescent cognitive control, theta oscillations, and social observation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Theta; Cognitive control; Medial-frontal cortex (MFC); Adolescence; Social observation; Motivation	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; INCENTIVE MOTIVATION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG DYNAMICS; ERROR; ADJUSTMENTS; MATURATION	Theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) provide an organizing principle of cognitive control, allowing goal-directed behavior. In adults, theta power over medial-frontal cortex (MFC) underlies conflict/error monitoring, whereas theta connectivity between MFC and lateral-frontal regions reflects cognitive control recruitment. However, prior work has not separated theta responses that occur before and immediately after a motor response, nor explained how medial-lateral connectivity drives different kinds of control behaviors. Theta's role during adolescence, a developmental window characterized by a motivation-control mismatch also remains unclear. As social observation is known to influence motivation, this might be a particularly important context for studying adolescent theta dynamics. Here, adolescents performed a flanker task alone or under social observation. Focusing first on the nonsocial context, we parsed cognitive control into dissociable subprocesses, illustrating how theta indexes distinct components of cognitive control working together dynamically to produce goal-directed behavior. We separated theta power immediately before/after motor responses, identifying behavioral links to conflict monitoring and error monitoring, respectively. MFC connectivity was separated before/after responses and behaviorally-linked to reactive and proactive control, respectively. Finally, distinct forms of post-error control were dissociated, based on connectivity with rostral/caudal frontal cortex. Social observation was found to exclusively upregulate theta measures indexing post-response error monitoring and proactive control, as opposed to conflict monitoring and reactive control. Linking adolescent cognitive control to theta oscillations provides a bridge between non-invasive recordings in humans and mechanistic studies of neural oscillations in animal models; links to social observation provide insight into the motivation-control interactions that occur during adolescence.

The strength of alpha and gamma oscillations predicts behavioral switch costs	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cingulo-opercular network; Fronto-parietal network; Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Oscillatory activity; Task switching	COGNITIVE CONTROL; EEG-ALPHA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FRONTAL-CORTEX; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; TASK; PARIETAL; DYNAMICS; MECHANISMS	Cognitive flexibility is often examined using task-switch paradigms, whereby individuals either switch between tasks or repeat the same task on successive trials. The behavioral costs of switching in terms of accuracy and reaction time are well-known, but the oscillatory dynamics underlying such costs are poorly understood. Herein, we examined 25 healthy adults who performed a task-switching paradigm during magnetoencephalography (MEG). All MEG data were transformed into the time-frequency domain and significant oscillatory responses were imaged separately per condition (i.e., switch, repeat) using a beamformer. To determine the impact of task-switching on the neural dynamics, the resulting images were examined using paired-samples t-tests. Wholebrain correlations were also computed using the switch-related difference images (switch - repeat) and the switch-related behavioral data (i.e., switch costs). Our key results indicated stronger decreases in alpha and beta activity, and greater increases in gamma activity in nodes of the cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal networks during switch relative to repeat trials. In addition, behavioral switch costs were positively correlated with switch-related differences in right frontal and inferior parietal alpha activity, and negatively correlated with switch effects in anterior cingulate and right temporoparietal gamma activity. In other words, participants who had a greater decrease in alpha or increase in gamma in these respective regions had smaller behavioral switch costs, which suggests that these oscillations are critical to supporting cognitive flexibility. In sum, we provide novel data linking switch effects and gamma oscillations, and employed a whole-brain approach to directly link switch-related oscillatory differences with switch-related performance differences.

A Sound-Sensitive Source of Alpha Oscillations in Human Non-Primary Auditory Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; auditory cortex; functional inhibition; high gamma; intracranial; speech	SUPERIOR TEMPORAL GYRUS; WORKING-MEMORY; REPETITIVE TRANSIENTS; GAMMA ACTIVITY; 10-HZ RHYTHM; PHASE; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; SPEECH; POWER	The functional organization of human auditory cortex can be probed by characterizing responses to various classes of sound at different anatomical locations. Along with histological studies this approach has revealed a primary field in posteromedial Heschl's gyms (HG) with pronounced induced high-frequency (70 -150 Hz) activity and short-latency responses that phase-lock to rapid transient sounds. Low-frequency neural oscillations are also relevant to stimulus processing and information flow, however, their distribution within auditory cortex has not been established. Alpha activity (7-14 Hz) in particular has been associated with processes that may differentially engage earlier versus later levels of the cortical hierarchy, including functional inhibition and the communication of sensory predictions. These theories derive largely from the study of occipitoparietal sources readily detectable in scalp electroencephalography. To characterize the anatomical basis and functional significance of less accessible temporal-lobe alpha activity we analyzed responses to sentences in seven human adults (4 female) with epilepsy who had been implanted with electrodes in superior temporal cortex. In contrast to primary cortex in posteromedial HG, a non-primary field in anterolateral HG was characterized by high spontaneous alpha activity that was strongly suppressed during auditory stimulation. Alpha-power suppression decreased with distance from anterolateral HG throughout superior temporal cortex, and was more pronounced for clear compared to degraded speech. This suppression could not be accounted for solely by a change in the slope of the power spectrum. The differential manifestation and stimulus-sensitivity of alpha oscillations across auditory fields should be accounted for in theories of their generation and function.

J	Jahangiri, A; Sepulveda, F				Jahangiri, Amir; Sepulveda, Francisco			The Relative Contribution of High-Gamma Linguistic Processing Stages of Word Production, and Motor Imagery of Articulation in Class Separability of Covert Speech Tasks in EEG Data	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces; EEG; Linguistic processing stages; Motor imagery of articulation; Gabor transform; Davies-Bouldin index	INNER SPEECH; GABOR; PERCEPTION; ARTIFACTS; RESPONSES; VALIDITY; SYSTEMS; CORTEX; OVERT; HZ	Word production begins with high-Gamma automatic linguistic processing functions followed by speech motor planning and articulation. Phonetic properties are processed in both linguistic and motor stages of word production. Four phonetically dissimilar phonemic structures BA, FO, LE, and RY were chosen as covert speech tasks. Ten neurologically healthy volunteers with the age range of 21-33 participated in this experiment. Participants were asked to covertly speak a phonemic structure when they heard an auditory cue. EEG was recorded with 64 electrodes at 2048 samples/s. Initially, one-second trials were used, which contained linguistic and motor imagery activities. The four-class true positive rate was calculated. In the next stage, 312ms trials were used to exclude covert articulation from analysis. By eliminating the covert articulation stage, the four-class grand average classification accuracy dropped from 96.4% to 94.5%. The most valuable features emerge after Auditory cue recognition (100ms post onset), and within the 70-128Hz frequency range. The most significant identified brain regions were the Prefrontal Cortex (linked to stimulus driven executive control), Wernicke's area (linked to Phonological code retrieval), the right IFG, and Broca's area (linked to syllabification). Alpha and Beta band oscillations associated with motor imagery do not contain enough information to fully reflect the complexity of speech movements. Over 90% of the most class-dependent features were in the 30-128Hz range, even during the covert articulation stage. As a result, compared to linguistic functions, the contribution of motor imagery of articulation in class separability of covert speech tasks from EEG data is negligible.

"Telling me not to worry..." Hyperscanning and Neural Dynamics of Emotion Processing During Guided Imagery and Music	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						music therapy; moments of interest; dyadic interaction; imagery; emotion; EEG; alpha asymmetry; social neuroscience	FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; MIDDLE TEMPORAL GYRUS; MIDLINE THETA; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; SITUATED COGNITION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; THERAPY; ANXIETY; DEPRESSION; ATTENTION	To analyze how emotions and imagery are shared, processed and recognized in Guided Imagery and Music, we measured the brain activity of an experienced therapist ("Guide") and client ("Traveler") with dual-EEG in a real therapy session about potential death of family members. Synchronously with the EEG, the session was video-taped and then micro-analyzed. Four raters identified therapeutically important moments of interest (MOI) and no-interest (MONI) which were transcribed and annotated. Several indices of emotion- and imagery-related processing were analyzed: frontal and parietal alpha asymmetry, frontal midline theta, and occipital alpha activity. Session ratings showed overlaps across all raters, confirming the importance of these MOIs, which showed different cortical activity in visual areas compared to resting-state. MOI 1 was a pivotal moment including an important imagery with a message of hope from a close family member, while in the second MOI the Traveler sent a message to an unborn baby. Generally, results seemed to indicate that the emotions of Traveler and Guide during important moments were not positive, pleasurably or relaxed when compared to resting-state, confirming both were dealing with negative emotions and anxiety that had to be contained in the interpersonal process. However, the temporal dynamics of emotion-related markers suggested shifts in emotional valence and intensity during these important, personally meaningful moments; for example, during receiving the message of hope, an increase of frontal alpha asymmetry was observed, reflecting increased positive emotional processing. EEG source localization during the message suggested a peak activation in left middle temporal gyrus. Interestingly, peaks in emotional markers in the Guide partly paralleled the Traveler's peaks; for example, during the Guide's strong feeling of mutuality in MOI 2, the time series of frontal alpha asymmetries showed a significant cross-correlation, indicating similar emotional processing in Traveler and Guide. Investigating the moment-to-moment interaction in music therapy showed how asymmetry peaks align with the situated cognition of Traveler and Guide along the emotional contour of the music, representing the highs and lows during the therapy process. Combining dual-EEG with detailed audiovisual and qualitative data seems to be a promising approach for further research into music therapy.

Spike-waves during sleep seem to be related to slow waves, raising the question of whether spike-waves can be systematically influenced by such acoustic stimulation. In five pediatric patients, all-night EEG was recorded, combined with real-time slow wave detection. Throughout the night, acoustic stimulation was performed in a 3 x 5-min-block design (no stimulation-stimulation-no stimulation). Tones were applied time-locked either to the up or to the down phase of the detected slow waves in an alternating pattern. All patients tolerated the acoustic stimulation during sleep well. They showed high sleep quality and no signs of clinical or non-convulsive electrographic seizures. Our preliminary analysis shows no systematic effect of acoustic stimulation on spike-wave activity. Moreover, with our stimulation approach tones were distributed over a rather broad phase-range during the DOWN or UP stimulation and showed inter-individual differences in their distribution. In this study, we applied for the first time an acoustic closed-loop slow wave stimulation tool for a non-invasive manipulation of spike-wave activity. Thus, our pilot data show that closed-loop acoustic stimulation is feasible and well tolerated in children with spike wave activity during sleep. Improved precision in phase targeting and personalized stimulation parameters in a larger sample of subjects might be needed to show systematic effects.

Deep-brain stimulation of the caudal zona incerta has re-emerged as an alternate target for tremor control in various etiologies. Object Explore the clinical efficacy and mechanism of action of caudal zona incerta deep-brain stimulation in orthostatic tremor. Methods Four patients (63.1 +/- 4.1 years, female = 50%) with orthostatic tremor were recruited for this open label study (63.1 +/- 4.1 years, female = 50%). In two patients, the electrodes were externalized to determine the effectiveness of caudal zona incerta as a target. Surface EMG (leg muscles), EEG (leg motor cortex) and caudal zona incerta local field potential recordings were recorded. Data were recorded in sitting and standing positions with stimulation OFF and ON. Results EMG frequency analysis showed tremor frequency at 13-17 Hz. EMG-EEG coherence was found in the tremor frequency band and double tremor frequency band. EMG-caudal zona incerta coherence was higher in the tremor frequency band, while EEG coherence was higher in the double tremor frequency band. Upon stimulation, there was a selective reduction in tremor frequency band EEG-EMG coherence in all patients. All the patients had reduction in feeling of unsteadiness and increase in the stance duration. Conclusions Bilateral caudal zona incerta deep-brain stimulation is effective in refractory orthostatic tremor. Two independent central oscillations were found at tremor and double tremor frequency. Zona incerta DBS produces improvement in OT patients possibly by modifying the abnormal oscillatory proprioceptive input from leg muscles. Frequent changes in deep-brain stimulation settings were required for maintaining the clinical benefit.

Alpha suppression over parietal electrode sites predicts decisions to trust	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Trust decisions; alpha suppression; EEG; oscillatory dynamics	MODULATES BRAIN RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; NEGATIVITY; OTHERS; MODEL; P3	Decisions to trust help form the basis of relationships and society yet little is known about their neurophysiology. We told participants they were playing a coin toss game with a trustworthy and an untrustworthy person and measured their neural activity with EEG as they decided whether to trust those fictitious interaction partners. Target people ostensibly correctly reported the outcome of a coin toss on 66% of trials. Behaviorally, participants probability matched and chose to trust the reported coin flips from each profile equally by the end of 100 trials. Electrophysiologically, there were reliable differences in the pattern of oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13Hz) over parietal electrode sites 1-3 s prior to their trust decisions. Specifically, for trustworthy profiles, there was greater alpha suppression for trust decisions vs. distrust decisions. Conversely, for untrustworthy profiles there was greater alpha suppression for distrust decisions vs. trust decisions. This differential activity (trust minus distrust) also predicted the number of trust decisions made. Our results indicate that the intentions to trust people form very early in the processing stream and manifest as alpha suppression over parietal cortex.

Emerging research suggests that a single bout of aerobic exercise can improve cognition, brain function and psychological health. Our aim was to examine the effects of high-intensity exercise on cognitive-performance and brain measures of attention, inhibition and performance-monitoring across a test-battery of three cognitive tasks. Method: Using a randomised cross-over design, 29 young men completed three successive cognitive tasks (Cued Continuous Performance Task [CPT-OX]; Eriksen Flanker Task; four-choice reaction-time task [Fast Task]) with simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording before and after a 20-min high-intensity cycling exercise and resting control session. Cognitive-performance measures, EEG power and event-related potential measures, were obtained during the tasks. Random-intercept linear models were used to investigate the effects of exercise, compared to rest, on outcomes. Results: A single bout of exercise significantly (p < 0.05) increased the amplitude of the event-related potential Go P3, but had no effect on the contingent negative variation (CNV), Cue P3 or NoGo P3, during the CPT-OX. Delta power, recorded during the CPT-OX, also significantly increased after exercise, whereas there was no effect on cognitive-performance in this task. Exercise did not influence any cognitive-performance or brain measures in the subsequent Flanker or Fast Tasks. Conclusion: Acute high-intensity exercise improves brain-indices reflecting executive and sustained attention during task performance (Go P3 and delta activity), in the CPT-OX, but not anticipatory attention (Cue P3 and CNV) or response inhibition (NoGo P3) in young-adult men. Exercise had no effect on cognitive-performance or brain measures in the subsequent Flanker and Fast tasks, which may potentially be explained by the time delay after exercise.

State-trait influences of Vipassana meditation practice on P3 EEG dynamics	MEDITATION	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review	International Conference on Meditation	MAR 04-06, 2018	Univ Allahabad, Ctr Behav & Cognit Sci, Allahabad, INDIA		Univ Allahabad, Ctr Behav & Cognit Sci	Vipassana; Proficiency; Cognition; Event-related potentials; Attention; Neural plasticity	ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; MINDFULNESS; ATTENTION; THETA; PRACTITIONERS; CONSCIOUSNESS; NEUROSCIENCE; SYNCHRONY; EMOTION; IMPACT	Several studies have demonstrated that meditation naive subjects can, in just a few weeks, become proficient enough in meditation to show cognitive improvements accompanied with functional and structural changes in the brain. Would long-term exposure to qualitatively different levels of meditative training bring about differences in cognitive processing? Would meditation prior to task performance help separate out these differences? Could the nature of the task influence the findings related to cognitive enhancements? To address these questions, we evaluated cognitive functions in three groups of experienced Vipassana practitioners (Novices: n = 22, Mean +/- SD meditation experience = 989 +/- 595h; Senior practitioners: 21, 10,510 +/- 5313; Teachers: 16, 14,648 +/- 9623) who differed in terms of duration and quality of meditative practice. Specifically, we employed "ANGEL" a gamified multilevel oddball paradigm, to assess P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) and associated EEG dynamics-power spectra, event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC). In order to elicit the state-trait influences of meditation, the cognitive task was performed after the participants had undergone an hour long traditional meditation session. All participants could perform the task well and the gross ERP waveforms were similar for the three groups. As hypothesized, we found distinct state-trait influences of meditation leading to graded differences in P3 EEG dynamics. Specifically, we found reduced theta synchrony, enhanced alpha de-synchrony and lesser theta-alpha coherence in the more proficient meditators. Post hoc analyses revealed several differences between the novice and teacher groups but not as many between novice and seniors suggesting that the senior meditators formed an intermediate group. Our study demonstrates that both quantity and quality of meditation influence EEG dynamics during cognitive processing and that meditation prior to a task can provide additional state-trait effects involved in meeting the specific cognitive demands.

Nevertheless, the detection algorithms still lack robustness while processing brain signals. The aim would be to learn whether a person is deceitful or not by detection techniques and suggest a vigorous lie detection algorithm. Moreover, recently proposed algorithms for lie detection have shown to achieve a classification accuracy of around 96%. While different classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, multilaver neural network, Extreme Learning Machine, and Linear Discriminant Analysis have proposed which typically utilizes three different types of features like time domain features, frequency domain features, and wavelet features, are anticipated in the literature. Accordingly, in this research paper, we presented a lie detection system front the P300 wave. For automatic optimum feature learning, we applied an approach from deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is very effective for classification problems. The presented model significantly achieves high accuracy of 99.6%. The experimental outcomes show that the technique put forward achieves the maximum accuracy with a lesser amount of training and testing time and reveal improved performance. Additionally, an all-inclusive discussion on the choice of appropriate CNN architecture and classification results presented in this paper along with a comparison with the prior approaches of lie detection.

Previous work from our and other research groups has shown marked spindle deficits in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the presence of spindle impairments at illness onset, including which parameters are most affected, their topographic characteristics, and their relationships with clinical symptoms have yet to be characterized. In this study we performed sleep high density (hd)-EEG recordings in twenty-seven first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients and twenty-three healthy controls (HC). Several spindle parameters-amplitude, duration, and density-were calculated and compared across groups. FEP patients showed reduced spindle duration and density, but not in spindle amplitude relative to HC. These spindles reductions were localized in a frontal area and predicted the severity of FEP patients' negative symptoms. Altogether, these findings indicate that spindle deficits are present at the beginning of psychosis, contribute to clinical symptomatology, and point to frontal thalamo-cortical dysfunctions, thus providing a potential treatment target for early interventions in SCZ and related psychotic disorders.

For instance, could one predict whether or not an action was chosen voluntarily based only on how that action is motorically executed? We investigated this possibility by integrating scalp electroencephalograms and index-finger accelerometer recordings acquired while people chose between pressing a left or right button either freely or as instructed by a visual cue. Even though freely selected and instructed actions were executed with equal vigor, the timing of the movement to release the button was comparatively delayed for freely selected actions. This chronometric difference was six-times larger for the beta-oscillations over the sensorimotor cortex that characteristically accompany an action's termination. This surprising modulation of an action's termination by volition was traceable to volition-modulated differences in how the competing yet non-selected action was represented and regulated.

The asynchronous state's relation to large-scale potentials in cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						cognitive state; correlations; EEG; MEG; population activity	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; NEURAL CORRELATIONS; NOISE CORRELATIONS; BARREL CORTEX; CORRELATED VARIABILITY; DEPENDENT MODULATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BEHAVIORAL STATES; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; SPIKE-COUNT	Understanding the relation between large-scale potentials (M/EEG) and their underlying neural activity can improve the precision of research and clinical diagnosis. Recent insights into cortical dynamics highlighted a state of strongly reduced spike count correlations, termed the asynchronous state (AS). The AS has received considerable attention from experimenters and theorists alike, regarding its implications for cortical dynamics and coding of information. However, how reconcilable are these vanishing correlations in the AS with large-scale potentials such as M/EEG observed in most experiments? Typically the latter are assumed to be based on underlying correlations in activity, in particular between subthreshold potentials. We survey the occurrence of the AS across brain states, regions. and layers and argue for a reconciliation of this seeming disparity: large-scale potentials are either observed, first, at transitions between cortical activity states, which entail transient changes in population firing rate, as well as during the AS. and, second, on the basis of sufficiently large, asynchronous populations that only need to exhibit weak correlations in activity. Cells with no or little spiking activity can contribute to large-scale potentials via their subthreshold currents, while they do not contribute to the estimation of spiking correlations, defining the AS. Further-more. third, the AS occurs only within particular cortical regions and layers associated with the currently selected modality, allowing for correlations at other times and between other areas and layers.

However, the detection accuracy of EEG signal using traditional grey theory is limited. In the current study, in order to increase the distinguishing ability of the GM (1, 1), we defined new parameters by introducing a factor u to revise developing coefficient and grey action. Consequently, the grey theory has been applied to the BCI system, where the improved grey model was proposed to analyze alpha wave to switch the state of BCI system. Moreover, since Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential Signal (SSVEP) is a kind of oscillation signal with specific frequency, the grey relational analysis has been applied in frequency domain to recognize instruction of the subject. According to the result, the average accuracy of alpha wave detection is 92.5% when the timescale is 0.5s, which is 15% higher than the traditional grey model, and average accuracy of SSVEP detection of four patterns is 86.1% in 3s, which showed that brain-computer interface system based on the grey theory can effectively realize the state transition and instruction recognition.

Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed database from inception to March 2018. Studies included in the review measured any event-related potentials, neural oscillations, or phase synchrony. Results: A total of 113 articles were identified. Twenty-nine studies were included for the review. The majority of the studies focused on the N170 component. Smaller N170 amplitudes were consistently reported in schizophrenia patients compared to the healthy control group. Significant correlations between N170 amplitudes and social functioning scales were reported. Other results were quite inconsistent; however, group differences were more prominent for tasks with specific conditions. Conclusions: Older patients with longer disease duration show more consistent neuropsychological correlations. Alterations of event-related potentials are likely to be linked to higher severity of symptoms. The N170 component seems to be the most promising event-related potential to be used for evaluation of present status and for dynamic control of cognitive impairments, social functioning, and rehabilitation effectiveness. Significance: This systematic review provides evidence of (1) neuropsychological alterations of face processing outside an emotional context, and (2) a potential role of N170 as a diagnostic and treatment monitoring biomarker.

Methods One hundred Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (25 rats per group) and exposed to 27 MHz continuous shortwave at a power density of 5, 10, or 30 mW/cm(2) for 6 min once only or underwent sham exposure for the control. The spatial learning and memory, electroencephalogram (EEG), hippocampal structure and Nissl bodies were analysed. Furthermore, the expressions of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B), cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) in hippocampal tissue were analysed on 1, 7, and 14 days after exposure. Results The rats in the 10 and 30 mW/cm(2) groups had poor learning and memory, disrupted EEG oscillations, and injured hippocampal structures, including hippocampal neurons degeneration, mitochondria cavitation and blood capillaries swelling. The Nissl body content was also reduced in the exposure groups. Moreover, the hippocampal tissue in the 30 mW/cm(2) group had increased expressions of NR2A and NR2B and decreased levels of CREB and p-CREB. Conclusion Shortwave exposure (27 MHz, with an average power density of 10 and 30 mW/cm(2)) impaired rats' spatial learning and memory and caused a series of dose-dependent pathophysiological changes. Moreover, NMDAR-related CREB pathway suppression might be involved in shortwave-induced structural and functional impairments in the rat hippocampus.

Previous investigations commonly utilize a block paradigm to study sustained and transient changes in attention networks. fMRI investigations have shown that sustained attention in visual block design attention tasks corresponds to decreased signal in the default mode and visual processing networks. While task negative networks are anticipated to decrease during active task engagement, it is unexpected that visual networks would also be suppressed during a visual task where event-related fMRI studies have found transient increases to visual stimuli. To resolve these competing results, the current investigations utilized intracranial EEG to directly interrogate visual and default mode network dynamics during a visual continuous performance task. We used the electrophysiological data to model expected fMRI signals and to maximize interpretation of current results with previous investigations. Results show broadband gamma power decreases in the default mode network, corresponding to previous EEG and fMRI findings. Meanwhile, visual processing regions including the primary visual cortex and fusiform gyrus demonstrate both sustained decreases during task engagement and stimuli-driven transient increases in gamma power. Modeled fMRI based on gamma power reproduces signal decreases reported in the fMRI literature, and emphasizes the insensitivity of fMRI to transient, regularly spaced signal changes embedded within sustained network dynamics. The signal processing functions of the dynamic visual and default mode network changes explored in this study are unknown but may be elucidated through further investigation.

Early sinusoidal heart rate patterns and heart rate variability to assess hypoxia-ischaemia in near-term fetal sheep	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						arginine vasopressin; biomarker; fetal heart rate variability; fetus; hypoxia-ischaemia; sinusoidal heart rate pattern	BRAIN-INJURY; POWER SPECTRUM; ASPHYXIA; HYPOPERFUSION; OXYGENATION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; GESTATION; STANDARDS; NEWBORNS	Key points Therapeutic hypothermia needs to be started as early as possible in the first 6 h after acute injury caused by hypoxia-ischaemia (HI), but the severity and timing of HI are often unclear. In this study we evaluated whether measures of heart rate variability (HRV) might provide early biomarkers of HI. The duration but not magnitude of suppression of HRV power and conversely increased sample entropy of the heart rate were associated with severity of HI, such that changes in the first 3 h did not discriminate between groups. Relative changes in HRV power bands showed different patterns between groups and therefore may have the potential to evaluate the severity of HI. Aberrant fetal heart rate patterns and increased arginine vasopressin levels in the first hour after moderate and severe HI were correlated with loss of EEG power after 3 days' recovery, suggesting potential utility as early biomarkers of outcome. center dot center dot center dot center dot Therapeutic hypothermia is partially neuroprotective after acute injury caused by hypoxia-ischaemia (HI), likely because the timing and severity of HI are often unclear, making timely recruitment for treatment challenging. We evaluated the utility of changes in heart rate variability (HRV) after HI as biomarkers of the timing and severity of acute HI. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 0.85 gestational age were exposed to different durations of umbilical cord occlusion to produce mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 8) or severe HI (n = 8) or to sham occlusion (n = 5). Heart rate (HR) and HRV indices were assessed until 72 h after HI. All HI groups showed suppressed very low frequency HRV power and elevated sample entropy for the first 3 h; more prolonged changes were associated with greater severity of HI. Analysis of relative changes in spectral power showed that the moderate and severe groups showed a shift towards higher HRV frequencies, which was most marked after severe HI. This shift was associated with abnormal rhythmic HR patterns including sinusoidal patterns in the first hour after HI, and with elevated plasma levels of arginine vasopressin, which were correlated with subsequent loss of EEG power by day 3. In conclusion, absolute changes in HRV power in the first 3 h after acute HI were not significantly related to the severity of HI. The intriguing relative shift in spectral power towards higher frequencies likely reflects greater autonomic dysfunction after severe HI. However, sinusoidal HR patterns and elevated vasopressin levels may have utility as biomarkers of severe HI.

In this way, a cycling between model and experiment becomes possible allowing model insights to be brought to bear in understanding AD in our complex brain circuits.

Previous research has identified targets of such adjustments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cortical regions, motor cortical areas, and subthalamic nucleus. Yet most of such studies involved visual tasks with relatively moderate cognitive load and strong dependence on motor inhibition - thus highlighting sensory, executive and motor effects while underestimating sensorimotor transformation and related aspects of decision making. Currently there is ample evidence that posterior parietal cortical areas are involved in task-specific neural processes of decision making (including evidence accumulation, sensorimotor transformation, attention, etc.) yet, to our knowledge, no EEG studies have demonstrated post-error increase in functional connectivity in the theta-band between midfrontal and posterior parietal areas during performance on non-visual tasks. In the present study, we recorded EEG while subjects were performing an auditory version of the cognitively demanding attentional condensation task; this task involves rather non-straightforward stimulus-toresponse mapping rules, thus, creating increased load on sensorimotor transformation. We observed strong pre-response alpha-band suppression in the left parietal area, which presumably reflected involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in task-specific decision-making processes. Negative feedback was followed by increased midfrontal theta-band power and increased functional coupling in the theta band between midfrontal and left parietal regions. This could be interpreted as activation of the performance monitoring system and top-down influence of this system on the posterior parietal regions involved in decision making, respectively. This inter-site coupling related to negative feedback was stronger for subjects who tended to commit errors with slower response times. Generally, current findings support the idea that slower errors are related to the state of outcome uncertainty caused by failures of task-specific processes, associated with posterior parietal regions.

We hypothesize that the power of FOs and connectivity of slow waves in hypsarrhythmia would indicate the prognosis of IS. Method We retrospectively identified 42 children with pharmacoresistant IS who underwent TCC from 2009 to 2014 at Nagasaki Medical Center. We collected preoperative hypsarrhythmia for 200 seconds from each child. Children were categorized into three groups with interictal epileptic discharges on EEG at 6 months after TCC: group A, no epileptic discharge; group B, lateralized epileptic discharges; and group C; bilateral epileptic discharges. We analyzed spectral power and phase synchronization in preoperative hypsarrhythmia among the three groups. Results We found 10 children in group A, 10 children in group B, and 22 children in group C. All group A and 1 in group B achieved seizure freedom after TCC. Six (67%) of 9 group B children who underwent further surgeries achieved seizure freedom. Ten (45%) of group C children had seizure reduction >50% after TCC, and 13 (87%) of 15 children who underwent further surgeries had residual seizures. The clinical profiles of the three groups did not differ significantly. The power of FOs (>= 45 Hz) in hypsarrhythmia was significantly stronger in group C at the midline and temporal regions than in groups B and A (P = .014). The connectivity of theta (4-9 Hz) and FOs (29-70 Hz) tended to increase in group C, compared with the increased connectivity of 1-2 Hz in group A (P = .08). Significance The increased power and connectivity of FOs in hypsarrhythmia may correlate with pharmacoresistant and surgically resistant seizures in IS. The existence and connectivity of FOs are associated with unilateral/bilateral cortical epileptogenicity in hypsarrhythmia. Prominent slow waves and connectivity without FOs might correlate with seizure freedom after TCC. Modulation of the callosal system with subcortical/cortical epileptic discharges might play a role in generating hypsarrhythmia and IS.

Human Verbal Memory Encoding Is Hierarchically Distributed in a Continuous Processing Stream	ENEURO			English	Article						cognition; cortical mapping; electrocorticography; high-frequency oscillations; network oscillations	SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL; LANGUAGE; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; METAANALYSIS	Processing of memory is supported by coordinated activity in a network of sensory, association, and motor brain regions. It remains a major challenge to determine where memory is encoded for later retrieval. Here, we used direct intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients performing free recall tasks to determine the temporal pattern and anatomical distribution of verbal memory encoding across the entire human cortex. High gamma frequency activity (65-115 Hz) showed consistent power responses during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words on a subset of electrodes localized in 16 distinct cortical areas activated in the tasks. More of the high gamma power during word encoding, and less power before and after the word presentation, was characteristic of successful recall and observed across multiple brain regions. Latencies of the induced power changes and this subsequent memory effect (SME) between the recalled and forgotten words followed an anatomical sequence from visual to prefrontal cortical areas. Finally, the magnitude of the memory effect was unexpectedly found to be the largest in selected brain regions both at the top and at the bottom of the processing stream. These included the language processing areas of the prefrontal cortex and the early visual areas at the junction of the occipital and temporal lobes. Our results provide evidence for distributed encoding of verbal memory organized along a hierarchical posterior-to-anterior processing stream.

However, causal evidence for the role that PCC plays in memory encoding is lacking. In human female and male participants (N = 17) undergoing seizure mapping, we investigated functional properties of the PCC using deep brain stimulation (DBS) and stereotactic electroencephalography. We used a verbal free recall paradigm in which the PCC was stimulated during presentation of half of the study lists, whereas no stimulation was applied during presentation of the remaining lists. We investigated whether stimulation affected memory and modulated hippocam pal activity. Results revealed four main findings. First, stimulation during episodic memory encoding impaired subsequent free recall, predominantly for items presented early in the study lists. Second, PCC stimulation increased hippocampal gamma-band power. Third, stimulation-induced hippocampal gamma power predicted the magnitude of memory impairment. Fourth, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and PCC predicted the strength of the stimulation effect on memory. Our findings offer causal evidence implicating the PCC in episodic memory encoding. Importantly, the results indicate that stimulation targeted outside of the temporal lobe can modulate hippocampal activity and impact behavior. Furthermore, measures of connectivity between brain regions within a functional network can be informative in predicting behavioral effects of stimulation. Our findings have significant implications for developing therapies to treat memory disorders and cognitive impairment using DBS.

Although these results are promising, most of this research was conducted based on high-priced EEG systems developed for clinical and research purposes. This study addresses the question whether such effects can also be shown with an easy to use and comparably low-priced Emotiv Epoc EEG headset available for the average consumer. In addition, critical voices were raised regarding the control group designs of studies addressing the link between neurofeedback training and cognitive performance. Based on an extensive literature review revealing considerable methodological issues in an important part of the existing research, the present study addressed the question whether individual upper alpha neurofeedback has a positive effect on alpha amplitudes (i.e. increases alpha amplitudes) and short-term memory performance focussing on a methodologically sound, single-blinded, sham controlled design. Method Participants (N = 33) took part in four test sessions over four consecutive days of either neurofeedback training (NFT group) or sham feedback (SF group). In the NFT group, five threeminute periods of visual neurofeedback training were administered each day whereas in the SF group (control group), the same amount of sham feedback was presented. Performance on eight digit-span tests as well as participants' affective states were assessed before and after each of the daily training sessions. Results NFT did not show an effect on individual upper alpha and cognitive performance. While performance increased in both groups over the course of time, this effect could not be explained by changes in individual upper alpha. Additional analyses however revealed that participants in the NFT group showed faster and larger increase in alpha compared to the SF group. Surprisingly, exploratory analyses showed a significant correlation between the initial alpha level and the alpha improvement during the course of the study. This finding suggests that participants with high initial alpha levels benefit more from alpha NFT interventions. In the discussion, the appearance of the alpha enhancement in the SF group and possible reasons for the absence of a connection between NFT and short-term memory are addressed.

One of the most productive areas of interdisciplinary research in this area has been the implementation of biologically-inspired mechanisms in the development of autonomous systems. Specifically, enabling such systems to display adaptive behavior such as learning from good and bad outcomes, has been achieved by quantifying and understanding the neural mechanisms of the brain networks mediating adaptive behaviors in humans and animals. For example, associative learning from aversive or dangerous outcomes is crucial for an autonomous system, to avoid dangerous situations in the future. A body of neuroscience research has suggested that the neurocomputations in the human brain during associative learning involve re-shaping of sensory responses. The nature of these adaptive changes in sensory processing during learning however are not yet well enough understood to be readily implemented into on-board algorithms for robotics application. Toward this overall goal, we record the simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), characterizing one candidate mechanism, i.e., large-scale brain oscillations. The present report examines the use of Functional Source Separation (FSS) as an optimization step in EEG-fMRI fusion that harnesses timing information to constrain the solutions that satisfy physiological assumptions. We applied this approach to the voxel-wise correlation of steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) amplitude and blood oxygen level-dependent imaging (BOLD), across both time series. The results showed the benefit of FSS for the extraction of robust ssVEP signals during simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Applied to data from a 3-phase aversive conditioning paradigm, the correlation maps across the three phases (habituation, acquisition, extinction) show converging results, notably major overlapping areas in both primary and extended visual cortical regions, including calcarine sulcus, lingual cortex, and cuneus. In addition, during the acquisition phase when aversive learning occurs, we observed additional correlations between ssVEP and BOLD in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as the precuneus and superior temporal gyrus.

They are characterized by a deep negative deflection lasting about half-a-second, sustained, at the cortical level, by a widespread and synchronized neuronal hyperpolarization (i.e., electrical silence). The phase of hyperpolarization is followed by a period of intense and synchronized neuronal firing (i.e., depolarization phase) resulting at the EEG level, in a large positive deflection (lasting about 0.5 s) and a concurrent high frequency activity (i.e., spindles). Both KCs and SSOs rather than being "local" phenomena, propagate over large sections of the cortex. These features suggest that bistability is a large-scale network phenomenon, possibly driven by a propagating excitatory activity and involving wide populations of synchronized neurons. We have recently shown that KCs and SSOs include a positive bump preceding the negative peak and that for sensory-evoked KCs this bump coincides with the P200 wave. We demonstrated that the P200 has a sensory-modality specific localization, as it is firstly elicited in the primary sensory areas related to the stimulus, which in turn receive projections from the thalamic core. We observed that the P200 acts as a propagating excitatory activity and hypothesized that it could play a key role in inducing the opening of K+ channels, and hence the cortical hyperpolarization. Here we demonstrate that the P200 is sustained by a high-frequency excitation bringing further support to its role in triggering bistability. We show that the P200 has a higher power density in gamma band as compared to the P900 coherently for all sensory modalities, and we confirm that the latter wave is crowned by higher activity in sigma-beta bands. Finally, we characterize the P200 gamma activity at the cortical level in terms of spatial localization and temporal dynamics, demonstrating that it emerges in sensory stimulus-specific primary areas and travels over the cortical mantle spreading toward fronto-central associative areas and fading concurrently with the N550 onset.

However, the speed of emotional feature extraction from complex visual environments is largely undetermined. Here we use objective electrophysiological recordings in combination with frequency tagging to demonstrate that the extraction of emotional information from neutral, pleasant, or unpleasant naturalistic scenes can be completed at a presentation speed of 167 ms (i.e., 6 Hz) under high perceptual load. Emotional compared to neutral pictures evoked enhanced electrophysiological responses with distinct topographical activation patterns originating from different neural sources. Cortical facilitation in early visual cortex was also more pronounced for scenes with pleasant compared to unpleasant or neutral content, suggesting a positivity offset mechanism dominating under conditions of rapid scene processing. These results significantly advance our knowledge of complex scene processing in demonstrating rapid integrative content identification, particularly for emotional cues relevant for adaptive behavior in complex environments.

How these patterns of activity are modulated by subcortical arousal systems is poorly understood. Here, we couple selective optogenetic stimulation of a defined subcortical cell-type, basal forebrain (BF) parvalbumin (PV) neurons, with hdEEG recordings in mice (Opto-hdEEG). Stimulation of BF PV projection neurons preferentially generated time-locked gamma oscillations in frontal cortices. BF PV gamma-frequency stimulation potently modulated an auditory sensory paradigm used to probe cortical function in neuropsychiatric disorders, the auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Phase-locked excitation of BF PV neurons in advance of 40Hz auditory stimuli enhanced the power, precision and reliability of cortical responses, and the relationship between responses in frontal and auditory cortices. Furthermore, synchronization within a frontal hub and long-range cortical interactions were enhanced. Thus, phasic discharge of BF PV neurons changes cortical processing in a manner reminiscent of global workspace models of attention and consciousness.

This work introduces the many-to-many formulation for automatic sleep staging, which means using a many-to-many mapping to convert the contextual input to the corresponding contextual output. We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform the many-to-many mapping, and use multilayer perceptron (MLP) to merge the contextual output into the final prediction for a particular epoch. In order to avoid the influence of unobvious characteristic waves and wrong labels on the training process, this work leverages the technology of curriculum learning. By clustering algorithm based on local density, the training set is divided into several subsets according to the signal quality. We design a learning strategy by successively leveraging these subsets. To the best of our current knowledge, this is the first work using curriculum learning for automatic sleep staging. It is showed by experiments that our scheme yields an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art on the public dataset Sleep-EDF.

In this paper, we consider mild difficulty in falling asleep (MDFA). Recognition of MDFA has the potential to assist in the provision of appropriate treatment plans for both sleep issues and related medical conditions. An issue in the diagnosis of MDFA lies in subjectivity. To address this issue, a decision support tool based on dual-modal physiological feature fusion which is able to automatically identify MDFA is proposed in this study. Special attention is given to the problem of how to extract candidate features and fuse dual-modal features. Following the identification of the optimal feature set, this study considers the correlations between each feature and class and evaluates correlations between the inter-modality features. Finally, the recognition accuracy was measured using 10-fold cross validation. The experimental results for our method demonstrate improved performance. The highest recognition rate of MDFA using the optimal feature set can reach 96.22%. Based on the results of current study, the authors will, in projected future research, develop a real-time MDFA recognition system.

Complex Oscillatory Waves Emerging from Cortical Organoids Model Early Human Brain Network Development	CELL STEM CELL			English	Article							CEREBRAL ORGANOIDS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; STEM-CELLS; DYNAMICS; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS; GENERATION; SYNCHRONY; PATTERNS; CORTEX	Structural and transcriptional changes during early brain maturation follow fixed developmental programs defined by genetics. However, whether this is true for functional network activity remains unknown, primarily due to experimental inaccessibility of the initial stages of the living human brain. Here, we developed human cortical organoids that dynamically change cellular populations during maturation and exhibited consistent increases in electrical activity over the span of several months. The spontaneous network formation displayed periodic and regular oscillatory events that were dependent on glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. The oscillatory activity transitioned to more spatiotemporally irregular patterns, and synchronous network events resembled features similar to those observed in preterm human electroencephalography. These results show that the development of structured network activity in a human neocortex model may follow stable genetic programming. Our approach provides opportunities for investigating and manipulating the role of network activity in the developing human cortex.

This process requires segregating the speech streams from each other and continuously directing attention to the target stream. We investigated the functional brain networks underlying this ability. Two speech streams were presented simultaneously to participants, who followed one of them and detected targets within it (target stream). The loudness of the distractor speech stream varied on five levels: moderately softer, slightly softer, equal, slightly louder, or moderately louder than the attended. Performance measures showed that the most demanding task was the moderately softer distractors condition, which indicates that a softer distractor speech may receive more covert attention than louder distractors and, therefore, they require more cognitive resources. EEG-based measurement of functional connectivity between various brain regions revealed frequency-band specific networks: (1) energetic masking (comparing the louder distractor conditions with the equal loudness condition) was predominantly associated with stronger connectivity between the frontal and temporal regions at the lower alpha (8-10 Hz) and gamma (30-70 Hz) bands; (2) informational masking (comparing the softer distractor conditions with the equal loudness condition) was associated with a distributed network between parietal, frontal, and temporal regions at the theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands. These results suggest the presence of distinct cognitive and neural processes for solving the interference from energetic vs. informational masking.

For short time scales, working memory studies suggest that multiple mental contents are maintained by theta-coupled reactivation, but evidence for similar mechanisms during complex behaviors such as goal-directed navigation is scarce. We examined intracranial electroencephalography recordings of epilepsy patients performing an object-location memory task in a virtual environment. We report that large-scale electrophysiological representations of objects that cue for specific goal locations are dynamically reactivated during goal-directed navigation. Reactivation of different cue representations occurred at stimulus-specific hippocampal theta phases. Locking to more distinct theta phases predicted better memory performance, identifying hippocampal theta phase coding as a mechanism for separating competing goals. Our findings suggest shared neural mechanisms between working memory and goal-directed navigation and provide new insights into the functions of the hippocampal theta rhythm.

These proportional power increases are often reported in EEG studies recording theta over frontal midline sites. Intracranial recordings, however, yield mixed results, depending on the brain area being recorded from. We recorded intracranial EEG with depth electrodes in 13 patients with epilepsy who were performing a Sternberg WM task. Here, we investigated patterns of theta power changes as a function of memory load during maintenance in three areas critical for WM: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsal ACC (dACC), and hippocampus. Theta frequency power in both hippocampus and dACC increased during maintenance. In contrast, theta frequency power in the DLPFC decreased during maintenance, and this decrease was proportional to memory load. Only the power decreases in DLPFC, but not the power increases in hippocampus and dACC, were predictive of behavior in a given trial. The extent of the load-related theta power decreases in the DLPFC in a given participant predicted a participant's RTs, revealing that DLPFC theta explains individual differences in WM ability between participants. Together, these data reveal a pattern of theta power decreases in the DLPFC that is predictive of behavior and that is opposite of that in other brain areas. This result suggests that theta band power changes serve different cognitive functions in different brain areas and specifically that theta power decreases in DLPFC have an important role in maintenance of information.

Sleepless and desynchronized: Impaired inter trial phase coherence of steady-state potentials following sleep deprivation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Sleep deprivation; EEG; Steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP); Inter trial phase coherence (ITPC)	PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA ACTIVITY; NEURAL BASIS; EEG; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; AMPLITUDE; LOCKING; ALPHA	Sleep loss has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional functioning. These impairments have been associated with alterations in EEG measures of power spectrum and event-related potentials, however the impact of sleep loss on inter trial phase coherence (ITPC), a measure of phase consistency over experimental trials, remains mostly unknown. ITPC is thought to reflect the ability of the neural response to temporally synchronize with relevant events, thus optimizing information processing. In the current study we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on information processing by evaluating the phase consistency of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) as well as amplitude-based measures of ssVEPs, obtained from a group of 18 healthy individuals following 24 h of total sleep deprivation and after a night of habitual sleep. An ssVEP task was utilized, which included the presentation of dots flickering at 7.5 Hz, along with a cognitive-emotional task. Our results show that ITPC is significantly reduced under sleep deprivation relative to habitual sleep. Interestingly, decreased ITPC under sleep deprivation was associated with decreased behavioral performance in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), a validated measure of reduced vigilance following a lack of sleep. The results suggest that the capability of the brain to synchronize with rhythmic stimuli is disrupted without sleep. Thus, decreased ITPC may represent an objective and mechanistic measure of sleep loss, allowing future work to study the relation between brain-world synchrony and the specific functional impairments associated with sleep deprivation.

This work focuses on exploring the neurophysiological changes associated with motor learning. Electroencephalographic (EEC) signals were recorded from eight subjects while performing a bimanual coordination task in a laparoscopic simulator. Spectral power measurements in theta, alpha and beta bands during four training sessions were calculated. Power indices, task score and perception of mental workload were evaluated using analysis of variance to show the effect of training session. Results show improvements in task performance and changes in power measurements associated with the training process. This work opens the possibility to assess the training performance of surgical residents using electrophysiological recordings.

Here, we investigated the hemispheric distribution of alpha during orienting of attention in male and female right brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect. Temporal spectral evolution showed that in patients with neglect alpha oscillations over the damaged hemisphere were pathologically enhanced both during the baseline-fixation period that preceded cued orienting (capturing tonic alpha changes) and during orienting with leftward, rightward, or neutral-bilateral spatial cues (reflecting phasic alpha changes). Patients without neglect showed a similar though significantly less enhanced hemispheric asymmetry. Healthy control subjects displayed a conventional decrease of alpha activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the direction of orienting. In right-brain-damaged patients, neglect severity in the line bisection task was significantly correlated both with tonic alpha asymmetry during the baseline period and with phasic asymmetries during orienting of attention with neutral-bilateral and leftward cues. Asymmetries with neutral-bilateral and leftward cues were correlated with lesion of white matter tracts linking frontal with parietal- occipital areas. These findings show that disruption of rostrocaudal white matter connectivity in the right hemisphere interferes with the maintenance of optimal baseline tonic levels of alpha and the phasic modulation of alpha activity during shifts of attention. The hemispheric distribution of alpha activity can be used as a diagnostic tool for acquired pathological biases of spatial attention due to unilateral brain damage.

The occurrence of repeated sleep onset REM periods over the Multiple Sleep Latency Test offers a unique opportunity to identify EEG patterns predictive of successful dream recall after short periods composed of only REM or NREM sleep. It also permits to disentangle state- from trait-like differences in dream recall, by using a within-subjects design. Methods A consecutive series of 115 first-diagnosed drug-free adult narcolepsy-type 1 patients underwent Multiple Sleep Latency Tests and were asked after each nap opportunity if they had or had not a dream experience. Scalp EEG power and a specific index of cortical activation (delta/beta power ratio), obtained from naps of 43 patients with both presence and absence of dream recall in the same sleep stage, were compared separately for REM and NREM sleep. Results Successful dream recall was associated with an increased EEG desynchronization in both REM and NREM over partially overlapping cortical areas. Compared to unsuccessful recall, it showed (1) lower delta power over centro-parietal areas during both stages, (2) higher beta power in the same cortical areas during NREM, and (3) lower values in the delta/beta ratio during NREM in most scalp locations. Interpretation A more activated electrophysiological milieu in both REM and NREM sleep promotes dream recall, strengthening the notion that the parietal areas are crucial not only in generating dream experience, as shown in brain-damaged patients, but also in the memory processing leading to recall.

J	Park, JK; Kim, JT				Park, Jong Kang; Kim, Jong Tae			Deterministic Sensor Signal Detection Technique for Static and Short-Ranged Channels Using Real-Valued Independent Component Analysis	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Active sensor; noise reduction; demodulation; independent component analysis	SINUSOIDAL SIGNALS; SEPARATION; ALGORITHMS; INTERNET; DELAY; EEG	Periodic noise in active sensors is not random and cannot easily be eliminated by successive integration of signal samples. These noise components, often, tend to severely degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor signals, thereby resulting in detection failures. To facilitate effective reduction of non-random noises, the proposed study presents a digital front-end procedure based on modified independent component analysis (ICA). In comparison with conventional demodulation-based techniques, the proposed method can suppress periodic noise whilst enabling fine detection of the signal phase and magnitude through use of only a few samples. A new cost-effective two-channel ICA-based technique and its initialization method were devised for individual sensor devices. The proposed preprocessing method employing partial in-phase and quadrature demodulation strengthens system immunity against Gaussian random noises, which inevitably exist in most sensing circuits. This paper also discusses results obtained via implementation of a customized logic design for the full scenario of the proposed denoising technique. With regard to the capacitive and visible light sensors, experimental results demonstrate that errors caused by noise components that occur close to the stimulating frequency are suppressed at rates 3.2-5.3 times higher compared to existing processing techniques.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were measured from the frontal region of the head in normal, healthy subjects, and frequency analyses were performed. Each odor stimulation was delivered while the subject was tasting chocolate, using chocolate paste as the odorant for 'matched odor stimulation,' and garlic paste for 'unmatched odor stimulation.' Differences in EEG signals appeared between the matched and unmatched arms of the study. Comparison of the frequencies of EEGs captured under the condition of unmatched odor stimulation with those captured under the condition of matched odor stimulation showed that the occupancy rate of the theta-frequency band under the condition of unmatched odor stimulation was higher than that under the condition of matched odor stimulation. Interestingly, a negative correlation existed between the occupancy rate of the theta-frequency band and the subjective feeling of chocolate sweetness. The present findings suggest that when humans receive odors that do not match with the foods being consumed, subjective feelings are disturbed and theta-band brain activity is increased while the unmatched information is cross-checked.

Rebound or Entrainment?

While working towards clinical impact, ACS mechanisms of action remain unclear. For ACS's well-documented influence on occipital alpha, hypotheses include neuronal entrainment as well as rebound phenomena. As a retinal origin is also discussed, we employed a novel form of ACS with the advantage that it specifically targets occipital alpha-oscillations via retinofugal pathways retinofugal ACS (rACS). We aimed to confirm alpha-enhancement outlasting the duration of stimulation with 10 Hz rACS. To distinguish entrainment from rebound effects, we investigated the correlation between alpha peak frequency change and alpha-enhancement strength. We quantified the alpha band power before and after 10 Hz rACS in 15 healthy subjects. Alpha power enhancement and alpha peak frequency change were assessed over the occipital electrodes and compared to sham stimulation. RACS significantly enhanced occipital alpha power in comparison to sham stimulation (p < 0.05). Alpha peak frequency changed by a mean 0.02 Hz (+/- 0.04). A greater change in alpha peak frequency did not correlate with greater effects on alpha power. Our findings show an alpha-enhancement consistent with studies conducted for transcranial ACS (tACS) and contribute evidence for a retinal involvement in tACS effects on occipital alpha. Furthermore, the lack of correlation between alpha peak frequency change and alpha-enhancement strength provides an argument against entrainment effects and in favor of a rebound phenomenon.

Working memory needs to dissociate representations that drive attention towards currently relevant information from prospective representations that are needed for future tasks, but that until then should be prevented from guiding attention. Yet, little is known about how the brain initiates and controls such sequential prioritization of selection. In the current study we recorded EEG while subjects remembered a color as the target template for one of two sequential search tasks, thus making it either currently relevant (when it was the target for the first search) or prospectively relevant (when it was the target for the second search) prior to the task sequence. Using time-frequency specific linear classifiers, we were able to predict the priority status (current versus prospective) of the memory representation from multivariate patterns of delta (2-4 Hz) and non-lateralized alpha power (8-14 Hz) during both delay periods. The delta band was only transiently involved when initializing the priority status at the start of the first delay, or when switching priority during the second delay, which we interpret as reflecting the momentary top-down control over prioritization. In contrast, alpha power decoding was based on a more stable pattern of activity that generalized across time both within and between delay periods, which we interpret as reflecting a difference in the prioritized memory representations themselves. Taken together, we reveal the involvement of a complex, distributed and dynamic spatiotemporal landscape of frequency-specific oscillatory activity in controlling prioritization of information within working memory.

Despite the use of strikingly similar experimental paradigms, they differ crucially in their notion of the stimulus-driven periodic brain responses: one regards them mostly as synchronized (entrained) intrinsic brain rhythms; the other assumes they are predominantly evoked responses [classically termed steady-state responses (SSRs)] that add to the ongoing brain activity. This conceptual difference can produce contradictory predictions about, and interpretations of, experimental outcomes. The effect of spatial attention on brain rhythms in the alpha band (8 -13 Hz) is one such instance: alpha-range SSRs have typically been found to increase in power when participants focus their spatial attention on laterally presented stimuli, in line with a gain control of the visual evoked response. In nearly identical experiments, retinotopic decreases in entrained alpha-band power have been reported, in line with the inhibitory function of intrinsic alpha. Here we reconcile these contradictory findings by showing that they result from a small but far-reaching difference between two common approaches to EEG spectral decomposition. In a new analysis of previously published human EEG data, recorded during bilateral rhythmic visual stimulation, we find the typical SSR gain effect when emphasizing stimulus-locked neural activity and the typical retinotopic alpha suppression when focusing on ongoing rhythms. These opposite but parallel effects suggest that spatial attention may bias the neural processing of dynamic visual stimulation via two complementary neural mechanisms.

The Role of Meaning in Visual Memory: Face-Selective Brain Activity Predicts Memory for Ambiguous Face Stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; face memory; memory; N170; visual memory	LONG-TERM-MEMORY; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; RECOGNITION; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; PATTERNS; INSIGHTS; RECALL	How people process images is known to affect memory for those images, but these effects have typically been studied using explicit task instructions to vary encoding. Here, we investigate the effects of intrinsic variation in processing on subsequent memory, testing whether recognizing an ambiguous stimulus as meaningful (as a face vs as shape blobs) predicts subsequent visual memory even when matching the perceptual features and the encoding strategy between subsequently remembered and subsequently forgotten items. We show in adult humans of either sex that single trial EEG activity can predict whether participants will subsequently remember an ambiguous Mooney face image (e.g., an image that will sometimes be seen as a face and sometimes not be seen as a face). In addition, we show that a classifier trained only to discriminate between whether participants perceive a face versus non-face can generalize to predict whether an ambiguous image is subsequently remembered. Furthermore, when we examine the N170, an event-related potential index of face processing, we find that images that elicit larger N170s are more likely to be remembered than those that elicit smaller N170s, even when the exact same image elicited larger or smaller N170s across participants. Thus, images processed as meaningful, in this case as a face, during encoding are better remembered than identical images that are not processed as a face. This provides strong evidence that understanding the meaning of a stimulus during encoding plays a critical role in visual memory.

They imply feelings like urgency (red), productivity (yellow, green), restful (blue) and other sensations. Researchers have been investigating color impact in interface design. Some authors studied color influence in the brain waves aiming to verify changes of humor and/or performance while using an interface. The purpose of this study is to verify the difference between colors in brain response, human perception and performance while playing a game that was designed with a combination of fifteen rectangles filled with complementary colors and a single one filled with a different color. Ten volunteers performed the experiment where they were advised to identify the different color target. The time of performance and the EEG were recorded, and then the power spectral density was extracted and analyzed. Results showed an increase of alpha band in prefrontal, visual and primary motor cortex. The brain activity in the right hemisphere was greater than in the left hemisphere during the experiment. However, the comparison of brain response among colors combination presented no visual or significant difference. Moreover, data time analysis showed that the red-cyan-magenta scenario was the slowest one and the blue-yellow-red was the fastest, although there were no statistically significant between them.

Previous work has shown that neural oscillations will entrain to the beat of the music or rhythmic stimuli. Despite the fact that aging is known to impact both auditory and cognitive processing, little is known about how aging affects neural entrainment to rhythmic stimuli. In this study, younger and older participants listened to isochronous sequences at a slower and faster rate while EEG data was recorded. Steady-state evoked potentials had amplitude peaks at the stimulus rate and its harmonics. Steady-state evoked potentials at the stimulus rate and the first harmonic was attenuated in older adults compared to younger adults. Additionally, no amplitude difference was found for the second and third harmonics in older adults, while there was a decrease in amplitude in younger adults. This age-related decline in the entrainment specificity of the brain responses to the stimulus rate, suggests that aging may decrease the ability to entrain to stimuli in the environment, and further suggests that older adults may be less able to inhibit neural entrainment that is not directly related to the incoming stimulus.

It was recently shown that approval of the consequential behavior of driverless cars varied with the number of lives saved and showed interindividual differences, with approval increasing alongside the number of lives saved. In the present study, interindividual differences in individualized moral decision-making at both the behavioral and neural level were investigated using EEG. It was found that alpha event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and delta/theta phase-locking - intertrial coherence (ITC) and phase-locking value (PLV)- play a central role in mediating interindividual differences in Moral decision-making. In addition, very late alpha activity differences between individualized and shared stimuli, and delta/theta ITC, where shown to be closely related to reaction time and subjectively perceived emotional distress. This demonstrates that interindividual differences in Moral decision-making are mediated neuronally by various markers - late alpha ERSP, and delta/theta ITC - as well as psychologically by reaction time and perceived emotional distress. Our data show, for the first time, how and according to which neuronal and behavioral measures interindividual differences in Moral dilemmas can be measured.

High-Frequency Neuronal Oscillatory Abnormalities in the Phospholipase C-beta 1 Knockout Mouse Model of Schizophrenia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						animal model; antipsychotic; electrophysiology; neural oscillations; PLC-B1 KO mice	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; GAMMA; RECEPTORS; OLANZAPINE; CLOZAPINE; DEFICITS; CORTEX; MEMORY; EEG; PHARMACOKINETICS	Background: Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by psychoses, socioaffective disturbances, and cognitive deficits. The phosphodiesterase enzyme phospholipase C-beta 1 has been reported to be reduced in postmortem tissue of schizophrenia patients. Dysregulation of neuronal oscillations, particularly those in the higher frequency range such as beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz), are also associated with this disorder. We investigated the influence of phospholipase C-beta 1 gene deletion on cortical oscillatory activity and sensorimotor gating behavior. Methods: Adult phospholipase C-beta 1 knockout and wild-type C57Bl/6J control mice (total n = 26) underwent surgical implantation of extradural electrodes to allow electrocorticography recordings. Electrocorticography was recorded during prepulse inhibition behavior sessions to measure ongoing and auditory-evoked electrophysiological responses. Mice were also pretreated with antipsychotic drugs haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg), clozapine (2.5 mg/kg), and olanzapine (5 mg/kg). Results: Phospholipase C-beta 1 knockout mice exhibited reduced prepulse inhibition and diminished power and phase synchrony of beta and gamma oscillatory responses to auditory stimuli as well as elevated ongoing beta oscillations. Reductions in prepulse inhibition were highly correlated with the power and phase synchrony of evoked oscillations. Clozapine and olanzapine ameliorated the prepulse inhibition deficit in phospholipase C-beta 1 knockout mice, but not the electrophysiology abnormalities. Conclusions: Phospholipase C-beta 1 reduction leads to disturbances to beta and gamma oscillatory dynamics and prepulse inhibition behavior. The strong relationships between these measures demonstrate the importance of event-related oscillatory activity to sensorimotor gating behavior. However, dissociation of these measures observed in the drug studies suggests that abnormalities in neuronal networks may not necessarily need to be corrected for behavioral improvement.

The developmental trajectory of sensorimotor cortical oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Beta; PBMR; Gamma; Motor cortex; Hand	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; BAND ACTIVITY; MOVEMENT; GAMMA; SYNCHRONIZATION; MEG; SEPARATION; EEG; LOCALIZATION	Numerous studies of motor control have confirmed beta and gamma oscillations in the primary motor cortices during basic movements. These responses include a robust beta decrease that precedes and extends through movement onset, a transient gamma response that coincides with the movement, and a post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) response that occurs after movement offset. While the existence of these responses has been confirmed by many studies, very few studies have examined their developmental trajectory. In the current study, we utilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate age-related changes in sensorimotor cortical oscillations in a large cross-section of children and adolescents (n = 94; age range = 9 -15 years-old). All participants performed a stimulus detection task with their right finger and the resulting MEG data were examined using oscillatory analysis methods and imaged using a beamformer. Consistent with adult studies, these youth participants exhibited characteristic beta (16-24 Hz) decreases prior to and during movement, as well as PMBR responses following movement offset, and a transient gamma (74-84 Hz) response during movement execution. Our primary findings were that the strength of the PMBR increased with age, while the strength of the gamma synchronization decreased with chronological age. In addition, the strength of each motor-related oscillatory response was significantly correlated with the power of spontaneous activity in the same frequency range and same voxel. This was the case for all three oscillatory responses. In conclusion, we investigated motor-related oscillatory activity in the largest cohort of children and adolescents reported to date, and our results indicated that beta and gamma cortical oscillations continue to develop as children transition into adolescents, and that these responses may not be fully matured until young to middle adulthood.

While noxious stimuli seem good candidates to explore DoC patients' responsivity, autonomic and electrophysiological correlates of pain detection in DoC patients are still debated. This research aims at investigating autonomic and cortical activation as covert measure of residual somatosensory and nociceptive processes in patients in vegetative state. Twenty-one patients received touch- and pain-related stimulations while autonomic and cortical measures were recorded, with minimal stress for them. Results showed an increased frontal and parietal activation in response to both touch and pain stimuli. Pain-related stimulation was however associated with greater delta parietal response, lower left frontal activation, and increased electrodermal and heart rate measures. Present findings suggest that both somatic stimulations could induce measurable central responses, which might mirror basic attention orientation and perceptual processes. Nonetheless, the nociceptive stimulation in particular seemed to induce a more consistent and informative pattern of covert response even if we used a mild pain-induction procedure.

There is evidence to suggest that a hypnotic state may help patients to better achieve tasks of motor imagination, which is central in the rehabilitation protocols after a stroke. However, the hypnosis techniques could also alter activity in the motor cortex. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of hypnosis on the EEG signal during a movement or an imagined movement is poorly investigated. In particular, how event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns would be modulated for different motor tasks may provide a better understanding of the potential benefits of hypnosis for stroke rehabilitation. To investigate this purpose, we recorded EEG signals from 23 healthy volunteers who performed real movements and motor imageries in a closed eye condition. Our results suggest that the state of hypnosis changes the sensorimotor beta rhythm during the ERD phase but maintains the ERS phase in the mu and beta frequency band, suggesting a different activation of the motor cortex in a hypnotized state.

Design: This study used a within-subject design. Method: Forty expert golfers were recruited to perform 60 putts while their EEGs were recorded. The putting distance was chosen to ensure that approximately 50% of all putts would be missed so that there was a need for constant adjustments to be made during performance. Successful performance was defined as the ball going in the hole. Results: (a) Lower Mu power in Cz, and alpha power in Pz and Oz were observed for successful performances compared with unsuccessful performances at T1 ( 2000 1000 ms); (b) Higher SMR power in Cz was observed for successful performances relative to unsuccessful performances at T2 ( 1000 0 ms). Conclusions: These findings not only support the multi-action plan model (MAP) and the psychomotor efficiency hypothesis, but also reveal the temporal dynamics of the cognitive mechanisms in an optimal-controlled state.

The norepinephrine (NE) system has been shown to modulate these oscillations possibly via gain control mechanisms, which depend on the modulation of neuron membrane potentials. Because the latter are also modulated by tDCS, the interrelation of tDCS and NE effects on superior frontal theta band activity needs investigation. We test the hypothesis that anodal tDCS affects modulatory effects of the NE system on theta band activity during inhibitory control in superior frontal regions. Using EEG beamforming, theta band activity in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) was integrated (correlated) with the pupil diameter data as an indirect index of NE activity. In a within-subject design, healthy participants completed a response inhibition task in two sessions in which they received 2mA anodal tDCS over the vertex, or sham stimulation. There were no behavioral effects of anodal tDCS. Yet, tDCS affected correlations between SFG theta band activity time course and the pupil diameter time course. Correlations were evident after sham stimulation (r=.701; p<.004), but absent after anodal tDCS. The observed power of this dissociation was above 95%. The data suggest that anodal tDCS may eliminate neuromodulatory effects, likely of the NE system, on theta band activity during response inhibition in a structure of the response inhibition network. The NE system and tDCS seem to target similar mechanisms important for cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex. The results provide a hint why tDCS often fails to induce overt behavioral effects and shows that neurobiological systems, which may exert similar effects as tDCS on neural processes should closely be monitored in tDCS experiments.

Neurophysiology of Avian Sleep: Comparing Natural Sleep and Isoflurane Anesthesia	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Columba livia; avian brain; visual hyperpallium; NREM sleep; isoflurane anesthesia; slow-waves; burst suppression; propagation	LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; PIGEON COLUMBA; SLOW OSCILLATION; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; IN-VIVO; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; LIVIA; TELENCEPHALON; SEVOFLURANE	Propagating slow-waves in electroencephalogram (EEG) or local field potential (LFP) recordings occur during non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep in both mammals and birds. Moreover, in both, input from the thalamus is thought to contribute to the genesis of NREM sleep slow-waves. Interestingly, the general features of slow-waves are also found under isoflurane anesthesia. However, it is unclear to what extent these slow-waves reflect the same processes as those giving rise to NREM sleep slow-waves. Similar slow-wave spatio-temporal properties during NREM sleep and isoflurane anesthesia would suggest that both types of slow-waves are based on related processes. We used a 32-channel silicon probe connected to a transmitter to make intra-cortical recordings of the visual hyperpallium in naturally sleeping and isoflurane anesthetized pigeons (Columba livia) using a within-bird design. Under anesthesia, the amplitude of LFP slow-waves was higher when compared to NREM sleep. Spectral power density across all frequencies (1.5-100 Hz) was also elevated. In addition, slow-wave coherence between electrode sites was higher under anesthesia, indicating higher synchrony when compared to NREM sleep. Nonetheless, the spatial distribution of slow-waves under anesthesia was more comparable to NREM sleep than to wake or REM sleep. Similar to NREM sleep, slow-wave propagation under anesthesia mainly occurred in the thalamic input layers of the hyperpallium, regions which also showed the greatest slow-wave power during both recording conditions. This suggests that the thalamus could be involved in the genesis of slow-waves under both conditions. Taken together, although slow-waves under isoflurane anesthesia are stronger, they share spatio-temporal activity characteristics with slow-waves during NREM sleep.

However, the mechanism of generation and the physiological function of this brain rhythm have not yet been clarified. Multichannel extracellular field potentials of the ACC were recorded and analyzed using the current source density method in halothane-anesthetized rats. Spontaneous high-current spikes (HCSs) were localized in the deep part of layer II/III and upper part of layer V of the ACC. The frequency of HCSs in the ACC was 7-12 Hz, with an amplitude of 6.5 +/- 0.76 mV/mm(2) and duration of 55.24 +/- 2.43 ms. The power density significantly decreased (84.56 +/- 6.93%, p < 0.05, t test) after pinching the hindpaw and significantly increased (149.28 +/- 15.96%) after treatment with morphine. The suppressive effect of pinching was reversed by naloxone (0.7 mg/kg, i.p.). HCSs coincided with initiation of the depolarization of cingulate neurons and remained in a depolarized upstate. The occurrence of cingulate HCSs was persistently preceded by a hyperpolarization phase and a burst of multiunit spike activity in the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus. Spontaneous field-potential oscillations changed from 10 Hz to a lower band (i.e., similar to 7.5 Hz) when a central poststroke pain condition was induced. The central poststroke pain group had a higher average coherence coefficient compared with the control group. Our results indicate that spontaneous cingulate cortical HCSs could be initiated by thalamocortical synaptic inputs from the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus and maintained by intracortical neuronal upstate mechanisms in physiological and pathological pain states.

Trace amine-associated receptor 1 agonism promotes wakefulness without impairment of cognition in Cynomolgus macaques	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; MONKEYS; NEUROTRANSMISSION; TRANSMISSION; INVOLVEMENT; MODULATION; REVEALS; FAMILY	Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G-protein coupled receptor with affinity for the trace amines. TAAR1 agonists have pro-cognitive, antidepressant-, and antipsychotic-like properties in both rodents and non-human primates (NHPs). TAAR1 agonism also increases wakefulness and suppresses rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in mice and rats and reduces cataplexy in two mouse models of narcolepsy. We investigated the effects of TAAR1 agonism in Cynomolgus macaques, a diurnal species that exhibits consolidated night-time sleep, and evaluated the effects of TAAR1 agonists on cognition using a working memory (WM) paradigm in this species. Adult male Cynomolgus macaques (n = 6) were surgically implanted to record the electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram, and locomotor activity (LMA) and the efficacy of the TAAR1 partial agonist RO5263397 (0.1,1,10 mg/kg, p.o.) on sleep/wake, EEG spectra, and LMA was determined. In a second experiment, the acute effects of RO5263397 (0.1,1,10 mg/kg, p.o.) were assessed on a delayed-match-to-sample test of WM in adult male macaques (n = 7). RO5263397 (10 mg/kg) administered at lights off, when sleep pressure was high, promoted wakefulness and reduced both REM and non-REM sleep without inducing hyperlocomotion. RO5263397 (10 mg/kg) also increased delta/theta activity during all vigilance states. RO5263397 had no effect on WM at either short (2 sec) or long (10 sec) delay intervals. The wake-enhancing and REM-suppressing effects of R05263397 shown here in a diurnal primate are consistent with previous results in nocturnal rodents. These effects and the associated alterations in EEG spectra occurred without inducing hyperlocomotion or affecting WM, encouraging further study of TAAR1 agonists as potential narcolepsy therapeutics.

J	Magosso, E; De Crescenzio, F; Ricci, G; Piastra, S; Ursino, M				Magosso, Elisa; De Crescenzio, Francesca; Ricci, Giulia; Piastra, Sergio; Ursino, Mauro			EEG Alpha Power Is Modulated by Attentional Changes during Cognitive Tasks and Virtual Reality Immersion	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INTERNALLY DIRECTED ATTENTION; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; BAND; FREQUENCIES; INHIBITION; PARIETAL; THETA; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Variations in alpha rhythm have a significant role in perception and attention. Recently, alpha decrease has been associated with externally directed attention, especially in the visual domain, whereas alpha increase has been related to internal processing such as mental arithmetic. However, the role of alpha oscillations and how the different components of a task (processing of external stimuli, internal manipulation/representation, and task demand) interact to affect alpha power are still unclear. Here, we investigate how alpha power is differently modulated by attentional tasks depending both on task difficulty (less/more demanding task) and direction of attention (internal/external). To this aim, we designed two experiments that differently manipulated these aspects. Experiment 1, outside Virtual Reality (VR), involved two tasks both requiring internal and external attentional components (intake of visual items for their internal manipulation) but with different internal task demands (arithmetic vs. reading). Experiment 2 took advantage of the VR (mimicking an aircraft cabin interior) to manipulate attention direction: it included a condition of VR immersion only, characterized by visual external attention, and a condition of a purely mental arithmetic task during VR immersion, requiring neglect of sensory stimuli. Results show that: (1) In line with previous studies, visual external attention caused a significant alpha decrease, especially in parieto-occipital regions; (2) Alpha decrease was significantly larger during the more demanding arithmetic task, when the task was driven by external visual stimuli; (3) Alpha dramatically increased during the purely mental task in VR immersion, whereby the external stimuli had no relation with the task. Our results suggest that alpha power is crucial to isolate a subject from the environment, and move attention from external to internal cues. Moreover, they emphasize that the emerging use of VR associated with EEG may have important implications to study brain rhythms and support the design of artificial systems.

EEG model stability and online decoding of attentional demand during gait using gamma band features	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Attention level; Gait; EEG; Online	PLASTICITY; REHABILITATION; CORTEX; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; ARTIFACTS; RESPONSES; RELEVANT; ALPHA; THETA	Rehabilitation therapies are evolving oriented to improve their performances in terms of functional recovery. To achieve such recovery, the patients' involvement is an important factor that correlates with the plastic properties of the brain. By evaluating electroencephalographic signals, it is possible to modify, in real time, the parameters of the rehabilitation according to the patients' cognitive state. In this paper, an online brain-machine interface to measure the attention level during gait is presented. The system is based on the measurement of selective attention mechanisms manifested as power synchronization and desynchronization in the gamma band. A Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier is used to provide an attention index between 0 and 1 in real time. Robust techniques for artifact rejection and signal standardization are used in order to deal with the problems associated to the measurement of cortical signals during walking. The final interface is validated with 4 incomplete Spinal Cord Injury patients and 4 healthy participants. The system shows an average success rate of 68.1% in the classification of 3 attention levels and a stable behavior of these results during time. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zammit, N; Muscat, R				Zammit, Nowell; Muscat, Richard			Beta band oscillatory deficits during working memory encoding in adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactive disorder	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; beta rhythms; electroencephalographic; methylphenidate; working memory	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; STIMULANT MEDICATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; EEG; ADHD; CHILDREN	Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioural disorder, characterized by symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity, in addition to various cognitive deficits, including working memory impairments. This pathology arises from a complex constellation of genetic, structural and neurotransmission abnormalities, which give rise to the aberrant electrophysiological patterns evident in patients with ADHD. Among such, findings have consistently provided support in favour of weaker power across the beta frequency range. Evidence has also emerged that beta rhythmic decrements are linked to working memory encoding. The catecholaminergic modulation of both working memory and beta oscillations may suggest that the link between the two might be rooted at the neurotransmission level. Studies have consistently shown that ADHD involves significant catecholaminergic dysregulation, which is also supported by other clinical studies that demonstrate stimulant-induced amelioration of ADHD symptomology. In this study, we explore the possible ways that might relate ADHD, working memory, beta rhythms and catecholaminergic signalling altogether by investigating the integrity of encoding-relevant electroencephalographic beta rhythms in medication-naive and stimulant-medicated adolescent patients. The aberrant parietal and frontal encoding-related beta rhythm revealed in the ADHD patients together with a working memory (WM) deficit as observed herein was reversed by methylphenidate in the latter case but not with regard to the beta rhythm. This finding per se raises the issue of the role played by beta rhythms in the WM deficits associated with ADHD.

J	Yeldesbay, A; Fink, GR; Daun, S				Yeldesbay, Azamat; Fink, Gereon R.; Daun, Silvia			Reconstruction of effective connectivity in the case of asymmetric phase distributions	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Dynamic Causal Modelling; Phase oscillators; n:m synchronization	DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; INFERENCE; EEG	Background: The interaction of different brain regions is supported by transient synchronization between neural oscillations at different frequencies. Different measures based on synchronization theory are used to assess the strength of the interactions from experimental data. One method of estimating the effective connectivity between brain regions, within the framework of the theory of weakly coupled phase oscillators, was implemented in Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) for phase coupling (Penny et al., 2009). However, the results of such an approach strongly depend on the observables used to reconstruct the equations (Kralemann et al., 2008). In particular, an asymmetric distribution of the observables could result in a false estimation of the effective connectivity between the network nodes. New method: In this work we built a new modelling part into DCM for phase coupling, and extended it with a distortion function that accommodates departures from purely sinusoidal oscillations. Results: By analysing numerically generated data sets with an asymmetric phase distribution, we demonstrated that the extended DCM for phase coupling with the additional modelling component, correctly estimates the coupling functions. Comparison with existing methods: The new method allows for different intrinsic frequencies among coupled neuronal populations and provides results that do not depend on the distribution of the observables. Conclusions: The proposed method can be used to analyse effective connectivity between brain regions within and between different frequency bands, to characterize m:n phase coupling, and to unravel underlying mechanisms of the transient synchronization.

Power Spectral Density and Functional Connectivity Changes due to a Sensorimotor Neurofeedback Training: A Preliminary Study	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Article								Neurofeedback is a form of neuromodulation based on learning to modify some aspects of cortical activity. Sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) oscillation is one of the most used frequency bands in neurofeedback. Several studies have shown that subjects can learn to modulate SMR power to control output devices, but little is known about possible related changes in brain networks. The aim of this study was to investigate the enhanced performance and changes in EEG power spectral density at somatosensory cerebral areas due to a bidirectional modulation-based SMR neurofeedback training. Furthermore, we also analyzed the functional changes in somatosensory areas during resting state induced by the training as exploratory procedure. A six-session neurofeedback protocol based on learning to synchronize and desynchronize (modulate) the SMR was implemented. Moreover, half of the participants were enrolled in two functional magnetic resonance imaging resting-state sessions (before and after the training). At the end of the training, participants showed a successful performance enhancement, an increase in SMR power specific to somatosensory locations, and higher functional connectivity between areas associated with somatosensory activity in resting state. Our research increases the better understanding of the relation between EEG neuromodulation and functional changes and the use of SMR training in clinical practice.

On the one hand, electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates and humans have identified changes in firing rates and power modulations of beta band oscillations with the vibrotactile frequencies held in working memory, as well as with the mental operation required for decision making. On the other hand, firing rates and centro-parietal potentials were found to increase to a fixed level at the time of responding during the random-dot motion task, possibly reflecting an underlying evidence accumulation mechanism until a decision threshold is met. Here, to bridge these two paradigms, we presented two visual random-dot motion stimuli in a sequential comparison task while recording EEG from human volunteers. We identified a modulation of prefrontal beta band power that scaled with the level of dot motion coherence of the first stimulus during a short retention interval. Furthermore, beta power in premotor areas was modulated by participants' choices approximately 700 ms before responses were given via button press. At the same time, dot motion patches of the second stimulus evoked a pattern of broadband centro-parietal signal build-up till responses were made, whose peak varied with trial difficulty. Hence, we show that known modulations of beta power during working memory and decision making extend from the vibrotactile to the visual domain and provide support for the notion of evidence accumulation as an unconfined decision-making mechanism generalizing over distinct decision types.

In this study, we identified coupling between the brain and the heart along the continuum of sedation levels, but not in discrete sedation levels (e.g., wakefulness, conscious sedation, and deep sedation). To identify coupling between the brain and the heart during sedation, we induced several depths of sedation using patient-controlled sedation with propofol and midazolam. We performed electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis and extracted the instantaneous heart rate (HR) from the electrocardiogram (ECG). EEG spectral power dynamics and mean HR were compared along the continuum of sedation levels. We found that EEG sigma power was the parameter most sensitive to changes in the sedation level and was correlated with the mean HR under the effect of sedative agents. Moreover, we calculated the Granger causality (GC) value to quantify brain-heart coupling at each sedation level. Additionally, the GC analysis revealed noticeably different strengths and directions of causality among different sedation levels. In all the sedation levels, GC values from the brain to the heart (GC(b -> h)) were higher than GC values from the heart to the brain (GC(h -> b)). Moreover, the mean GC(b -> h) increased as the sedation became deeper, resulting in higher GC(b -> h) values in deep sedation (1.97 +/- 0.18 in propofol, 2.02 +/- 0.15 in midazolam) than in pre-sedation (1.71 +/- 0.13 in propofol, 1.75 +/- 0.11 in midazolam; p < 0.001). These results show that coupling between brain and heart activities becomes stronger as sedation becomes deeper, and that this coupling is more attributable to the brain-heart direction than to the heart-brain direction. These findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between the brain and the heart under specific conditions, namely, different sedation states.

J	Yeh, N; Rose, NS				Yeh, Nicholas; Rose, Nathan S.			How Can Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Be Used to Modulate Episodic Memory?: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						non-invasive brain stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation; repetitive TMS; theta-burst stimulation; episodic memory; recall; recognition	NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; PARIETAL CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; TMS-EEG; INTERFERENCE; RETRIEVAL; RTMS	A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to synthesize the existing literature on how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to modulate episodic memory. Given the numerous parameters of TMS protocols and experimental design characteristics that can be manipulated, a mechanistic understanding of how changes in the combination of parameters (e.g., frequency, timing, intensity, targeted brain region, memory task) modulate episodic memory is needed. To address this, we reviewed 59 studies and conducted a meta-analysis on 245 effect sizes from 37 articles on healthy younger adults (N = 1,061). Analyses revealed generally more beneficial effects of 1-Hz rTMS vs. other frequencies on episodic memory. Moderation analyses revealed complex interactions as online 20-Hz rTMS protocols led to negative effects, while offline 20-Hz rTMS led to enhancing effects. There was also an interaction between stimulation intensity and frequency as 20-Hz rTMS had more negative effects when applied below-vs. at-motor threshold. Conversely, 1-Hz rTMS hadmore beneficial effects than other frequencies when applied below-vs. at-or above-motor threshold. No reliable aggregate or hypothesized interactions were found when assessing stimulation site (frontal vs. parietal cortex, left vs. right hemisphere), stimulated memory process (during encoding vs. retrieval), the type of retrieval (associative/recollection vs. item/familiarity), or the type of control comparison (active vs. sham or no TMS) on episodic memory. However, there is insufficient data to make strong inference based on the lack of aggregate or two-way interactions between these factors, or to assess more complex (e.g., 3-way) interactions. We reviewed the effects on other populations (healthy older adults and clinical populations), but systematic comparison of parameters was also prevented due to insufficient data. A database of parameters and effects sizes is available as an open source repository so that data from studies can be continuously accumulated in order to facilitate futuremeta-analysis. In conclusion, modulating episodic memory relies on complex interactions among the numerous moderator variables that can be manipulated. Therefore, rigorous, systematic comparisons need to be further investigated as the body of literature grows in order to fully understand the combination of parameters that lead to enhancing, detrimental or null effects on episodic memory.

J	King-Stephens, D				King-Stephens, David			The Ambiguous Nature of Fast Ripples in Epilepsy Surgery	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS	Removing High-Frequency Oscillations: A Prospective Multicenter Study on Seizure Outcome Objective: To evaluate the use of interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in epilepsy surgery for prediction of postsurgical seizure outcome in a prospective multicenter trial. Methods: We hypothesized that a seizure-free outcome could be expected in patients in whom the surgical planning included the majority of HFO-generating brain tissue, while a poor seizure outcome could be expected in patients in whom only a few such areas were planned to be resected. Fifty-two patients were included from 3 tertiary epilepsy centers during a 1-year period. Ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) were automatically detected during slow-wave sleep with chronic intracranial EEG in 2 centers and acute intraoperative electrocorticography in 1 patient. Results: There was a correlation between the removal of HFO-generating regions and seizure-free outcome at the group level for all patients. No correlation was found, however, for the center-specific analysis, and an individual prognostication of seizure outcome was true in only 36 (67%) patients. Moreover, some patients became seizure-free without removal of the majority of HFO-generating tissue. The investigation of influencing factors, including comparisons of visual and automatic analysis, using a threshold analysis for areas with high HFO activity, and excluding contacts bordering the resection, did not result in improved prognostication. Conclusions: On an individual patient level, a prediction of outcome was not possible in all patients. This may be due to the analysis techniques used. Alternatively, HFOs may be less specific for epileptic tissue than earlier studies have indicated.											11	2	3	0	0	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1535-7597	1535-7511		EPILEPSY CURR	Epilepsy Curr.

Recent psychological studies, however, show observable variability of internal criteria occurs by random noise. The neural correlates of said random noise - an instance of 'psychological noise' - yet remain unclear. Combining simulation, behavioral, and neural approaches, our study investigated the psychological and neural correlates of such random noise in our internal criteria during decision making. We applied well-established decision-making tasks which relied on either internal criteria - occupation choice task as internally-guided decision making (IDM) - or external criteria - salary judgment task as externally-guided decision making (EDM). Subjects underwent EEG for resting state and task-evoked activity during IDM and EDM. We measured resting state long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in the alpha frequency range as the index of neuronal noise. Based on our simulation, we identified a measure of psychological noise (as distinguished from true preference change) in IDM. The main finding shows that the indices for psychological noise are directly related to frontocentral LRTC in the alpha range. Higher degrees of frontocentral LRTC, which index lower neuronal noise, were related to lower degrees of psychological noise during IDM. This was not found during EDM. Resting state LRTC was also related to task-evoked activity, such as conflict-related negativity, during IDM only. Taken together, our data demonstrate, for the first time, the direct relationship between neuronal noise in the brain's intrinsic activity and psychological noise in the internal criteria of our decision making.

MI based BCIs require training, during which the user gradually learns how to control his or her brain activity with the help of feedback. Additionally, machine learning techniques are frequently used to boost BCI performance and to adapt the decoding algorithm to the user's brain. Thus, both the brain and the machine need to adapt in order to improve performance. To study the utility of co-adaptive training in the BCI paradigm and the time scales involved, we investigated the performance of two groups of subjects, in a 4-day MI experiment using EEG recordings. One group (control, n = 9 subjects) performed the BCI task using a fixed classifier based on MI data from day 1. In the second group (experimental, n = 9 subjects), the classifier was regularly adapted based on brain activity patterns during the experiment days. We found that the experimental group showed a significantly larger change in performance following training compared to the control group. Specifically, although the experimental group exhibited a decrease in performance between days, it showed an increase in performance within each day, which compensated for the decrease. The control group showed decreases both within and between days. A correlation analysis in subjects who had a notable improvement in performance following training showed that performance was mainly associated with modulation of power in the a frequency band. To conclude, continuous updating of the classification algorithm improves the performance of subjects in longitudinal BCI training.

Look at me when I'm talking to you: Selective attention at a multisensory cocktail party can be decoded using stimulus reconstruction and alpha power modulations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						audiovisual speech; electroencephalography; envelope reconstruction; visual attention; visual speech	AUDITORY ATTENTION; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; ATTENDED SPEECH; TRACKING; INTEGRATION; INCREASES; REPRESENTATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION	Recent work using electroencephalography has applied stimulus reconstruction techniques to identify the attended speaker in a cocktail party environment. The success of these approaches has been primarily based on the ability to detect cortical tracking of the acoustic envelope at the scalp level. However, most studies have ignored the effects of visual input, which is almost always present in naturalistic scenarios. In this study, we investigated the effects of visual input on envelope-based cocktail party decoding in two multisensory cocktail party situations: (a) Congruent AV-facing the attended speaker while ignoring another speaker represented by the audio-only stream and (b) Incongruent AV (eavesdropping)-attending the audio-only speaker while looking at the unattended speaker. We trained and tested decoders for each condition separately and found that we can successfully decode attention to congruent audiovisual speech and can also decode attention when listeners were eavesdropping, i.e., looking at the face of the unattended talker. In addition to this, we found alpha power to be a reliable measure of attention to the visual speech. Using parieto-occipital alpha power, we found that we can distinguish whether subjects are attending or ignoring the speaker's face. Considering the practical applications of these methods, we demonstrate that with only six near-ear electrodes we can successfully determine the attended speech. This work extends the current framework for decoding attention to speech to more naturalistic scenarios, and in doing so provides additional neural measures which may be incorporated to improve decoding accuracy.

J	Ghosh, L; Rakshit, P; Konar, A				Ghosh, Lidia; Rakshit, Pratyusha; Konar, Amit			Working memory modeling using inverse fuzzy relational approach	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Short term memory; Working memory; Bidirectional associative memory; Fuzzy relational technique; Fuzzy max-min inverse; Unified particle swarm optimization	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; PARTICLE SWARM; EEG; POWER; ALGORITHM; OSCILLATIONS; STATIONARITY	The paper proposes a novel approach to fuzzy modeling of human working memory (WM) using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, acquired during human face encoding and recall experiments in connection with a face recognition problem. The EEG signals acquired from the short term memory (STM) during memory encoding instances are considered as the input of the proposed working memory model. On the other hand, the EEG response of the WM to visual stimuli acquired during WM recall instances are considered as the output of the proposed working memory model. The entire experiment is primarily divided into two phases. In the first phase, the WM of a human subject is modeled by a fuzzy implication relation, describing a mapping from the STM response (during encoding) to the WM responses (during recall) to visual stimuli. During STM encoding, the subject is visually presented with the full face stimulus of a person. During WM recall, four partial face stimuli of the same person (made familiar during encoding) are used for the subject to recall the respective full face. The second phase is undertaken to validate the WM model by visually stimulating the subject again with randomly selected partial faces of people, being familiar in the first phase and the WM EEG responses are recorded. The WM responses along with the WM model, developed in the first phase, are used to retrieve the STM information by using an inverse fuzzy (implication) relation. Besides WM modeling, another important contribution of the paper lies in devising a solution to the inverse fuzzy relation computation in the settings of an optimization problem. An error metric is then defined to measure the discrepancy between the model-predicted STM encoding pattern and the actual pattern encoded by the STM (as captured by the EEG signal during encoding in the first phase). Apparently, smaller the error magnitude better is the accuracy of the proposed model to effectively differentiate people with memory failures. Experimentally it is observed that the proposed model yields a very small error, in the order of 10(-4), thus showing a high level of similarity between actual and model predicted STM response for all the healthy subjects. An experiment undertaken using eLORETA software confirms that the orbito-frontal cortex of prefrontal lobe is responsible for STM encoding whereas dorsolateral prefrontal region is responsible for WM recall. An analysis undertaken reveals that the proposed WM model produces the best response in the theta frequency band of EEG spectra, thus assuring the association of the theta frequency range in the face recognition task. Comparative analysis performed also substantiates that the proposed technique of computing max-min inverse fuzzy relation outperforms the existing techniques for inverse fuzzy computation, with a successful retrieval accuracy of 87.92%. The proposed study would find interesting applications to diagnose memory failures for people with Pre-frontal lobe amnesia. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Discontinuity has been observed in states of pathology, where it is predictive of adverse neurological outcome, as well as under general anesthesia. Though in preterm-infants discontinuity reflects normal brain development, less is known regarding its role in term children, particularly in the setting of general anesthesia. Here, we conduct a post-hoc exploratory analysis to investigate the spectral features of discontinuous activity in children under general anesthesia. Methods We previously recorded electroencephalography in children less than forty months of age under general anesthesia (n = 65). We characterized the relationship between age, anesthetic depth, and discontinuous activity, and used multitaper spectral methods to compare the power spectra of subjects with (n = 35) and without (n = 30) discontinuous activity. In the subjects with discontinuous activity, we examined the amplitude and power spectra associated with the discontinuities and analyzed how these variables varied with age. Results Cumulative time of discontinuity was associated with increased anesthetic depth and younger age. In particular, age-matched children with discontinuity received higher doses of propofol during induction as compared with children without discontinuity. In the tens of seconds preceding the onset of discontinuous activity, there was a decrease in high-frequency power in children four months and older that could be visually observed with spectrograms. During discontinuous activity, there were distinctive patterns of amplitude, spectral edge, and power in canonical frequency bands that varied with age. Notably, there was a decline in spectral edge in the seconds immediately following each discontinuity. Conclusion Discontinuous activity in children reflects a state of a younger or more deeply anesthetized brain, and characteristic features of discontinuous activity evolve with age and may reflect neurodevelopment.

However, existing research in this topic provides data about different oscillatory brain activities in different age groups with different musical background. In order to obtain a more coherent picture and examine early manifestations of entrainment, we assessed brain oscillations at multiple time scales (beta: 15-25 Hz, gamma: 28-48 Hz) and in steady state evoked potentials (SS-EPs in short) in 6-7-year-old children with no musical background right at the start of primary school before they learnt to read. Our goal was to exclude the effect of music training and reading, since previous studies have shown that sensorimotor entrainment (movement synchronization to the beat) is related to musical and reading abilities. We found evidence for endogenous anticipatory processing in the gamma band related to meter perception, and stimulus-related frequency specific responses. However, we did not find evidence for an interaction between auditory and motor networks, which suggests that endogenous mechanisms related to auditory processing may mature earlier than those that underlie motor actions, such as sensorimotor synchronization.

Arousal from sleep expected to cause sudden changes in the cardiovascular system that can manifest as cardiac responses. In this paper, our objective was to investigate how cardiac characteristics change due to arousal. We focused on the QT interval fluctuations in ECG during the occurrence of arousals. We analysed 7373 sleep arousals collected from 50 males that were older than 65 years. We analysed the ECG signal 5 seconds prior to and 10 seconds after each arousal onset (Pre and Post-Onset). Q and T waves were detected for all Pre and Post-Onset windows to estimate their time intervals. To find out whether the QT interval, a marker of ventricular activation, is modulated by arousal onset, we have applied graphical and statistical analysis. Our observations indicate that in 47 out of 50 subjects (94%), the average QT interval of all arousal significantly shortened at arousal onset. We observed similar outcomes for different types of arousals, indicating that the shortening in average QT interval is independent of the type of arousal. We also studied the relative QT interval change during arousal. The distribution of relative QT interval changes demonstrates that around 60% of arousals increase or decrease QT interval by a maximum of 20%. The probability of QT time interval shortening was twice that of QT interval lengthening.

In this study, a four-shank microelectrode array (MEA) was fabricated to monitor cortex (two shorter shanks) and caudate putamen (CPU) (two longer shanks) signals simultaneously. The dopamine (DA) concentration and neural spike firing in the bilateral targets were recorded in the unilateral 6-OHDA PD rats treated by APO. Electroplating platinum black and reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites onto the electrode surface significantly improved their performance with higher sensitivity, selectivity, and linearity and lower impedance. The DA level and neural spike firing rate were regulated to the normal level. On the lesioned side, the mean DA concentration increased, and the firing rate decreased significantly in the cortex and CPU. Synchronous spike oscillation and typical periodic firing appeared on the lesioned side but were significantly reduced after APO treatment. This represents a substantial contribution to PD treatment and effective recovery of movement. The nanotechnology-enhanced MEA biosensing interface provides an elaborate platform for detecting neuron activities and helps to reveal the abnormal signals between neurons.

In addition to attention affecting memory performance, strong evidence suggests that memory, in turn, affects attentional orienting. Here, we ask whether the effects of social processing on memory alter subsequent memory-guided attention orienting and corresponding anticipatory dynamics of 8-12 Hz alpha-band oscillations as measured with EEG. Eighteen young adults searched for targets in scenes that contained either social or nonsocial distracters and their memory precision tested. Subsequently, RT was measured as participants oriented to targets appearing in those scenes at either valid (previously learned) locations or invalid (different) locations. Memory precision was poorer for target locations in social scenes. In addition, distractor type moderated the validity effect during memory-guided attentional orienting, with a larger cost in RT when targets appeared at invalid (different) locations within scenes with social distractors. The poorer memory performance was also marked by reduced anticipatory dynamics of spatially lateralized 8-12 Hz alpha-band oscillations for scenes with social distractors. The functional consequences of a social attention bias therefore extend from memory to memory-guided attention orienting, a bidirectional chain that may further reinforce attentional biases.

Electroencephalogram data were gathered from 15 young adolescents, 16 old adolescents, and 16 young adults during viewing affective pictures. The results indicated that both positive and negative pictures induced greater intra- and interhemispheric long-distance beta coherences than neutral pictures. However, opposite results were observed between young and old adolescents in terms of negative phase differences. Old adolescents exhibited greater beta coherences for positive and negative pictures than both young adolescents and young adults, but there was no difference between the groups for neutral pictures. These observations suggest that long-range beta coherence might reflect the late maturation of affective functional integration in adolescents.

Probing the temporal dynamics of movement inhibition in motor imagery	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motor imagery; Inhibition; Neuroimaging; Preparation; Movement	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; SKILL ACQUISITION; EXECUTION; EEG; NETWORK; BETA; SIMULATION; FMRI; MEG	Beyond the lack of overt movement in motor imagery (MI), MI is thought to be functionally equivalent to motor execution (ME). Two theories appear viable to explain the neural mechanism underlying the inhibition of movement in MI, with one suggesting the inhibition of movement in MI occurs early in the planning process, and the other suggesting it occurs after the planning for movement is compete. Here we sought to generate evidence related to the timing of movement inhibition in MI. Participants performed a motor task via MI and ME that had distinct preparation and performance phases, with brain activity obtained throughout. Analysis of sensor-level data was performed to isolate event related desynchrony (ERD) in the mu and beta frequency bands in both a sensorimotor and left parietal region of interest (ROI). The magnitude of ERD in the sensorimotor ROI was significantly greater in ME than MI during both the preparatory and performance phases. The reduced ERD in the mu and beta frequency bands in the sensorimotor ROI during the preparatory phase for MI, compared to ME, suggests that movement planning is inhibited (or at least reduced) in MI, contributing to the lack of movement. While past work has shown that the networks of functional brain activity underlying MI and ME are heavily overlapping, differences in the temporal dynamics of this activity suggest that MI and ME are not equivalent processes.

Deficits in arithmetic error detection in infants with prenatal alcohol exposure: An ERP study	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG phase synchronization; Prenatal alcohol exposure; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; Error detection; Theta; Infants	SOUTH-AFRICA PREVALENCE; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; CHILDREN; AGE; THETA; ADOLESCENTS; CONSUMPTION; CONTINUUM; ATTENTION	Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral problems, particularly in arithmetic. We report ERP data collected from 32 infants (mean age = 6.8 mo; SD = 0.6; range = 6.1-8.1; 16 typically developing [TD]; 16 prenatally alcohol-exposed) during a task designed to assess error detection. Evidence of error monitoring at this early age suggests that precursors of the onset of executive control can already be detected in infancy. As predicted, the ERPs of the TD infants, time-locked to the presentation of the solution to simple arithmetic equations, showed greater negative activity for the incorrect solution condition at middle-frontal scalp areas. Spectral analysis indicated specificity to the 6-7 Hz frequency range. By contrast, the alcohol-exposed infants did not show the increased middle-frontal negativity seen in the TD group nor the increased power in the 6-7 Hz frequency, suggesting a marked developmental delay in error detection and/or early impairment in information processing of small quantities. Overall, our research demonstrates that (a) the brain network involved in error detection can be identified and highly specified in TD young infants, and (b) this effect is replicable and can be utilized for studying developmental psychopathology at very early ages.

Non-selective inhibition of inappropriate motor-tendencies during response-conflict by a fronto-subthalamic mechanism	ELIFE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BASAL GANGLIA; ACTION SELECTION; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; BLIND SEPARATION; NUCLEUS; CORTEX; SUPPRESSION	To effectively interact with their environment, humans must often select actions from multiple incompatible options. Existing theories propose that during motoric response-conflict, inappropriate motor activity is actively (and perhaps non-selectively) suppressed by an inhibitory fronto-basal ganglia mechanism. We here tested this theory across three experiments. First, using scalp-EEG, we found that both outright action-stopping and response-conflict during action-selection invoke low-frequency activity of a common fronto-central source, whose activity relates to trial-by-trial behavioral indices of inhibition in both tasks. Second, using simultaneous intracranial recordings from the basal ganglia and motor cortex, we found that response-conflict increases the influence of the subthalamic nucleus on M1-representations of incorrect response-tendencies. Finally, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that during the same time period when conflict-related STN-to-M1 communication is increased, cortico-spinal excitability is broadly suppressed. Together, these findings demonstrate that fronto-basal ganglia networks buttress action-selection under response-conflict by rapidly and non-selectively net-inhibiting inappropriate motor tendencies.

Recent work, however, suggests that viewing changing expressions more robustly evokes physiological responses. Here, we examined the sensitivity of steady-state visual evoked potentials and intrinsic oscillatory brain activity to transient emotional changes in facial expressions. Twenty-two participants viewed sequences of grayscale faces periodically turned on and off at a rate of 17.5 Hz, to evoke flicker steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) in visual cortex. Each sequence began with a neutral face (flickering for 2290 msec), immediately followed by a face from the same actor (also flickering for 2290 msec) with one of four expressions (happy, angry, fearful, or another neutral expression), followed by the initially presented neutral face (flickering for 1140 msec). The amplitude of the ssVEP and the power of intrinsic brain oscillations were analyzed, comparing the four expression-change conditions. We found a transient perturbation (reduction) of the ssVEP that was more pronounced after the neutral-to-angry change compared to the other conditions, at right posterior sensors. Induced alpha-band (8-13 Hz) power was reduced compared to baseline after each change. This reduction showed a central-occipital topography and was strongest in the subtlest and rarest neutral-to-neutral condition. Thus, the ssVEP indexed involvement of face-sensitive cortical areas in decoding affective expressions, whereas mid-occipital alpha power reduction reflected condition frequency rather than expression-specific processing, consistent with the role of alpha power changes in selective attention.

Neural oscillations during cognitive processes in an App knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease pathology	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; THETA; FREQUENCY; MEMORY; INFORMATION; DYSFUNCTION; SEIZURES; EEG	Multiple animal models have been created to gain insight into Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Among the most commonly used models are transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) with mutations linked to familial AD, resulting in the formation of amyloid beta plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks observed in AD patients. However, recent evidence suggests that the overexpression of APP by itself can confound some of the reported observations. Therefore, we investigated in the present study the App(NL-G-F)model, an App knock-in (App-KI) mouse model that develops amyloidosis in the absence of APP-overexpression. Our findings at the behavioral, electrophysiological, and histopathological level confirmed an age-dependent increase in A beta 1-42 levels and plaque deposition in these mice in accordance with previous reports. This had apparently no consequences on cognitive performance in a visual discrimination (VD) task, which was largely unaffected in App(NL-G-F) mice at the ages tested. Additionally, we investigated neurophysiological functioning of several brain areas by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis, a measure associated with adequate cognitive functioning, during the VD task (starting at 4.5 months) and the exploration of home environment (at 5 and 8 months of age). While we did not detect age-dependent changes in PAC during home environment exploration for both the wild-type and the App(NL-G-F) mice, we did observe subtle changes in PAC in the wild-type mice that were not present in the App(NL-G-F) mice.

Sensorimotor Cortical Oscillations during Movement Preparation in 16p11.2 Deletion Carriers	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						16p11.2; autism; beta rhythm; magnetoencephalography; manual; speech	FUNCTIONAL LATERALIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG POWER; LANGUAGE; AUTISM; SPECTRUM; DUPLICATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; CHILDREN	Sensorimotor deficits are prevalent in many neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, including one of its common genetic etiologies, a 600 kb reciprocal deletion/duplication at 16p11.2. We have previously shown that copy number variations of 16p11.2 impact regional brain volume, white matter integrity, and early sensory responses in auditory cortex. Here, we test the hypothesis that abnormal cortical neurophysiology is present when genes in the 16p11.2 region are haploinsufficient, and in humans that this in turn may account for behavioral deficits specific to deletion carriers. We examine sensorimotor cortical network activity in males and females with 16p11.2 deletions compared with both typically developing individuals, and those with duplications of 16p11.2, using magnetoencephalographic imaging during preparation of overt speech or hand movements in tasks designed to be easy for all participants. In deletion carriers, modulation of beta oscillations (12-30 Hz) were increased during both movement types over effector-specific regions of motor cortices compared with typically developing individuals or duplication carriers, with no task-related performance differences between cohorts, even when corrected for their own cognitive and sensorimotor deficits. Reduced left hemispheric language specialization was observed in deletion carriers but not in duplication carriers. Neural activity over sensorimotor cortices in deletion carriers was linearly related to clinical measures of speech and motor impairment. These findings link insufficient copy number repeats at 16p11.2 to excessive neural activity (e.g., increased beta oscillations) in motor cortical networks for speech and hand motor control. These results have significant implications for understanding the neural basis of autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders.	[Hinkley, Leighton B.

PMCA and RT-QuIC have different ability to amplify PrPsc from sporadic, variant and genetic forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). PMCA readily amplifies PrPsc from variant CJD (vCJD) tissue while RT-QuIC easily amplifies PrPsc from sporadic CJD (sCJD) patient tissues. In terms of diagnosis, this implies the possibility of distinguishing vCJD from sCJD and explains the wider use of RT-QuIC given the respective frequencies of vCJD and sCJD. The sensitivity values of RT-QuIC for the diagnosis of sCJD are comparable or higher than those of the other tests (EEG, MRI, detection of 14-3-3 or tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid) but with a specificity close to 100%. These new diagnostic methods could also be useful for the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Yet ELS effect is mostly unknown, and no study has followed children to test its impact on the default mode network (DMN) in relation to maternal behavior across childhood. Focusing on brain oscillations, we utilized a unique cohort of war-exposed preadolescent children (11-13 years of age) and their mothers followed from early childhood to examine the effects of ELS combined with observed parenting on DMN connectivity and power in mother and child. METHODS: Participants included 161 mothers and children (children: 39 exposed/36 control subjects; mothers: 44 exposed/42 control subjects) who underwent magnetoencephalography scanning during rest. RESULTS: Stress exposure reduced DMN connectivity in mother and child; however, in mothers, the impaired connectivity occurred in the alpha band, whereas among children it occurred in the theta band, a biomarker of the developing brain. Maternal anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms in early childhood predicted lower maternal DMN connectivity. Among children, the experience of intrusive, anxious, and uncontained parenting across the first decade and greater cortisol production in late childhood predicted reduced DMN connectivity in preadolescence. Impairments to theta DMN connectivity increased in children with posttraumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that ELS disrupts the synchronous coordination of distinct brain areas into coherent functioning of the DMN network, a core network implicated in self-relevant processes. Results suggest that one pathway for the lifelong effects of ELS on psychopathology and physical illness relate to impaired coherence of the DMN and its role in maintaining quiescence, alternating internal and external attention, and supporting the sense of self.

The objective of the present study was to detect and localize interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in patients with insular epilepsy at the source levels using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We investigated whether HFOs can delineate epileptogenic areas. We analysed MEG data with new accumulated source imaging (HFOs, 80-250 Hz ripples during spikes) and conventional dipole modelling (spikes) methods for localizing epileptic foci. We evaluated the relationship of the resection of focal brain regions containing interictal HFOs and the spikes with the postsurgical seizure outcome. Interictal HFOs were localized in the insular epileptogenic zone (EZ) in 18 out of 21 patients undergoing surgical treatment for clinically diagnosed insular epilepsy. While dipole clusters of spikes were involved in the insular EZ in 15 patients. Both the HFOs and the dipole cluster were localized in the insula in 14 patients. The seizure-free percentage was 87% for the resection of brain regions generating HFOs, whereas 80% for the resection of brain regions generating spikes. There was a much higher chance of freedom from seizures with complete resection of the HFO-generating regions than with partial resection or no resection (P = 0.031). No such difference was seen for spike-generating regions. Our results suggest that HFOs from insular epilepsy could be noninvasively detected and quantitatively assessed with MEG technology. MEG HFOs (ripples during spikes) may be valuable for the localization of the epileptogenic zone in insular epilepsy.

It would be of great clinical value to identify objective markers for these diseases based on behavioral or neurological manifestations. Deficient response inhibition has been reported in both SCH and OCD; however, it is unclear if common or distinct neural abnormalities underlie this impairment. Methods: To address this question, we compared Stop signal task performance and associated event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillation (ERO) among 24 SCH patients, 25 OCD patients, and 27 healthy controls (HCs). Results: In successful Stop trials, both SCH and OCD patients showed prolonged Stop signal response time, reduced ERP-P3 component amplitude, and weaker theta-band synchronization compared to HCs, while there were no significant differences between patient groups. In unsuccessful Stop trials, however, SCH patients demonstrated significantly lower P3 amplitudes and weaker theta-band activity than OCD patients. In addition, Stop accuracy rate in SCH patients was negatively correlated with Positive subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that impaired response inhibition in SCH and OCD arises from common underlying neural processing abnormalities. However, the lower P3 amplitude and weaker theta-band activity in SCH patients in unsuccessful Stop trials suggest distinct neural activity patterns related to error processing. These differences in ERPs and ERO may provide clues to unique neurological abnormalities in SCH and provide objective measures for differential diagnosis.

However, its modulatory effects in stroke subjects is still not well understood. In this paper, the offline modulatory effects of HD-tDCS on the ipsilesional primary motor cortex were investigated by performing wrist isometric contraction tasks before and after HD-tDCS in eleven unilateral chronic stroke subjects using a synchronized HD-tDCS and electroencephalogram/electromyography measurement system. This paper is a randomized, single blinded, and sham-controlled crossover study. Each subject randomly received three HD-tDCS (anode, cathode, and sham) with at least one-week washout period. Online feedback-guided medium-level wrist isometric contraction tasks were conducted for the affected upper limbs before stimulation and 10, 30, and 50 min after the end of 10-min 1-mA HD-tDCS. The characteristics of corticomuscular coherence (CMC), cortical oscillation power spectral density, and power spectral entropy were analyzed during tasks and compared across all sessions and stimulation conditions. Anode HD-tDCS induced significant CMC changes in stroke subjects, while cathode and sham stimulation did not induce significant CMC changes. The largest neuromodulation effects were observed at 10 min immediately after anodal HD-tDCS.

Given the flexibility in the design of ECoG grids, which is only increasing, it remains an open question what geometry of the electrodes is optimal for an application. Conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS, coated microelectrodes have an advantage that they can be made very small without losing low impedance. This makes them suitable for evaluating the required granularity of ECoG recording in humans and experimental animals. We used two-dimensional (2D) micro-ECoG grids to record intra-operatively in humans and during acute implantations in mouse with separation distance between neighboring electrodes (i.e., pitch) of 0.4 mm and 0.2/0.25 mm respectively. To assess the spatial properties of the signals, we used the average correlation between electrodes as a function of the pitch. In agreement with prior studies, we find a strong frequency dependence in the spatial scale of correlation. By applying independent component analysis (ICA), we find that the spatial pattern of correlation is largely due to contributions from multiple spatially extended, time-locked sources present at any given time. Our analysis indicates the presence of spatially structured activity down to the sub-millimeter spatial scale in ECoG despite the effects of volume conduction, justifying the use of dense micro-ECoG grids.

No Evidence that Predictions and Attention Modulate the First Feedforward Sweep of Cortical Information Processing	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						prediction; spatial attention; human electrophysiology; first feedforward; sweep	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; C1 MODULATION; STRIATE; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; SIGNAL	Predictive coding models propose that predictions (stimulus likelihood) reduce sensory signals as early as primary visual cortex (V1), and that attention (stimulus relevance) can modulate these effects. Indeed, both prediction and attention have been shown to modulate V1 activity, albeit with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution. This leaves it unclear whether these effects reflect a modulation of the first feedforward sweep of visual information processing and/or later, feedback-related activity. In two experiments, we used electroencephalography and orthogonally manipulated spatial predictions and attention to address this issue. Although clear top-down biases were found, as reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band activity, we found no evidence for top-down effects on the earliest visual cortical processing stage (< 80 ms post-stimulus), as indexed by the amplitude of the C1 event-related potential component and multivariate pattern analyses. These findings indicate that initial visual afferent activity may be impenetrable to top-down influences by spatial prediction and attention.

Neural based assessment of mind wandering during a fatigue-inducing motor task: Is task failure due to fatigue or distraction?	2019 9TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE/EMBS International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAR 20-23, 2019	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMBS		mind wandering; motor fatigue task; spectral power; parietal alpha; frontal midline theta; sustained attention	OSCILLATIONS; THETA; BRAIN; ALPHA	This study developed a method for investigating mind wandering (MW) in a fatigue-inducing motor task. To develop research protocols to assess fatigue in clinical cohorts, it is important that participants perform the task at hand to the best of their ability and with their complete attention. Therefore, it is important to know if the participant fails in the task due to fatigue or lack of sustained attention as a result of MW. Two cohorts of 12 healthy controls and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) subjects performed a hand-grip fatigue-inducing motor task while EMG and EEG were simultaneously recorded. Frontal midline theta (FMT) and parietal alpha power were calculated throughout the task. While no significant differences were obtained in the FMT power for both cohorts, significant differences in parietal alpha power for the healthy subjects across the task shows they may have experienced MW unlike CFS subjects, who had to put in consistent effort to sustain attention during the task, which could imply fewer MW events. Assessing MW using EEG can serve as an objective marker for evaluating performance in a task and, for assessing the impact of fatigue on the ability to sustain attention.

Previous work indicates that interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), traditionally subdivided into ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz), are a promising biomarker of epileptogenicity. We aimed to investigate whether HFOs correlate with the emergence of seizure activity and whether they differ between focal seizures (FSs) with impaired awareness and BTCSs. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 15 FSs and 13 BTCSs from seven patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, each of them with at least one BTCS and at least one FS. Representative intervals of intracranial electroencephalography from the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and remote non-SOZ areas were selected to compare pre-ictal, complex focal, tonic-clonic, and postictal periods. Ripples and fast ripples were visually identified and their density, that is, percentage of time occupied by the respective events, computed. Results Ripple and fast ripple densities increased inside the SOZ after seizure onset (P < 0.01) and in remote areas after progression to BTCSs (P < 0.01). Postictal SOZ ripple density dropped below pre-ictal levels (P < 0.001). Prior to onset of bilateral tonic-clonic movements, ripple density inside the SOZ is higher in BTCSs than in FSs (P < 0.05). Interpretation Ripples and fast ripples correlate with onset and spread of ictal activity. Abundant ripples inside the SOZ may reflect the activation of specific neuronal networks related to imminent spread of seizure activity.

We measure the power of gamma-range steady-state responses (SSRs) as well as intelligence and other aspects of neurocognitive function in 40 healthy males born in 1953. The participants are a part of a Danish birth cohort study and the data therefore include additional information measured earlier in life. Our main power measure is the difference in power between a visual stimulation and a combined audiovisual stimulation. We hypothesize and establish empirically that the power measure is associated with intelligence. In particular, we find a highly significant correlation between the power measure and present intelligence scores. The association is robust to controlling for size-at-birth measures, length of education, speed of processing as well as a range of other potentially confounding factors. Interestingly, we find that intelligence scores measured earlier in life (childhood, youth, late midlife), are also correlated with the present-day power measure, suggesting a deep connection between intelligence and the power measure. Finally, we find that the power measure has a high sensitivity for detection of an intelligence score below the average.

Increased cortical activity observed during observation has therefore been suggested to represent increased learning. Causal relationships have been demonstrated between Ml and motor sequence reproduction and between parietal cortex and bimanual learning. However, similar effects have not been reported for frontal regions despite a number of reports implicating its involvement in encoding of motor sequences. Investigating causal relations between cortical activity and reproduction of motor sequences in parietal, frontal and primary motor regions can disentangle whether specific regions during simple observation can be selectively ascribed to encoding or reproduction or both. We designed a sensorimotor paradigm that included a strong motor sequence component, and tested the impact of individually adjusted transcranial alternating current stimulation (IAF-tACS) to prefrontal, parietal, and primary motor regions on electroencephalographic motor rhythms (alpha and beta bandwidths) during motor sequence observation and the ability to reproduce the observed sequences. Independently of the stimulated region, IAF-tACS led to a reduction in suppression in the lower beta-range relative to sham. Prefrontal IAF-tACS however, led to significant improvement in motor sequence reproduction, pinpointing the crucial role of prefrontal regions in motor sequence reproduction.

Methods: Fifty patients with dementia and 34 healthy individuals watched 3 videos that aimed to elicit various emotional responses. Electroencephalogram and heart rate variability were recorded. Results: Patients with dementia experienced less fun and more fear than controls. The high frequency (HF) from the baseline in response to funny stimulation as well as HF from neutral to fear stimulation in the dementia group increased further than in the control group. The slow wave (SW)-fast wave (FW) ratio from neutral to funny stimulation in the control group increased further than in the dementia group. The SW-FW from neutral to fear stimulation was further decreased in the dementia group than in the control group. Conclusions: Although patients with dementia were more sensitive to implicit affect, they showed more enhanced imbalance between positive and negative affect in explicit affect assessment.

The impact of age and sex on the oscillatory dynamics of visuospatial processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Aging; Sex differences; Attention; Neural oscillations	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; GAMMA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GABA CONCENTRATION; COMBINED FMRI; ATTENTION; BRAIN; EEG; MEG	The ability to dynamically allocate neural resources within the visual space is supported by a number of spectrally-specific oscillatory responses, and such visuospatial processing has been found to decline moderately with age and differ by sex. However, the direct effects of age and sex on these oscillatory dynamics remains poorly understood. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), structural magnetic resonance imaging, and advanced source reconstruction and statistical methods, we investigated the impact of aging and sex on behavioral performance and the underlying neural dynamics during visuospatial processing. In a large sample spanning a broad age range, we find that a number of prototypical attention and perception network components, both spectrally-and spatially-defined, exhibit complex and uniquely informative relationships with age and sex. Specifically, neural responses in the theta range (4-10 Hz) were found to covary with chronological age in prefrontal and motor cortices, signifying a possible relationship between age and cognitive control. Further, we found that beta (18-24 Hz) activity covaried with age across a large swath of the somato-motor strip, supporting previous findings of motor planning and execution deficits with increasing age. Finally, gamma-frequency (48-70 Hz) oscillations were found to exhibit robust covariance with age in superior parietal and temporo-parietal areas, indicating that the mapping of saliency in visual space is modulated by the normal aging process. Interestingly, behavioral performance and some of these oscillatory neural responses also exhibited interactions between age and sex, indicating sex differences in the evolution of the neural coding of visual perception as age increases. In particular, men were found to have stronger correlations between age and neural oscillatory responses during task performance than women in lateral occipital and superior temporal regions in the alpha band and in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the gamma band, while women exhibited more robust covariance between age and neural responses than men in inferior temporal and medial prefrontal cortex in the theta range.

However, no monitoring techniques can accurately predict or detect AAGA. Since the first reflex for a patient during AAGA is to move, a passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the detection of an intention of movement would be conceivable to alert the anesthetist. However, the way in which propofol (i.e., an anesthetic commonly used for the general anesthesia induction) affects motor brain activity within the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has been poorly investigated and is not clearly understood. For this reason, a detailed study of the motor activity behavior with a step-wise increasing dose of propofol is required and would provide a proof of concept for such an innovative BCI. The main goal of this study is to highlight the occurrence of movement attempt patterns, mainly changes in oscillations called event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS), in the EEG signal over the motor cortex, in healthy subjects, without and under propofol sedation, during four different motor tasks. Methods: MOTANA is an interventional, prospective, exploratory, physiological, monocentric, and randomized study conducted in healthy volunteers under light anesthesia, involving EEG measurements before and after target-controlled infusion of propofol at three different effect-site concentrations (0 mu g.ml(-1), 0.5 mu g.ml(-1), and 1.0 mu g.ml(-1)). In this exploratory study, 30 healthy volunteers will perform 50 trials for the four motor tasks (real movement, motor imagery, motor imagery with median nerve stimulation, and median nerve stimulation alone) in a randomized sequence. In each conditions and for each trial, we will observe changes in terms of ERD and ERS according to the three propofol concentrations. Pre- and post-injection comparisons of propofol will be performed by paired series tests. Discussion: MOTANA is an exploratory study aimed at designing an innovative BCI based on EEG-motor brain activity that would detect an attempt to move by a patient under anesthesia. This would be of interest in the prevention of AAGA.

J	Hansson, JHS				Hansson, J. H. Sture			A hypothesis regarding how sleep can calibrate neuronal excitability in the central nervous system and thereby offer stability, sensitivity and the best possible cognitive function	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article						Sleep function; Excitability; Stability; Sensitivity; Central nervous system; Calibration	AXON INITIAL SEGMENT; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; INTRINSIC EXCITABILITY; HOMEOSTATIC PLASTICITY; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; DEPRIVATION; DEPRESSION; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; DROSOPHILA	The function of sleep in mammal and other vertebrates is one of the great mysteries of biology. Many hypotheses have been proposed, but few of these have made even the slightest attempt to explain the essence of sleep - the uncompromising need for reversible unconsciousness. During sleep, epiphenomena - often of a somatic character - occur, but these cannot explain the core function of sleep. One answer could be hidden in the observations made for long periods of time of the function of the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is faced with conflicting requirements on stability and excitability. A high level of excitability is desirable, and is also a prerequisite for sensitivity and quick reaction times; however, it can also lead to instability and the risk of feedback, with life-threatening epileptic seizures. Activity-dependent negative feedback in neuronal excitability improves stability in the short term, but not to the degree that is required. A hypothesis is presented here demonstrating how calibration of individual neurons - an activity which occurs only during sleep - can establish the balanced and highest possible excitability while also preserving stability in the CNS. One example of a possible mechanism is the observation of slow oscillations in EEGs made on birds and mammals during slow wave sleep. Calibration to a genetically determined level of excitability could take place in individual neurons during the slow oscillation. This is only possible offline, which explains the need for sleep. The hypothesis can explain phenomena such as the need for unconsciousness during sleep, with the disconnection of sensory stimuli, slow EEG oscillations, the relationship of sleep and epilepsy, age, the effects of sleep on neuronal firing rate and the effects of sleep deprivation and sleep homeostasis. This is with regard primarily to mammals, including humans, but also all other vertebrates.	[Hansson, J. H.

Nonlinear harmonic generation in the corticothalamic system	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Neural field theory; EEG; Nonlinear waves; Harmonic generation	SPINDLE OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; PARAMETERS; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; WAVES	Neural field theory of the corticothalamic system is applied to quantitatively analyze harmonic generation in normal sleep and wake states. The linear power spectrum is derived analytically via the transfer function and is then convolved with itself and other factors to calculate the nonlinear power spectrum analytically via a recent perturbation expansion. Analysis shows that strong spectral peaks generate a harmonic at twice the original frequency with peak power proportional to the square of that of the original peak. Fits to the data enable absolute normalization to be determined, with the conclusion that the experimentally observed spindle harmonic peak is nonlinear. Using this normalization, the same analysis is applied to the wake state and nonlinear contributions to the alpha and beta peaks are quantified. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results indicate that alpha brainwaves are associated more with peaks in the on-site condition than with peaks in the video condition, whereas beta waves show the opposite pattern. The findings suggest that people respond differently to a real lake and its video simulation. Moreover, the relationships between the brainwave responses of the participants across time and the environmental features shown in the video are identified. The findings show that four categories of landscape features may be associated with significant bursts of beta rhythms: conjunction/turns of paths, ambiguous water features, disadvantageous landscapes, and obtrusive artifacts. Design implications are discussed based on the results.

In this study, we examined how polygenic risk scores (PRS), derived from a recent GWAS of DSM-IV Alcohol Dependence (AD) conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, relate to longitudinal measures of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric EEG connectivity (alpha, theta, and beta frequencies) in adolescent and young adult offspring from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) assessed between ages 12 and 31. Our findings indicate that AD PRS (p-threshold < 0.001) was associated with increased fronto-central, tempo-parietal, centro-parietal, and parietal-occipital interhemispheric theta and alpha connectivity in males only from ages 18-31 (beta coefficients ranged from 0.02-0.06, p-values ranged from 10(-6)-10(-12)), but not in females. Individuals with higher AD PRS also demonstrated more performance deficits on neuropsychological tasks (Tower of London task, visual span test) as well as increased risk for lifetime DSM-5 alcohol and opioid use disorders. We conclude that measures of neural connectivity, together with neurocognitive performance and substance use behavior, can be used to further understanding of how genetic risk variants from large GWAS of AUD may influence brain function. In addition, these data indicate the importance of examining sex and developmental effects, which otherwise may be masked. Understanding of neural mechanisms linking genetic variants emerging from GWAS to risk for AUD throughout development may help to identify specific points when neurocognitive prevention and intervention efforts may be most effective.

J	Li, X; Xue, TT; Zhang, L				Li, Xu; Xue, Tingting; Zhang, Lin			Information retrieval from modified Kuramoto network by resonant synchronization	EPL			English	Article							NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; MODEL; EEG	A collective behavior of resonant synchronization (RS) in an inhomogeneous network is investigated and its function to retrieve information from encoding networks is proposed based on the RS mechanism. We use modified Kuramoto phase oscillators to simulate normal neurons in self-oscillation state, and investigate the collective responses of a fully connected neuronal network to the stimulus signals when the network is in a critical state just below the synchronization threshold. The stimulus driving on one node at resonant frequencies can stimulate the unsynchronized rotators across the network into collective synchronized states locked to similar frequencies, and thus recover the memorized locations through the synchronized patterns related to the predetermined frequency distributions among the oscillators. This model suggests a potential mechanism to explain how brain stores and retrieves information from resonant synchronization patterns emerging from an inhomogeneous critical neuronal network stimulated by the resonant external driving.

High-definition tDCS to the right temporoparietal junction modulates slow-wave resting state power and coherence in healthy adults	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						coherence; electroencephalogram; high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation; resting state; temporoparietal junction	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DELTA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; EEG; NETWORK; COMMUNICATION; CORRELATE	The right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is a multisensory integration hub that is increasingly utilized as a target of stimulation studies exploring its rich functional network roles and potential clinical applications. While transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is frequently employed in such studies, there is still relatively little known regarding its local and network neurophysiological effects, particularly at important nonmotor sites such as the rTPJ. The current study applied either anodal, cathodal, or sham high-definition tDCS to the rTPJ of 53 healthy participants and used offline EEG to assess the impacts of stimulation on resting state (eyes open and eyes closed) band power and coherence. Temporoparietal and central region delta power was increased after anodal stimulation (the latter trend only), whereas cathodal stimulation increased frontal region delta and theta power. Increased coherence between right and left temporoparietal regions was also observed after anodal stimulation. All significant effects occurred in the eyes open condition. These findings are discussed with reference to domain general and mechanistic theories of rTPJ function. Low-frequency oscillatory activity may exert long-range inhibitory network influences that enable switching between and integration of endogenous/exogenous processing streams. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Through the novel use of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and EEG, we provide evidence that both anodal and cathodal stimulation of the right temporoparietal junction selectively modulate slow-wave power and coherence in distributed network regions of known relevance to proposed temporoparietal junction functionality. These results also provide direct evidence of the ability of tDCS to modulate oscillatory activity at a long-range network level, which may have explanatory power in terms of both neurophysiological and behavioral effects.

Recent studies suggest that neurovascular coupling in neonates and preterm born infants is different compared to adults. The hemodynamic response after a stimulus is later and less pronounced and the stimulus might even result in a negative (hypoxic) signal. In addition, studies both in animals and neonates confirm the presence of a short hypoxic period after a stimulus in preterm infants. In clinical practice, different methodologies exist to study neurovascular coupling. The combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (brain hemodynamics) with EEG (brain function) is most commonly used in neonates. Especially near-infrared spectroscopy is of interest, since it is a non-invasive method that can be integrated easily in clinical care and is able to provide results concerning longer periods of time. Therefore, near-infrared spectroscopy can be used to develop a continuous non-invasive measurement system, that could be used to study neonates in different clinical settings, or neonates with different pathologies. The main challenge for the development of a continuous marker for neurovascular coupling is how the coupling between the signals can be described. In practice, a wide range of signal interaction measures exist. Moreover, biomedical signals often operate on different time scales. In a more general setting, other variables also have to be taken into account, such as oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide and blood pressure in order to describe neurovascular coupling in a concise manner. Recently, new mathematical techniques were developed to give an answer to these questions. This review discusses these recent developments.

In this paper, we investigated the effects of a sound quality visual feedback system (SQVFS) in violin learning. In particular, we studied the EEG activity of a group of participants with no previous violin playing experience while they learned to produce a stable sound (regarding pitch, dynamics, and timbre) in order to find motor learning biomarkers in a music task. Eighteen subjects with no prior experience in violin playing were divided into two groups: participants in the first group (experimental group, N = 9) practiced with instructional videos and offline feedback from the SQVFS provided in alternation with their performance, while participants in a second group (control group, N = 9) practiced with the instructional videos only. A third group of violin experts (players with more than 6 years of experience) performed the same task for comparative purposes (N = 7). All participants were asked to perform 20 trials (4 blocks of 5 trials) consisting of a violin bowing exercise while their EEG activity and their produced sound was recorded. Significant sound quality improvements along the session were found in all participants with the exception of participants in the expert group. In addition, participants in the experimental group showed increased interest in the learning process and significant improvement after the second block not present in the control group. A significant correlation between the levels of frontal gamma band power and the sound improvement along the task was found in both the experimental and control group. This result is consistent with the temporal binding model which associates gamma band power with the role of integrating (binding) information processed in distributed cortical areas. Task complexity demands more cognitive resources, more binding and thus, gamma band power enhancement, which may be reduced as the demanded task begins to be automated as it is likely to be the case in both beginners groups.

We used electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to evaluate network structure and network topology dynamics during rest with eyes closed and open, and during auditory oddball task across the lifespan. For this evaluation, we constructed a hyper-frequency network (HFN) based on within-and cross-frequency coupling (WFC and CFC, respectively) at 10 oscillation frequencies ranging between 2 and 20 Hz. We found that WFC increased monotonously across the lifespan, whereas CFC showed a U-shaped relationship. These changes in WFC and CFC strengths coevolve with changes in network structure and network topology dynamics, namely the magnitude of graph-theoretical topology measures increased linearly with age (except for characteristic path length, which is going shorter), while their standard deviation showed an inverse U-shaped relationship with a peak in young adults. Temporal as well as structural or nodal similarity of network topology (with some exceptions) seems to coincide with variability changes, i.e., stronger variability is related to higher similarity between consecutive time windows or nodes. Furthermore, network complexity measures showed different lifespan-related patterns, which depended on the balance of WFC and CFC strengths. Both variability and complexity of HFNs were strongly related to the perceptual speed scores. Finally, investigation of the modular organization of the networks revealed higher number of modules and stronger similarity of community structures across time in young adults as compared with children and older adults. We conclude that network variability and complexity measures reflect temporal and structural topology changes in the functional organization and reorganization of neuronal cell assemblies across the lifespan.

Relationships Between Neuronal Oscillatory Amplitude and Dynamic Functional Connectivity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						amplitude envelopes; coupled neural masses; dynamic functional connectivity; magnetoencephalography; neural mass bifurcation; neuronal oscillations; time-frequency spectrograms	MEG; PHASE; EEG; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONY; NETWORKS; CORTEX; MODEL	Event-related fluctuations of neural oscillatory amplitude are reported widely in the context of cognitive processing and are typically interpreted as a marker of brain "activity". However, the precise nature of these effects remains unclear; in particular, whether such fluctuations reflect local dynamics, integration between regions, or both, is unknown. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we show that movement induced oscillatory modulation is associated with transient connectivity between sensorimotor regions. Further, in resting-state data, we demonstrate a significant association between oscillatory modulation and dynamic connectivity. A confound with such empirical measurements is that increased amplitude necessarily means increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): this means that the question of whether amplitude and connectivity are genuinely coupled, or whether increased connectivity is observed purely due to increased SNR is unanswered. Here, we counter this problem by analogy with computational models which show that, in the presence of global network coupling and local multistability, the link between oscillatory modulation and long-range connectivity is a natural consequence of neural networks. Our results provide evidence for the notion that connectivity is mediated by neural oscillations, and suggest that time-frequency spectrograms are not merely a description of local synchrony but also reflect fluctuations in long-range connectivity.

Here, we investigate differences in slow oscillations (SO; 0.5-1 Hz), sleep spindles (SP), and their coupling across the adult human lifespan and ask whether observed alterations relate to the ability to retain associative memories across sleep. We demonstrate that older adults do not show the finetuned coupling of fast SPs (12.5-16 Hz) to the SO peak present in younger adults but, instead, are characterized most by a slow SP power increase (9-12.5 Hz) at the end of the SO up-state. This slow SP power increase, typical for older adults, coincides with worse memory consolidation in young age already, whereas the tight precision of SO-fast SP coupling promotes memory consolidation across younger and older adults. Crucially, brain integrity in source regions of SO and SP generation, including the medial prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, reinforces this beneficial SO-SP coupling in old age. Our results reveal that cognitive functioning is not only determined by maintaining structural brain integrity across the adult lifespan, but also by the preservation of precisely timed neural interactions during sleep that enable the consolidation of declarative memories.

JA precedes the development of the capacity to attribute mental states to others (i.e., mentalization or theory of mind). The neural mechanisms involved in the development of mentalization are not fully understood. Electroencephalographic recordings were made of children while they watched stimuli on a screen and their interaction with the experimenter was assessed. We tested whether neuronal activity preceding JA correlates with mentalization in typically developing (TD) children and whether this activity is impaired in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) who evidence deficits in JA and mentalization skills. Both groups exhibited JA behavior with comparable frequency. TD children displayed a higher amplitude of negative central (Nc) event-related potential preceding JA behavior (similar to 500 msec after stimuli presentation), than did the ASD group. Previous to JA behavior, TD children demonstrated beta oscillatory activity in the temporoparietal region, while ASD children did not show an increase in beta activity. In both groups, the beta power correlated with mentalization, suggesting that this specific neuronal mechanism is involved in mentalization, which used during social interaction.

The effect of sevoflurane and isoflurane anesthesia on single unit and local field potentials	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Local field potentials; Beta oscillations; Volatile anesthetics; Single-neuron activity	EEG BURST-SUPPRESSION; GLUTAMATE RELEASE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DESFLURANE; PROPOFOL; ACTIVATE; POWER; CONSCIOUSNESS; HALOTHANE; RABBIT	Volatile general anesthetics are used commonly in adults and children, yet their mechanisms of action are complex and the changes in single unit firing and synaptic activity that underlie the broad decreases in neuronal activity induced by these drugs have not been well characterized. Capturing such changes throughout the anesthesia process is important for comparing the effects of different anesthetics and gaining a better understanding of their mechanisms of action and their impact on different brain regions. Using chronically implanted electrodes in the rabbit somatosensory cortex, we compared the effects of two common general anesthetics, isoflurane, and sevoflurane, on cortical neurons. Single unit activity and local field potentials (LFP) were recorded continuously before and during anesthetic delivery at 1 MAC, as well as during recovery. Our findings show that although isoflurane and sevoflurane belong to the same class of volatile general anesthetics, their effects upon cortical single units and LFP were quite different. Overall, the suppression of neuronal firing was greater and more uniform under sevoflurane. Moreover, the changes in LFP frequency bands suggest that effect of anesthesia upon beta oscillations does not necessarily depend on the level of single unit activity, but rather on the changes in GABA/glutamate neurotransmission induced by each drug.

Frontoparietal Networks Mediate the Behavioral Impact of Alpha Inhibition in Visual Cortex	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						alpha oscillations; attention; magnetoencephalography; visual entrainment	SPATIOTEMPORAL OSCILLATORY DYNAMICS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; HZ FLICKER; EEG; ENTRAINMENT; MODULATION; MAINTENANCE; SUPPRESSION; PERFORMANCE	Alpha oscillations are known to play a central role in the functional inhibition of visual cortices, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. One noninvasive method for modulating alpha activity experimentally is through the use of flickering visual stimuli that "entrain" visual cortices. Such alpha entrainment has been found to compromise visual perception and affect widespread cortical regions, but it remains unclear how the interference occurs and whether the widespread activity induced by alpha entrainment reflects a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the entrainment, or alternatively, a propagated interference signal that translates to impaired visual processing. Herein, we attempt to address these questions by integrating alpha entrainment into a modified Posner cueing paradigm, while measuring the underlying dynamics using magnetoencephalography. Our findings indicated that alpha entrainment is negatively related to task performance, such that as neural entrainment increases on the attended side (relative to the unattended side) accuracy decreases. Further, this attentional biasing is found to covary robustly with activity in the frontoparietal attention network. Critically, the observed negative entrainment effect on task accuracy was also fully mediated by activity in frontoparietal regions, signifying a propagation of the interfering alpha entrainment signal from bottom-up sensory to top-down regulatory networks.

One important influence on these mechanisms is the perceptual characteristics of the stimuli. We investigated the impact of perceptual similarity between targets and nontargets (T-N similarity) in a visual search task using EEG. Participants searched for a predefined target letter among five nontargets. The T-N similarity was manipulated with three levels: high, middle, and low. We tested for the influences of T-N similarity on an ERP (e.g., N2pc) and alpha oscillations. We observed a significant N2pc effect across all levels of similarity. The N2pc amplitude was reduced and occurred later for high similarity relative to low and middle similarities. We also showed that the N2pc amplitude was inversely correlated with the RTs across all similarities. Importantly, we found a significant alpha phase adjustment about the same time as the N2pc for high similarity; by contrast, no such effect was observed for middle and low similarities. Finally, we showed a positive correlation between the phase-locking value and the N2pc-the stronger the alpha phase-locking value, the larger the N2pc, when the T-N similarity was high. In conclusion, our results provide novel evidence for multiple competitive mechanisms during visual search.

Spatio-temporal structure of sleep slow oscillations on the electrode manifold and its relation to spindles	SLEEP			English	Article						slow oscillations; local/global sleep; spindles; thalamocortical coupling	MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; HZ OSCILLATION; WAVE SLEEP; PHASE; MECHANISMS; COMMUNICATION; STIMULATION; HIPPOCAMPUS	Electrophysiological sleep rhythms have been shown to impact human waking cognition, but their spatio-temporal dynamics are not understood. We investigated how slow oscillations (SOs; 0.5-4 Hz) are organized during a night of polysomnographically-recorded sleep, focusing on the scalp electrode manifold. We detected troughs of SOs at all electrodes independently and analyzed the concurrent SO troughs found in every other electrode within +/- 400 ms. We used a k-clustering algorithm to categorize the spatial patterns of SO trough co-occurrence into three types (Global, Local or Frontal) depending on their footprint on the electrode manifold during the considered time window. When comparing the clusters across non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages, we found a relatively larger fraction of Local SOs in slow wave sleep (SWS) compared to stage 2, and larger fraction of Global SOs in stage 2 compared to SWS. The probability of SO detection in time between two electrodes showed that SO troughs of all types co-occurred at some nearby electrodes, but only Global troughs had traveling wave profiles, moving anteriorly to posteriorly. Global SOs also had larger amplitudes at frontal electrodes and stronger coupling with fast spindles (12.5-16 Hz). Indeed, SO-spindle complexes were more likely to be detected following a Global SO trough compared to SOs in other clusters. Also, the phase-amplitude modulation of SOs over spindles (modulation vector) was higher for Global SOs across the electrode manifold. Given the recent evidence of a link between thalamocortical coupling and cognition, our findings suggest stronger cognitive relevance of Global SOs as compared to other SO types in sleep memory processing. Statement of Significance Select brain rhythms contribute to the formation of long-term memories during sleep, including slow oscillations (SOs) in cortex, thalamic spindles, and hippocampal ripples. We introduce a novel data-driven approach to uncover the spatiotemporal profiles of events on high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) in humans, and apply it to SOs. We find three distinct types of SOs, based on topography: Global, Local, and Frontal. They differ in amplitude, spatio-temporal profiles and relation to spindles, with only Global SOs showing traveling wave profiles (anteriorly to posteriorly), larger amplitudes at frontal electrodes and stronger spindle coupling. Our findings suggest stronger cognitive relevance of Global SOs as compared to other SO types in sleep memory processing, crucial to enable sleep manipulations aimed at improving memory performance.

However, the number of studies characterizing the abuse potential and psychopharmacological properties of 25B-NBOMe is limited; thus, we examined its rewarding and reinforcing effects using conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration (SA) tests. Pretreatment with SCH23390 (SCH), Haloperidol (HAL), and ketanserin (KS), antagonists of dopamine D1 (DRD1), dopamine D2 (DRD2), and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A receptor) receptors, respectively, was utilized during a CPP test to investigate the involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in 25B-NBOMe-mediated effects. We also examined the effects of 25B-NBOMe on the expression of dopamine-related proteins in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Then, we measured the dopamine level, phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB), deltaFosB (Delta FosB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the NAcc. In addition, we explored the involvement of 5-HT2A receptors in the 25B-NBOMe-induced head twitch response (HTR). We also examined the effects of 25B-NBOMe on brain wave activity using electroencephalography. 25B-NBOMe elicited CPP and SA. SCH and HAL blocked 25B-NBOMe-induced CPP, whereas KS did not. Moreover, 25B-NBOMe altered the DRD1, DRD2, and dopamine transporter expression and increased dopamine levels. It also induced changes in p-CREB, Delta FosB, and BDNF expression. 25B-NBOMe induced HTR and increased 5-HT2A receptor mRNA levels, effects inhibited by KS. Furthermore, 25B-NBOMe altered delta and gamma wave activity, which was normalized by SCH and HAL. These findings show that 25B-NBOMe may induce rewarding and reinforcing effects via a dopaminergic mechanism, suggesting its abuse potential.

Real-time feedback is presented on the computer screen to enhance collaborative participation in the human-computer interaction. Methods: Four stimulus sources flickering at different frequencies were sequentially fixed around the computer monitor to allow for subjects to complete control tasks by gazing at different stimulus sources. The subjects autonomously switched between the idle and working states by controlling the alpha amplitude. A sliding window voting discrimination (SWVD) strategy was incorporated into the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) algorithm for asynchronous classification. Results: Experiments were performed with 18 subjects using both the synchronous and asynchronous paradigms. The average accuracy was 95.42 +/- 3.35% with a data length of 3 s for synchronous operation; in addition, most subjects were able to successfully control a target to move precisely and smoothly with a 1 s sliding window during asynchronous operation. Conclusion: The proposed design scheme is feasible for our online asynchronous BCI system. Significance: By applying the SWVD strategy and optimizing the experimental paradigm, the classical CCA algorithm was successfully applied for continuous control in an asynchronous BCI system. With the developed system, obvious improvements in the information transmission rate (ITR) and sensitivity were achieved, which will be beneficial for the development of practical BCI systems.

This cross-frequency coupling has been linked to working memory and spatial memory consolidation; however, its spatial and temporal dynamics remains unclear. Here, we first investigate the dynamics of theta-gamma interactions using multiple frequency and temporal scales in simultaneous recordings from hippocampal CA3, CA1, subiculum, and parietal cortex in freely moving mice. We found that theta phase dynamically modulates distinct gamma bands during REM sleep. Interestingly, we further show that theta-gamma coupling switches between recorded brain structures during REM sleep and progressively increases over a single REM sleep episode. Finally, we show that optogenetic silencing of septohippocampal GABAergic projections significantly impedes both theta-gamma coupling and theta phase coherence. Collectively, our study shows that phase-space (i.e. cross-frequency coupling) coding of information during REM sleep is orchestrated across time and space consistent with region-specific processing of information during REM sleep including learning and memory. Significance Classical descriptions of sleep-related brain activity using low spatial resolution electroencephalography led to the distinction between non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM (or paradoxical) sleep. Yet, local brain activity during each of these states is characterized by circuit-specific oscillations (slow waves, spindles, and theta). In this study, we show that theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in the hippocampus is dynamically modulated in space and time during single REM sleep episode, distinct from neocortical CFC. These findings extend the multiple criteria used to define REM sleep state in health and disease.

Inhibition is a key component of human executive functions and shares neural substrate with pain processing, which may explain the inhibitory deficits in FM. Here, we investigated the integrity of brain inhibitory mechanisms in these patients. Methods: We recorded the electroencephalographic activity of 27 patients with FMand 27 healthy controls (HCs) (all women) while they performed a reactive motor inhibition task (the stop-signal paradigm). We analyzed task-induced modulations in electrophysiological markers related to inhibition (N2, P3, and midfrontal theta oscillations) and visual attention (posterior alpha oscillations). Results: The FM group performed the task correctly, with no differences relative to HCs at the behavioral level. We did not find any between-group differences in N2 amplitude (F(1,52) = 0.01, p =.93), P3 amplitude (F(1,52) = 3.46; p =.068), or theta power (F(1,52) = 0.05; p =.82). However, modulation of posterior alpha power after presentation of either the go or stop stimuli was lower in patients than in HCs (F(1,52) = 7.98; p =.007). Conclusions: N2, P3, theta power, and behavioral results indicate that the mechanisms of motor inhibition are sufficiently preserved to enable correct performance of the stop-signal task in patients with FM. Nevertheless, the lower modulation of alpha suggests greater difficulty in mobilizing and maintaining visual attentional resources, a result that may explain the cognitive dysfunction observed in FM.

The phase to phase synchronization within and across frequency bands is calculated and a significant difference between the epilepsy and control groups is observed. Compared with the controls, the epilepsy patients exhibit a stronger within-frequency coupling (WFC) within theta and beta bands, and shows a stronger cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in the delta-alpha and theta-alpha band pairs, but a weakened CFC in alpha-beta band pairs. The weakened coupling between alpha and high frequency band reflects a suppression of phase modulation between the brain regions related to epilepsy. Moreover, WFC and CFC are positively correlated, which is higher in the patients relative to controls. We further reconstruct functional brain connectivity and find that both WFC and CFC networks show small-world properties. For the epilepsy, the small-world efficiency is enhanced in the CFC networks in delta-alpha and theta-alpha band pairs, whereas weakened between alpha and beta bands, which suggests a shift away from the optimal operating point in the epileptic brain with a new balance between WFC and CFC. Our results may help us to understand the important role of information communication across different frequency bands and shed new light on the study of pathology of epilepsy.

Similar changes in those with a history of mTBI (i.e. concussion), however, have not been consistently reported. Frontal theta-to-gamma frequency ratio has shown promise in EEG research in predicting performance on working memory tasks. In the present study we explored the sensitivity of the frontal theta-togamma relative power spectral density (PSD) ratio to the history of concussion in 81 youth athletes (18 with a history of concussion, ages 13-18) during the tests of the Nike Sensory Training Station that vary in working memory and processing speed demands and motor output requirements. The results showed that the theta-to-gamma relative PSD ratio was significantly lower in the concussion history group on the tests of target capture, perception span and hand reaction time. A principle component analysis further indicated that this metric reflects an underlying dimension shared by several visuo-motor control tests of the Nike battery. The results suggested persistent deficits in psychomotor ability in the athletes with a history of concussion that may have implications for diagnosis, rehabilitation and athletic training.

PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Neuromarketing; Packaging; Electroencephalogram; Eye-tracking; Attention; Preference	EYE-TRACKING; DESIGN; EEG; COLOR; CHOICE; OSCILLATIONS; ATTRIBUTES; MOVEMENTS; PRODUCTS; CAPTURE	Developments in neuroscience have provided the opportunity to know unconscious consumer reactions and acknowledge direct measures of cognitive constructs like attention. Given the ever-increasing concern over packaging's contribution to creating a positive first impression, the current research seeks to examine consumers' attention and declarative preferences regarding the three main different packaging attributes as isolated variables: images, texts and colours. The experiment exposed participants (N = 40) to 63 stimuli, which were based on modifications of the three main packaging attributes of three products of three different food categories. This study used electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) to measure attention, and a declarative test was employed to examine preference. First, the results presented herein show that the presence of visual elements, either images or texts on packages, increased the participants' level of attention. Second, the results reveal that colour modifications do not have a significant effect on participants' neurophysiological attention levels. Third, the results demonstrated that the neurophysiological effects among the participants do not necessarily coincide with their subjective evaluations of preference. Hence, this study increases awareness of the relevance of combining traditional market research tools that rely on explicit consumer responses with neuroscientific techniques. These findings indicate, first of all, that more research is needed to ascertain the extent to which consumers' neurophysiological outcomes correspond to their declarative preferences and second, that neurophysiological methods should be given more attention in research.

Theta and alpha band oscillations during value-directed strategic processing	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Event-related spectral perturbations; Theta; Alpha; Strategic processing	MEMORY EFFICIENCY; FRONTAL THETA; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; POWER	Strategic processing allows for value-based preferential encoding of information. Event-related spectral perturbations can provide insights into neural processes linked to the different aspects of strategic processing. This study examined theta and alpha band power differences linked to processing of high-versus low-value information. Thirty-three young adults (17 F; mean age: 21.2 +/- 1.5 years) completed a value-directed word list learning task. The task consisted of five word lists that each contained a unique set of high- and low-value words that were visually presented one at a time and EEG corresponding to these words were examined. To encourage strategic processing, participants were informed that after each list they would be asked to recall as many words as possible with their goal being to maximize their score. Overall, participants recalled more high-value words for each of the five lists as compared to low-value words, which supports that participants engaged in strategic processing. Frontal theta band power showed greater positivity during processing of low-compared to high-value words, whereas parietal alpha band power showed greater negativity during processing of high-compared to low-value words. These findings suggest that theta and alpha bands index different aspects of strategic processing, namely inhibition and selective attention, and have future applications for understanding the effects of aging and brain diseases/disorders.

Here, we investigate what happens in the brain after simply listening to auditory beats in order to understand more about the automatic internalization of temporal intervals without tapping. Electroencephalograms were recorded while musicians attended to accelerating, decelerating, or steady click sequences. Evoked responses and induced beta power modulations (13-30 Hz) were examined for one beat following the last physical beat of each sequence (termed the silent beat) and compared to responses obtained during physical beats near the sequence endings. In response to the silent beat, P3a was observed with the largest amplitude occurring after accelerations and the smallest after decelerations. Late beta power modulations were also found after the silent beat, and the magnitude of the beta-power suppressions was significantly correlated with the concurrent P3a amplitudes. In contrast, physical beats elicited P2 responses and early beta suppressions, likely reflecting a combination of stimulus-related processing and temporal prediction. These results suggest that the activities observed after the silent beat were not produced via sustained entrainment after the physical beats, but via automatically-formed expectation for an additional beat. Therefore, beta modulations may be generated endogenously by expectation violation, while P3a amplitudes may relate to strength of expectation, with acceleration endings causing the strongest expectations for sequence continuation.

Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) has been extensively revealed in sustained contractions of various upper- and lower-limb muscles during static and dynamic force outputs. However, it is not well-understood that the CMC modulation mechanisms, i.e., the relation between a cerebral hemisphere and dynamic motor controlling limbs at constant speeds, such as isokinetic movement. In this paper, we explore the CMC between upper arm flexors/extensors movement and motor cortex during isometric exercise and cyclically isokinetic movement. We also provide further insights of frequency-shift and the neural pathway mechanisms in isokinetic movement by evaluating the coherence between motor cortex and agonistic or antagonistic muscles. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between cortical-muscular functional connections in elbow flexion-extension movement with constant speeds. The result shows that gamma-range coherence for isokinetic movement is greatly increased compared with isometric exercise, and significant CMC is observed in the entire flexion-extension stage regardless the nature of muscles contraction, although dominant synchronization of cortical oscillation and muscular activity resonated in sustained contraction stage principally. Besides, the CMC for extensors and flexors are explicitly consistent in contraction stage during cyclically isokinetic elbow movement. It is concluded that cortical-muscular coherence can be dynamically modulated as well as selective by cognitive demands of the body, and the time-varying mechanisms of the synchronous motor oscillation exist in healthy individuals during dynamic movement.

Automated sleep scoring: A review of the latest approaches	SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS			English	Review						Sleep scoring; Automated and semi-automated systems; Artificial intelligence; Shallow learning; Deep learning	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; AMERICAN ACADEMY; POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC RECORDINGS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EEG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; HEALTH; CHANNEL; SYSTEM; RELIABILITY	Clinical sleep scoring involves a tedious visual review of overnight polysomnograms by a human expert, according to official standards. It could appear then a suitable task for modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Indeed, machine learning algorithms have been applied to sleep scoring for many years. As a result, several software products offer nowadays automated or semi-automated scoring services. However, the vast majority of the sleep physicians do not use them. Very recently, thanks to the increased computational power, deep learning has also been employed with promising results. Machine learning algorithms can undoubtedly reach a high accuracy in specific situations, but there are many difficulties in their introduction in the daily routine. In this review, the latest approaches that are applying deep learning for facilitating and accelerating sleep scoring are thoroughly analyzed and compared with the state of the art methods. Then the obstacles in introducing automated sleep scoring in the clinical practice are examined. Deep learning algorithm capabilities of learning from a highly heterogeneous dataset, in terms both of human data and of scorers, are very promising and should be further investigated.

We investigated the effects of presynaptic differences in dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis with the help of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) rs10770141 and the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) rs1611115, rs6271, and rs1611122 polymorphisms. Conscious and subliminal response conflicts were induced with flanker and prime distractors in (n = 207) healthy young participants while neurophysiological data (EEG) was recorded. The results demonstrated that the increased presynaptic catecholamine synthesis associated with the TH rs10770141 TT genotype improves cognitive control in case of consciously perceived (flanker) conflicts, but not in case of subliminally processed (prime) conflicts. Only norepinephrine seemed to also modulate subliminal conflict processing, as evidenced by better performance of the DBH rs1611122 CC genotype in case of high subliminal conflict load. Better performance was linked to larger conflict-induced modulations in post-response alpha band power arising from parietal and inferior frontal regions, which likely helps to suppress the processing of distracting information. In summary, presynaptic catecholamine synthesis benefits consciously perceived conflicts by improving the suppression of distracting information following a conflict. Subliminal conflicts were modulated via the same mechanism, but only by norepinephrine.

Therefore, it might be reasonable to hypothesize correlations and similarities between electrical activities among different parts of the body. Since no works have been found in this direction, the proposed study aimed at overcoming this lack of evidence and seeking analogies between the brain activity and the electrical activity of non-cerebral locations, such as the neck and wrists, to determine if i) cerebral parameters can be estimated from non-cerebral sites, and if ii) non-cerebral sensors can replace cerebral sensors for the evaluation of the users under specific experimental conditions, such as eyes open or closed. In fact, the use of cerebral sensors requires high-qualified personnel, and reliable recording systems, which are still expensive. Therefore, the possibility to use cheaper and easy-to-use equipment to estimate cerebral parameters will allow making some brain-based applications less invasive and expensive, and easier to employ. The results demonstrated the occurrence of significant correlations and analogies between cerebral and non-cerebral electrical activity. Furthermore, the same discrimination and classification accuracy were found in using the cerebral or non-cerebral sites for the user's status assessment.

However, the quality of ECG, corrupted by artifacts, limits the automatic ECG classification. In order to extract good quality ECG, we proposed a new ECG enhancement method based on tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). In the proposed method, the original ECG signal was decomposed into high Q-factor component and low Q-factor component with dual-Q TQWT. According to the morphological of P, QRS, T waves in ECG, low Q-factor component was chosen for the representation of ECG. The proposed method was tested on 52 healthy volunteers and 52 myocardial infarction patients from the openly dataset of PTB diagnostic ECG. A total of 288 features, covering time, frequency, nonlinear, and entropy domains, were extracted from R-R interval and ECG (in a window of 5s) across 12 leads. The features were selected by Relief method, and 22 discriminative features were fed into five different classifiers. The classification accuracy for dual-Q TQWT was 86.3%, which was 4.7% higher than the filtered data based on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The comparison results verified that the proposed dual-Q TQWT method provides good feasibility for ECG de-noising.

Investigating Effect of Sleep and Meditation on HRV and Classification using ANN	2019 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT)	International Conference on Computing Communication and Network Technologies		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)	JUL 06-08, 2019	IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, INDIA		IIT Kanpur	Artificial neural network; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Heart rate variability; Lomb algorithm; Meditation		Driver sleep detection plays an important role to avoid the fatal accidents caused due to the drowsiness of the driver. EEG measurement is effective in the case of sleep detection but it is comparatively difficult to obtain during driving. Different states of subjects give different heart rate variability measures making it possible to distinguish the states of subjects. During meditation state, the heart rate variability (HRV) is increased and higher HRV makes it easy to switch from the rest position to an alert position without dizziness. The proposed algorithm utilizes HRV to distinguish between normal state, sleeping state and meditation state. The mean distance between two R peaks observed in the normal state is 0.66 seconds which increased to 0.87 seconds in meditation state and increased further in sleeping state to 1.2 seconds. Spectral analysis of the HRV showed that power in the low-frequency band(0.04Hz to 0.15Hz) decreased by 34.32% and the power in the high-frequency band (0.15Hz to 0.4Hz) increased by 60.01% in sleep state compared against the normal state. In meditation state, the fluctuation observed in the R to R interval is more, resulting in an overall increase in HRV. The standard deviation of heart rate in meditation state increased to 6.14 from 5.28 obtained in non-meditation state. In this paper, the artificial neural network is used to distinguish between normal, meditation and sleeping state. Time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear features are extracted from the dataset collected from the Physionet website and neural network is trained using these features. 70% of the samples are used for training, 15% for validation and the rest 15% are used for testing the neural network. The overall accuracy of the neural network observed is 85.4%. It classified all the samples of the sleeping state correctly giving 100% accuracy for the class. For normal and meditation class, the observed accuracy is 85.5% and 71.4% respectively.

While the early phase of skill acquisition remains relatively unaffected in older adults, posttraining consolidation appears to be selectively impaired by advancing age. Motor learning is associated with posttraining changes of oscillatory alpha and beta neuronal activities in the motor cortex. However, whether or not these oscillatory dynamics relate to posttraining consolidation and how they relate to the age-specific impairment of motor consolidation in older adults remains elusive. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique capable of modulating such neuronal oscillations. Here, we examined whether tACS targeting M1 immediately following explicit motor sequence training is capable of modulating motor skill consolidation in older adults. In two sets of double-blind, sham-controlled experiments, tACS targeting left M1 was applied at either 10Hz (alpha-tACS) or 20Hz (beta-tACS) immediately after termination of a motor sequence training with the right (dominant) hand. Task performance was retested after an interval of 6 hours to assess consolidation of the training-acquired skill. EEG was recorded over left M1 to be able to detect local after-effects on oscillatory activity induced by tACS. Relative to the sham intervention, consolidation was selectively disrupted by posttraining alpha-tACS of M1, while posttraining beta-tACS of M1 had no effect on delayed retest performance compared to the sham intervention. No significant postinterventional changes of oscillatory activity in M1 were detected following alpha-tACS or beta-tACS. Our findings point to a frequency-specific interaction of tACS with posttraining motor memory processing and may suggest an inhibitory role of immediate posttraining alpha oscillations in M1 with respect to motor consolidation in healthy older adults.

BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Corticospinal excitability; Gain modulation; Oscillatory power; Oscillatory phase; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; PLASTICITY; MODULATION; FREQUENCY; TACS	Background: Intrinsic motor cortex activity modifies corticospinal excitability (CSE) in accordance with both oscillatory power fluctuations and phase-specific modulation along the oscillatory beta cycle, particularly in the 16-17 Hz frequency bin. Objective: To determine the magnitude of CSE and the relevance of stimulation timing for input gain mediated by either oscillatory power or phase. Methods: We applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex of healthy subjects at rest during electroencephalography recordings. The corticospinal gain modulation was indexed by the amplitude variability of the induced motor-evoked potentials recorded from the forearm muscle. Results: Low compared to high beta power led to a robust 40-70% CSE increase over a wide range of power values. By contrast, the phase modulation was critically dependent on the precise timing of the stimuli to the rising phase of the oscillatory beta cycle, but could then achieve CSE increases of 180%. Conclusion: These findings can influence closed-loop, state-dependent stimulation in the context of neurorehabilitation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this clinical study, we recorded electroencephalograms for a large sample of children with learning disabilities (LD) and healthy control children (n=216) during resting states in which the eyes were either open or closed. We calculated the power and lagged phase coherence in six main frequency bands (delta, theta, lower and upper alpha, and lower and upper beta) to re-evaluate the question of whether children with LD show frontal theta power increases and posterior alpha band decreases on the basis of patterns of electroencephalogram oscillation, which could then be considered as evidence for the so-called 'maturational delay hypothesis.' We identified a general (not restricted to frontal electrodes) power increase in the theta band and no accompanying concomitant alpha band decrease at the posterior electrode position. In addition, we observed increased beta band power at frontal electrodes for LD children. With respect to lagged phase coherence, which is a coherence measure not influenced by volume conduction, we identified decreased coherence for children with LD in the upper alpha band during the eyes closed condition. We interpret this LD-specific resting-state activation pattern as indicating a suboptimally functioning neural resting-state network that provides a detrimental 'starting point' for task-specific brain activations.

Methods - Search for relevant references and summary of our own research activity on the topic. Results - Strong interrealtionship exists between epilepsy and plastic brain functions (memory processing and synaptic homeostasis) and the working modes of NREM sleep. In the most frequent childhood and adult epilepsy networks responsible for plastic functions can be derailed to an epileptic level of excitability, and suffer a transitory or permanent epileptic transformation. Exampling on the three big epilepsies: absence epilepsy; medial temporal lobe epilepsy; and childhood idiopathic focal age dependent epilepsy spectrum we demonstrate the most important features of this epileptic transformation. The association of cognitive impairment to certain sleep dependent epilepsies gains explanation by the epilepsy caused interference with slow wave decline (ICFE) and memory consolidation (MILE) during NREM sleep. This paper serves also to introduce the concept of sleep dependent system epilepsies. Conclusions - We provide evidences about shared mechanisms among sleep related epilepsies being the derailment of sleep plastic funcions toward exaggerated excitability determined by the inherent possibilities of the signal transduction properties.

Elevated blood pressure is usually associated with a prefrontal hemodynamic abnormality. However, the detailed process is still unclear. In this study, we designed a startle protocol and tested the response of the cerebral cortex and cardiovascular system in young normotensive subjects with a family history of hypertension (FH+). Additionally, the cold forehead test (CFT) was performed in hypertensive subjects. In total, 40 young normotensive subjects (21 with FH+ and 19 without a family history of hypertension (FH-)) and 49 middle-aged subjects (21 normotensives (NT) and 28 hypertensives (HT)) were recruited. Our results showed that the magnitude of startle-evoked alpha oscillation at the parasympathetic-related prefrontal cortex (FP1 and FP2) in the FH+ group was significantly smaller than in the FH- group. Acute bradycardia (RRI increase) was observed in FH- subjects but disappeared in the FH+ group. The coupling between instant cardiac acute response (increased RRI) and prefrontal arousal (magnitude of evoked oscillation) was significantly weakened in the FH+ group compared with the FH- group. Furthermore, the decrease in HR induced by parasympathetic outflow during CFT was absent in HT subjects. Hence, we concluded that the impairment of parasympathetic outflow derived from the prefrontal lobe occurs in both healthy young offspring of hypertensive and hypertensive patients.

Pain Expressions and Inhibitory Control in Patients With Fibromyalgia: Behavioral and Neural Correlates	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain electrical activity; chronic pain; cognitive dysfunction; emotion; attention; pain; inhibitory control	ATTENTIONAL BIAS; SPANISH VERSION; CATASTROPHIZING SCALE; STROOP INTERFERENCE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EMOTION REGULATION; INFORMATION; THREAT; MEMORY; VALIDATION	Fibromyalgia (FM) is a generalized chronic pain condition associated with a variety of symptoms, including altered cognitive and emotional processing. It has been proposed that FM patients show a preferential allocation of attention to information related to the symptoms of the disease, particularly to pain cues. However, the existing literature does not provide conclusive evidence on the presence of this attentional bias, and its effect on cognitive functions such as inhibitory control. To clarify this issue, we recorded the electroencephalographic activity of 31 women diagnosed with FM and 28 healthy women, while performing an emotional Go/NoGo task with micro-videos of pain, happy, and neutral facial expressions. We analyzed behavioral data, performed EEG time-frequency analyses, and obtained the event-related potentials (ERPs) N2 and P3 components in NoGo trials. A series of self-reports was also administered to evaluate catastrophic thinking and the main symptoms of fibromyalgia. Pain expressions were associated with longer reaction times and more errors, as well as with higher theta and delta power, and P3 amplitude to NoGo stimuli. Thus, behavioral and psychophysiological data suggest that increased attention to pain expressions impairs the performance of an inhibitory task, although this effect was similar in FM patients and healthy controls. N2 amplitude was modulated by type of facial expression (larger to pain faces), but only for the control group. This finding suggests that the presentation of pain faces might represent a smaller conflict for the patients, more used to encounter pain stimuli. No main group effects were found significant for N2 or P3 amplitudes, nor for time-frequency data. Using stimuli with greater ecological validity than in previous studies, we could not confirm a greater effect of attentional bias toward negative stimuli over inhibitory performance in patients with FM. Studying these effects allow us to better understand the mechanisms that maintain pain and develop intervention strategies to modify them.	[Pidal-Miranda, Marina; Gonzalez-Villar, A.

Prospective observational study: Fast ripple localization delineates the epileptogenic zone	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; High frequency oscillations; HFO; FR; Ripple	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY SURGERY; CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; 100-500 HZ; FDG-PET; EEG; OUTCOMES; HIPPOCAMPAL; GENERATION; BRAIN	Objective: To investigate spatial correlation between interictal HFOs and neuroimaging abnormalities, and to determine if complete removal of prospectively identified interictal HFOs correlates with post-surgical seizure-freedom. Methods: Interictal fast ripples (FRs: 250-500 Hz) in 19 consecutive children with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy who underwent extra-operative electrocorticography (ECoG) recording were prospectively analyzed. The interictal FRs were sampled at 2000 Hz and were visually identified during 10 min of slow wave sleep. Interictal FRs, MRI and FDG-PET were delineated on patient-specific reconstructed three-dimensional brain MRI. Results: Interictal FRs were observed in all patients except one. Thirteen out of 18 patients (72%) exhibited FRs beyond the extent of neuroimaging abnormalities. Fifteen of 19 children underwent resective surgery, and survival analysis with log-rank test demonstrated that complete resection of cortical sites showing interictal FRs correlated with longer post-operative seizure-freedom (p < 0.01). Complete resection of seizure onset zones (SOZ) also correlated with longer post-operative seizure-freedom (p = 0.01), yet complete resection of neuroimaging abnormalities did not (p = 0.43). Conclusions: Prospective visual analysis of interictal FRs was feasible, and it seemed to accurately localize epileptogenic zones. Significance: Topological extent of epileptogenic region may exceed what is discernible by multimodal neuroimaging. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Hippocampal theta codes for distances in semantic and temporal spaces	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						hippocampus; episodic memory; theta; recall; cognitive map	GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY FORMATION; FREQUENCY; EEG; REPRESENTATION; NAVIGATION; INCREASES; RHYTHM; CELLS	The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is known to support episodic memory and spatial navigation, raising the possibility that its true function is to form "cognitive maps" of any kind of information. Studies in humans and animals support the idea that the hippocampal theta rhythm (4 to 8 Hz) is key to this mapping function, as it has been repeatedly observed during spatial navigation tasks. If episodic memory and spatial navigation are 2 sides of the same coin, we hypothesized that theta oscillations might reflect relations between explicitly nonspatial items, such as words. We asked 189 neurosurgical patients to perform a verbal free-recall task, of which 96 had indwelling electrodes placed in the MTL. Subjects were instructed to remember short lists of sequentially presented nouns. We found that hippocampal theta power and connectivity during item retrieval coded for semantic distances between words, as measured using word2vec-derived subspaces. Additionally, hippocampal theta indexed temporal distances between words after filtering lists on recall performance, to ensure adequate dynamic range in time. Theta effects were noted only for semantic subspaces of 1 dimension, indicating a substantial compression of the possible semantic feature space. These results lend further support to our growing confidence that the MTL forms cognitive maps of arbitrary representational spaces, helping to reconcile longstanding differences between the spatial and episodic memory literatures.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) density spectral array monitoring in children during sevoflurane anaesthesia: a prospective observational study	ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						anaesthesia; children; density spectral array; sevoflurane	AGE; PROPOFOL; DEPTH	Electroencephalographic density spectral array monitoring has been developed to facilitate the interpretation of unprocessed electroencephalogram signals. The primary aim of this prospective observational study, performed in a tertiary children's hospital, was to identify the clinical applicability and validity of density spectral array monitoring in infants and children during sevoflurane anaesthesia. We included 104 children, aged < 6 years, undergoing elective surgery during sevoflurane anaesthesia. We investigated the correlation between non-steady state end-tidal sevoflurane and the expression of the four electroencephalogram frequency bands , , and , representing density spectral array. Patients were divided into three age groups (< 6 months, 6-12 months, > 12 months). There was a significant correlation between end-tidal sevoflurane and density spectral array in the age groups 6-12 months (p < 0.05) and 1-6 years (p < 0.0001). In infants < 6 months of age, the relative percentages of density spectral array did not correlate with end-tidal sevoflurane. The main finding was that different end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane produce age-dependent changes in the density spectral array power spectrum. In infants younger than 6 months-old, and coherence are absent, whereas and oscillations have already emerged. In cases where anaesthesia was too deep, this presented as burst suppression on the electroencephalogram, disappeared, leaving the electroencephalographic activity in the range. Future research should address this issue, aiming to clarify whether the emergence of oscillations in infants helps to prevent sevoflurane overdosing.	[de Heer, I. J.; Bouman, S. J.

Using a Phenomenological Mathematical Model to Reproduce the Interaction of Endogenous and Exogenous Oscillations under Neurocontrol	SOVREMENNYE TEHNOLOGII V MEDICINE			English	Article						neuronal interface; electroencephalogram; EEG; neurobiocontrol; brain rhythms; mathematical model; thalamocortical system	SIGNALS	The aim of the study was to evaluate the possibility of using a phenomenological mathematical model of the thalamocortical unit cell to describe the frequency-time responses of the real thalamocortical system (namely, various alpha rhythm modulations) and reproduce the signal dynamics in the process of neurobiocontrol. Materials and Methods. The experimental part of this study (the resonant neurobiocontrol with double feedback based on the BioFeedBack2 software-hardware complex) was carried out according to the hybrid protocol: background - before/after: 2-minute record of the baseline vertex EEG (the active electrode - Cz grounding and the reference electrodes held on the earlobes); frequency scan during 210 s: exposure to pulsed infrared radiation with an increasing rate of from 8 to 14 Hz (frequency step - 0.1 Hz, time step 3 s) and a music-like sound signal, the tone and volume of which determined by the peak amplitude in the spectrum of the current EEG in the range of 8-14 Hz. The characteristic feedback time is 10 ms, the frequency accuracy is 0.2-0.4 Hz. Periodic noise pulses, presented with a frequency related to the baseline heart rate, have been added to the sound signal. For the calculations, a previously developed phenomenological model of the thalamocortical unit cell was used. The model incorporates interacting modules simulating the major neuronal modules of the brain, i.e., the thalamus, the cortex and the thalamic reticular nuclei. Results and Discussion. Using the proposed phenomenological mathematical model of the thalamocortical unit cell, we obtained frequency-time responses of the model signal, which reproduces the frequency pattern of the real EEG signal. The model simulates the situation when the baseline alpha rhythm changes in response to an external factor with the known thalamocortical parameters. In the future, this information will improve the current feedback procedures of biocontrol aimed at enhancing the cognitive power of the brain. Appropriate training will allow controlling the alpha rhythm frequency (neurobiolcontrol) in such a way that, by the objective psychophysical criteria, the subjects will have their cognitive activity enhanced, and, by the subjective assessment, their well-being will improve. Conclusion. In this study, a neuro-informational approach to personalized brain rhythm management is demonstrated. It is now possible to reproduce individual features of a complex information processing system using the proposed phenomenological model of the thalamocodical unit cell.	[Nuidel, I.

We recorded scalp EEG and basal ganglia local field potentials in Parkinson's disease patients (11 STN, 7 GPi) ON and OFF dopaminergic medication while they performed a visually-guided force matching task using a pen on a force-sensitive graphics tablet. Force adjustments were accompanied by beta power suppression irrespective of whether the force was increased or reduced. Before the adjustment was completed, beta activity returned. High beta power was specifically associated with slowing of the force adjustment. ON medication, the peak force rate was faster and cortico-basal ganglia beta phase coupling was more readily modulated. In particular, phase decoupling was stronger during faster adjustments. The results suggest that beta power in the basal ganglia does not covary with force per se, but rather with a related factor, the absolute force rate, or a more general concept of movement effort. The results also highlight that beta activity reappears during stabilization of isometric contractions, and that dopamine-related suppression of cortico-basal ganglia beta coupling is linked to faster force adjustments.

However, how to improve the accuracy of these parameters is always a challenging work as PPG is susceptible to be contaminated by noises especially motion artifacts (MAs). This study presents an algorithm called PQR to calculate three indexes (P/QJR) for estimation the signal quality based on noise interferences and rSQl index for comparison of any two signals. P/Q/R indicates the influencing degree of high-frequency noise, baseline wandering and motion artifacts on PPG respectively. And a relative signal quality estimation index rSQI is designed to compare the quality of any two signals. When the value of rSQI is greater than zero, it illustrates that the quality of the former signal is better than the latter, and vice versa. Lower P/Q/R scores could be obtained from the algorithm if PPG is contaminated by strong artifacts or with an irregular signal morphology. The algorithm put a complete successive signal into consideration instead of signal segmentation beat by beat. Experiment results using MIMIC (Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive care) database indicates the availability of PQR algorithm. And the real-time PPG signal quality estimation system could be realized to help estimating heart rate online by applying PQR algorithm to the dataset of IEEE Signal Processing Society. Moreover, the experiments using our lab hardware platform show the corresponding preliminary results of application on the comparison of different signal processing methods. The novel PQR algorithm generates significantly lower rSQI values with the comparison of reference signal when PPG signals are contaminated by strong noise. The chosen threshold could be established once an application has been defined derived from the collected data. The PQR algorithm maybe could help to guide the choice of PPG signal in real-time for the physical information extraction such as heart rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Possible sources of such exposure include overpressure from blast explosions or high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). While current ultrasound clinical protocols do not normally produce long-term neurological deficits, the rapid expansion of potential therapeutic applications and ultrasound pulse-train protocols highlights the importance of establishing a safety envelope beyond which therapeutic ultrasound can cause neurological deficits not detectable by standard histological assessment for thermal and cavitational damage. In this study, we assessed the neuroinflammatory response, behavioral effects, and brain micro-electrocorticographic (mu ECoG) signals in mice following exposure to a train oftranscranial pulses above normal clinical parameters. We found that the HIFU exposure induced a mild regional neuroinflammation not localized to the primary focal site, and impaired locomotor and exploratory behavior for up to 1 month post-exposure. In addition, low frequency (delta) and high frequency (beta, gamma) oscillations recorded by ECoG were altered at acute and chronic time points following HIFU application. ECoG signal changes on the hemisphere ipsilateral to HIFU exposure are of greater magnitude than the contralateral hemisphere, and persist for up to three months. These results are useful for describing the upper limit oftranscranial ultrasound protocols, and the neurological sequelae of injury induced by high-intensity stress waves.

Power spectrum and coherence of electroencephalograms of young people with the use of mnemotechnics	REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						cerebral bioelectric activity; a foreign language; associations; associative thinking	SPATIAL-ORGANIZATION; EEG-ALPHA; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BLOOD-FLOW; BRAIN; DESYNCHRONIZATION; BIOPOTENTIALS; LOCALIZATION; DYNAMICS; THINKING	The increase of external information and the need for processing of large information arrays has been leading to the search for mechanisms of thinking in mental activity, as well as new methods of data protection and reproduction. Power spectrum and coherence of electroencephalograms (EEG) during memorizing of foreign words has been analyzed in many ways: in the usual one with the help of mnemotechnics. The research was conducted during the ovarian phase of the cycle of 11 female students aged 18-20. Registration of EEG activity was carried out according to the international system of H. Jasper,"10-20". The process of recollection of associative information led to the decrease in the power spectrum of the EEG in the alpha range in the frontal and temporal loci of the left hemisphere and the prefrontal sections of both hemispheres, in the beta range it was probable only in T6 zone of beta(2) range, in the delta range it was in the prefrontal, posterior lower-frontal and posttemporal loci of both hemispheres, in the central, parietal and occipital regions of the left hemisphere, as well as in the anteriofrontal zone of the right hemisphere, in the theta-range - in the prefrontal and posterior lower-frontal regions of both hemispheres and in the posttemporal and occipital loci of the left hemisphere. Synchronization in the delta range is the reflection of the processes of figural information processing and manipulation. With the increase of attention concentration, the synchronization was observed in the theta range in the anteriofrontal and F4-P4 zones. Interhemispheric functional and symmetrical bonds in the alpha and beta ranges indicate the involvement of the corpus callosum in the process of memorizing foreign words, which facilitates their faster, more correct and easier reproduction, especially with the use of associative images. The decrease of power spectrum in the delta and theta ranges showed that less effort was required to reproduce associative information than to mention unsupported images of foreign words. The effective use of the association method is realized by reduction of the power spectrum of the waves in the alpha range in the frontal and temporal loci of the left hemisphere and the prefrontal sections of both hemispheres, which indicates the activation of mental activity in these zones in the processes of maintaining and reproducing associative information.

Integrating electric field modeling and neuroimaging to explain inter-individual variability of tACS effects	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; SIGNAL SPACE SEPARATION; ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; EXCITABILITY; CURRENTS; CORTEX; ALPHA; EEG; POPULATIONS	Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) of the brain can have variable effects, plausibly driven by individual differences in neuroanatomy and resulting differences of the electric fields inside the brain. Here, we integrated individual simulations of electric fields during tES with source localization to predict variability of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) aftereffects on alpha-oscillations. In two experiments, participants received 20-min of either alpha-tACS (1 mA) or sham stimulation. Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was recorded for 10-min before and after stimulation. tACS caused a larger power increase in the alpha-band compared to sham. The variability of this effect was significantly predicted by measures derived from individual electric field modeling. Our results directly link electric field variability to variability of tACS outcomes, underline the importance of individualizing stimulation protocols, and provide a novel approach to analyze tACS effects in terms of dose-response relationships.

As the gamma oscillations of qEEG rhythms are related to depression, and particularly to treatment resistance, they may also be related to suicidality. Aim: The present study aimed to identify the neural correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in depression using qEEG, based on the hypothesis that gamma rhythm in patients with depression would be higher in patients with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Method: qEEG were recorded in 533 participants (276 female). Groups were divided into the following: Nonsuicidal (n = 218), Suicide Ideation (n = 211), Suicide Attempt (n = 74), and control (n = 30). Results: High-gamma power at the F4, Fz, C4, Cz, O2, F8, T5 and T6 regions was significantly higher in the Suicide Ideation than the other groups. Conclusion: If confirmed by further studies, high-gamma rhythm has the potential to be used as a biomarker for screening suicidality.

Considering overarching neural principles, this lack of stability relates to increased levels of neural noise. However, no study has directly examined neural noise in ADHD. Likewise, it is unknown whether the modulation of neural noise reflects a mechanistic link as to why methylphenidate (MPH) is effective in treating impulsivity in ADHD. METHODS: We compared neural noise between 29 juvenile patients with ADHD and 32 healthy control subjects and examined the effects of MPH. We examined 1/f neural noise of electroencephalogram data collected while participants performed a response inhibition (Go/NoGo) task. RESULTS: Specific during NoGo trials, children with ADHD showed more neural noise than healthy control subjects. This was especially the case with regard to the theta frequency band, which is very closely related to cognitive control. MPH treatment reduced neural noise in ADHD to the level of healthy control subjects. Correlational analyses showed a direct relationship between decreases in neural noise and increases in behavioral performance. Mechanistically, this can be explained by the MPH-induced increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission that enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in neural networks and thus reduces neural noise. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate increased (pink) neural noise in patients with ADHD and its reduction through MPH treatment. The study reveals an important mechanistic link as to why MPH is effective in treating impulsivity in ADHD.

We introduce a visual sustained attention continuous performance task with three levels of task difficulty. Pairwise discrimination of these task difficulties from electroencephalographic features was performed using a leave-one-subject-out cross validation approach. Features were selected using the orthogonal forward regression supervised feature selection method. Cognitive load was best predicted using a combination of prefrontal theta power, broad spatial range gamma power, fronto-central beta power, and fronto-central alpha power. Generalization performance estimates for pairwise classification of task difficulty using these features reached 75% for 5s epochs, and 85% for 30s epochs.

Unsupervised machine-learning classification of electrophysiologically active electrodes during human cognitive task performance	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CHANNEL SELECTION; MEMORY FORMATION; MOTOR-IMAGERY; BRAIN; RECORDINGS; POTENTIALS; STIMULI	Identification of active electrodes that record task-relevant neurophysiological activity is needed for clinical and industrial applications as well as for investigating brain functions. We developed an unsupervised, fully automated approach to classify active electrodes showing event-related intracranial EEG (iEEG) responses from 115 patients performing a free recall verbal memory task. Our approach employed new interpretable metrics that quantify spectral characteristics of the normalized iEEG signal based on power-in-band and synchrony measures. Unsupervised clustering of the metrics identified distinct sets of active electrodes across different subjects. In the total population of 11,869 electrodes, our method achieved 97% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity with the most efficient metric. We validated our results with anatomical localization revealing significantly greater distribution of active electrodes in brain regions that support verbal memory processing. We propose our machine-learning framework for objective and efficient classification and interpretation of electrophysiological signals of brain activities supporting memory and cognition.

J	Wilson, HR				Wilson, Hugh R.			Hyperchaos in Wilson-Cowan oscillator circuits	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						hyperchaos; neural chaos; neural simulation; Wilson-Cowan	DYNAMICS; DIMENSION; EEG	The Wilson-Cowan equations were originally shown to produce limit cycle oscillations for a range of parameters. Others subsequently showed that two coupled Wilson-Cowan oscillators could produce chaos, especially if the oscillator coupling was from inhibitory interneurons of one oscillator to excitatory neurons of the other. Here this is extended to show that chains, grids, and sparse networks of Wilson-Cowan oscillators generate hyperchaos with linearly increasing complexity as the number of oscillators increases. As there is now evidence that humans can voluntarily generate hyperchaotic visuomotor sequences, these results are particularly relevant to the unpredictability of a range of human behaviors. These also include incipient senescence in aging, effects of concussive brain injuries, autism, and perhaps also intelligence and creativity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This paper represents an exploration of hyperchaos in coupled Wilson-Cowan equations. Results show that hyperchaos (number of positive Lyapunov exponents) grows linearly with the number of oscillators in the array and leads to high levels of unpredictability in the neural response.

Hence, most recording systems include high-pass filters that solve saturation issues but come hand in hand with loss of physiological and pathological information. In this work, we use flexible epicortical and intracortical arrays of graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFETs) to map cortical spreading depression in rats and demonstrate that gSGFETs are able to record, with high fidelity, infraslow signals together with signals in the typical local field potential bandwidth. The wide recording bandwidth results from the direct field-effect coupling of the active transistor, in contrast to standard passive electrodes, as well as from the electrochemical inertness of graphene. Taking advantage of such functionality, we envision broad applications of gSGFET technology for monitoring infraslow brain activity both in research and in the clinic.

However, the potential interactive effects on physical fitness have not been investigated. Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether ADFH individuals with the ApoE-4 genotype show deviant brain event-related neural oscillatory performance and cognitively-related molecular indices. A secondary purpose was to examine the interactive effects on physical fitness. Methods: Blood samples were provided from 110 individuals with ADFH to assess molecular biomarkers and the ApoE genotype for the purpose of dividing them into an ApoE-4 group (n = 16) and a non-ApoE-4 group (n = 16) in order for them to complete a visuospatial working memory task while simultaneously recording electroencephalographic signals. They also performed a senior functional physical fitness (SFPF) test. Results: While performing the cognitive task, the ApoE-4 relative to non-ApoE-4 group showed worse accuracy rates (ARs) and brain neural oscillatory performance. There were no significant between-group differences with regard to any molecular biomarkers (e.g., IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, BDNF, A beta 1-40, A beta 1-42). VO2max was significantly correlated with the neuropsychological performance (i.e., ARs and RTs) in the 2-item and 4-item conditions in the ApoE-4 group and across the two groups. However, the electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations during visuospatial working memory processing in the two conditions were not correlated with any SFPF scores or cardiorespiratory tests in the two groups. Conclusions: ADFH individuals with the ApoE-4 genotype only showed deviant neuropsychological (e.g., ARs) and neural oscillatory performance when performing the cognitive task with a higher visuospatial working memory load. Cardiorespiratory fitness potentially played an important role in neuropsychological impairment in this group.

Dynamic regulation of interregional cortical communication by slow brain oscillations during working memory	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CONTROL NETWORK; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; REGIONS	Transiently storing information and mentally manipulating it is known as working memory. These operations are implemented by a distributed, fronto-parietal cognitive control network in the brain. The neural mechanisms controlling interactions within this network are yet to be determined. Here, we show that during a working memory task the brain uses an oscillatory mechanism for regulating access to prefrontal cognitive resources, dynamically controlling interactions between prefrontal cortex and remote neocortical areas. Combining EEG with non-invasive brain stimulation we show that fast rhythmical brain activity at posterior sites are nested into prefrontal slow brain waves. Depending on cognitive demand this high frequency activity is nested into different phases of the slow wave enabling dynamic coupling or de-coupling of the fronto-parietal control network adjusted to cognitive effort. This mechanism constitutes a basic principle of coordinating higher cognitive functions in the human brain.	[Berger, B.; Minarik, T.; Biel, A.

Beta power encodes contextual estimates of temporal event probability in the human brain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ORIENTING ATTENTION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; PARIETAL CORTEX; ELAPSED TIME; SHORT-TERM; EEG; EXPECTATION; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; REPRESENTATION	To prepare for an impending event of unknown temporal distribution, humans internally increase the perceived probability of event onset as time elapses. This effect is termed the hazard rate of events. We tested how the neural encoding of hazard rate changes by providing human participants with prior information on temporal event probability. We recorded behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data while participants listened to continuously repeating five-tone sequences, composed of four standard tones followed by a nontarget deviant tone, delivered at slow (1.6 Hz) or fast (4 Hz) rates. The task was to detect a rare target tone, which equiprobably appeared at either position two, three or four of the repeating sequence. In this design, potential target position acts as a proxy for elapsed time. For participants uninformed about the target's distribution, elapsed time to uncertain target onset increased response speed, displaying a significant hazard rate effect at both slow and fast stimulus rates. However, only in fast sequences did prior information about the target's temporal distribution interact with elapsed time, suppressing the hazard rate. Importantly, in the fast, uninformed condition pre-stimulus power synchronization in the beta band (Beta 1, 15-19 Hz) predicted the hazard rate of response times. Prior information suppressed pre-stimulus power synchronization in the same band, while still significantly predicting response times. We conclude that Beta 1 power does not simply encode the hazard rate, but-more generally-internal estimates of temporal event probability based upon contextual information.

We asked whether they do so when faced with full-body social interactions, whether emerging representations go beyond basic sensorimotor mirroring, and whether they depend on processing goals and inclinations. In an EEG/ERP study, we presented line-drawn, dyadic interactions with and without affectionate touch. In an explicit and an implicit task, participants categorized images into touch versus no-touch and same versus opposite sex interactions, respectively. Modulations of central Rolandic rhythms implied that affectionate touch displays engaged sensorimotor mechanisms. Additionally, the late positive potential (LPP) being larger for images with as compared to without touch pointed to an involvement of higher order socio-affective mechanisms. Task and sex modulated touch perception. Sensorimotor responding, indexed by Rolandic rhythms, was fairly independent of the task but appeared less effortful in women than in men. Touch induced socio-affective responding, indexed by the LPP, declined from explicit to implicit processing in women and disappeared in men. In sum, this study provides first evidence that vicarious touch from full-body social interactions entails shared sensorimotor as well as socio-affective experiences. Yet, mental representations of touch at a socio-affective level are more likely when touch is goal relevant and observers are female. Together, these results outline the conditions under which touch in visual media may be usefully employed to socially engage observers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Panthi, S; Leitch, B				Panthi, Sandesh; Leitch, Beulah			The impact of silencing feed-forward parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in the cortico-thalamocortical network on seizure generation and behaviour	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Feedforward inhibition; Cortico-thalamocortical; Somatosensory cortex; Parvalbumin; GABAergic interneurons; DREADDs; Absence seizures; Motor dysfunction	MOUSE MODEL; POSITIVE INTERNEURONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; AMPA RECEPTORS; REMOTE-CONTROL; NEURONS; ACTIVATION; STARGAZER; THALAMUS	Feed-forward inhibition (FFI) is an essential mechanism within the brain, to regulate neuronal firing and prevent runaway excitation. In the cortico-thalamocortical (CTC) network, fast spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons regulate the firing of pyramidal cells in the cortex and relay neurons in the thalamus. PV+ interneuron dysfunction has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Previously, we demonstrated that loss of excitatory AMPA-receptors, specifically at synapses on PV+ interneurons in CTC feedforward microcircuits, occurs in the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy. These mice present with absence seizures characterized by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalogram (EEG) and concomitant behavioural arrest, similar to childhood absence epilepsy. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of loss of FFI within the CTC on absence seizure generation and behaviour using new Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) technology. We crossed PV-Cre mice with Cre-dependent hM4Di DREADD strains of mice, which allowed Cre-recombinase-mediated restricted expression of inhibitory G(i)-DREADDs in PV+ interneurons. We then tested the impact of global and focal (within the CTC network) silencing of PV+ interneurons. CNO mediated silencing of all PV+ interneurons by intraperitoneal injection caused the impairment of motor control, decreased locomotion and increased anxiety in a dose-dependent manner. Such silencing generated pathological oscillations similar to absence-like seizures. Focal silencing of PV+ interneurons within cortical or thalamic feedforward microcircuits, induced SWD-like oscillations and associated behavioural arrest. Epileptiform activity on EEG appeared significantly sooner after focal injection compared to peripheral injection of CNO. However, the mean duration of each oscillatory burst and spike frequency was similar, irrespective of mode of CNO delivery. No significant changes were observed in vehicle-treated or non-DREADD wild-type control animals. These data suggest that dysfunctional feed-forward inhibition in CTC microcircuits may be an important target for future therapy strategies for some patients with absence seizures. Additionally, silencing of PV+ interneurons in other brain regions may contribute to anxiety related neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Phase response theory explains cluster formation in sparsely but strongly connected inhibitory neural networks and effects of jitter due to sparse connectivity	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						clusters; phase resetting; synchrony	NEURONAL NETWORKS; RESETTING CURVES; FIRING PATTERNS; SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; MODEL; INTERNEURONS; PROPOFOL	We show how to predict whether a neural network will exhibit global synchrony (a one-cluster state) or a two-cluster state based on the assumption of pulsatile coupling and critically dependent upon the phase response curve (PRC) generated by the appropriate perturbation from a partner cluster. Our results hold for a monotonically increasing (meaning longer delays as the phase increases) PRC, which likely characterizes inhibitory fast-spiking basket and cortical low-threshold-spiking interneurons in response to strong inhibition. Conduction delays stabilize synchrony for this PRC shape, whereas they destroy two-cluster states, the former by avoiding a destabilizing discontinuity and the latter by approaching it. With conduction delays, stronger coupling strength can promote a one-cluster state, so the weak coupling limit is not applicable here. We show how jitter can destabilize global synchrony but not a two-cluster state. Local stability of global synchrony in an all-to-all network does not guarantee that global synchrony can be observed in an appropriately scaled sparsely connected network; the basin of attraction can be inferred from the PRC and must be sufficiently large. Two-cluster synchrony is not obviously different from one-cluster synchrony in the presence of noise and may be the actual substrate for oscillations observed in the local field potential (LFP) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) in situations where global synchrony is not possible. Transitions between cluster states may change the frequency of the rhythms observed in the LFP or EEG. Transitions between cluster states within an inhibitory sub-network may allow more effective recruitment of pyramidal neurons into the network rhythm. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that jitter induced by sparse connectivity can destabilize global synchrony but not a two-cluster state with two smaller clusters firing alternately. On the other hand, conduction delays stabilize synchrony and destroy two-cluster states. These results hold if each cluster exhibits a phase response curve similar to one that characterizes fast-spiking basket and cortical low-threshold-spiking cells for strong inhibition. Either a two-cluster or a one-cluster state might provide the oscillatory substrate for neural computations.

Little is known, however, about the age-related changes in amplitude, density (spindles/minute) and frequency (waves/second) of canine spindles. We investigated a large sample (N = 155) of intact and neutered pet dogs of both sexes, varying in breed and age, searching for spindles in segments of non-REM sleep. We recorded EEG from both a frontal midline electrode (Fz) and a central midline electrode (Cz) in 55.5% of the dogs, in the remaining animals only the Fz electrode was active (bipolar derivation). A similar topography was observed for fast (>= 13 Hz) spindle occurrence as in humans (fast spindle number, density on Cz > Fz). For fast spindles, density was higher in females, and increased with age. These effects were more pronounced among intact animals and on Fz. Slow spindle density declined and fast spindle frequency increased with age on Cz, while on Fz age-related amplitude decline was observed. The frequency of fast spindles on Fz and slow spindles on Cz was linked to both sex and neutering, suggesting modulation by sexual hormones. Intact females displayed higher frequencies than males and neutered females. Our findings support the argument that sigma bursts in the canine non-REM sleep are analogous to human sleep spindles, and suggest that slow and fast spindles display different trajectories related to age, of which an increase in frontal fast spindles is unique to dogs.

Objective The present studies examine the effects of NYX-2925 on NMDAR-dependent auditory LTP (aLTP) in vivo. Methods NMDAR-dependent aLTP and NMDAR-dependent auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) was measured, as well as changes in resting-state qEEG power. Results NYX-2925 (1, 10 mg/kg PO) increased aLTP 1 h after auditory tetanus measured by the post-minus pre-tetanus difference waveform 140-180 ms post tone onset. NYX-2925 (0.1, 1 mg/kg PO) facilitated MMN measured by the difference waveform (i.e., deviant minus standard tones). NYX-2925 (0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg PO) also enhanced resting-state alpha qEEG power. Conversely, the NMDAR glutamate site antagonist CPP (10 mg/kg IP) reduces alpha power and MMN and produces an opposite effect as NYX-2925 on aLTP. Conclusions Together, these data suggest that the activation of the NMDAR by NYX-2925 enhances synaptic plasticity in vivo, which may both reduce symptoms of neurological disorders and serve as a biomarker for drug effects. This is the first demonstration of a long-lasting (1-h post-tetanus) effect of NMDAR modulation on synaptic plasticity processes in vivo using a noninvasive technique in freely behaving animals.

The utility of an automated and ambulatory device for detecting and differentiating epileptic and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						epilepsy; psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; automation; ambulatory; accelerometry		ObjectiveAccurate differentiation between epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) can be challenging based on history alone. Inpatient video EEG monitoring (VEM) is often needed for a definitive diagnosis. However, VEM is highly resource intensive, is of limited availability, and cannot be undertaken over long periods. Previous research has shown that time-frequency analysis of accelerometer data could be utilized to differentiate between ES and PNES. Using a seizure detection and classification algorithm, we sought to examine the diagnostic utility of an automated analysis with an ambulatory accelerometer. MethodsA wrist-worn device was used to collect accelerometer data from patients during VEM admission, for diagnostic evaluation of convulsive seizures. An automated process, that involved the use of K-means clustering and support vector machines, was used to detect and classify each seizure as ES or PNES. The results were compared with VEM diagnoses determined by epileptologists blinded to the accelerometer data. ResultsTwenty-four convulsive seizures, consisting of at least 20 seconds of sustained continuous activity, recorded from 11 patients during inpatient VEM (13 PNES from five patients and 11 ES from six patients) were included for analysis. The automated system detected all convulsive seizures (ES, PNES) from >661 hours of recording with 67 false alarms (2.4 per 24 hours). The sensitivity and specificity for classifying ES from PNES were 72.7% and 100%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for classifying PNES were 81.3% and 100%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the classification results obtained from the automation process and the VEM diagnoses. SignificanceThis automated system can potentially provide a wearable out-of-hospital seizure diagnostic monitoring system.

Additionally, evidence for long-range coupling of neuronal oscillations between visual cortices and regions engaged in the anticipation of upcoming stimuli has been more recently provided. Nevertheless, on the one hand the relation between long-range functional coupling and anatomical connections is still to be assessed, and, on the other hand, the specific role of the alpha and beta frequency bands in the different processes underlying visuo-spatial attention still needs further clarification. We address these questions using measures of linear (frequency-specific) and nonlinear (cross-frequency) phase-synchronization in a cohort of 28 healthy subjects using magnetoencephalography. We show that alpha band phase-synchronization is modulated by the orienting of attention according to a parieto-occipital top-down mechanism reflecting behavior, and its hemispheric asymmetry is predicted by volume's asymmetry of specific tracts of the Superior-Longitudinal-Fasciculus. We also show that a network comprising parietal regions and the right putative Frontal-Eye-Field, but not the left, is recruited in the deployment of spatial attention through an alpha-beta cross-frequency coupling. Overall, we demonstrate that the visuospatial attention network features subsystems indexed by characteristic spectral fingerprints, playing different functional roles in the anticipation of upcoming stimuli and with diverse relation to fiber tracts.

Alpha Frequency Entrainment Reduces the Effect of Visual Distractors	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SPATIOTEMPORAL OSCILLATORY DYNAMICS; GAMMA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EEG; MEG; MODULATION; MAINTENANCE	Numerous studies have linked alpha frequency (similar to 10 Hz) visual entrainment to the inhibition of incoming visual information. However, although these studies have provided key evidence for the intrinsic sensitivity of the human brain to incoming alpha frequency signals, they have only examined the negative impact of alpha entrainment on target stimuli. Thus, it remains uncertain whether the perception of distracting or nonimperative stimuli can also be affected by alpha frequency entrainment. In the current study, we address this question using an adapted version of the arrow-based Erikson "flanker" paradigm that incorporates stimuli flickering at two distinct frequencies: 10 Hz (alpha) and 30 Hz. By presenting flickering stimuli in the portions of the visual field where the flanking arrows would soon appear, we aimed to determine whether the frequency of visual entrainment (i.e., 10 Hz vs. 30 Hz) significantly interacted with the congruency of the flanking arrows (representing selective attention processing) using behavioral task performance and neural oscillations as the outcome metrics. Twenty-three healthy adult participants underwent magnetoencephalography during performance of the task. Our results indicated a reduced congruency effect (i.e., a smaller difference between congruent and incongruent trials) in the alpha flicker condition, as compared with the 30-Hz flicker condition, which suggests a robust relationship between alpha entrainment and the active inhibition of distractor stimuli appearing in that portion of the visual field. Supporting this, alpha frequency (but not 30 Hz) entrainment responses in the primary visual cortex also covaried significantly with the behavioral congruency effect.

To achieve seizure freedom without side effects, accurate localization of the epileptogenic tissue is crucial before its resection. We investigate an automated, fast, objective mapping process that uses only interictal data. Methods: We propose a novel approach based on multiple iEEG features, which are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) model for classification of iEEG electrodes as normal or pathologic using 30 min of inter-ictal recording. Results: The tissue under the iEEG electrodes, classified as epileptogenic, was removed in 17/18 excellent outcome patients and was not entirely resected in 8/10 poor outcome patients. The overall best result was achieved in a subset of 9 excellent outcome patients with the area under the receiver operating curve = 0.95. Conclusion: SVM models combining multiple iEEG features show better performance than algorithms using a single iEEG marker. Multiple iEEG and connectivity features in presurgical evaluation could improve epileptogenic tissue localization, which may improve surgical outcome and minimize risk of side effects. Significance: In this study, promising results were achieved in localization of epileptogenic regions by SVM models that combine multiple features from 30 min of inter-ictal iEEG recordings.

Male Wistar rats with FS separated into water (W, 1 mL), palm oil (PO, 300mg/kg, total volume 1 mL), or KO (300mg/kg, total volume 1 mL) groups. All drugs were administered chronically via the intragastric route. Electrical activity was recorded by intracranial EEG simultaneously with convulsive behavior. All animals' brains were processed by immunofluorescence against GFAP, NeuN, and connexins (Cx); cellular quantification was performed in hippocampus and pyramidal or granular layer thickness was evaluated with cresyl violet (CV) staining. The results showed a significant delay in convulsive behavior and a slight increased survival time after PTZ administration in the group treated with KO compared with PO and W groups. The epileptiform activity showed high amplitude and frequency, with no significant differences between groups, nor were there differences in the number and duration of discharge trains. KO and PO increased the number of astrocytes and the number of neurons compared with the W group. KO and PO decreased the expression of Cx36 without affecting Cx43 expression or the thickness of layers. Based on these data, we consider it important to perform more experiments to determine the anticonvulsant role of KO, taking into account the partial effect found in this study. KO could be used as a coadjuvant of traditional anticonvulsive treatments. Practical ApplicationIn this study was evaluated the anticonvulsive effect of a chronic krill oil (KO) supplement in animals with seizures. Results showed that KO had partial anticonvulsive effects measured by EEG activity and convulsive behavior analysis. These data justify further research that looks at KO supplementation as a prospective coadjuvant of pharmacologic management of seizure disorder.

Mapping the cerebral cortex can be performed either extraoperatively or intraoperatively. When considering the optimal venue for a particular patient, a number of important considerations need to be considered including: the intended goals for the mapping, patient factors, anesthetic effects, stimulation parameters, cortical functions of interest, as well as the mapping modalities being considered. In this chapter, we will cover electrocorticography, cortical somatosensory evoked potentials, and the various neurophysiologic techniques used to map sensorimotor and cognitive functions, including language. One of the main uses of electrocorticography in epilepsy surgery is to map the cortical regions associated with epileptiform activity. This information is used to plan resection boundaries. Electrocorticography can also be used to monitor for afterdischarges (ADs) during direct cortical stimulation as well as for mapping high-frequency activity during various cognitive tasks. Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials can identify the central sulcus by mapping the dipolar activation of the primary somatosensory cortex that results from stimulation of the large fiber somatosensory pathway by peripheral nerve stimulation. Motor, sensory, and language cortex can also be identified by direct electrical cortical stimulation.

Here, we explore brain-heart interactions during visual emotional elicitation in healthy subjects using measures of Granger causality (GC), a widely used descriptor of causal influences between two dynamical systems. The proposed approach inferences causality between instantaneous cardiovagal dynamics estimated from inhomogeneous point-process models of the heartbeat and high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics in 22 healthy subjects who underwent pleasant/unpleasant affective elicitation by watching pictures from the International Affective Picture System database. Particularly, we calculated the GC indexes between the EEG spectrogram in the canonical theta-. alpha-, beta-, and gamma -bands and both the instantaneous mean heart rate and its continuous parasympathetic modulations (i.e., the instantaneous HF power). Thus we looked for significant statistical differences among GC values estimated during the resting slate, neutral elicitation, and pleasant/unpleasant arousing elicitation. As compared with resting state, coupling strength increases significantly in the left hemisphere during positive stimuli and in the right hemisphere during negative stimuli. Our results further reveal a correlation between emotional valence and lateralization of the dynamical information transfer going from brain-to-heart, mainly localized in the prefrontal, somatosensory, and posterior cortexes, and of the information transfer from heart-to-brain, mainly reflected into the fronto-parietal cortex oscillations in the gamma-band (30-45 Hz).

Degradation of the auditory periphery due to aging and hearing loss may lead to increased responsiveness to sound in the auditory cortex, with potential consequences for the processing of temporal regularities. We used electroencephalography recorded from younger (19-33 years) and older adults (55-76 years) to investigate whether younger and older listeners differ in responsiveness to sound and sensitivity to amplitude modulation in sounds. Aging was associated with reduced adaptation in the auditory cortex, suggesting an age-related increase in responsiveness. Furthermore, neural synchronization in the auditory cortex to 4-Hz amplitude-modulated narrow-band noises was enhanced in similar to 30% of older individuals. Despite enhanced responsiveness and synchronization in the auditory cortex, sustained neural activity (likely involving auditory and higher-order regions) in response to amplitude modulation was absent in older people. Aging appears to be associated with over-responsiveness to amplitude modulation in the auditory cortex, but with diminished regularity sensitivity in higher-order areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In fact, this kind of patients represent a unique and physiological way to investigate how neuroplasticity overcame unilateral deafferentation by implementing particular strategies that produce apparently next- to-normal hearing behavioural performances. This explains why such patients have been underinvestigated for a long time. Thanks to the availability of techniques able to study the cerebral activity underlying the mentioned behavioural outcomes, the aim of the present research was to elucidate whether different electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns occurred in unilateral hearing loss (UHL) children in comparison to normal hearing (NH) controls during speech-in-noise listening. Given the intrinsic lateralized nature of such patients, due to the unilateral side of hearing impairment, the experimental question was to assess whether this would reflect a different EEG pattern while performing a word in noise recognition task varying the direction of the noise source. Results showed a correlation between the period of deafness and the cortical activity asymmetry toward the hearing ear side in the frontal, parietal and occipital areas in all the experimental conditions. Concerning alpha and beta activity in the frontal and central areas highlighted that in the NH group, the lateralization was always left-sided during the Quiet condition, while it was right-sided in noise conditions: this evidence was not, however, detected also in the UHL group. In addition, focusing on the theta and alpha activity in the frontal areas (Broca area) during noise conditions, while the activity was always left-lateralized in the NH group, it was ipsilateral to the direction of the background noise in the UHL group, and of a weaker extent than in NH controls. Furthermore, in noise conditions, only the UHL group showed a higher theta activity in the temporal areas ipsilateral to the side where the background noise was directed to. Finally, in the case of bilateral noise (background noise and word signal both coming from the same two sources), the theta and alpha activity in the frontal areas (Broca area) was left-lateralized in the case of the NH group and lateralized towards the side of the better hearing ear in the case of the UHL group. Taken together, this evidence supports the establishment of a particular EEG pattern occurrence in UHL children taking place in the frontal (Broca area), temporal and parietal lobes, probably physiologically established in order to deal with different sound and noise source directions.

Infraslow coordination of slow wave activity through altered neuronal synchrony	SLEEP			English	Article						slow wave activity; infraslow; sleep regulation; neuronal synchrony; rat	SLEEP HOMEOSTASIS; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LOCAL SLEEP; OSCILLATION; EEG; MEMORY; FLUCTUATIONS; STIMULATION; PLASTICITY	Slow wave activity (SWA; the EEG power between 0.5 and 4 Hz during non-rapid eye movement sleep [NREM]) is the best electrophysiological marker of sleep need; SWA dissipates across the night and increases following sleep deprivation. In addition to these well-documented homeostatic SWA trends, SWA exhibits extensive variability across shorter timescales (seconds to minutes) and between local cortical regions. The physiological underpinnings of SWA variability, however, remain poorly characterized. In male Sprague-Dawley rats, we observed that SWA exhibits pronounced infraslow fluctuations (similar to 40- to 120-s periods) that are coordinated across disparate cortical locations. Peaks in SWA across infraslow cycles were associated with increased slope, amplitude, and duration of individual slow waves and a reduction in the total number of waves and proportion of multipeak waves. Using a freely available data set comprised of extracellular unit recordings during consolidated NREM episodes in male Long-Evans rats, we further show that infraslow SWA does not appear to arise as a consequence of firing rate modulation of putative excitatory or inhibitory neurons. Instead, infraslow SWA was associated with alterations in neuronal synchrony surrounding "On"/"Off" periods and changes in the number and duration of "Off" periods. Collectively, these data provide a mechanism by which SWA can be coordinated across disparate cortical locations and thereby connect local and global expression of this patterned neuronal activity. In doing so, infraslow SWA may contribute to the regulation of cortical circuits during sleep and thereby play a critical role in sleep function.

We here tested whether interhemispheric functional connectivity and ensuing auditory perception can selectively be modulated by high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS). For this purpose, we applied multi-site HD-tACS at 40Hz bilaterally with a phase lag of 180 degrees and recorded a 64-channel EEG to study the oscillatory phase dynamics at the source-space level during a dichotic listening (DL) task in twenty-six healthy participants. In this study, we revealed an oscillatory phase signature at 40Hz which reflects different temporal profiles of the phase asymmetries during left and right ear percept. Here we report that 180 degrees-tACS did not affect the right ear advantage during DL at group level. However, a follow-up analysis revealed that the intrinsic phase asymmetries during sham-tACS determined the directionality of the behavioral modulations: While a shift to left ear percept was associated with augmented interhemispheric asymmetry (closer to 180 degrees), a shift to right ear processing was elicited in subjects with lower asymmetry (closer to 0 degrees). Crucially, the modulation of the interhemispheric network dynamics depended on the deviation of the tACS-induced phase-lag from the intrinsic phase asymmetry. Our characterization of the oscillatory network trends is giving rise to the importance of phase-specific gamma-band coupling during ambiguous auditory perception, and emphasizes the necessity to address the inter-individual variability of phase asymmetries in future studies by tailored stimulation protocols.

Systematic extraction of individual slow waves is not trivial. New method: In this study, we used the neural network pattern recognition to detect individual slow waves in LFP recorded from mice as well as other commonly used methods that are based on fast frequencies modulation, amplitude, or duration. Results: The number and quality of events detected as slow waves depended on the chosen method of detection, level of thresholds, or on combination of methods. Each individual method yields some false-positive and false-negative detections. Typically, the fast frequency-method has a higher false discovery rate, but almost no missing waves; amplitude-based method has relatively high false-positive and false-negative rates; duration-based method has low false-negative rates; neural network pattern recognition approach has the lowest false-positive rate among individual methods, often rejecting waves that were falsely detected by other approaches. Combining all 4 detection methods practically eliminated false-positive errors, but a large number of slow waves remained undetected. Conclusions: The use of a particular method of slow wave detection needs to be adjusted to the objectives of a given study: to detect all slow waves, but also numerous false positives can be achieved using the fast frequency approach. Neural network pattern recognition method alone can detect slow waves with the lowest false-positive rate, that can be further minimized with the use of combination of other methods.

Pathological responses to single-pulse electrical stimuli in epilepsy: The role of feedforward inhibition	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						delayed responses; early responses; focal epilepsy; neural mass model; single-pulse electrical stimulation	NEURAL MASS MODEL; IDENTIFY EPILEPTOGENIC CORTEX; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; FOCAL EPILEPSY; IN-VIVO; EEG; GENERATION; ONSET	Delineation of epileptogenic cortex in focal epilepsy patients may profit from single-pulse electrical stimulation during intracranial EEG recordings. Single-pulse electrical stimulation evokes early and delayed responses. Early responses represent connectivity. Delayed responses are a biomarker for epileptogenic cortex, but up till now, the precise mechanism generating delayed responses remains elusive. We used a data-driven modelling approach to study early and delayed responses. We hypothesized that delayed responses represent indirect responses triggered by early response activity and investigated this for 11 patients. Using two coupled neural masses, we modelled early and delayed responses by combining simulations and bifurcation analysis. An important feature of the model is the inclusion of feedforward inhibitory connections. The waveform of early responses can be explained by feedforward inhibition. Delayed responses can be viewed as second-order responses in the early response network which appear when input to a neural mass falls below a threshold forcing it temporarily to a spiking state. The combination of the threshold with noisy background input explains the typical stochastic appearance of delayed responses. The intrinsic excitability of a neural mass and the strength of its input influence the probability at which delayed responses to occur. Our work gives a theoretical basis for the use of delayed responses as a biomarker for the epileptogenic zone, confirming earlier clinical observations. The combination of early responses revealing effective connectivity, and delayed responses showing intrinsic excitability, makes single-pulse electrical stimulation an interesting tool to obtain data for computational models of epilepsy surgery.

We hypothesized that analysis of continuously captured time-varying instantaneous phase synchronization between signals from different brain regions might add another dimension to already identified network dynamics. To validate this hypothesis as an aid to elucidating the physiological mechanisms of aging, we examined time-series of instantaneous phase synchronization events in resting-state EEG activity across the brain, in healthy younger and healthy older subjects. We then characterized the temporal dynamics of phase synchronization using multiscale entropy, which quantifies the complexity of brain signal dynamics over multiple time scales. The results of surrogate analyses confirmed that the temporal dynamics of phase synchronization arise from deterministic processes in the neural network system. Group comparison showed region-specific enhanced complexity of temporal dynamics of phase synchronization in older subjects in alpha band predominantly in frontal brain regions, which was not identified by a comparative phase synchronization approach such as phase lag index. Enhanced complexity of temporal dynamics of functional connectivity in older subjects might reflect a general network alteration theory in aging. This is a first report describing the importance of capturing the dynamics of instantaneous phase synchronization and characterizing its temporal organization. Applying this method to neurophysiologic data may provide a novel understanding of dynamical neural network processes in both healthy and pathological conditions.

Disruption of Frontal Lobe Neural Synchrony During Cognitive Control by Alcohol Intoxication	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 144; Neuroscience; brain; cognitive control; magnetoencephalography; theta oscillations; phase-locking; neural synchrony; alcohol; Stroop task; multimodal imaging	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; DECISION-MAKING; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITORY CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FAMILY-HISTORY; THETA; EEG	Decision making relies on dynamic interactions of distributed, primarily frontal brain regions. Extensive evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicates that the anterior cingulate (ACC) and the lateral prefrontal cortices (IatPFC) are essential nodes subserving cognitive control. However, because of its limited temporal resolution, fMRI cannot accurately reflect the timing and nature of their presumed interplay. The present study combines distributed source modeling of the temporally precise magnetoencephalography (MEG) signal with structural MRI in the form of "brain movies" to: (1) estimate the cortical areas involved in cognitive control ("where"), (2) characterize their temporal sequence ("when"), and (3) quantify the oscillatory dynamics of their neural interactions in real time. Stroop interference was associated with greater event-related theta (4 - 7 Hz) power in the ACC during conflict detection followed by sustained sensitivity to cognitive demands in the ACC and IatPFC during integration and response preparation. A phase-locking analysis revealed co-oscillatory interactions between these areas indicating their increased neural synchrony in theta band during conflict-inducing incongruous trials. These results confirm that theta oscillations are fundamental to long-range synchronization needed for integrating top-down influences during cognitive control. MEG reflects neural activity directly, which makes it suitable for pharmacological manipulations in contrast to fMRI that is sensitive to vasoactive confounds. In the present study, healthy social drinkers were given a moderate alcohol dose and placebo in a within-subject design. Acute intoxication attenuated theta power to Stroop conflict and dysregulated co-oscillations between the ACC and IatPFC, confirming that alcohol is detrimental to neural synchrony subserving cognitive control. It interferes with goal-directed behavior that may result in deficient self-control, contributing to compulsive drinking. In sum, this method can provide insight into real-time interactions during cognitive processing and can characterize the selective sensitivity to pharmacological challenge across relevant neural networks.

Interactions Between Rhythmic and Feature Predictions to Create Parallel Time-Content Associations	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prediction; EEG; temporal information; rhythm; adaptation	VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; ADAPTATION; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; SUPPRESSION	The brain is inherently proactive, constantly predicting the when (moment) and what (content) of future input in order to optimize information processing. Previous research on such predictions has mainly studied the "when" or "what" domain separately, missing to investigate the potential integration of both types of predictive information. In the absence of such integration, temporal cues are assumed to enhance any upcoming content at the predicted moment in time (general temporal predictor). However, if the when and what prediction domain were integrated, a much more flexible neural mechanism may be proposed in which temporal-feature interactions would allow for the creation of multiple concurrent time-content predictions (parallel time-content predictor). Here, we used a temporal association paradigm in two experiments in which sound identity was systematically paired with a specific time delay after the offset of a rhythmic visual input stream. In Experiment 1, we revealed that participants associated the time delay of presentation with the identity of the sound. In Experiment 2, we unexpectedly found that the strength of this temporal association was negatively related to the EEG steady-state evoked responses (SSVEP) in preceding trials, showing that after high neuronal responses participants responded inconsistent with the time-content associations, similar to adaptation mechanisms. In this experiment, time-content associations were only present for low SSVEP responses in previous trials. These results tentatively show that it is possible to represent multiple time-content paired predictions in parallel, however, future research is needed to investigate this interaction further.

Rat models suggest that the deficits caused by ATN damage, which is associated with "diencephalic amnesia", can be ameliorated by environmental enrichment (EE) through unknown mechanisms. We examined whether changes in theta rhythmicity within and between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are influenced by EE in rats with ATN lesions. Here, we show that ATN lesions and EE produced essentially opposed functional effects in terms of changes in rhythmicity between two consecutive trials when rats forage for chocolate hail. On the second trial, standard-housed rats with ATN lesions showed: (a) a clear reduction in prefrontal cortex experience-dependent power change in the theta band and in two adjacent bands; (b) little change in the theta band in hippocampal area CA1; and (c) only a modest overall reduction in experience-dependent power change at lower theta frequencies in the dentate gyrus. EE exposure prevented the decrease in prefrontal theta power in rats with ATN lesions, and in fact caused a clear increase in prefrontal cortex power across all bands. While ATN lesions did not reliably affect prefrontal-CA1 or prefrontal-dentate theta coherence, EE increased the coherence between prefrontal cortex and area CA1 in both the sham and ATN groups. Thus, EE increases functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus via pathways that bypass the ATN, and increases behaviorally dependent prefrontal rhythmicity. These EEG effects may contribute to improved learning and memory in the ATN-lesion model of diencephalic amnesia.

To examine the time course of prediction error signaling, we recorded intracranial EEG activity from nine presurgical epileptic patients while they listened to melodies whose information theoretical predictability had been characterized using a computational model. We examined oscillatory activity in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus, lateral cortical areas previously implicated in auditory predictive processing. We also examined activity in anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), insula, and amygdala to determine whether signatures of prediction error signaling may also be observable in these subcortical areas. Our results demonstrate that the information content (a measure of unexpectedness) of musical notes modulates the amplitude of low-frequency oscillatory activity (theta to beta power) in bilateral STG and right MTG from within 100 and 200 msec of note onset, respectively. Our results also show this cortical activity to be accompanied by low-frequency oscillatory modulation in ACG and insula-areas previously associated with mediating physiological arousal. Finally, we showed that modulation of low-frequency activity is followed by that of high-frequency (gamma) power from approximately 200 msec in the STG, between 300 and 400 msec in the left insula, and between 400 and 500 msec in the ACG. We discuss these results with respect to models of neural processing that emphasize gamma activity as an index of prediction error signaling and highlight the usefulness of musical stimuli in revealing the wide-reaching neural consequences of predictive processing.

Methods: Different combinations of two classes of filters (Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)), three cutoff frequency bands (0.5-1000 Hz, 3-1000 Hz, and 30-1000 Hz), and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to preprocess SEPs recorded from 17 healthy volunteers who participated in two sessions of 1000 stimulations of the right median nerve. N30 amplitude was calculated from frontally placed electrode (F3). Results: The epochs classified as artifacts from SEPs filtered with FIR compared to those filtered with IIR were 1% more using automatic and 140% more using semi-automatic methods (both p < 0.001). There were no differences in N30 amplitudes between FIR and IIR filtered SEPs. The N30 amplitude was significantly lower for SEPs filtered with 30-1000 Hz compared to the bandpass frequencies 0.5-1000 Hz and 3-1000 Hz. The N30 amplitude was significantly reduced when SEPs were cleaned with ICA compared to the SEPs from which non-brain components were not removed using ICA. Conclusion: This study suggests that the preprocessing of SEPs should be done carefully and the neuroscience community should come to a consensus regarding SEP preprocessing guidelines, as the preprocessing parameters can affect the outcomes that may influence the interpretations of results, replicability, and comparison of different studies.

An outstanding question concerns the extent to which early intervention can normalize trajectories of brain development in at-risk children. We tested this within the context of a randomized clinical trial of an early parenting program, the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC), delivered to parents and infants monitored for maltreatment by Child Protective Services. METHODS: Families participated in the randomized clinical trial when children were 2.5 years of age or younger. Parenting and home adversity was measured at baseline. Children were followed longitudinally, and resting brain activity was measured electrophysiologically (n = 106) when children reached 8 years of age. Spectral power was quantified and compared across children assigned to the experimental intervention (ABC), a control intervention, and a low-risk comparison group (n = 76) recruited at the follow-up assessment. RESULTS: Higher early home adversity was associated with electrophysiological profiles indicative of cortical delays/immaturity in middle childhood, based on relatively greater power in lower frequency bands (theta, 4-6 Hz, and low alpha, 6-9 Hz) and lower power in a higher frequency band (high alpha, 9-12 Hz). Children assigned to ABC showed relatively greater high-frequency power (beta, 12-20 Hz) than children assigned to the control intervention. Beta power in the ABC did not differ from that of the low-risk comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: Maltreatment risk and home adversity can affect indicators of middle childhood brain maturation. Early parenting programs can support more normative patterns of neural function during middle childhood.

J	Meisler, SL; Kahana, MJ; Ezzyat, Y				Meisler, Steven L.; Kahana, Michael J.; Ezzyat, Youssef			Does data cleaning improve brain state classification?	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Intracranial EEG; Physiology; Noise removal; Multivariate; Episodic memory	FREQUENCY GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY FORMATION; THETA; CORTEX; STIMULATION; RECORDINGS; DISTANCE; RECALL; POWER	Background: Neuroscientists routinely seek to identify and remove noisy or artifactual observations from their data. They do so with the belief that removing such data improves power to detect relations between neural activity and behavior, which are often subtle and can be overwhelmed by noise. Whereas standard methods can exclude certain well-defined noise sources (e.g., 50/60 Hz electrical noise), in many situations there is not a clear difference between noise and signals so it is not obvious how to separate the two. Here we ask whether methods routinely used to "clean" human electrophysiological recordings lead to greater power to detect brain behavior relations. New method: This, to the authors' knowledge, is the first large-scale simultaneous evaluation of multiple commonly used methods for removing noise from intracranial EEG recordings. Results: We find that several commonly used data cleaning methods (automated methods based on statistical signal properties and manual methods based on expert review) do not increase the power to detect univariate and multivariate electrophysiological biomarkers of successful episodic memory encoding, a well-characterized broadband pattern of neural activity observed across the brain. Comparison with existing methods: Researchers may be more likely to increase statistical power to detect physiological phenomena of interest by allocating resources away from cleaning noisy data and toward collecting more within-patient observations. Conclusions: These findings highlight the challenge of partitioning signal and noise in the analysis of brain-behavior relations, and suggest increasing sample size and numbers of observations, rather than data cleaning, as the best approach to improving statistical power.

The epileptic network of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Cortically driven and reproducible across age	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PAROXYSMAL FAST ACTIVITY; SPIKE-WAVE COMPLEXES; BRAIN-STEM; HYPOTHALAMIC HAMARTOMA; GENERATED SEIZURES; FAST COMPONENTS; TONIC SEIZURES; EEG; SLEEP; OSCILLATION	Objective To identify brain regions underlying interictal generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA), and their causal interactions, in children and adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Methods Concurrent scalp EEG-fMRI was performed in 2 separately analyzed patient groups with LGS: 10 children (mean age 8.9 years) scanned under isoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia and 15 older patients (mean age 31.7 years) scanned without anesthesia. Whole-brain event-related analysis determined GPFA-related activation in each group. Results were used as priors in a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis comparing evidence for different neuronal hypotheses describing initiation and propagation of GPFA between cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. Results A total of 1,045 GPFA events were analyzed (cumulative duration 1,433 seconds). In both pediatric and older groups, activation occurred in distributed association cortical areas, as well as the thalamus and brainstem (p < 0.05, corrected for family-wise error). Activation was similar across individual patients with structural, genetic, and unknown etiologies of epilepsy, particularly in frontoparietal cortex. In both groups, DCM revealed that GPFA was most likely driven by prefrontal cortex, with propagation occurring first to the brainstem and then from brainstem to thalamus. Conclusions We show reproducible evidence of a cortically driven process within the epileptic network of LGS. This network is present early (in children) and late (in older patients) in the course of the syndrome and across diverse etiologies of epilepsy, suggesting that LGS reflects shared "secondary network" involvement. A cortical-to-subcortical hierarchy is postulated whereby GPFA rapidly propagates from prefrontal cortex to the brainstem via extrapyramidal corticoreticular pathways, whereas the thalamus is engaged secondarily.

Effective Connectivity of Beta Oscillations in Endometriosis-Related Chronic Pain During rest and Pain-Related Mental Imagery	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Endometriosis; pelvic pain; EEG effective connectivity; pain modulatory brain systems	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN; CHRONIC BACK-PAIN; VENTROLATERAL ORBITAL CORTEX; INTRINSIC BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GRAY-MATTER; DEFAULT MODE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EMOTIONAL CONTROL	Using the EEG recordings of patients with endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain, we have examined the effective connectivity within the cortical pain-related network during rest and during pain-related imagery. During rest, an altered connectivity was hypothesized between cortical somatosensory pain areas and regions involved in emotional and cognitive modulation of pain. During pain-related imagery, alterations in prefrontal-temporal connectivity were expected. The effective connectivity was estimated using the Directed Transfer Function method. Differences between endometriosis patients and controls were found in the beta band (14-25 Hz). During rest, endometriosis was associated with an increased connectivity from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the left somatosensory cortex and also from the left somatosensory cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex and the right temporal cortex. These results might be related to sustained activation of the somatosensory pain system caused by the ongoing pain. During pain-related imagery, endometriosis patients showed an increased connectivity from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the right temporal cortex. This finding might point to impaired emotional regulation when processing pain related stimuli, or it might be related to altered memorization of pain experiences. Results of this study open up new directions in chronic pain research aimed at exploring the beta band connectivity alterations. Perspective: This study examined the pain system's dynamics in endometriosis patients with chronic pelvic pain during resting-state and pain-related mental imagery. The results could contribute to the development of new therapies using guided mental imagery.

However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the effects of RAS are still poorly understood. We aimed at identifying which mechanisms sustain gait improvement in a cohort of patients with PD who practiced RAS gait training.MethodsWe enrolled 50 patients with PD who were randomly assigned to two different modalities of treadmill gait training using GaitTrainer3 with and without RAS (non_RAS) during an 8-week training program. We measured clinical, kinematic, and electrophysiological effects of both the gait trainings.ResultsWe found a greater improvement in Functional Gait Assessment (p<0.001), Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale (p<0.001), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (p=0.001), and overall gait quality index (p<0.001) following RAS than non_RAS training. In addition, the RAS gait training induced a stronger EEG power increase within the sensorimotor rhythms related to specific periods of the gait cycle, and a greater improvement of fronto-centroparietal/temporal electrode connectivity than the non_RAS gait training.ConclusionsThe findings of our study suggest that the usefulness of cueing strategies during gait training consists of a reshape of sensorimotor rhythms and fronto-centroparietal/temporal connectivity. Restoring the internal timing mechanisms that generate and control motor rhythmicity, thus improving gait performance, likely depends on a contribution of the cerebellum. Finally, identifying these mechanisms is crucial to create patient-tailored, RAS-based rehabilitative approaches in PD.Trial registrationNCT03434496.

Despite a long history of research into visual search, the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with multiple-target search are poorly understood. Here we test the novel theory that the efficiency oflooking for multiple targets critically depends on the mode of cognitive control the environment affords to the observer. We used an innovative combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking while participants searched for two targets, within two different contexts: either both targets were present in the search display and observers were free to prioritize either one of them, thus enabling proactive control over selection; or only one of the two targets would be present in each search display, which requires reactive control to reconfigure selection when the wrong target has been prioritized. During proactive control, both univariate and multivariate signals of beta-band (15-35 Hz) power suppression before display onset predicted switches between target selections. This signal originated over midfrontal and sensorimotor regions and has previously been associated with endogenous state changes. In contrast, imposed target selections requiring reactive control elicited prefrontal power enhancements in the delta/theta band (2-8 Hz), but only after display onset. This signal predicted individual differences in associated oculomotor switch costs, reflecting reactive reconfiguration of target selection. The results provide compelling evidence that multiple target representations are differentially prioritized during visual search, and for the first time reveal distinct neural mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control over multiple-target search.

Cortical activation in generalized seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						electroencephalogram; GABA(A) receptor; generalized; signal analysis	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; ABSENCE SEIZURES; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; GENERATED SEIZURES; ILAE COMMISSION; FAST COMPONENTS; POSITION PAPER; GENETIC MODEL; EPILEPSY; CLASSIFICATION	Objective Patients with generalized epilepsy exhibit different epileptiform events including asymptomatic interictal spikes (IS), absence seizures with spike-wave discharges (SWDs), and myoclonic seizures (MS). Our objective was to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical activation in SWDs, IS, and MS in the Gabra1(+/A322D) juvenile myoclonic epilepsy mouse. Methods We fabricated affordable, flexible high-density electroencephalography (HdEEG) arrays and recorded spontaneous SWD, IS, and MS with video/HdEEG. We determined differences among the events in amplitude spectral density (ASD) in the delta/theta/alpha/beta/gamma frequency bands at baseline (3.5-4.0 seconds before the first spike time, t(0)) and the prespike period (0.1-0.5 seconds before t(0)), and we elucidated the spatiotemporal activation during the t(0) spike. Results All three events had an increase in ASD between baseline and prespike in at least one frequency band. During prespike, MS had the largest delta-band ASD, but SWD had the greatest alpha/beta/gamma band ASD. For all three events, the ASD was largest in the anterior regions. The t(0) spike voltage was also greatest in the anterior regions for all three events and IS and MS had larger voltages than SWD. From 7.5 to 17.5 msec after t(0), MS had greater voltage than IS and SWD, and maximal voltage was in the posterior parietal region. Significance Changes in spectral density from baseline to prespike indicate that none of these generalized events are instantaneous or entirely unpredictable. Prominent engagement of anterior cortical regions during prespike and at t(0) suggest that common anterior neural circuits participate in each event. Differences in prespike ASD signify that although the events may engage similar brain regions, they may arise from distinct proictal states with different neuronal activity or connectivity. Prolonged activation of the posterior parietal area in MS suggests that posterior circuits contribute to the myoclonic jerk. Together, these findings identify brain regions and processes that could be specifically targeted for further recording and modulation.

Neural field theory of evoked response potentials in a spherical brain geometry	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEOCORTICAL DYNAMICS; WAVES; EEG; SLEEP; NETWORKS; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; PROPAGATION; PREDICTION	Evoked response potentials (ERPs) are calculated in spherical and planar geometries using neural field theory of the corticothalamic system. The ERP is modeled as an impulse response and the resulting modal effects of spherical corticothalamic dynamics are explored, showing that results for spherical and planar geometries converge in the limit of large brain size. Cortical modal effects can lead to a double-peak structure in the ERP time series. It is found that the main difference between infinite planar geometry and spherical geometry is that the ERP peak is sharper and stronger in the spherical geometry. It is also found that the magnitude of the response decreases with increasing spatial width of the stimulus at the cortex. The peak is slightly delayed at large angles from the stimulus point, corresponding to group velocities of 6-10 m s(-1). Strong modal effects are found in the spherical geometry, with the lowest few modes sufficing to describe the main features of ERPs, except very near to spatially narrow stimuli.	[Mukta, K.

Multiplexing of Theta and Alpha Rhythms in the Amygdala-Hippocampal Circuit Supports Pattern Separation of Emotional Information	NEURON			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; GRANGER CAUSALITY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; GAMMA; INHIBITION; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION	How do we remember emotional events? While emotion often leads to vivid recollection, the precision of emotional memories can be degraded, especially when discriminating among overlapping experiences in memory (i.e., pattern separation). Communication between the amygdala and the hippocampus has been proposed to support emotional memory, but the exact neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used intracranial recordings in pre-surgical epilepsy patients to show that successful pattern separation of emotional stimuli is associated with theta band (3-7 Hz)-coordinated bidirectional interactions between the amygdala and the hippocampus. In contrast, discrimination errors (i.e., failure to discriminate similar stimuli) were associated with alpha band (7-13 Hz)-coordinated unidirectional influence from the amygdala to the hippocampus. These findings imply that alpha band synchrony may impair discrimination of similar emotional events via the amygdala-hippocampal directional coupling, which suggests a target for treatments of psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, in which aversive experiences are often overgeneralized.

Coordinated representational reinstatement in the human hippocampus and lateral temporal cortex during episodic memory retrieval	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA POWER; LOBE; CONFIDENCE; DYNAMICS; NETWORK; STIMULI; RHYTHMS; NEURONS	Theoretical models of episodic memory have proposed that retrieval depends on interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex, where hippocampal reinstatement of item-context associations drives neocortical reinstatement of item information. Here, we simultaneously recorded intracranial EEG from hippocampus and lateral temporal cortex (LTC) of epilepsy patients who performed a virtual reality spatial navigation task. We extracted stimulus-specific representations of both item and item-context associations from the time-frequency patterns of activity in hippocampus and LTC. Our results revealed a double dissociation of representational reinstatement across time and space: an early reinstatement of item-context associations in hippocampus preceded a later reinstatement of item information in LTC. Importantly, reinstatement levels in hippocampus and LTC were correlated across trials, and the quality of LTC reinstatement was predicted by the magnitude of phase synchronization between hippocampus and LTC. These findings confirm that episodic memory retrieval in humans relies on coordinated representational interactions within a hippocampal-neocortical network.

J	De Canditiis, D; De Feis, I				De Canditiis, Daniela; De Feis, Italia			Simultaneous nonparametric regression in RADWT dictionaries	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						RADWT; Grouped LASSO; Multichannel	SIMULTANEOUS SPARSE APPROXIMATION; SLEEP-SPINDLES; SELECTION; ALGORITHMS	A new technique for nonparametric regression of multichannel signals is presented. The technique is based on the use of the Rational-Dilation Wavelet Transform (RADWT), equipped with a tunable Q-factor able to provide sparse representations of functions with different oscillations persistence. In particular, two different frames are obtained by two RADWT with different Q-factors that give sparse representations of functions with low and high resonance. It is assumed that the signals are measured simultaneously on several independent channels and that they share the low resonance component and the spectral characteristics of the high resonance component. Then, a regression analysis is performed by means of the grouped lasso penalty. Furthermore, a result of asymptotic optimality of the estimator is presented using reasonable assumptions and exploiting recent results on group-lasso like procedures. Numerical experiments show the performance of the proposed method in different synthetic scenarios as well as in a real case example for the analysis and joint detection of sleep spindles and K-complex events for multiple electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

This noise is principally composed of the residual stimulus artefact and millivolt amplitude compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) recorded from the scalp muscles and precludes analysis of the cortical evoked potentials, especially during the first 20-ms post stimulus. The proposed method uses the wavelet transform with a fourth-order Daubechies mother wavelet and a novel coefficient reduction algorithm based on cortical amplitude thresholds. Four other mother wavelets as well as digital filtering have been tested, and the Coiflets 2 and 3 also found to be effective with Coiflet 3 results marginally better than Daubechies 4. The approach has been tested using data recorded from 16 normal subjects during a study of cortical sensitivity to rTMS at different cortical locations using stimulation amplitudes, frequencies, and sites typically used in clinical practice to treat major depressive disorder.

In sequential memory tasks, memory performance can be reduced by shortening the intervals between memory item presentations. To clarify the neurophysiological mechanism underlying this, we recorded magnetoencephalograms in 33 healthy volunteers performing two sequential memory tasks with either short or long intervals between memory items (hereafter, fast and slow conditions, respectively). Memory accuracy, and theta- and alpha-band activities originating from occipital and frontal brain areas were analyzed. Memory performance was significantly lower for the fast condition than the slow condition. Meanwhile, occipital and frontal theta activities were significantly lower for the fast condition than the slow condition. Increased occipital-alpha, a sign of active inhibition of task-irrelevant visual input, occurred regardless of condition. However, memory processing related to occipital- and frontal-theta activities had some temporal limitations. Namely, the shorter intervals of the fast condition attenuated theta activity, likely disrupting working memory processing, thereby leading to the observed decline in memory performance.

However, clinical efficacy is limited by high inter-individual variability and low response rates. One possible strategy to improve the effect size and consistency may be brain state dependent brain stimulation, i.e. coupling of TMS pulses to the endogenous brain states as reflected by the instantaneous oscillatory brain activity. Here we present findings from a proof-of-principle study of alpha-oscillation synchronized brain stimulation of the frontal cortex in patients with major depression (BOSSFRONT). Repetitive stimulation consistently on the negative peak of ongoing alpha activity in left DLPFC, but not brain state independent intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), resulted in suppression of resting-state alpha activity in left DLPFC and an increase in TMS-induced beta activity. Findings show that alpha-synchronized rTMS of left DLPFC is both feasible and safe, and suggest that it interferes with frontal brain networks important in the pathophysiology of major depression.

Here we show a core feature of cognitive decline-working-memory deficits-emerges from disconnected local and long-range circuits instantiated by theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in temporal cortex and theta phase synchronization across frontotemporal cortex. We developed a noninvasive stimulation procedure for modulating long-range theta interactions in adults aged 60-76 years. After 25 min of stimulation, frequency-tuned to individual brain network dynamics, we observed a preferential increase in neural synchronization patterns and the return of sender-receiver relationships of information flow within and between frontotemporal regions. The end result was rapid improvement in working-memory performance that outlasted a 50 min post-stimulation period. The results provide insight into the physiological foundations of age-related cognitive impairment and contribute to groundwork for future non-pharmacological interventions targeting aspects of cognitive decline.

Transgenic mice with amyloid plaque pathology also display epileptic seizures, but those are too infrequent to assess the effect of anti-epileptic treatments. Besides spontaneous seizures, these mice also display frequent epileptic spiking in epidural EEG recordings, and these have provided a means to test potential drug treatment to AD-related epilepsy. However, the origin of EEG spikes in transgenic AD model mice has remained elusive, which makes it difficult to relate electrophysiology with underlying pathology at the cellular and molecular level. Using multiple cortical and subcortical electrodes in freely moving APP/PS1 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates, we identified several types of epileptic spikes among over 15 800 spikes visible with cortical screw electrodes based on their source localization. Cortical spikes associated with muscle twitches, cortico-hippocampal spikes, and spindle and fast-spindle associated spikes were present equally often in both APP/PS1 and wild-type mice, whereas pure cortical spikes were slightly more common in APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, spike-wave discharges, cortico-hippocampal spikes with after hyperpolarization and giant spikes were seen almost exclusively in APP/PS1 mice but only in a subset of them. Interestingly, different subtypes of spikes responded differently to anti-epileptic drugs ethosuximide and levetiracetam. From the translational point most relevant may be the giant spikes generated in the hippocampus that reached an amplitude up to +/- 5 mV in the hippocampal channel. As in AD patients, they occurred exclusively during sleep. Further, we could demonstrate that a high number of giant spikes in APP/PS1 mice predicts seizures. These data show that by only adding a pair of hippocampal deep electrodes and EMG to routine cortical epidural screw electrodes and by taking into account underlying cortical oscillations, one can drastically refine the analysis of cortical spike data. This new approach provides a powerful tool to preclinical testing of potential new treatment options for AD related epilepsy.

The mesh structure of the stretchable PEDOT-CF allowed stable structural integration with the PVA substrate. The electrode performance for monitoring electrocorticography (ECoG) was evaluated in saline solution, on ex vivo brains, and in vivo animal experiments using rats and porcines. It was demonstrated that the large double-layer capacitance of the PEDOT-CF brings low impedance at the frequency of brain wave including epileptic seizures, and PVA hydrogel substrate minimized the contact impedance on the brain. The most important unique feature of the hydrogel-based ECoG electrode was its shape conformability to enable tight adhesion even to curved, grooved surface of brains by just being placed. In addition, since the hydrogel-based electrode is totally organic, the simultaneous ECoG-fMRI measurements could be conducted without image artifacts, avoiding problems induced by conventional metallic electrodes.

It is posited that the formation of new memory traces is orchestrated by the synchronization of neuronal activity in the theta rhythm (3-8 Hz), theta coupled gamma activity (40-120 Hz), and decreases in the alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz). Critically, given the correlative nature of neurophysiological recordings, the functional relevance of oscillatory processes is not well understood. Here, we experimentally enhanced memory formation processes by a rhythmic visual stimulation at an individual theta frequency, in contrast to the stimulation at an individual alpha frequency. This memory entrainment effect was not explained by theta power per se, but was driven by a visually evoked theta-gamma coupling pattern. This underlines the functional role of the theta rhythm and the theta-gamma neuronal code in human episodic memory. The entrainment of mnemonic network mechanisms by a visual stimulation technique provides a proof of concept that visual pacemakers can entrain complex cognitive processes in the wake human brain.

Objective: To systematically review the existing literature on the accuracy of early heart rate variability (HRV) to predict brain injury and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes after NE. Design/Methods: We systematically searched the literature published between May 1947 and May 2018. We included all prospective and retrospective studies reporting HRV metrics, within the first 7 days of life in babies with NE, and its association with adverse outcomes (defined as evidence of brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging and/or abnormal neurodevelopment at >= 1 year of age). We extracted raw data wherever possible to calculate the prognostic indices with confidence intervals. Results: We retrieved 379 citations, 5 of which met the criteria. One further study was excluded as it analysed an already-included cohort. The 4 studies provided data on 205 babies, 80 (39%) of whom had adverse outcomes. Prognostic accuracy was reported for 12 different HRV metrics and the area under the curve (AUC) varied between 0.79 and 0.94. The best performing metric reported in the included studies was the relative power of high-frequency band, with an AUC of 0.94. Conclusions: HRV metrics are a promising bedside tool for early prediction of brain injury and neurodevelopmental outcome in babies with NE. Due to the small number of studies available, their heterogeneity and methodological limitations, further research is needed to refine this tool so that it can be used in clinical practice.

In Neuro-engineering, SSVEP-based Brain-computer Interfaces (SSVEP-BCIs) have been used in variety of applications (e. g., communication, entertainment, etc.) for the detection of attention to visual stimuli. In this work, we propose a hands-free videogame in which the player joystick is a SSVEP-BCI. In the videogame, hostile avatars fire weapons against the player who could deflect them if enough attention is exerted. Attention is detected based on the analysis of SSVEP and Alphaband powers. For this purpose, weapons are mobile checkerboards that flicker at a constant frequency. We presented this videogame as a demo in a technologic event for students of engineering who freely tried it. The main findings were: (i) the attention detection algorithm based on SSVEPs is robust enough to be performed in few seconds even with mobile visual stimuli and in a non-isolated room; (ii) the videogame is capable to dose and quantify the amount of cognitive attention that a player exerts on mobile stimuli by controlling their time and position. The results suggest that this videogame could be used as a serious game to play/train the attentional and visual tracking capabilities with direct application in Special Needs Education or in attention disorders.

Clarifying frequency-dependent brightness enhancement: delta- and theta-band flicker, not alpha-band flicker, consistently seen as brightest	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Visual perception; Flicker; Brightness enhancement; Neural oscillations; Discrimination	EEG ALPHA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; DARKNESS ENHANCEMENT; ENTRAINMENT; STIMULI; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; FLUCTUATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION	Frequency-dependent brightness enhancement, a perceptual illusion in which a flickering light can appear twice as bright as a constant light, has historically been reported to produce maximum effects at a flicker rate within the alpha (8-12Hz) band (Bartley in J Exp Psychol 23(3):313-319, 1938). Our recent examinations of this phenomenon using brightness discrimination between two flickering stimuli, however, have instead revealed the brightest percepts from theta-band (4-7Hz) flicker (Bertrand et al. in Sci Rep8(1):6152, 2018). Two primary questions arise from these seemingly contradictory findings: first, could task differences between these studies have caused recruitment of discrete oscillatory processes? Second, could the reported theta-band flicker enhancement be the result of an aliased alpha rhythm, sequentially sampling two stimulus locations, resulting in an similar to 5Hz half-alpha rhythm? Here, we investigated these questions with two experiments: one replicating Bartley's (1938) adjustment paradigm, and one containing both Bartley's adjustment task and Bertrand's (2018) discrimination task, but presenting stimuli only sequentially (rather than concurrently). Examination of a range of frequencies (2-12Hz) revealed the greatest brightness enhancement arising from flicker in the delta- and theta-band across all conditions, regardless of the spatial or temporal configuration of the stimuli. We speculate that these slower rhythms play an integral role in complex visual operations (e.g., a discrimination decision) where the entrainment of the endogenous neural rhythm to matched exogenous rhythmic stimulation promotes more efficient processing of visual information and thus produces perceptual biases as seen in frequency-dependent brightness enhancement.

Cognitive and Electrophysiological Evidences	MINDFULNESS			English	Article						Mindfulness; Neurofeedback; EEG; Wearable device; Attention; Cognitive control	MEDITATION; STRESS; ERP	Mindfulness meditation is at present deemed also as form of mental training that may allow for empowering focusing, attention regulation, and executive control skills. Nonetheless, the potential of traditional mindfulness practice for improving cognitive and neural efficiency is affected by two critical requirementsintensity of exercise and perseverance to practicewhich represent a known limitation of accessibility to meditation practices. It has been suggested that the impact of such limitations might be reduced thanks to the support of external devices. The present study aims at testing the efficacy of an intensive technology-mediated intervention based on mindful practices and supported by a brain-sensing device to optimize cognitive performance and neural efficiency. Forty participants took part in the study and were randomly divided in an active control and an experimental group. Both groups were involved in a structured intervention, which lasted 4weeks and was constituted by brief daily activities. The experimental group, differently from the active control, underwent mindfulness-based practices with the support of a dedicated device. Analyses highlighted increased electrophysiological responsiveness indices at rest and frequency profiles consistent with a relaxed mindset in the experimental group. Participants in the experimental group also showed improved electrophysiological markers of attention regulation and improved cognitive performance, as measured by a complex reaction times task. Findings hint at the potential of the investigated technology-mediated mindfulness practice for enhancing cognitive performance and for inducing consistent modulations of neural efficiency markers.

Methods: We reviewed the polysomnogram (PSG) data of children with sleep complaints who were being evaluated for sleep-disordered breathing and had an apnea-hypopnea-index <= 3. These data were compared to the recordings of the same children with nasal CPAP administered for one night and to 60 control subjects (children without any sleep complaints). A subgroup of children was monitored with esophageal manometry, but nasal cannula flow data was recorded in all cases. Results: Abnormal breathing patterns, particularly flow limitation, could be seen with more severity and frequency compared to apnea or hypopnea. The observed abnormal breathing patterns were associated with EEG disturbances. Conclusions: Patterns such as flow-limitation, mouth-breathing, changes in inspiratory and expiratory time, rib-cage and expiratory muscle activity, transcutaneous CO2 electrode changes and snoring noises are all variables that should be systematically reviewed when analyzing nocturnal PSG. Current scoring guidelines emphasizes apnea-hypopnea and hypoxic-sleep disordered breathing and therefore treatment is often much delayed in this population of children with evidence of abnormal breathing patterns. Analysis of the various patterns of abnormal breathing noted above allows recognition of "non-hypoxic" sleep-disordered-breathing (SDB). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kononowicz, TW; van Wassenhove, V				Kononowicz, Tadeusz W.; van Wassenhove, Virginie			Evaluation of Self-generated Behavior: Untangling Metacognitive Readout and Error Detection	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BETA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL-NETWORK; TIME; MEG; CORTEX; INHIBITION; CONFIDENCE; REGRESSION; SEPARATION	When producing a duration, for instance, by pressing a key for 1 sec, the brain relies on self-generated neuronal dynamics to monitor the "flow of time." Evidence has suggested that the brain can also monitor itself monitoring time, the so-called self-evaluation. How are temporal errors inferred on the basis of purely internally driven brain dynamics with no external reference for time? Although studies have shown that participants can reliably detect temporal errors when generating a duration, the neural bases underlying the evaluation of this self-generated temporal behavior are unknown. Theories of psychological time have also remained silent about such self-evaluation abilities. We assessed the contributions of an error-detection mechanism, in which error detection results from the ability to estimate the latency of motor actions, and of a readout mechanism, in which errors would result from inferring the state of a duration representation. Error detection predicts a V-shape association between neural activity and self-evaluation at the offset of a produced interval, whereas the readout predicts a linear association. Here, human participants generated a time interval and evaluated the magnitude of their timing (first- and second-order behavioral judgments, respectively). Focusing on the MEG/EEG signatures after the termination of the self-generated duration, we found several cortical sources involved in performance monitoring displaying a linear association between the power of alpha (alpha = 8-14 Hz) oscillations and self-evaluation. Altogether, our results support the readout hypothesis and indicate that duration representation may be integrated for the evaluation of self-generated behavior.

Recently, it has been shown that the post-movement beta rebound as well as beta activity during movement-preparation are modulated by movement errors. However, there are critical functional differences between pre- and post-movement beta activities. Here, we addressed two related open questions. Do the pre- and post-movement error-related modulations arise from distinct neural substrates? Do these modulations relate to efferent signals shaping muscle-activation patterns or do they reflect integration of sensory information, intervening upstream of the motor output? For this purpose, first we exploited independent component analysis (ICA) which revealed a double dissociation suggesting that distinct neural substrates are recruited in error-related beta-power modulations observed before and after movement. Second, we compared error-related beta oscillation responses observed in two bimanual reaching tasks involving similar movements but different interlimb coordination, and in which the same mechanical perturbations induced different behavioral adaptive responses. While the task difference was not reflected in the post-movement beta rebound, the pre-movement beta activity was differently modulated according to the interlimb coordination. Critically, we show an uncoupling between the behavioral and the electrophysiological responses during the movement preparation phase, which demonstrates that the error-related modulation of the foreperiod beta activity does not reflect changes in the motor output from primary motor cortex. It seems instead to relate to higher level processing of sensory afferents, essential for sensorimotor adaptation.

Chronic stress is a common waking experience; however, which specific aspect of sleep is most responsive, and how sleep changes relate to behavioral disturbances and molecular correlates remain unknown. We quantified sleep, physical, endocrine, and behavioral variables, as well as the brain and blood transcriptome in mice exposed to 9 weeks of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Comparing 46 phenotypic variables revealed that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), corticosterone regulation, and coat state were most responsive to UCMS. REMS theta oscillations were enhanced, whereas delta oscillations in non-REMS were unaffected. Transcripts affected by UCMS in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and blood were associated with inflammatory and immune responses. A machine-learning approach controlling for unspecific UCMS effects identified transcriptomic predictor sets for REMS parameters that were enriched in 193 pathways, including some involved in stem cells, immune response, and apoptosis and survival. Only three pathways were enriched in predictor sets for non-REMS. Transcriptomic predictor sets for variation in REMS continuity and theta activity shared many pathways with corticosterone regulation, in particular pathways implicated in apoptosis and survival, including mitochondrial apoptotic machinery. Predictor sets for REMS and anhedonia shared pathways involved in oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. These data identify REMS as a core and early element of the response to chronic stress, and identify apoptosis and survival pathways as a putative mechanism by which REMS may mediate the response to stressful waking experiences.

Robust calculation of slopes in detrended fluctuation analysis and its application to envelopes of human alpha rhythms	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; BAND	Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a popular method to analyze long-range temporal correlations in time series of many different research areas but in particular also for electrophysiological recordings. Using the classical DFA method, the cumulative sum of data are divided into segments, and the variance of these sums is studied as a function of segment length after linearly detrending them in each segment. The starting point of the proposed new method is the observation that the classical method is inherently non-stationary without justification by a corresponding non-stationarity of the data. This leads to unstable estimates of fluctuations to the extent that it is impossible to estimate slopes of the fluctuations other than by fitting a line over a wide range of temporal scales. We here use a modification of the classical method by formulating the detrending as a strictly stationary operation. With this modification the detrended fluctuations can be expressed as a weighted average across the power spectrum of a signal. Most importantly, we can also express the slopes, calculated as analytic derivatives of the fluctuations with respect to the scales, as statistically robust weighted averages across the power spectra. The method is applied to amplitudes of brain oscillations measured with magnetoencephalography in resting state condition. We found for envelopes of the the alpha rhythm that fluctuations as a function of time scales in a double-logarithmic plot differ substantially from a linear relation for time scales below 10 seconds. In particular we will show that model selections fail to determine accurate scaling laws, and that standard parameter settings are likely to yield results depending on signal to noise ratios than on true long range temporal correlations.

Despite a low signal-to-noise ratio, evidence exists that it contains significant information about activity in local cortical networks. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we found high gamma activity when comparing data from an n-back working memory task to resting data in a large sample of normal volunteers. Initial analysis of power spectra from 0-back, 2-back, and rest trials showed three frequency bands exhibiting task-related differences: alpha, beta, and high gamma. Unlike alpha and beta, the high gamma spectrum was broad, without a peak at a single frequency. In addition, power in high gamma was highest for the 2-back and lowest during rest, while the opposite pattern occurred in the other bands. Beamformer source localization of each of the three frequency bands revealed a distinct set of sources for high gamma. These included several regions of prefrontal cortex that exhibited greater power when both n-back conditions were compared to rest. A subset of these regions had more power when the 2-back was compared to 0-back, which indicates a role in working memory performance. Our results show that high gamma will be important for understanding cortical processing during cognitive and other tasks. Furthermore, data from human intracortical recordings suggest that high gamma is the aggregate of spiking in local cortical networks, which implies that MEG could serve to bridge experimental modalities by noninvasively observing task-related modulation of spiking rates.

Progressive reduction of auditory evoked gamma in first episode schizophrenia but not clinical high risk individuals	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Clinical high risk; First episode schizophrenia; Gamma oscillation	GYRUS VOLUME REDUCTION; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; PLANUM TEMPORALE; BAND RESPONSE; HESCHL GYRUS; CORTEX; HALLUCINATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; MECHANISMS; DIVERSITY	The early auditory-evoked gamma band response (EAGBR) may serve as an index of the integrity of fast recurrent inhibition or synaptic connectivity in the auditory cortex, where abnormalities in individuals with schizophrenia have been consistently found. The EAGBR has been rarely investigated in first episode schizophrenia patients (FESZ) and individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia, and never been compared directly between these populations nor evaluated longitudinally. Here we examined the EAGBR in FESZ, CHR, and matched healthy controls (HC) at baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments to determine whether the EAGBR was affected in these clinical groups, and whether any EAGBR abnormalities changed over time. The electroencephalogram was recorded with a dense electrode array while subjects (18 FESZ, 18 CHR, and 40 HC) performed an auditory oddball task. Event-related spectral measures (phase locking factor [PLF] and evoked power) were computed on Morlet-wavelet-transformed single epochs from the standard trials. At baseline, EAGBR PIS and evoked power did not differ between groups. FESZ showed progressive reductions of PLF and evoked power from baseline to follow-up, and deficits in PLF at follow-up compared to HC. EAGBR peak frequency also increased at temporal sites in FESZ from baseline to follow-up. Longitudinal effects on the EAGBR were not found in CHR or HC, nor did these groups differ at follow-up. In conclusion, we detected neurophysiological changes of auditory cortex function in FESZ during a one-year period, which were not observed in CHR. These findings are discussed within the context of neurodevelopmental models of schizophrenia. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Synchronization of Autonomic and Cerebral Rhythms During Listening to Music: Effects of Tempo and Cognition of Songs	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Synchronization; Autonomic and cerebral rhythms; Tempo; Cognition; Music	RESPONSES; MOOD	A large number of studies document cardiorespiratory changes occurring while listening to music. Less is known, however, about the interaction between cardiorespiratory and cerebral electrical rhythms during listening to music and how cognition and acoustic structural aspects of songs influence that interaction. We focused on tempo as a structural feature of songs, since tempo is a major determinant of physiological responses to music, and on familiarity and randomization of phase of local spectra of known and unknown songs for cognition. Our results indicated an overall increase in the degree of synchronization among cardiorespiratory variables (Heart rate (RR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), respiration) and between cardiorespiratory and cerebral (EEG) oscillations during all songs. We also observed a marked decrease in respiratory frequency bandwidth and increase in respiratory rate while listening to songs, and slow song produced the most periodic breathing. Compared with slow tempo, during fast song, DBP and cerebral oscillations became less synchronized with high frequency components of RR suggesting that the processes causing the previously known reduction in vagal activity with increase in tempo also may have caused the decrease in these synchronizations. Cognition of songs affected the SBP coherencies the most. DBP was synchronized with respiration more than all other measured variables in response to auditory stimuli. Results indicate an overall increase in the degree of synchronization among a variety of cerebral electrical and autonomically driven cardiovascular rhythms. It is possible that this significant increase in synchronizations underlies the widely reported pleasurable and palliative effects of listening to music.	[Mollakazemi, M.

Working memory training integrates visual cortex into beta-band networks in congenitally blind individuals	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Congenitally blind; Functional connectivity; Oscillations; Training; Working memory	PERCEIVED STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; EEG; VOICE; AREAS; OSCILLATIONS	Congenitally blind individuals have been shown to activate the visual cortex during non-visual tasks. The neuronal mechanisms of such cross-modal activation are not fully understood. Here, we used an auditory working memory training paradigm in congenitally blind and in sighted adults. We hypothesized that the visual cortex gets integrated into auditory working memory networks, after these networks have been challenged by training. The spectral profile of functional networks was investigated which mediate cross-modal reorganization following visual deprivation. A training induced integration of visual cortex into task-related networks in congenitally blind individuals was expected to result in changes in long-range functional connectivity in the theta-, beta-and gamma band (imaginary coherency) between visual cortex and working memory networks. Magnetoencephalographic data were recorded in congenitally blind and sighted individuals during resting state as well as during a voice-based working memory task; the task was performed before and after working memory training with either auditory or tactile stimuli, or a control condition. Auditory working memory training strengthened theta-band (2.5-5 Hz) connectivity in the sighted and beta-band (17.5-22.5 Hz) connectivity in the blind. In sighted participants, theta-band connectivity increased between brain areas typically involved in auditory working memory (inferior frontal, superior temporal, insular cortex). In blind participants, beta-band networks largely emerged during the training, and connectivity increased between brain areas involved in auditory working memory and as predicted, the visual cortex. Our findings highlight long-range connectivity as a key mechanism of functional reorganization following congenital blindness, and provide new insights into the spectral characteristics of functional network connectivity.

Here we investigated how the human brain implements this dynamic process by adopting a reward-modulated Simon task while acquiring EEG and fMRI data in separate sessions. In the Simon task, a lateral target stimulus triggers an automatic response tendency of the spatially corresponding hand, which needs to be overcome if the activated hand is opposite to what the task requires, thereby delaying the response. We associated high or low reward with different targets, the location of which could be congruent or incongruent with the correct response hand. High-reward targets elicited larger Simon effects than low-reward targets, suggesting an increase in the automatic response tendency induced by the stimulus location. This tendency was accompanied by modulations of the lateralized readiness potential over the motor cortex, and was inhibited soon after if the high-reward targets were incongruent with the correct response hand. Moreover, this process was accompanied by enhanced theta oscillations in medial frontal cortex and enhanced activity in a frontobasal ganglia network. With dynamical causal modeling, we further demonstrated that the connection from presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) to right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) played a crucial role in modulating the reward-modulated response inhibition. Our results support a dynamic neural model of reward-induced response activation and inhibition, and shed light on the neural communication between reward and cognitive control in generating adaptive behaviors.

HFO are normally sub-divided according to their oscillating-frequency into Ripples (80-250 Hz) and Fast-Ripples (FR) (250-500 Hz) and are known to also occur in the non-epileptic brain. We address two challenges faced by HFO: firstly, estimating the margins of the EZ using the HFO occurrence-rate from each intracranial EEG channel; secondly, selecting HFO sub-groups with a higher probability of being purely epileptic. We propose the clustering of channels with high HFO occurrence-rates as a deterministic method to delimit the EZ. Additionally, we perform the EZ estimation using 9 sub-groups of HFO; these sub-groups are determined by their temporal and spatial coincidence with intracranial interictal-epileptic-spikes (IES) and are assumed to have varying levels of epileptogenicity. The EZ estimated with the different HFO-sub-groups are compared between themselves and with a proxy of the factually undefinable EZ, namely the resected-volume (RV). The proposed clustering method proved to be deterministic and allowed estimating the EZ for each patient and each HFO-sub-group. Those Ripples assumed to be more epileptogenic occurred in lower numbers than all Ripples but showed the highest correspondence with the RV. All FR sub-groups showed a high specificity to the RV. The proposed clustering method successfully extracted the information from the HFO occurrence-rate to estimate the EZ. The selection of more epileptogenic HFO based on their coincidence with IES proved to be of value for both Ripples and FR.

In the current study, we aimed to identify the frequency-dependent neural network dynamics during the offset of absence seizures. Methods: Fifteen drug-naive patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) were assessed with a 275-Channel Magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. MEG data were recorded during and between seizures at a sampling rate of 6,000 Hz and analyzed in seven frequency bands. Source localization was performed with accumulated source imaging. Granger causality analysis was used to evaluate effective connectivity networks of the entire brain at the source level. Results: At the low-frequency (1-80 Hz) bands, activities were predominantly distributed in the frontal cortical and parieto-occipito-temporal junction at the offset transition periods. The high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500 Hz) analysis indicated significant source localization in the medial frontal cortex and deep brain areas (mainly thalamus) during both the termination transition and interictal periods. Furthermore, an enhanced positive cortico-thalamic effective connectivity was observed around the discharge offset at all of the seven analyzed bands, the direction of which was primarily from various cortical regions to the thalamus. Conclusions: Seizure termination is a gradual process that involves both the cortices and the thalamus in CAE. Cortico-thalamic coupling is observed at the termination transition periods, and the cerebral cortex acts as the driving force.

In addition, olfactory impairment that usually develops before the detection of motor deficits, is detected in 90% of Parkinsonian patients. Recent studies in mammals, have shown that slow cortical potentials phase-lock with nasal respiration. In several cortical areas, gamma synchronization of the electrographic activity is also coupled to respiration, suggesting than nasal respiratory entrainment could have a role in the processing of olfactory information. In the present study, we evaluate the role of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, in the modulation of the electrocorticogram activity and its respiratory entrainment during wakefulness and sleep. For this purpose, we performed a unilateral lesion of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta of the rat, with 6-hydroxydopamine. An increase in beta (20-35 Hz) together with a decrease in gamma power (60-95 Hz) in the motor cortex ipsilateral to the lesion was observed during wakefulness. These results correlated with the degree of motor alterations and dopamine measured at the striatum. Moreover, we found a decline in gamma coherence between the ipsilateral olfactory bulb and motor cortex. Also, at the olfactory bulb we noticed an increase in respiratory-gamma cross-frequency coupling after the lesion, while at the motor cortex, a decrease in respiratory potential entrainment of gamma activity was observed. Interestingly, we did not observe any significant modification either during Non-REM or REM sleep. These waking dysrhythmias may play a role both in the anosmia and motor deficits present in Parkinson disease.

However, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) can also be involved. The aim of this research was to assess the sleep macro- and microstructure, the cardiac ANS during sleep, and the relationships between sleep, autonomic features, and clinical parameters in a cohort of ALS patients. Methods: Forty-two consecutive ALS patients underwent clinical evaluation and full-night video-polysomnography. Only 31 patients met inclusion criteria (absence of comorbidities, intake of cardioactive drugs, or recording artifacts) and were selected for assessment of sleep parameters, including cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) and heart rate variability (HRV). Subjective sleep quality and daytime vigilance were also assessed using specific questionnaires. Results: Although sleep was subjectively perceived as satisfactory, compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls, ALS patients showed significant sleep alteration: decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, increased nocturnal awakenings, inverted stage 1 (N1)/stage 3 (N3) ratio, reduced REM sleep, and decreased CAP rate, the latter supported by lower amounts of A phases with an inverted A1/A3 ratio. Moreover, a significant reduction in HRV parameters was observed during all sleep stages, indicative of impaired autonomic oscillations. Conclusion: Our results indicate that sleep is significantly disrupted in ALS patients despite its subjective perception. Moreover, electroencephalogram activity and autonomic functions are less reactive, as shown by a decreased CAP rate and a reduction in HRV features, reflecting an unbalanced autonomic modulation.

Slowing is slowing: Delayed neural responses to words are linked to abnormally slow resting state activity in primary progressive aphasia	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						PPA; MEG; Semantics; Slowing; Resting oscillations	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLUSTER-EXTENT; EEG; SPECTRUM; BRAIN; POWER; COMPREHENSION; LOCALIZATION	Neurodegenerative disorders are often characterized by neuronal "slowing," which may be assessed in different ways. In the present study, we examined the latency of neural responses to linguistic stimuli in participants diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), as well as changes in the power spectra of resting state activity, both measured with MEG. Compared to both age-matched and younger controls, patients with PPA showed a delayed latency of 8-30 Hz event-related desynchronization (ERD) in response to semantic anomalies. In addition, resting-state MEG revealed increased power in the lower frequency delta and theta bands, but decreased activity in the higher alpha and beta bands. The task-induced and spontaneous measures of neural dynamics were related, such that increased peak latencies in response to words were correlated with a shift of spontaneous oscillatory dynamics towards lower frequencies. In contrast, older controls showed similar task related ERD latencies as younger controls, but also "speeding" of spontaneous activity, i.e. a shift towards faster frequencies. In PPA patients both increased peak latencies on task and increased slow oscillations at rest were associated with less accurate performance on the language task and poorer performance on offline cognitive measures, beyond variance accounted for by structural atrophy. A mediation analysis indicated that increased theta power accounted for the relationship between delayed electrophysiological responses and reduced accuracy in PPA patients. These results indicate that the neuropathological changes in PPA result in slowing of both task-related and spontaneous neuronal activity, linked to functional decline, whereas the speeding of spontaneous activity in healthy aging seems to have a protective or compensatory effect.

This function has been studied extensively in the auditory and visual domains using various oddball paradigms, but only little exploration of this phenomenon has been done in the somatosensory domain. In this study, we explore how expectations of somatosensory stimulations are established and expressed in neural activity as measured with magnetoencephalography. Using tactile stimulations to the index finger, we compared conditions with actual stimulation to conditions with omitted stimulations, both of which were either expected or unexpected. Our results show that when a stimulation is expected but omitted, a time-locked response occurs similar to 135 ms subsequent to the expected stimulation. This somatosensory response to "nothing" was source localized to the secondary somatosensory cortex and to the insula. This provides novel evidence of the capability of the brain of millisecond time-keeping of somatosensory patterns across intervals of 3000 ms. Our results also show that when stimuli are repeated and expectations are established, there is associated activity in the theta and beta bands. These theta and beta band expressions of expectation were localized to the primary somatosensory area, inferior parietal cortex and cerebellum. Furthermore, there was gamma band activity in the right insula for the first stimulation after an omission, which indicates the detection of a new stimulation event after an expected pattern has been broken. Finally, our results show that cerebellum play a crucial role in predicting upcoming stimulation and in predicting when stimulation may begin again.

Human behaviour emerges from the modulation of spontaneous timely coordinated neuronal networks. Too little is known about the physical properties and neurophysiological underpinnings of music to understand its perception, its health benefit and to deploy personalized or standardized music-therapy. Prior studies revealed how macroscopic neuronal and music patterns scale with frequency according to a 1/f(alpha) relationship, where a is the scaling exponent. Here, we examine how this hallmark in music and neuronal dynamics relate to pleasure. Using electroencephalography, electrocardiography and behavioural data in healthy subjects, we show that music listening decreases the scaling exponent of neuronal activity and-in temporal areas-this change is linked to pleasure. Default-state scaling exponents of the most pleased individuals were higher and approached those found in music loudness fluctuations. Furthermore, the scaling in selective regions and timescales and the average heart rate were largely proportional to the scaling of the melody. The scaling behaviour of heartbeat and neuronal fluctuations were associated during music listening. Our results point to a 1/f resonance between brain and music and a temporal rescaling of neuronal activity in the temporal cortex as mechanisms underlying music appreciation.

The neural processes underlying mnemonic binding, however, are not fully understood. Moreover, although acute stress is known to modulate memory, if and how stress changes mnemonic integration across time and space is unknown. To elucidate these issues, we exposed participants to a stressor or a control manipulation shortly before they completed, while electroencephalography was recorded, an encoding task that systematically varied the demands for spatial and temporal integration. Associative memory was tested 24 h later. While early event-related potentials, including the P300 and Late Positive Component, distinguished different levels of spatiotemporal discontinuity, only later Slow Waves were linked to subsequent remembering. Furthermore, theta oscillations were specifically associated with successful mnemonic binding. Although acute stress per se left mnemonic integration largely unaffected, autonomic activity facilitated object memory and glucocorticoids enhanced detail memory, indicative for mnemonic integration. At the neural level, stress amplified the effects of spatiotemporal discontinuity on early information processing. Together, our results indicate that temporal and spatial gaps recruit early neural processes, providing attentional resources. The actual binding success, however, appears to depend on later processes as well as theta power and may be shaped by major stress response systems.

However, whether a brain can properly synchronize and produce a restorative sleep when it undergoes massive and widespread white matter damage is unknown. Here, we answer this question by testing 23 patients with various levels of white matter damage secondary to moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries (ages 18-56; 17 males, six females, 11-39 months post-injury) and compared them to 27 healthy subjects of similar age and sex. We used MRI and diffusion tensor imaging metrics (e.g. fractional anisotropy as well as mean, axial and radial diffusivities) to characterize voxel-wise white matter damage. We measured the following slow wave characteristics for all slow waves detected in N2 and N3 sleep stages: peak-to-peak amplitude, negative-to-positive slope, negative and positive phase durations, oscillation frequency, and slow wave density. Correlation analyses were performed in traumatic brain injury and control participants separately, with age as a covariate. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that greater white matter damage mainly over the frontal and temporal brain regions was strongly correlated with a pattern of higher neuronal synchrony characterized by slow waves of larger amplitudes and steeper negative-to-positive slopes during non-rapid eye movement sleep. The same pattern of associations with white matter damage was also observed with markers of high homeostatic sleep pressure. More specifically, higher white matter damage was associated with higher slow-wave activity power, as well as with more severe complaints of cognitive fatigue. These associations between white matter damage and sleep were found only in our traumatic brain injured participants, with no such correlation in controls. Our results suggest that, contrary to previous observations in healthy controls, white matter damage does not prevent the expected high cerebral synchrony during sleep. Moreover, our observations challenge the current line of hypotheses that white matter microstructure deterioration reduces cerebral synchrony during sleep. Our results showed that the relationship between white matter and the brain's ability to synchronize during sleep is neither linear nor simple.

However, largely due to technical and methodological challenges inherent in paediatric functional neuroimaging, there remains an important gap in our knowledge regarding the typical development of functional brain networks in "preschool" childhood (i.e., children younger than 6 years of age). In this study, we recorded brain oscillatory activity using age-appropriate magnetoencephalography in 24 children, including 14 preschool children aged from 4 to 6 years and 10 school children aged from 7 to 12 years. We compared the topology of the resting-state brain networks in these children, estimated using minimum spanning tree (MST) constructed from phase synchrony between beamformer-reconstructed time-series, with that of 24 adults. Our results show that during childhood the MST topology shifts from a star-like (centralised) toward a more line-like (de-centralised) configuration, indicating the functional brain networks become increasingly segregated. In addition, the increasing global network segregation is frequency-independent and accompanied by decreases in centrality (or connectedness) of cortical regions with age, especially in areas of the default mode network. We propose a heuristic MST model of "network space", which posits a clear developmental trajectory for the emergence of complex brain networks. Our results not only revealed topological reorganisation of functional networks across multiple temporal and spatial scales in childhood, but also fill a gap in the literature regarding neurophysiological mechanisms of functional brain maturation during the preschool years of childhood.

These different patterns of attentional beta modulation may be caused by feed-forward lateral inhibitory interactions in the visual cortex, activated solely during stimulus processing. To test this hypothesis, we developed a large-scale computational model of the cortical network. We first identified the parameter range needed to support beta rhythm generation, and next, simulated the different activity states corresponding to experimental paradigms. The model matched our experimental data in terms of spatial organization of beta correlations during different attentional states and provided a computational confirmation of the hypothesis that the paradigm-specific beta activation spatial maps depend on the lateral inhibitory mechanism.

To address the neurofeedback inefficacy problem, the present study is aimed to design and implement a new neurofeedback system that can more effectively and consistently regulate users' brain activities than the conventional way of training users to voluntarily regulate brain activities. The new neurofeedback system delivers external visual stimuli continuously at a specific alpha phase, which is real-time decoded from ongoing alpha wave, to regulate the alpha wave. Experimental results show that the proposed training-free externally-regulated neurofeedback (ER-NF) system can achieve consistent (effective in almost all sessions for almost all users), flexible (either increasing or decreasing peak alpha frequency and alpha power), and immediate (taking or losing effect immediately after stimulation is on or off) modulation effects on alpha wave. Therefore, the ER-NF system holds great potential to be able to more reliably and flexibly modulate cognition and behavior.

However, other statistics of the neuroimaging data may contain important information. Despite studies showing links between the variance in the BOLD time series (BV) and age and cognitive performance, a formal framework for testing these effects has not yet been developed. We introduce the variance design general linear model (VDGLM), a novel framework that facilitates the detection of variance effects. We designed the framework for general use in any fMRI study by modeling both mean and variance in BOLD activation as a function of experimental design. The flexibility of this approach allows the VDGLM to (a) simultaneously make inferences about a mean or variance effect while controlling for the other and (b) test for variance effects that could be associated with multiple conditions and/or noise regressors. We demonstrate the use of the VDGLM in a working memory application and show that engagement in a working memory task is associated with whole-brain decreases in BOLD variance.

For research it is of interest to find out how different requirements in attention tests affect physiological stress reactions. Objective The present pilot study examined the changes in heart rate variability (HRV) as a physiological stress response of the body to different attention requirements. In addition, the study aimed to clarify if the HRV is suitable as a physiological stress parameter to evaluate various attention requirements. Material and methods In addition to the objective stress parameter HRV, subjective stress using a Borg scale and objective performance data were recorded in 51 volunteers who completed 4 different attention tests. Results Many significant differences were found between the tests of the attention test battery and especially in the recovery phase for the HRV data. It was particularly noticeable that parasympathetically influenced HRV parameters of the time domain were invariably reduced under stress. In the continuous attention test and interference test, the parameters of subjective stress directly correlated with HRV parameters of the non-linear analysis and inversely correlated with frequency-related parameters. Correlations between the parameters could be determined. Conclusion There was an increased objective and subjective stress in the completion of the attention tests. This was influenced by the type of attention test. For further studies, it would be interesting to investigate the physiological correlates of attention, such as electroencephalograph (EEG) activity and HRV parameters simultaneously.

Neural and Attentional Correlates of Intrinsic Motivation Resulting from Social Performance Expectancy	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						intrinsic motivation; beta activity; reward positivity; attentional scope	SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY; POSITIVE AFFECT; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; BETA DESYNCHRONIZATION; BEHAVIORAL-APPROACH; EXTRINSIC REWARDS; MOTOR IMAGERY; FEEDBACK; OSCILLATIONS; INTENSITY	Some models of motivation distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. While past work has examined the neural and cognitive correlates of extrinsic motivation, research on intrinsic motivation has relied primarily on behavioral measures of performance and learning. In particular, no past work has examined the neural and cognitive correlates of social performance expectancy, which is linked to intrinsic motivation. The current study manipulated expectancy of difficult (vs. easy) trials on a cued flanker task and assessed attentional scope and performance. EEG was used to examine motor-action preparation as measured by suppression of beta band activity over the motor cortex and feedback processing as measured by the Reward Positivity (RewP). Results revealed expectancy of difficult (vs. easy) trials narrowed attentional scope, reduced beta activity over the motor cortex, and enhanced RewP amplitudes to win feedback. These findings suggest that enhancing intrinsic motivation through expectancies of positive social comparison engages similar neural and cognitive correlates as extrinsic motivators high in motivational intensity.

By averaging naming-related high-gamma activity at nonepileptic regions across a large number of patients, we provided the functional cortical atlases animating the neural dynamics supporting visual-object and auditory-description naming at the whole brain level. MethodsWe studied 79 patients who underwent extraoperative ECoG recording as epilepsy presurgical evaluation, and generated time-frequency plots and animation videos delineating the dynamics of naming-related high-gamma activity at 70-110 Hz. ResultsNaming task performance elicited high-gamma augmentation in domain-specific lower-order sensory areas and inferior-precentral gyri immediately after stimulus onset. High-gamma augmentation subsequently involved widespread neocortical networks with left hemisphere dominance. Left posterior temporal high-gamma augmentation at several hundred milliseconds before response onset exhibited a double dissociation; picture naming elicited high-gamma augmentation preferentially in regions medial to the inferior-temporal gyrus, whereas auditory naming elicited high-gamma augmentation more laterally. The left lateral prefrontal regions including Broca's area initially exhibited high-gamma suppression subsequently followed by high-gamma augmentation at several hundred milliseconds before response onset during both naming tasks. Early high-gamma suppression within Broca's area was more intense during picture compared to auditory naming. Subsequent lateral-prefrontal high-gamma augmentation was more intense during auditory compared to picture naming. SignificanceThis study revealed contrasting characteristics in the spatiotemporal dynamics of naming-related neural modulations between tasks. The dynamic atlases of visual and auditory language might be useful for planning of epilepsy surgery. Differential neural activation well explains some of the previously reported observations of domain-specific language impairments following resective epilepsy surgery. Video materials might be beneficial for the education of lay people about how the brain functions differentially during visual and auditory naming.

Methods: In this retrospective database study, all patients with PNES, who were investigated at Shiraz Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, from 2008 to 2018, were studied. Patients with concomitant epilepsy or abnormal Electroencephalogram (EEG) were not included. Results: Two hundred and seventy patients had the inclusion criteria; 162 patients (60%) were taking AEDs, and 108 (40%) were not taking any AEDs at the time of the diagnosis. Reporting auras (odds ratio: 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.301-0.952; p = 0.03), having ictal or postictal urinary incontinence (odds ratio: 3.86; 95% CI: 136-10.94; p = 0.01), reporting a dysfunctional family (odds ratio: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.002-3.072; p = 0.04), and a longer duration of the condition before the diagnosis (odds ratio: 1.057; 95% CI: 1.005-1.112; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with AED use; 63.7% of the cases were correctly predicted by the model that was generated by regression analysis (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Patients with PNES are at great risk of receiving unnecessary AEDs, and some patients' historical factors (e.g., urine incontinence) have a strong association with this practice.

Dynamics of functional connectivity in multilayer cortical brain network during sensory information processing	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS			English	Article							GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; ATTENTION; FEEDBACK; RHYTHMS; BETA	Topology of a functional brain multilayer network is dynamically adjusted to provide optimal performance during accomplishing cognitive tasks, including sensory information processing. Functional connectivity between brain regions is achieved in terms of correlation or synchronization inference in recorded signals of neuronal activity. The promising approach for studying cortical network structure implies considering functional interactions in different frequency bands on the different layers of multilayer network model. Links between these layers can be restored based on cross-frequency couplings. While the topology of functional connectivity within each layer can be effectively restored from registered neurophysiological signals, mechanisms underlying coupling between different layers remain poorly understood. Here we consider evolution of the cortical network topology in alpha and beta frequency bands during visual stimuli processing. For each frequency band the functional connectivity between different brain regions is estimated by comparing Fourier spectra of EEG signals. The obtained functional topologies are considered as the layers of two-layer network. In the framework of a multilayer model we analyze evolution of functional network topology on both layers and reveal features of intralayer interaction underlying visual information processing in the brain.

If conscious processing interacts with the information stored and available in WM, and if access to consciousness is a necessary condition for certain information to be able to be retained in WM, then certain correlates, mechanisms and neural codes could be shared. In this review and opinion article, the role in conscious perception and WM of a distributed activity in a fronto-parietal cortical network and the synchronized oscillatory activity of neuronal populations in different frequency bands and at different spatial scales is examined. Although conscious access and the first phases of information encoding share part of their neural codes, the retention of information in WM in a particular state could involve additional codes. At the end of the article it is suggested that a neural phase code, the theta-gamma code, could be the mechanism implemented by a global neuronal workspace to encode conscious contents and retain information in WM.

The interactive nature of this conference was embodied by 25 workshops covering topics in BCI (also called brain-machine interface) research. Workshops covered foundational topics such as hardware development and signal analysis algorithms, new and imaginative topics such as BCI for virtual reality and multi-brain BCIs, and translational topics such as clinical applications and ethical assumptions of BCI development. BCI research is expanding in the diversity of applications and populations for whom those applications are being developed. BCI applications are moving toward clinical readiness as researchers struggle with the practical considerations to make sure that BCI translational efforts will be successful. This paper summarizes each workshop, providing an overview of the topic of discussion, references for additional information, and identifying future issues for research and development that resulted from the interactions and discussion at the workshop.

If conscious processing interacts with the information stored and available in WM, and if access to consciousness is a necessary condition for certain information to be able to be retained in WM, then certain correlates, mechanisms and neural codes could be shared. In this review and opinion article, the role in conscious perception and WM of a distributed activity in a fronto-parietal cortical network and the synchronized oscillatory activity of neuronal populations in different frequency bands and at different spatial scales is examined. Although conscious access and the first phases of information encoding share part of their neural codes, the retention of information in WM in a particular state could involve additional codes. At the end of the article it is suggested that a neural phase code, the theta-gamma code, could be the mechanism implemented by a global neuronal workspace to encode conscious contents and retain information in WM.

The transformation of a part of the children to develop into a malignant course with different degree of residual cognitive loss, through compromising sleep plastic functions, by the epileptic discharges during sleep, beside pure genetic origin, is still under research. Both factual data and new conceptual approaches helps understand better the developmental childhood epilepsies.

The contribution of this paper is the use of the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method to incorporate a kinetic model of synaptic transmission mediated by the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (ACh) into a neural mass model of the thalamocortical circuitry, thereby imitating brainstem inputs to the thalamus. The result is a model of the thalamocortical oscillations as observed in electroencephalogram (EEG), firstly by introducing ACh into the existing model and secondly by varying synaptic parameters of the cholinergic pathway. Results show that embedding cholinergic input to the existing thalamocortical model leads to a change in postsynaptic voltages in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, as compared to the postsynaptic voltages without cholinergic input. In addition, it is observed that varying the cholinergic input to the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus (TRN) cell population around basal values deals with bifurcation in the model behaviour, implicating the crucial role of brainstem inputs to the TRN. This may underpin neural correlates of visuomotor deficiencies, which is a potential biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Using the concept of SPM, we developed a novel technique for quantification of the statistical deviation of an intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) measure from the nonepileptic mean. We validated this technique using data previously collected from 123 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent resective epilepsy surgery. We determined how the measurement of statistical deviation of modulation index (MI) from the non-epileptic mean (rated by z-score) improved the performance of seizure outcome classification model solely based on conventional clinical, seizure onset zone (SOZ), and neuroimaging variables. Here, MI is a summary measure quantifying the strength of in-situ coupling between high-frequency activity at >150 Hz and slow wave at 3-4 Hz. We initially generated a normative MI atlas showing the mean and standard deviation of slow-wave sleep MI of neighboring non-epileptic channels of 47 patients, whose ECoG sampling involved all four lobes. We then calculated 'MI z-score' at each electrode site. SOZ had a greater `MI z-score' compared to non-SOZ in the remaining 76 patients. Subsequent multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis to the combined data of all patients revealed that the full regression model incorporating all predictor variables, including SOZ and `MI z-score', best classified the seizure outcome with sensitivity/specificity of 0.86/0.76. The model excluding `MI z-score' worsened its sensitivity/specificity to 0.86/0.48. Furthermore, the leave-one-out analysis successfully cross-validated the full regression model. Measurement of statistical deviation of MI from the non-epileptic mean on invasive recording is technically feasible. Our analytical technique can be used to evaluate the utility of ECoG biomarkers in epilepsy presurgical evaluation.

This study introduces a computational framework exploiting existing generative models for a novel time-resolved quantification of causal brain-heart interplay. Exemplarily, having electroencephalographic signals and heart rate variability series as inputs, respective synthetic data models are coupled through parametrised functions defined in accordance with current central autonomic network (CAN) knowledge. We validate this concept using data from 30 healthy volunteers undergoing notable sympathetic elicitation through a cold-pressor test, and further compare the obtained results with a state-of-the-art method as maximal information coefficient. Although our findings are in agreement with previous CAN findings, we report new insights into the role of fronto-parietal region activity and lateralisation mechanisms over the temporal cortices during prolonged peripheral elicitation, which occur with specific time delays. Additionally, the afferent autonomic outflow maps to brain oscillations in the and bands, whereas complementary cortical dynamics in the , , and bands act on efferent autonomic control. The proposed framework paves the way towards novel biomarker definitions for the assessment of complex physiological networks using existing data generation models for brain and peripheral dynamics.

Localization of Expressive Language Cortex in a 2-Year-Old Child Using High-Gamma Electrocorticography	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						presurgical language mapping; high-gamma modulation; intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG); cortical stimulation mapping (CSM)	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CORTICAL STIMULATION; FMRI; OSCILLATIONS; RESECTION; SPEECH; TMS	Cortical stimulation mapping is the gold standard for presurgical language mapping; however, it cannot be reliably performed in very young patients. Language mapping using noninvasive modalities is also challenging in very young patients. Although utility of language mapping using power of high-gamma in electrocorticographic recordings was demonstrated in adults and older children, there is a gap of knowledge in the ability of this procedure for localizing language-specific cortex in very young patients. We describe a case of a 2-year-old patient who, to our knowledge, is the youngest person to undergo successful high-gamma electrocorticographic presurgical language mapping for localization of the expressive language cortex (Broca area). The surgical plan was to resect a cortical tuber within the left inferior frontal gyrus and there was a strong concern about postoperative language deficit after resection. Presurgical language mapping using noninvasive modalities were attempted without success. Cortical stimulation mapping was not feasible in this patient. Therefore, high-gamma electrocorticography was the only viable option for language mapping, and it successfully localized the expressive language cortex. The patient underwent surgery for resection of the IFG tuber based on results of high-gamma electrocorticography and had no postoperative language deficit. High-gamma electrocorticography can be used for localizing language-specific cortex, especially Broca's area, in very young patients.

For greater elucidation, a study in a nonepileptic rat model was previously conducted and showed that rapid-cycle (RC) VNS achieved superior desynchrony compared to standard-cycle (SC) VNS. Here, the authors report on the first in-human analysis of the neuromodulatory dose-response effects of VNS in a patient with posttraumatic, independent, bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy refractory to medications and SC-VNS who was referred as a potential candidate for a responsive neurostimulation device. During stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings, the VNS device was initially turned off, then changed to SC-VNS and then RC-VNS settings. Spectral analysis revealed a global reduction of power in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-15 Hz) bands with both SC- and RC-VNS compared to the stimulation off setting (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in the alpha band, both SC- and RC-VNS were associated with greater global desynchrony compared to the off setting (p < 0.001); and, specifically, in the bilateral epileptogenic hippocampi, RC-VNS further reduced spectral power compared to SC-VNS (p < 0.001). The dose-response and temporal effects suggest that VNS modulates regional and global dynamics differently.

Here, we investigated the theta (7-9 Hz) coherence of the right frontoparietal networks to explore the differences in connectivity changes for the right frontoparietal regions during spatial attention (i.e., attention to a specific location rather than a specific feature) and nonspatial attention (i.e., attention to a specific feature rather than a specific location) tasks. The theta coherence in both tasks was primarily maintained at a preparatory state, decreases after stimulus onset, and recovers to the level of the preparatory state after the response time. However, the theta coherence of the frontoparietal network during spatial attention was immediately maintained after cue-onset, whereas for the case of nonspatial attention, it was immediately decreased after cue-onset. In addition, the connectivity of the right frontoparietal network, including the middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobe, were significantly higher for spatial attention rather than for nonspatial attention, suggesting that the dorsal parts of right frontoparietal network are more engaged in spatial-specific attention from the preparatory state. These findings also suggest that these two attention systems involve the use of different regional connectivity patterns, not only in the cognitive state, but in the preparatory state as well.

B. longum 1714 (TM) has previously been shown to attenuate cortisol output and stress responses in healthy subjects exposed to an acute stressor. However, the ability of B. longum 1714 (TM) to modulate brain function in humans is unclear. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, the effects of B. longum 1714 (TM) on neural responses to social stress, induced by the "Cyberball game," a standardized social stress paradigm, were studied. Forty healthy volunteers received either B. longum 1714 (TM) or placebo for 4 weeks at a dose of 1 x 10(9) cfu/d. Brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography and health status using the 36-item short-form health survey. RESULTS: B. longum 1714 (TM) altered resting-state neural oscillations, with an increase in theta band power in the frontal and cingulate cortex (P < 0.05) and a decrease in beta-3 band in the hippocampus, fusiform, and temporal cortex (P < 0.05), both of which were associated with subjective vitality changes. All groups showed increased social stress after a 4-week intervention without an effect at behavioral level due to small sample numbers. However, only B. longum 1714 (TM) altered neural oscillation after social stress, with increased theta and alpha band power in the frontal and cingulate cortex (P < 0.05) and supramarginal gyrus (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: B. longum 1714 (TM) modulated resting neural activity that correlated with enhanced vitality and reduced mental fatigue. Furthermore, B. longum 1714 (TM) modulated neural responses during social stress, which may be involved in the activation of brain coping centers to counter-regulate negative emotions.

Slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS) during slow wave sleep has no effects on declarative memory in healthy young subjects	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Sleep-dependent memory consolidation; Slow oscillations; Feedback; Transcranial electrical stimulation	CONSOLIDATION; SPINDLES; MODEL	Background: The manipulation of specific brain oscillations by applying transcranial electrical stimulation techniques in order to enhance memory processes during sleep has become an intriguing field of research. A seminal study found a positive effect of slow-oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS) on sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories. Since then several studies have tried to replicate this result with inconsistent findings. Objective/Hypothesis: This study aimed to reexamine effects of so-tDCS on declarative memory observed in young participants based on a previously described stimulation protocol used in elderly subjects. Methods: 23 healthy participants (mean +/- SD: 23.2 +/- 1.9 years; 13 women) completed a word-pair test and a sequential finger tapping test before and after sleep. Participants received anodal so-tDCS bifrontaly at a frequency of 0.75 Hz or sham stimulation during NREM sleep N2, following a double-blind, placebo controlled, counterbalanced, randomized crossover design. Data were analyzed with respect to possible effects of stimulation on memory performances, sleep staging, spindle densities and EEG power in eight frequency bands. Results: Stimulation had no significant effect on sleep dependent memory consolidation or on sleep macro- and microstructure. Independent of stimulation, procedural memory performances increased and declarative memory performances decreased overnight. This decline was less pronounced when participants had more than one learning opportunity. Fast parietal but not slow frontal spindle densities diminished from baseline to stimulation-free intervals under both stimulation conditions. Conclusion: The present study could not reproduce the results of the seminal study in young subjects, but it is consistent with results observed in elderly subjects using the same protocol. Irrespective of stimulation, re-encoding opportunities in the word-pair test had an impact on memory strength and retrieval performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Growing evidence suggests that these therapeutic effects are dependent on the frequency and phase synchrony between SN oscillations and stimulation as well as the task-specific state of the SN during stimulation. However, the development of phase-synchronized non-invasive stimulation has proved challenging until recently. Here, we use a phase-locked pulsed brain stimulation approach to study the effects of two NIBS methods: transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) versus phase-locked transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), on the SN during an SN activating task. 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Each volunteer partook in four sessions, receiving one stimulation type at random (theta-tACS, peak tPCS, trough tPCS or sham) while undergoing a learning game, followed by an unstimulated test based on learned material. Each session lasted approximately 1.5 h, with an interval of at least 2 days to allow for washout and to avoid cross-over effects. Our results showed no statistically significant effect of stimulation on the event related potential (ERP) recordings, resting electroencephalogram (EEG), and the performance of the volunteers. While stimulation effects were not apparent in this study, the nominal performance of the phase-locking algorithm offers a technical foundation for further research in determining effective stimulation paradigms and conditions. Specifically, future work should investigate stronger stimulation and true task-specific stimulation of SN nodes responsible for the task as well as their recording. If refined, NIBS could offer an effective, homebased treatment option.

Early glioma is associated with abnormal electrical events in cortical cultures	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Glioma; Brain tumor; Glial injury; Gliosis; Neuronal synchronization	GLIAL-CELLS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; STATE; MECHANISMS	The prodromal stages of some neurological diseases have a distinct electrical profile which can potentially be leveraged for early diagnosis, predicting disease recurrence, monitoring of disease progression, and better understanding of the disease pathology. Gliomas are tumors that originate from glial cells present in the brain and spinal cord. Healthy glial cells support normal neuronal function and play an important role in modulating the regular electrical activity of neurons. However, gliomas can disrupt the normal electrical dynamics of the brain. Though experimental and clinical studies suggest that glioma and injury to glial cells disrupt electrical dynamics of the brain, whether these disruptions are present during the earliest stages of glioma and glial injury are unclear. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of early in vitro glial pathology (glioma and glial injury in specific) on neuronal electrical activity. In particular, we investigated the effect of glial pathology on neural synchronization: an important phenomenon that underlies several central neurophysiological processes (ScienceDirect, 2018 ). We used two in vitro disease samples: (a) a sample in which cortical cultures were treated with anti-mitotic agents that deplete glial cells and (b) a glioma sample in which healthy cortical cells were cultured with CRL-2303 (an aggressive glioma cell line). Healthy cortical culture samples were used as controls. Cultures were established over a glass dish embedded with microelectrodes that permits simultaneous measurement of extracellular electrical activity from multiple sites of the culture. We observed that healthy cortical cultures produce spontaneous and synchronized oscillations which were attenuated in the absence of glial cells. The presence of glioma was associated with the emergence of two types of abnormal electrical activity each with distinct amplitude and frequency profile. Our results indicate that even early stages of glioma and glial injury are associated with distinct changes in neuronal electrical activity.	[Savarra, Jude P.

This provides a generative or dynamic causal model of laminar specific responses that can generate haemodynamic and electrophysiological measurements. In principle, this allows the fusion of haemodynamic and (event related or induced) electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, it enables Bayesian model comparison of competing hypotheses about physiologically plausible synaptic effects; for example, does attentional modulation act on superficial or deep pyramidal cells - or both? In this technical note, we describe the resulting dynamic causal model and provide an illustrative application to the attention to visual motion dataset used in previous papers. Our focus here is on how to answer long-standing questions in fMRI; for example, do haemodynamic responses reflect extrinsic (afferent) input from distant cortical regions, or do they reflect intrinsic (recurrent) neuronal activity? To what extent do inhibitory interneurons contribute to neurovascular coupling? What is the relationship between haemodynamic responses and the frequency of induced neuronal activity? This paper does not pretend to answer these questions; rather it shows how they can be addressed using neural mass models of fMRI timeseries.	[Friston, K.

J	Verbeke, P; Verguts, T				Verbeke, Pieter; Verguts, Tom			Learning to synchronize: How biological agents can couple neural task modules for dealing with the stability-plasticity dilemma	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; DECISION-MAKING; FRONTAL THETA; SYSTEMS; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS; ACCOUNT	We provide a novel computational framework on how biological and artificial agents can learn to flexibly couple and decouple neural task modules for cognitive processing. In this way, they can address the stability-plasticity dilemma. For this purpose, we combine two prominent computational neuroscience principles, namely Binding by Synchrony and Reinforcement Learning. The model learns to synchronize task-relevant modules, while also learning to desynchronize currently task-irrelevant modules. As a result, old (but currently task-irrelevant) information is protected from overwriting (stability) while new information can be learned quickly in currently task-relevant modules (plasticity). We combine learning to synchronize with task modules that learn via one of several classical learning algorithms (Rescorla-Wagner, backpropagation, Boltzmann machines). The resulting combined model is tested on a reversal learning paradigm where it must learn to switch between three different task rules. We demonstrate that our combined model has significant computational advantages over the original network without synchrony, in terms of both stability and plasticity. Importantly, the resulting models' processing dynamics are also consistent with empirical data and provide empirically testable hypotheses for future MEG/EEG studies.

The mechanisms associated with the increased female susceptibility to depression remain poorly characterized. Aberrant neuronal oscillatory activity within the putative depression network is an emerging mechanism underlying MDD. However, innate sex differences in network activity and its contribution to depression vulnerability have not been well described. In this review, current evidence of sex differences in neuronal oscillatory activity, including the influence of sex hormones and female cycling, will first be described followed by evidence of disrupted neuronal circuit function in MDD and the effects of antidepressant treatment. Lastly, current knowledge of sex differences in MDD-associated aberrant circuit function and oscillatory activity will be highlighted, with an emphasis on the role of sex steroids and female cycling. Collectively, it is clear that there are significant gaps in the literature regarding innate and pathologically associated sex differences in network activity and that the elucidation of these differences is invaluable to our understanding of sex-specific vulnerabilities and therapies for MDD.

When attempting to anticipate, researchers have identified that at least two broad sources of information are used: contextual information relating to the situation in question; and biological motion from postural cues. However, the neural correlates associated with the processing of these different sources of information across groups varying in expertise has yet to be examined empirically. We compared anticipation performance and electrophysiological activity in groups of expert (n = 12) and novice (n = 15) performers using a video-based task. Participants made anticipation judgements after being presented information under three conditions: contextual information only; kinematic information only; and both sources of information combined. The experts responded more accurately across all three conditions. Stronger alpha event-related desynchronization over occipital and frontocentral sites occurred in experts compared to the novices when anticipating. The experts relied on stronger preparatory attentional mechanisms when they processed contextual information. When kinematic information was available, the domain specific motor representations built up over many years of practice likely underpinned expertise. Our findings have implications for those interested in identifying and subsequently, enhancing the neural mechanisms involved in anticipation.

During MI, the mu rhythmical oscillation of cortical neurons is the event-related desynchronization (ERD) subserving the physiological basis of MI-based brain-computer interface. In our work, we investigated the specific brain network reconfiguration from rest idle to MI task states, and also probed the underlying relationship between the brain network reconfiguration and MI related ERD. Findings revealed that comparing to rest state, the MI showed the enhanced motor area related linkages and the deactivated activity of default mode network. In addition, the reconfigured network index was closely related to the ERDs, i.e., the higher the reconfigured network index was, the more obvious the ERDs were. These findings consistently implied that the reconfiguration from rest to task states underlaid the reallocation of related brain resources, and the efficient brain reconfiguration corresponded to a better MI performance, which provided the new insights into understanding the mechanism of MI as well as the potential biomarker to evaluate the rehabilitation quality for those patients with deficits of motor function.

J	Hutchinson, BT				Hutchinson, Brendan T.			Toward a theory of consciousness: A review of the neural correlates of inattentional blindness	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Inattentional blindness; Consciousness; Review; Neuroimaging; Brain activity; EEG; fMRI; Attention; Awareness; Visual awareness negativity; p300; Global neuronal workspace; Recurrent processing	TEXTURE SEGMENTATION; WORKING-MEMORY; TEMPORAL RESOLUTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL AWARENESS; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; TOP-DOWN; ATTENTION; CORTEX; BRAIN	The neuroscientific study of consciousness involves examining candidate markers of consciousness under conditions where awareness varies. One such method for manipulating awareness is inattentional blindness. Whereas other methods of studying consciousness have been reviewed elsewhere, there has been little effort toward cataloguing work which has studied inattentional blindness using neuroscientific methodology. I address this by reviewing this body of literature, with key importance placed on how research informs a neuroscience of consciousness and the degree to which visual processing occurs in the absence of attention and awareness. Findings demonstrate clear evidence that processing up to intermediate stages (e.g. visual features, orthographic processing) occurs, even during inattentional blindness. The most commonly observed neurophysiological correlates associated with awareness include the visual awareness negativity and post-stimulus alpha suppression, whereas neuroanatomical markers include the lateral occipital cortex, the temporoparietal junction, and the intraparietal sulcus. I conclude by addressing the limitations this literature has been challenged with and offer recommendations for how future work on inattentional blindness can aid in advancing neuroscientific theories of consciousness.

In contrast to stimulation between 13 and 17 Hz, stimulation above 30 Hz is considered less annoying and diminishes the risk of epileptic seizures. However, high-frequency BCIs usually feature slow processing speed and accuracy rates which reduces user satisfaction. We investigate the re-test stability of resonance frequencies between 30 and 50 Hz in 18 participants over a period of 40 days, including seven consecutive runs. Aim is to determine individual resonance profiles for recurring BCI usage that make time-consuming calibration phases no longer necessary. Preliminary findings of a clinical sample are reported as well. Results indicate that seven of nine frequencies fail to repeatedly induce stable responses. However, stimulation with 32 and 40 Hz induced strong and recurring SSVEP in the vast majorities of trials. Consequently, high-frequency based BCI usage will continue to presuppose individual calibration. Apart from this, since 40 Hz oscillations are suggested to play a key role in various brain functions, it is reasonable to assume pronounced cortical reactions to 32 Hz to also constitute a neuronal oscillator that is functional active during cognitive processing.

Furthermore rhythmic tones are processed more efficiently than temporally random tones ('timing effect'), and this effect is increased when participants actively synchronize their motor performance with the rhythm of the tones, resulting in auditory-motor synchronization. Here, we investigated whether this applies also to sequences of linguistic stimuli (syllables). We compared temporally irregular syllable sequences with two temporally regular conditions where either the interval between syllable onsets (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA) or the interval between the syllables' vowel onsets was kept constant. Entrainment to the stimulus presentation frequency (1 Hz) and event-related potentials were assessed in 24 adults who were instructed to detect pre-defined deviant syllables while they either pedaled or sat still on a stationary exercise bike. We found larger 1 Hz entrainment and P300 amplitudes for the SOA presentation during motor activity. Furthermore, the magnitude of the P300 component correlated with the motor variability in the SOA condition and 1 Hz entrainment, while in turn 1 Hz entrainment correlated with auditory-motor synchronization performance. These findings demonstrate that acute auditory-motor coupling facilitates phonetic encoding. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multiple short-lived states of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) identified transiently synchronized networks and cross-network integration. However, little is known about the way brain couplings covary as rsFC states wax and wane. In this magnetoencephalography study, we explore the synchronization structure among the spontaneous interactions of well-known resting-state networks (RSNs). To do so, we extracted modes of dynamic coupling that reflect rsFC synchrony and analyzed their spatio-temporal features. These modes identified transient, sporadic rsFC changes characterized by the widespread integration of RSNs across the brain, most prominently in the beta band. This is in line with the metastable rsFC state model of resting-state dynamics, wherein our modes fit as state transition processes. Furthermore, the default-mode network (DMN) stood out as being structured into competitive cross-network couplings with widespread DMN-RSN interactions, especially among the beta-band modes. These results substantiate the theory that the DMN is a core network enabling dynamic global brain integration in the beta band.

For word production, the network includes a ventral pathway, connecting temporal and inferior frontal regions, and a dorsal pathway, connecting parietal and frontal regions. Despite the importance of word production for scientific and clinical purposes, the functional connectivity underlying this task has received relatively limited attention, and mostly from techniques limited in either spatial or temporal resolution. Here, we exploited data obtained from depth intra-cerebral electrodes stereotactically implanted in eight epileptic patients. The signal was recorded directly from various structures of the neocortex with high spatial and temporal resolution. The neurophysiological activity elicited by a picture naming task was analyzed in the time-frequency domain (10-150 Hz), and functional connectivity between brain areas among ten regions of interest was examined. Task related-activities detected within a network of the regions of interest were consistent with findings in the literature, showing task-evoked desynchronization in the beta band and synchronization in the gamma band. Surprisingly, long-range functional connectivity was not particularly stronger in the beta than in the high-gamma band. The latter revealed meaningful sub-networks involving, notably, the temporal pole and the inferior frontal gyrus (ventral pathway), and parietal regions and inferior frontal gyrus (dorsal pathway). These findings are consistent with the hypothesized network, but were not detected in every patient. Further research will have to explore their robustness with larger samples.

This transition state, which is known as the intermediate state (IS), is well-defined in rats but poorly characterized in cats. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that cholinergic stimulation of the perilocus coeruleus alpha nucleus (PLC alpha) in the pontine tegmentum of cats induced two states: wakefulness with muscle atonia and a state of dissociated sleep we have called the SPGO state. The SPGO state has characteristics in common with the IS, such including the presence of ponto-geniculooccipital waves (PGO) and EEG synchronization with delta wave reduction. Therefore, the aims of the present study were (1) to characterize the IS in the cat and, (2), to study the analogy between the SPGO and the different sleep stages showing PGO activity, including the IS. Polygraphic recordings of 10 cats were used. In seven cats carbachol microinjections (20-30 nL, 0.01-0.1 M) were delivered in the PLC alpha. In the different states, PGO waves were analyzed and power spectra obtained for the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands of the EEG from the frontal and occipital cortices, and for the theta hippocampal band. Statistical comparisons were made between the values obtained from the different states. The results indicate that the IS constitutes a state with characteristics that are distinct from both the preceding SWS and the following REM sleep, and that SPGO presents a high analogy with the IS. Therefore, the SPGO state induced by administering carbachol in the PLC alpha nucleus seems to be an expression of the physiological IS of the cat. Consequently, we propose that the PLC alpha region, besides being involved in the mechanisms of muscle atonia, may also be responsible for organizing the transition from SWS to REM sleep.

Defects in the GRIN2A gene, encoding the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs, cause slow-wave sleep (SWS)-related disorders of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum (EAS). The as-yet poorly understood developmental sequence of early EAS-related phenotypes, and the role of GluN2A-containing NMDARs in the development of SWS and associated electroencephalographic (EEG) activity patterns, were investigated in Grin2a knockout (KO) mice. Methods: Early social communication was investigated by ultrasonic vocalization (USV) recordings; the relationship of electrical activity of the cerebral cortex with SWS was studied using deep local field potential or chronic EEG recordings at various postnatal stages. Results: Grin2a KO pups displayed altered USV and increased occurrence of high-voltage spindles. The pattern of slow-wave activity induced by low-dose isoflurane was altered in Grin2a KO mice in the 3rd postnatal week and at 1 month of age. These alterations included strong suppression of the delta oscillation power and an increase in the occurrence of the spike-wave bursts. The proportion of SWS and the sleep quality were transiently reduced in Grin2a KO mice aged 1 month but recovered by the age of 2 months. Grin2a KO mice also displayed spontaneous spike-wave discharges, which occurred nearly exclusively during SWS, at 1 and 2 months of age. Significance: The impaired vocal communication, the spike-wave discharges occurring almost exclusively in SWS, and the age-dependent alteration of SWS that were all seen in Grin2a KO mice matched the sleep-related and age-dependent manifestations seen in children with EAS, hence validating the Grin2a KO as a reliable model of EAS disorders. Our data also show that GluN2A-containing NMDARs are involved in slow-wave activity, and that the period of postnatal brain development (postnatal day 30) when several anomalies peaked might be critical for GluN2A-dependent, sleep-related physiological and pathological processes.

Both the international TSC consensus conference in 2012, and the panel of European experts in 2012 and 2018 have concluded that surgery should be considered for medically refractory TSC patients. However, surgery remains currently underutilized in TSC. Case series, meta-analyses and guidelines all agree that a 50 to 60% chance of long-term seizure freedom can be achieved after surgery in TSC patients and a presurgical work-up should be done as early as possible after failure of two appropriate AEDs. The presence of infantile spasms, the second most common seizure type in TSC, had initially been a barrier to surgical planning but is now no longer considered a contraindication for surgery in TSC patients. TSC patients undergoing presurgical evaluation range from those with few tubers and good anatomo-electro-clinical correlations to patients with a significant "tuber burden" in whom the limits of the epileptogenic zone is much more difficult to define. Direct surgery is often possible in patients with a good electro-clinical and MRI correlation. For more complex cases, invasive monitoring is often mandatory and bilateral investigations can be necessary. Multiple non-invasive tools have been shown to be helpful in determining the placement of these invasive electrodes and in planning the resection scheme. Additionally, at an individual level, multimodality imaging can assist in identifying the epileptogenic zone. Increased availability of investigations that can be performed without sedation in young and/or cognitively impaired children such as MEG and HR EEG would most probably be of great benefit in the TSC population. Of those selected for invasive EEG, rates of seizure freedom following surgery are close to cases where invasive monitoring is not required, strengthening the important and efficient role of intracranial investigations in drug-resistant TSC associated epilepsy.

Although CDBS has been in use for a long time, very little has been reported on its supposed effects on cognition, particularly in relation to implants in the subthalamic nucleus. The results of the rare studies that do exist are controversial, and in many cases the studies have several design flaws. The present study compared cortical activation during three tasks (action execution, action observation and motor imagery) in PD patients with and without subthalamic implants. The study sample consisted of 36 volunteers, divided into three groups: healthy controls, PD patients with CDBS of the subthalamic nucleus, and PD patients without CDBS. Through a quantitative electroencephalogram assessment, absolute beta power was examined to observe the interaction between group and cognitive motor tasks. The electrodes at sites Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8, F3, Fz and F4, located in the prefrontal and frontal regions, were analyzed and a Group x Task interaction (p < 0.05) was observed for all of them. These findings suggest that CDBS of the subthalamic nucleus is efficient in reducing some of the effects of PD in these study tasks. At the same time, the dysfunctions found in several cortical areas, characteristic of PD, limited the effects of the CDBS. The results of this study suggest that CDBS of the subthalamic nucleus can modulate cognitive-motor aspects of PD.

Theta/delta coupling across cortical laminae contributes to semantic cognition	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cross-frequency coupling; delta rhythm; semantic processing; theta rhythm	THETA OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONS; MEMORY; LOCALIZATION; HIPPOCAMPUS	Rhythmic activity in populations of neurons is associated with cognitive and motor function. Our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these core brain functions has benefitted from demonstrations of cellular, synaptic, and network phenomena, leading to the generation of discrete rhythms at the local network level. However, discrete frequencies of rhythmic activity rarely occur alone. Despite this, little is known about why multiple rhythms are generated together or what mechanisms underlie their interaction to promote brain function. One overarching theory is that different temporal scales of rhythmic activity correspond to communication between brain regions separated by different spatial scales. To test this, we quantified the cross-frequency interactions between two dominant rhythms-theta and delta activity-manifested during magnetoencephalography recordings of subjects performing a word-pair semantic decision task. Semantic processing has been suggested to involve the formation of functional links between anatomically disparate neuronal populations over a range of spatial scales, and a distributed network was manifest in the profile of theta-delta coupling seen. Furthermore, differences in the pattern of theta-delta coupling significantly correlated with semantic outcome. Using an established experimental model of concurrent delta and theta rhythms in neocortex, we show that these outcome-dependent dynamics could be reproduced in a manner determined by the strength of cholinergic neuromodulation. Theta-delta coupling correlated with discrete neuronal activity motifs segregated by the cortical layer, neuronal intrinsic properties, and long-range axonal targets. Thus, the model suggested that local, interlaminar neocortical theta-delta coupling may serve to coordinate both cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical computations during distributed network activity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we show, for the first time, that a network of spatially distributed brain regions can be revealed by cross-frequency coupling between delta and theta frequencies in subjects using magnetoencephalography recording during a semantic decision task. A biological model of this cross-frequency coupling suggested an interlaminar, cell-specific division of labor within the neocortex may serve to route the flow of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical information to promote such spatially distributed, functional networks.

A number of studies have explored the effect of complexity and subsequently noted down the differences in performance. However, a few studies explored complexity (in the term of angular disparity) and cognitive strategies with respect to correct responses only. In contrast, the present study investigated frontal alpha desynchronization with reference to the complexity and proportions of correct and incorrect responses. Behavioral and neurophysiological responses were investigated to understand the switching between strategies (Analytic vs. Holistic). Results showed longer response time with respect to increased complexity. Frontal alpha desynchronization increased for difficult trials and incorrect responses, suggesting a higher utilization of cognitive resources at the frontal region during the MR task. Higher left frontal desynchronization reflected a trading off between strategies for difficult trials. Taken together, these findings suggest that the effect of stimuli complexity is more nuanced than implied by a simple hemispheric dichotomy for frontal cortex and discuss possible future directions to better understand the multitudinous brain mechanisms involved in MR.

Here, we adopt a novel computational method for examining potential similarities in high-dimensional brain imaging data between siblings. We examine oscillatory brain activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 201 healthy siblings and apply Bayesian reduced-rank regression to extract a low-dimensional representation of familial features in the participants' spectral power structure. Our results show that the structure of the overall spectral power at 1-90Hz is a highly conspicuous feature that not only relates siblings to each other but also has very high consistency within participants' own data, irrespective of the exact experimental state of the participant. The analysis is extended by seeking genetic associations for low-dimensional descriptions of the oscillatory brain activity. The observed variability in the MEG spectral power structure was associated with SDK1 (sidekick cell adhesion molecule 1) and suggestively with several other genes that function, for example, in brain development. The current results highlight the potential of sophisticated computational methods in combining molecular and neuroimaging levels for exploring brain functions, even for high-dimensional data limited to a few hundred participants.

However, the neural mechanism of this type of intention has not been investigated in detail. The main purpose of this study was to investigate cortical processing of the yes/no intentions to answer self-referential questions. Multichannel electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded while covertly answering self-referential questions with either yes or no. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and interregional phase synchrony (PS) were investigated to identify the differences in local and global neural synchronies between two intentions. We found that the local and interregional neural synchronies in the alpha-band were significantly different between yes and no, especially at the period of retaining the intention in mind, which was greater for no than for yes. These results can be interpreted to signify that a higher cognitive load during working memory retention or higher attentional demand is required for the no intention compared to yes. Our findings suggest that both local and global neural synchronies in the alpha-band may be significantly differentiated during a critical temporal epoch, according to the contents of the mental representation of the intention.

However, a FR is generated by a small patch of cortical tissue. Spatial sampling with standard electrodes may thus miss clinically relevant information. Methods: We analyzed FR rates in the intraoperative ECoG of 22 patients that underwent resective epilepsy surgery. We used standard electrodes with 10 mm inter-contact spacing (standard ECoG) in 14 surgeries and high-density grid electrodes with 5 mm spacing (hd-ECoG) in 8 surgeries. We detected FR using a previously validated automatic detector. Results: Postoperative seizure freedom was achieved in 14/22 (64%) cases. Across all 42 ECoG recordings, FR rates were higher for hd-ECoG than for standard ECoG. In the 14 seizure free patients (ILAE 1), no residual FR were detected (specificity = 100%). In the 8 patients with seizure recurrence (ILAE > 1), residual FR were detected in 1/7 standard ECoG and 1/1 hd-ECoG (Accuracy ACC(standard)( ECoG) = 57%, CI [29% 82%], ACC(hd-ECoG) = 100%, CI [63% 100%]). Conclusion: Denser spatial sampling by hd-ECoG improved FR detection compared to standard ECoG. Significance: Hd-ECoG may advance seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery.

In this work, we investigate whether the phasic functional connectivity patterns from short- and long-range attention networks can predict the tonic performance in a long Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), Pre-trial phase synchrony indices (PSIs) from individual experiment blocks are used as features for assessment of the proposed aerage cumulative vigilance score (CVS) and hit response time (HRT). Deep neural networks (DNNs) with the mean-squared error (MSE) loss function outperformed the ones with meanabsolute-error (MAE) in 4-fold cross-validations. PSI features from the 16-20 Hz beta sub-band obtained the lowest RAISE of 0.043 and highest correlation of 0.806 for predicting the average CVS, and the alpha oscillation PSIs resulted in an RMSE of 51,91 ms and a correlation of 0.903 for predicting the mean HRT. The proposed system can be used for monitoring performance of users susceptible to hypo- or hyper-vigilance and the subsequent system adaptation without implemented eye trackers. To the best of our knowledge, functional connectivity features in general and phase locking values in particular have not been used for regression models of vigilance variations with neural networks.

However, evidence in support of embodied semantics-in particular the hypothesised contribution of motor and premotor cortex to the representation of action concepts - is varied. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, consistent with semantic embodiment, sensorimotor cortices will rapidly become active while healthy participants access the meaning of visually-presented motor and non-motor action verbs. Event-related potentials revealed early differential processing of motor and non-motor verbs (164-203 ms) within distinct regions of cortex likely reflecting rapid cortical activation of differentially distributed semantic representations. However, we found no evidence for a specific role of sensorimotor cortices in supporting these representations. Moreover, we observed a later modulation of the alpha band (8-12 Hz) from 555-785 ms over central electrodes, with estimated generators within the left superior parietal lobule, which may reflect post-lexical activation of the object-directed features of the motor action concepts. In conclusion, we find no evidence for a specific role of sensorimotor cortices when healthy participants judge the meaning of visually-presented action verbs. However, the relative contribution of sensorimotor cortices to action comprehension may vary as a function of task goals.

Here, EEG signals elicited by visual and tactile stimuli were recorded while adult participants with and without probable DCD (pDCD) performed a motor task. The task cued reaching movements towards a location in visible peripersonal space as well as an area of unseen personal space. Event-related potentials elicited by visual and tactile stimuli revealed that visual processing was strongly affected by movement preparation in the pDCD group, even more than in controls. However, in contrast to the controls, tactile processing in unseen space was unaffected by movement preparation in the pDCD group. The selective use of sensory information from vision and proprioception is fundamental for the adaptive control of movements, and these findings suggest that this is impaired in DCD. Additionally, the pDCD group showed attenuated motor rhythms (beta: 13-30 Hz) over sensorimotor regions following cues to prepare movements towards unseen personal space. The results reveal that individuals with pDCD exhibit differences in the neural mechanisms of spatial selection and action preparation compared to controls, which may underpin the sustained difficulties they experience. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms potentially disrupted in this highly prevalent disorder.

The present study used a time-frequency approach to investigate the temporal dynamics of event-related changes in alpha power during passive viewing of emotional pictures in individuals with dysphoria (n = 23) and in individuals without dysphoria (n = 24). In the whole group, the processing of pleasant and unpleasant compared to neutral pictures was associated with a decrease in event-related alpha power (i.e., alpha desynchronization) at centro-parietal and parietal scalp sites in the 538-1400 ms post-stimulus. The group with dysphoria revealed a smaller alpha desynchronization than the group without dysphoria in response to pleasant, but not neutral and unpleasant, stimuli at frontal, fronto-central and centro-parietal sites. Interestingly, at central and centro-parietal scalp sites, the difference between groups in response to pleasant stimuli was lateralized to the right hemisphere, whereas no clear lateralization was observed at frontal and fronto-central scalp sites. These findings suggest that decreased cortical activity (i.e., reduced alpha desynchronization) in a network involving bilateral frontal and right-lateralized parietal regions may provide a specific measure of deficits in approach-related motivation in depression.

Excessive synchronization can, however, lead to focal epileptiform activity characterized by interictal and ictal discharges in epileptic patients and animal models. This review focusses on studies that have addressed epileptiform synchronization in temporal lobe regions by employing in vitro and in vivo recording techniques. First, we consider the role of ionotropic and metabotropic excitatory glutamatergic transmission in seizure generation as well as the paradoxical role of GABA(A) signaling in initiating and perhaps maintaining focal seizure activity. Second, we address non-synaptic mechanisms (which include voltage-gated ionic currents and gap junctions) in the generation of epilepti form synchronization. For each mechanism, we discuss the actions of anti-epileptic drugs that are presumably modulating excitatory or inhibitory signaling and voltage-gated currents to prevent seizures in epileptic patients. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of seizure initiation and maintenance, thus leading to the development of specific pharmacological treatments for focal epileptic disorders.

Impaired hippocampal-cortical coupling but preserved local synchrony during sleep in APP/PS1 mice modeling Alzheimer's disease	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; AMYLOID DEPOSITION; MOUSE MODEL; MEMORY; CORTEX	Sleep, in addition to its brain restorative processes, plays an important role in memory transfer from its temporary store in the hippocampus to the more permanent storage in the neocortex. Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects memory and sleep. The aim of this study was to explore disturbances in global and local synchrony patterns between brain regions in the APP/PS1 mouse model of the AD during natural sleep. We used 8 male APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and 6 wild-type littermates, aged 5-6 months, with multiple electrode bundles implanted into cortical regions, thalamus and hippocampus. We measured video-EEG in freely moving animals and analyzed synchrony during NREM vs REM sleep. Global synchrony between medial frontal cortex and hippocampus measured with magnitude-squared coherence was slightly decreased in delta range during NREM stage of sleep in APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, local hippocampal synchrony measured with cross-frequency coupling remained intact. Ripple structure or frequency did not differ between the genotypes. However, the coupling of the spindle-band power peak in the medial prefrontal cortex to hippocampal ripples was significantly decreased compared to wild-type animals. The delicate timing of hippocampal ripples, frontal delta, and corticothalamic spindle oscillations may be the first sign of impaired memory in amyloid plaque-forming transgenic mice.

This contrasts with emotional stimulus processing, which thus far has yielded a complex and ambiguous pattern of findings. To further advance understanding, the present study examined emotional stimulus processing in the context of task variations and baseline activity, which included several manipulation checks as well as internal replication of findings across conditions. Participants (N = 16) viewed erotic and romantic pictures, differing in stimulus arousal. Pictures were presented briefly (120 ms), and intertrial interval was systematically varied (similar to 1 vs. similar to 8 s). In one condition, participants passively viewed the pictures, in the other, they performed an active picture categorization task. The processing of erotic compared to romantic images was associated with a decrease in power in the alpha and lower beta band in posterior and anterior sensor clusters between 600-1,000 ms poststimulus. The finding was robust and confirmed across conditions, different quantifications, and independent from baseline activity. Furthermore, key findings regarding explicit task effects as well as ERPs sensitive to emotional arousal were replicated. Results are discussed with respect to the hypothesis that alpha- and lower beta-band activity may reflect cortical activation associated with emotional stimulus significance.

Electromagnetic radiation modulates synchronization in cortical neurons of Macaque brain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Synchronization; neural system; electromagnetic field; memristor coupling; CoCoMac; cortical neurons; selective attention; high gamma activity	GENERALIZED SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL; CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SIGNAL; NOISE	We study dynamical synchronization in a model of a neural system representing 47 cortical regions of Macaque brain under the effect of an electromagnetic field. This system is constituted by local networks of densely interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Coupling between the local networks is introduced through sparsely distributed excitatory connectivity. Voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels determine the neural dynamics of the networks. The effect of electromagnetic field on the neural system is studied by modulating magnetic flux on the membrane potential using memristor coupling. With the application of electromagnetic field and the modulation of long-range synaptic coupling, the system easily makes transition to synchronization. It is found that the threshold for synchrony between coupled local networks is lowered by the applied electromagnetic field. Also, electromagnetic field causes the neural subsystems to make low amplitude oscillations with an approximate frequency of 130 Hz. This indicates that electromagnetic field gives rise to high-gamma activity in the cortical regions of the brain which increases selective attention. This may facilitate adaptive brain function by giving rise to a rich collection of dynamics and contribute to the origin of complex patterns observed in the EEG.

However, most past studies on auditory spatial attention used impoverished spatial cues: presenting competing sounds to different ears, using only interaural differences in time (ITDs) and/or intensity (IIDs), or using non-individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Here we tested the hypothesis that impoverished spatial cues impair spatial auditory attention by only weakly engaging relevant cortical networks. Eighteen normal-hearing listeners reported the content of one of two competing syllable streams simulated at roughly +30 degrees and -30 degrees azimuth. The competing streams consisted of syllables from two different-sex talkers. Spatialization was based on natural spatial cues (individualized HRTFs), individualized IIDs, or generic ITDs. We measured behavioral performance as well as electroencephalographic markers of selective attention. Behaviorally, subjects recalled target streams most accurately with natural cues. Neurally, spatial attention significantly modulated early evoked sensory response magnitudes only for natural cues, not in conditions using only ITDs or IIDs. Consistent with this, parietal oscillatory power in the alpha band (8-14 Hz; associated with filtering out distracting events from unattended directions) showed significantly less attentional modulation with isolated spatial cues than with natural cues. Our findings support the hypothesis that spatial selective attention networks are only partially engaged by impoverished spatial auditory cues. These results not only suggest that studies using unnatural spatial cues underestimate the neural effects of spatial auditory attention, they also illustrate the importance of preserving natural spatial cues in assistive listening devices to support robust attentional control.

Sphingosine Kinase 2 Potentiates Amyloid Deposition but Protects against Hippocampal Volume Loss and Demyelination in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; myelin; neuroprotection; oligodendrocyte; sphingosine 1-phosphate; sphingosine kinase	PRECURSOR PROTEIN; WHITE-MATTER; MICE LACKING; TAU; SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; INVOLVEMENT; MYELINATION; EXPRESSION	Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent vasculoprotective and neuroprotective signaling lipid, synthesized primarily by sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) in the brain. We have reported pronounced loss of S1P and SK2 activity early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and an inverse correlation between hippocampal S1P levels and age in females, leading us to speculate that loss of S1P is a sensitizing influence for AD. Paradoxically, SK2 was reported to mediate amyloid beta (A beta) formation from amyloid precursor protein (APP) in vitro. To determine whether loss of S1P sensitizes to A beta-mediated neurodegeneration, we investigated whether SK2 deficiency worsens pathology and memory in male J20 (PDGFB-APP(SwInd)) mice. SK2 deficiency greatly reduced A beta content in J20 mice, associated with significant improvements in epileptiform activity and cross-frequency coupling measured by hippocampal electroencephalography. However, several key measures of APP(SwInd)-dependent neurodegeneration were enhanced on the SK2-null background, despite reduced A beta burden. These included hippocampal volume loss, oligodendrocyte attrition and myelin loss, and impaired performance in Y-maze and social novelty memory tests. Inhibition of the endosomal cholesterol exporter NPC1 greatly reduced sphingosine phosphorylation in glial cells, linking loss of SK2 activity and S1P in AD to perturbed endosomal lipid metabolism. Our findings establish SK2 as an important endogenous regulator of both APP processing to A beta, and oligodendrocyte survival, in vivo.

Spontaneous Variation in Electrocorticographic Resting-State Connectivity	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						electrocorticography; spontaneous variations; synchrony	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; FMRI; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	Prior studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography have observed both structured patterns in resting-state functional connectivity and spontaneous longitudinal variation in connectivity patterns independent of a task. In this first study using electrocorticography (ECoG), we characterized spontaneous, intersession variation in resting-state functional connectivity not linked to a task. We evaluated pairwise connectivity between electrodes using three measures (phase locking value [PLV], amplitude correlation, and coherence) for six canonical frequency bands, capturing different characteristics of time-evolving signals. We grouped electrodes into 10 functional regions and used intraclass correlation (ICC) to estimate pairwise longitudinal stability. We found that stronger PLV (PLV >= 0.4) in theta through gamma bands and strong correlation in all bands (R-2's >= 0.6) are linked to substantial stability (ICC >= 0.6), but that stability does not imply strong phase locking or amplitude correlation. There was no notable link between strong coherence and high ICC. All within-region PLVs are markedly stable across frequencies. In addition, we highlight interaction patterns across several regions: parahippocampal/entorhinal cortex is characterized by stable, weak functional connectivity except self-connections. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity is weak and unstable, except self-connections. Inferior parietal lobule has little stability despite narrow connectivity bounds. We confirm prior studies linking functional connectivity strength and intersession variability, extending into higher frequencies than other modalities, with greater spatial specificity than scalp electrophysiology. We suggest further studies quantitatively compare ECoG to other modalities and/or use these findings as a baseline to capture functional connectivity and dynamics linked to perturbations with a task or disease state.

Alpha desynchronization during simple working memory unmasks pathological aging in cognitively healthy individuals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SPECTRAL ENTROPY; NEURAL EFFICIENCY; BAND ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; CONNECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; THETA; DEFICITS	Our aim is to explore if cognitive challenge combined with objective physiology can reveal abnormal frontal alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD), in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to investigate brain activities during N-back working memory (WM) processing at two different load conditions (N = 0 or 2) in an aging cohort. We studied 60-100 year old participants, with normal cognition, and who fits one of two subgroups from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins: cognitively healthy (CH) with normal amyloid/tau ratio (CH-NAT, n = 10) or pathological amyloid/tau ratio (CH-PAT, n = 14). We recorded behavioral performances, and analyzed alpha power and alpha spectral entropy (SE) at three occasions: during the resting state, and at event-related desynchronization (ERD) [250 similar to 750 ms] during 0-back and 2-back. During 0-back WM testing, the behavioral performance was similar between the two groups, however, qEEG notably differentiated CH-PATs from CH-NATs on the simple, 0-back testing: Alpha ERD decreased from baseline only in the parietal region in CH-NATs, while it decreased in all brain regions in CH-PATs. Alpha SE did not change in CH-NATs, but was increased from baseline in the CH-PATs in frontal and left lateral regions (p<0.01), and was higher in the frontal region (p<0.01) of CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. The alpha ERD and SE analyses suggest there is frontal lobe dysfunction during WM processing in the CH-PAT stage. Additional power and correlations with behavioral performance were also explored. This study provide pilot information to further evaluate whether this biomarker has clinical significance.

Some previous studies using low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have proven of benefit in ASD children. Methods In this study, 32 children (26 males and six females) with low-function autism were enrolled, 16 children (three females and 13 males; mean +/- SD age: 7.8 +/- 2.1 years) received rTMS treatment twice every week, while the remaining 16 children (three females and 13 males; mean +/- SD age: 7.2 +/- 1.6 years) served as waitlist group. This study investigated the effects of rTMS on brain activity and behavioral response in the autistic children. Results Peak alpha frequency (PAF) is an electroencephalographic measure of cognitive preparedness and might be a neural marker of cognitive function for the autism. Coherence is one way to assess the brain functional connectivity of ASD children, which has proven abnormal in previous studies. The results showed significant increases in the PAF at the frontal region, the left temporal region, the right temporal region and the occipital region and a significant increase of alpha coherence between the central region and the right temporal region. Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores were also compared before and after receiving rTMS with positive effects shown on behavior. Conclusion These findings supported our hypothesis by demonstration of positive effects of combined rTMS neurotherapy in active treatment group as compared to the waitlist group, as the rTMS group showed significant improvements in behavioral and functional outcomes as compared to the waitlist group.

As such, there is a pressing need to better understand and investigate the mechanisms underpinning these non-motor deficits. The electrical activity within the brains of people with Parkinson's disease is known to exhibit excessive power within the beta range (12-30 Hz), compared with healthy controls. The weight of evidence suggests that this abnormally high level of beta power is the cause of bradykinesia and rigidity in Parkinson's disease. However, less is known about how the abnormal beta rhythms seen in Parkinson's disease impact on non-motor symptoms. In healthy adults, beta power decreases are necessary for successful episodic memory formation, with greater power decreases during the encoding phase predicting which words will subsequently be remembered. Given the raised levels of beta activity in people with Parkinson's disease, we hypothesized that the necessary decrease in power during memory encoding would be diminished and that this would interfere with episodic memory formation. Accordingly, we conducted a cross-sectional, laboratory-based experimental study to investigate whether there was a direct relationship between decreased beta modulation and memory formation in Parkinson's disease. Electroencephalography recordings were made during an established memory-encoding paradigm to examine brain activity in a cohort of adults with Parkinson's disease (N = 28, 20 males) and age-matched controls (N = 31, 18 males). The participants with Parkinson's disease were aged 6566 years, with an average disease duration of 664 years, and tested on their normal medications to avoid the confound of exacerbated motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease participants showed impaired memory strength (P = 0.023) and reduced beta power decreases (P = 0.014) relative to controls. Longer disease duration was correlated with a larger reduction in beta modulation during encoding, and a concomitant reduction in memory performance. The inability to sufficiently decrease beta activity during semantic processing makes it a likely candidate to be the central neural mechanism underlying this type of memory deficit in Parkinson's disease. These novel results extend the notion that pathological beta activity is causally implicated in the motor and (lesser appreciated) non-motor deficits inherent to Parkinson's disease. These findings provide important empirical evidence that should be considered in the development of intelligent next-generation therapies.

J	Ssentongo, P				Ssentongo, Paddy			Prevalence and incidence of new-onset seizures and epilepsy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): Systematic review and meta-analysis	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						New-onset seizures; HIV/AIDS; Incidence; Meta-analysis; Prevalence	TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; COTE-DIVOIRE; INFECTION; PROPHYLAXIS; MORTALITY; COTRIMOXAZOLE; MORBIDITY; CHILDREN	Background: The prevalence and incidence of seizures are substantially higher in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared with the general population and is associated with higher mortality rates. Despite this, the condition remains poorly understood, and there is variation in reported epidemiological studies. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the risk factors associated with seizures in the population with HIV, explore the source of variations, and describe management plans that can aid clinicians in the acute and long-term treatment of these patients. Methods: A structured electronic database search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library was conducted. Studies were included if they described clinical details of patients with HIV with seizures or epilepsy. We extracted select variables from each included study, and we estimated pooled estimates of the incidence and prevalence of seizures using random-effects meta-analysis of proportions. Results: Information on 6639 cases of patients with HIV was extracted from 9 included studies. These comprised of 2 studies from the United States of America (USA), 3 from Europe, 3 from Asia, and 1 from Africa. The pooled prevalence and incidence rate of seizures in HIV were 62 per 1000 population and 60 per 1000 population respectively. Among those who presented with new-onset seizures, 63% had seizure recurrence. At the time of first seizure, 82.3% had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Factors that appeared to be linked to seizures in HIV included advanced HIV disease, opportunistic infections particularly toxoplasmosis, and metabolic derangement. Most seizures were effectively controlled by common antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Conclusions: The prevalence and incidence of seizures and epilepsy in the population with HIV are substantially higher than the general population. Our results suggest that advanced HIV and opportunistic infections are associated with the majority of the seizures. Early initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), prophylactic use of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and routine electroencephalogram (EEG) in patients with HIV may reduce seizure incidence and frequency and help in early diagnosis of nonconvulsive seizures in this population. We recommend long-term seizure management with AED, and for patients on HAART, enzyme-inducing AED should be avoided when possible. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Welfare assessment of novel on-farm killing methods for poultry	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CERVICAL DISLOCATION; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; BLUNT TRAUMA; CAPTIVE BOLT; BRAIN; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INSENSIBILITY; SEVOFLURANE; SLAUGHTER	There is a need for novel mechanical devices for dispatching poultry on farm following the introduction of EU Regulation (EC) no. 1099/2009 On the Protection of Animals at the Time of Killing. We examined three novel mechanical killing devices: Modified Armadillo, Modified Rabbit Zinger, a novel mechanical cervical dislocation device; and traditional manual cervical dislocation. The four killing methods were tested on 230 chickens across four batches. We measured behavioural, electroencephalogram and post-mortem outcomes in anesthetized laying hens and broilers at two life stages (juveniles and adults/slaughter age). Graeco Latin-Square designs systematically randomized killing treatment, bird type, age and kill order. All birds were lightly anaesthetized immediately prior to the killing treatment with inhalation of Sevoflurane. The novel mechanical cervical dislocation method had the highest kill success rate (single application attempt only, with no signs of recovery) of a mechanical method (96%). The Modified Armadillo was the least reliable with 49% kill success. Spectral analysis of electroencephalogram signals at 2 s intervals for successfully killed birds only revealed progressive decreases in median frequency alongside increases in total power. Later, total power decreased as the birds exhibited isoelectric electroencephalogram signal. Latencies to pre-defined spectral ranges associated with unconsciousness showed that birds subjected to manual and novel mechanical cervical dislocation achieved these states sooner than birds subjected to the modified Armadillo. Nevertheless all methods exhibited short latencies (<4 s). The Modified Rabbit Zinger had the shortest duration of reflex persistence for nictitating membrane, pupillary and rhythmic breathing post method application. Of the methods tested, the novel mechanical cervical dislocation device is the most promising mechanical method for killing poultry on-farm based on a range of behavioural, electroencephalogram and anatomical parameters.

It has also been suggested that adequate anesthesia produced by administration of chloral hydrate, ketamine, or halothane significantly reduces the GABAergic neuronal firing rate within the VTA. However, the exact effects on GABAergic neurons in the VTA and the mechanisms through which these neurons modulate anesthesia through associated neural circuits is still unclear. Here, we used optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to specifically activate or inhibit GABAergic neuronal perikarya in the VTA or their projections to the LH in Vgat-Cre mice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analyses and burst suppression ratio (BSR) calculations were conducted following administration of 0.8 or 1.0% isoflurane, respectively; and loss of righting reflex (LORR), recovery of righting reflex (RORR), and anesthesia sensitivity were assessed under 1.4% isoflurane anesthesia. The results showed that activation of GABAergic neurons in the VTA increased delta wave power from 40.0 to 46.4% (P = 0.006) and decreased gamma wave power from 15.2 to 11.5% (P = 0.017) during anesthesia maintenance. BSR was increased from 51.8 to 68.3% (P = 0.017). Induction time (LORR) was reduced from 333 to 290 s (P = 0.019), whereas arousal time (RORR) was prolonged from 498 to 661 s (P = 0.007). Conversely, inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons led to opposite effects. In contrast, optical activation of VTA-LH GABAergic projection neurons increased power of slow delta waves from 44.2 to 48.8% (P = 0.014) and decreased that of gamma oscillations from 10.2 to 8.0%. BSR was increased from 39.9 to 60.2% (P = 0.0002). LORR was reduced from 330 to 232 s (P = 0.002), and RORR increased from 396 to 565 s (P = 0.007). Optical inhibition of the projection neurons caused opposite effects in terms of both the EEG spectrum and the BSR, except that inhibition of this projection did not accelerate arousal time. These results indicate that VTA GABAergic neurons could facilitate the anesthetic effects of isoflurane during induction and maintenance while postponing anesthetic recovery, at least partially, through modulation of their projections to the LH.

J	Engel, J				Engel, Jerome, Jr.			Evolution of concepts in epilepsy surgery	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Review						history; epilepsy surgery; ILAE; EEG; neuroimaging; neuropsychological testing	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DRUG-RESISTANT EPILEPSY; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; THERMAL ABLATION; ILAE COMMISSION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TASK-FORCE	At the time of the first meeting of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) in 1909, surgical treatment for epilepsy had been accepted as an alternative therapy for over two decades, but was rarely practiced, considered a last resort for carefully selected patients. Localization was based on ictal semiology and identification of a structural lesion. Very few papers on epilepsy surgery were presented at ILAE meetings or published in Epilepsia during the first half of the 20(th) century. A modest explosion in interest in epilepsy surgery at mid-century resulted from recognition that "invisible" epileptogenic lesions could be identified by EEG, especially for temporal lobe epilepsy. Epilepsy surgery received a second boost in popularity toward the end of the 20(th) century with the advent of structural and functional neuroimaging, and the number of epilepsy centers worldwide doubled between the first Palm Desert conference in 1986 and the second Palm Desert conference in 1992. Neuroimaging also helped to increase application of surgical treatment to infants and young children with severe epilepsies. Epilepsy surgery was accepted as standard of care for drug-resistant focal epilepsy and was well-represented at international ILAE congresses and in Epilepsia. Advances continue into the 21(st) century with the introduction of laser ablation, and palliative neuromodulation approaches, which have greatly increased the population of patients who can benefit from surgery. Modern presurgical evaluation techniques have also made surgical treatment possible in many countries with limited resources. Three randomized control trials now have definitively proved the safety and efficacy of epilepsy surgery, however, this alternative therapy remains under-utilized even in the industrialized world, where less than 1% of potential candidates are being referred to epilepsy centers. Furthermore, those who are referred receive surgery an average of 20 years after onset of epilepsy, often too late to avoid irreversible disability. The major challenges in realizing the full potential of epilepsy surgery, therefore, are not as much in the continued improvement of the treatment itself, as they are in addressing the treatment gap that is preventing appropriate patients from being referred to full-service epilepsy centers.

To this end, electroencephalographic hyperscanning was used to study brain-to-brain phase synchronization during a two person turn-taking verbal exchange with no visual contact, in either a native or a foreign language context. Results show that the coupling strength between brain signals is increased in both, the native language context and the foreign language context, specifically, in the alpha frequency band. A difference in brain-to speech entrainment to native and foreign languages is also shown. These results indicate that between brain similarities in the timing of neural activations and their spatial distributions change depending on the language code used. We argue that factors like linguistic alignment, joint attention and brain-entrainment to speech operate with a language-idiosyncratic neural configuration, modulating the alignment of neural activity between speakers and listeners. Other possible factors leading to the differential interbrain synchronization patterns as well as the potential features of brain-to-brain entrainment as a mechanism are briefly discussed. We concluded that linguistic context should be considered when addressing interpersonal communication. The findings here open doors to quantifying linguistic interactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

White dreams are typically interpreted as forgotten dreams, and are sidelined as not being particularly informative with regard to the nature of dreaming. In this review article, we propose a paradigm shift with respect to the status of white dreams arguing that focusing on this phenomenon can reveal fundamental insights about the neural processes that occur in the dreaming brain. As part of this paradigm shift, we propose a novel interpretation of what white dreams are. This new interpretation is made possible by recent advancements in three different though interrelated fields focusing on dreaming, mental imagery, and wakeful perception. In this paper, we bring these different threads together to show how the latest findings from these fields fit together and point towards a general framework regarding the neural underpinnings of conscious experiences that might turn out to be highly relevant not just for dream research but for all aspects of studying consciousness.

Neural Evidence of Superior Memory: How to Capture Brain Activities of Encoding Processes Underlying Superior Memory	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						superior memory; event-related potentials; protocol analysis; memory training; digit-span	DELTA BAND ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; DIGIT MEMORY; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMPONENTS; RETRIEVAL; DYNAMICS	Relatively little attention has been paid to the neural basis of superior memory despite its potential in providing important insight into efforts to improve memory in the general population or to offset age-related cognitive decline. The current study reports a rare opportunity to reproduce and isolate specific neural activities directly associated with exceptional memory. To capture the brain processes responsible for superior memory, we returned to a laboratory task and analytic approach used to explore the nature of exceptional memory, namely, digit-span task combined with verbal protocol analysis. One participant with average memory received approximately 50 h of digit-span training and the participant's digit-span increased from normative (8 digits) to exceptional (30 digits). Event-related potentials were recorded while the participant's digit span increased from 19 to 30 digits. Protocol analysis allowed us to identify direct behavioral indices of idiosyncratic encoding processes underlying the superior memory performance. EEG indices directly corresponding to the behavioral indices of encoding processes were identified. The results suggest that the early attention-related encoding processes were reflected in theta and delta whereas the later attention-independent encoding processes were reflected in time-domain slow-wave. This fine-grained approach offers new insights into studying neural mechanism mediating superior memory and the cognitive effort necessary to develop it.

In particular, localization of the generators of neural oscillations is very important in the study of cognitive processes in the healthy and in the pathological brain. New method: We introduce the use of a Bayesian multi-dipole localization method in the frequency domain. Given the Fourier Transform of the data at one or multiple frequencies and/or trials, the algorithm approximates numerically the posterior distribution with Monte Carlo techniques. Results: We use synthetic data to show that the proposed method behaves well under a wide range of experimental conditions, including low signal-to-noise ratios and correlated sources. We use dipole clusters to mimic the effect of extended sources. In addition, we test the algorithm on real MEG data to confirm its feasibility. Comparison with existing method(s): Throughout the whole study, DICS (Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources) is used systematically as a benchmark. The two methods provide similar general pictures; the posterior distributions of the Bayesian approach contain much richer information at the price of a higher computational cost. Conclusions: The Bayesian method described in this paper represents a reliable approach for localization of multiple dipoles in the frequency domain.

J	Jiang, HT; Tian, S; Bi, K; Lu, Q; Yao, ZJ				Jiang, Haiteng; Tian, Shui; Bi, Kun; Lu, Qing; Yao, Zhijian			Hyperactive frontolimbic and frontocentral resting-state gamma connectivity in major depressive disorder	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL RESPONSE; EEG; AMYGDALA; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; NETWORKS; PATTERN; CIRCUITS	Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a system-level disorder affecting multiple functionally integrated cerebral networks. Nevertheless, their temporospatial organization and potential disturbance remain mostly unknown. The present report tested the hypothesis that deficient temporospatial network organization separates MDD and healthy controls (HC), and is linked to symptom severity of the disorder. Methods: Eyes-closed resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings were obtained from twenty-two MDD and twenty-two HC subjects. Beamforming source localization and functional connectivity analysis were applied to identify frequency-specific network interactions. Then, a novel virtual cortical resection approach was used to pinpoint putatively critical network controllers, accounting for aberrant cerebral connectivity patterns in MDD. Results: We found significantly elevated frontolimbic and frontocentral connectivity mediated by gamma (30-48 Hz) activity in MDD versus HC, and the right amygdala was the key differential network controller accounting for aberrant cerebral connectivity patterns in MDD. Furthermore, this frontolimbic and frontocentral gamma-band hyper-connectivity was positively correlated with depression severity. Limitations: The overall sample size was small, and we found significant effects in the deep limbic regions with resting-state MEG, the reliability of which was difficult to corroborate further. Conclusions: Overall, these findings support a notion that the right amygdala critically controls the exaggerated gamma-band frontolimbic and frontocentral connectivity in MDD during the resting-state condition, which potentially constitutes pre-established aberrant pathways during task processing and contributes to MDD pathology.

This is broadly interpreted as evidence of a concentration of memory resources to the attended, to-be-remembered stimulus. However, online attentional selection is known to additionally depend on distractor inhibition, raising the viable alternative that attentional deployment in working memory involves inhibitory control processes. Here, we demonstrate that active inhibition plays a central role in the deployment of attention in working memory. We do so using a retroactive cueing paradigm, where a briefly presented memory array is followed by a cue indicating a to-be-remembered target (Experiment 1) or a to-be-forgotten distractor (Experiment 2). We identify discrete indices of target selection and distractor inhibition in lateralized oscillatory activity over visual areas. When a retroactive cue identifies the location of a target, results show rapid decrease of lateral, targete-licited alpha band activity, representing attentional orienting toward the target. This is followed only later by emergence of an increase in distractor-elicited alpha activity, reflecting distractor inhibition. In contrast, when the retroactive cue identifies a distractor, evidence of distractor inhibition emerges first, only later followed by target selection. These results thus demonstrate that separate excitatory and inhibitory processes underlie the deployment of attention on the level of working memory representations.

However, a dynamic description of how motor cortical circuits reorganize after SCI is lacking. Here, we captured the comprehensive dynamics of motor networks across SCI in a nonhuman primate model. Using electrocorticography over the sensorimotor areas in monkeys, we collected broadband neuronal signals during a reaching-and-grasping task at different stages of recovery of dexterous finger movements after a partial SCI at the cervical levels. We identified two distinct network dynamics: grasping-related intrahemispheric interactions from the contralesional premotor cortex (PM) to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) in the high-gamma band (>70 Hz), and motor-preparation-related interhemispheric interactions from the contralesional to ipsilesional PM in the alpha and low-beta bands (10-15 Hz). The strengths of these networks correlated to the time course of behavioral recovery. The grasping-related network showed enhanced activation immediately after the injury, but gradually returned to normal while the strength of the motor-preparation-related network gradually increased. Our findings suggest a cortical compensatory mechanism after SCI, where two interdependent motor networks redirect activity from the contralesional hemisphere to the other hemisphere to facilitate functional recovery.

Although tDCS application has been spreading over a variety of neuroscience domains, the mechanisms by which the stimulation acts are largely unknown. We investigated tDCS effects on cortical gamma synchrony, which is a crucial player in cortical function. We performed a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind study on healthy subjects, combining tDCS and magnetoencephalography. By driving brain activity via 40 Hz auditory stimulation during magnetoencephalography, we experimentally tuned cortical gamma synchrony and measured it before and after bilateral tDCS of the primary sensory-motor hand regions (anode left, cathode right). We demonstrated that the stimulation induces a remarkable decrease of gamma synchrony (13 out of 15 subjects), as measured by gamma phase at 40 Hz. tDCS has strong remote effects, as the cortical region mostly affected was located far away from the stimulation site and covered a large area of the right centro-temporal cortex. No significant differences between stimulations were found for baseline gamma synchrony, as well as early transient auditory responses. This suggests a specific tDCS effect on externally driven gamma synchronization. This study sheds new light on the effect of tDCS on cortical function showing that the net effect of the stimulation on cortical gamma synchronization is an inhibition.

The characteristics of this pre-stimulus activity can predict whether a near-threshold stimulus will be perceived or not perceived, but can they also predict which one of two competing stimuli with different perceptual contents is perceived? Ambiguous visual stimuli, which can be seen in one of two possible ways at a time, are ideally suited to investigate this question. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neurophysiological measurement technique that records magnetic signals emitted as a result of brain activity. The millisecond temporal resolution of MEG allows for a characterization of oscillatory brain states from as little as 1 second of recorded data. Presenting an empty screen around 1 second prior to the ambiguous stimulus onset therefore provides a time window in which one can investigate whether pre-stimulus oscillatory activity biases the content of upcoming perception, as indicated by participants' reports. The spatial resolution of MEG is not excellent, but sufficient to localise sources of brain activity at the centimetre scale. Source reconstruction of MEG activity then allows for testing hypotheses about the oscillatory activity of specific regions of interest, as well as the time- and frequency-resolved connectivity between regions of interest. The described protocol enables a better understanding of the influence of spontaneous, ongoing brain activity on visual perception.

Load effects on spatial working memory performance are linked to distributed alpha and beta oscillations	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						magnetoencephalography (MEG); oscillatory activity; posterior parietal cortex (PPC); prefrontal cortex (PFC); superior temporal cortex	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARIETAL; MAINTENANCE; EEG; ATTENTION; MEG; METAANALYSIS; ACTIVATION; LOCATION	Increasing spatial working memory (SWM) load is generally associated with declines in behavioral performance, but the neural correlates of load-related behavioral effects remain poorly understood. Herein, we examine the alterations in oscillatory activity that accompany such performance changes in 22 healthy adults who performed a two- and four-load SWM task during magnetoencephalography (MEG). All MEG data were transformed into the time-frequency domain and significant oscillatory responses were imaged separately per load using a beamformer. Whole-brain correlation maps were computed using the load-related beamformer difference images and load-related accuracy effects on the SWM task. The results indicated that load-related differences in left inferior frontal alpha activity during encoding and maintenance were negatively correlated with load-related accuracy differences on the SWM task. That is, individuals who had more substantial decreases in prefrontal alpha during high-relative to low-load SWM trials tended to have smaller performance decrements on the high-load condition (i.e., they performed more accurately). The same pattern of neurobehavioral correlations was observed during the maintenance period for right superior temporal alpha activity and right superior parietal beta activity. Importantly, this is the first study to employ a voxel-wise whole-brain approach to significantly link load-related oscillatory differences and load-related SWM performance differences.

Although effects on ERPs of valence, magnitude, expectancy, and context during feedback processing have been extensively investigated, the electrophysiological processes underlying prediction formation in anticipation of feedback signals have received little attention. The aim of the present study was to explore these processes of prediction formation and their influence on subsequent feedback signals. Twenty healthy, right-handed volunteers performed a forced-choice task in which they had to indicate which of two presented objects was more expensive. After the volunteer's choice, an expert cue, which was accurate in 80% of trials, was presented to manipulate prediction formation about future reward and punishment. ERPs were recorded during presentation of the expert cue and during feedback. Results revealed that prediction formation of future rewards and punishments is accompanied by differences in the P2 component and a subsequent delay period. During feedback processing, the prediction-related P2 was associated with the processing of valence reflected in the feedback-related P2. Furthermore, the prediction-related difference in the delay period was associated with error processing in feedback-related medial frontal negativity. These findings suggest that prediction signals prior to feedback contain information about whether a prediction is correct or wrong (expectancy) and if the outcome will be a reward or punishment (valence).

Cognitive effort decreases beta, alpha, and theta coherence and ends afterdischarges in human brain	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Afterdischarges; Cognition; Attention; Effort; Coherence	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CORTICAL STIMULATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; PULSE STIMULATION; TEMPORAL-LOBE; EPILEPSY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; SEIZURES	Objective: Mental activation has been reported to modify the occurrence of epileptiform activity. We studied its effect on afterdischarges. Method: In 15 patients with implanted electrodes we presented cognitive tasks when afterdischarges occurred. We developed a wavelet cross-coherence function to analyze the electrocorticography before and after the tasks and compared findings when cognitive tasks did or did not result in afterdischarge termination. Six patients returned for functional MRI (fMRI) testing, using similar tasks. Results: Cognitive tasks often could terminate afterdischarges when direct abortive stimulation could not. Wavelet cross-coherence analysis showed that, when afterdischarges stopped, there was decreased coherence throughout the brain in the 7.13-22.53 Hz frequency ranges (p values 0.008-0.034). This occurred a) regardless of whether an area activated on fMRI and b) regardless of whether there were afterdischarges in the area. Conclusions: It is known that cognitive tasks can alter localized or network synchronization. Our results show that they can change activity throughout the brain. These changes in turn can terminate localized epileptiform activity. Significance: Cognitive tasks result in diffuse brain changes that can modify focal brain activity.

The neural tides of sleep and consciousness revealed by single-pulse electrical brain stimulation	SLEEP			English	Article						brain waves; human electrocorticography; high-gamma activity; effective connectivity; causal interactions	CORTICOCORTICAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EVENT-RELATED CAUSALITY; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; IN-VIVO; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; EXCITABILITY; PROPAGATION	Wakefulness and sleep arise from global changes in brain physiology that may also govern the flow of neural activity between cortical regions responsible for perceptual processing versus planning and action. To test whether and how the sleep/wake cycle affects the overall propagation of neural activity in large-scale brain networks, we applied single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) in patients implanted with intracranial EEG electrodes for epilepsy surgery. SPES elicited cortico-cortical spectral responses at high-gamma frequencies (CCSRHG, 80-150 Hz), which indexes changes in neuronal population firing rates. Using event-related causality (ERC) analysis, we found that the overall patterns of neural propagation among sites with CCSRHG were different during wakefulness and different sleep stages. For example, stimulation of frontal lobe elicited greater propagation toward parietal lobe during slow-wave sleep than during wakefulness. During REM sleep, we observed a decrease in propagation within frontal lobe, and an increase in propagation within parietal lobe, elicited by frontal and parietal stimulation, respectively. These biases in the directionality of large-scale cortical network dynamics during REM sleep could potentially account for some of the unique experiential aspects of this sleep stage. Together these findings suggest that the regulation of conscious awareness and sleep is associated with differences in the balance of neural propagation across large-scale frontal-parietal networks.

Motivated by findings reported at the cortical level in healthy participants we test the hypothesis in the basal ganglia of Parkinson's disease patients that lower frequency beta band activity relates to motor circuits associated with the upper limb and higher beta frequencies with lower limb movements. Methods: We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the subthalamic nucleus using segmented "directional" DBS leads, during which patients performed repetitive upper and lower limb movements. Movement-related spectral changes in the beta and gamma frequency-ranges and their spatial distributions were compared between limbs. Results: We found that the beta desynchronization during leg movements is characterised by a strikingly greater involvement of higher beta frequencies (24-31 Hz), regardless of whether this was contralateral or ipsilateral to the limb moved. The spatial distribution of limb-specific movement-related changes was evident at higher gamma frequencies. Conclusion: Limb processing in the basal ganglia is differentially organised in the spectral and spatial domain and can be captured by directional DBS leads. Significance: These findings may help to refine the use of the subthalamic LFPs as a control signal for adaptive DBS and neuroprosthetic devices.

In the past, most studies had developed control schemes relating to synchronization problems which were limited to two or three neurons, which cannot depict the dynamic synchronization behavior of neuron networks. In this paper, we investigated the synchronization issues associated with a ring-structured network of FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons, under external electrical stimulation, and with single- and dual-state gap junctions. In addition, the gap junctions (coupling)s and ionic gate disturbances were included in the dynamics of this FHN neuronal network, making our work both more realistic, and more challenging. Thus, each neuron in this network was influenced synaptically by its neighboring two neurons. A simple, robust, and adaptive control scheme, for both a single- and the dual-gap-junction network has been proposed, which will compensate for the nonlinear dynamics without direct cancelation to achieve synchronization. Sufficient conditions to guarantee synchronization of both membrane potentials and recovery variables were derived by using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the proposed scheme was validated, and its efficacy was comprehensively analyzed through numerical simulations.

An integrated overview of these changes, its relationship with clinical symptoms, and the influence of treatment is currently missing. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the MEG studies that have examined oscillatory activity and functional connectivity in the PD-affected brain. The available articles could be separated into motor network-focused and whole-brain focused studies. Motor network studies revealed PD-related changes in beta band (13-30 Hz) neurophysiological activity within and between several of its components, although it remains elusive to what extent these changes underlie clinical motor symptoms. In whole-brain studies PD-related oscillatory slowing and decrease in functional connectivity correlated with cognitive decline and less strongly with other markers of disease progression. Both approaches offer a different perspective on PD-specific disease mechanisms and could therefore complement each other. Combining the merits of both approaches will improve the setup and interpretation of future studies, which is essential for a better understanding of the disease process itself and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying specific PD symptoms, as well as for the potential to use MEG in clinical care.

A decrease of sleep quantity preflight and on the International Space Station (ISS) has been reported. Recent counter-measures have been implemented to better regulate sleep opportunities on ISS. In our study, astronauts were allocated enough time for sleep the night before the recordings. However, for proper sleep recovery, the quality of sleep is also critical. Unfortunately, data on sleep quality have yet to be acquired from the ISS. Here, we investigate sleep pressure markers during wakefulness in five astronauts throughout their 6-month space mission by the mean of electroencephalographic recordings. We show a global increase of theta oscillations (5-7 Hz) on the ISS compared to on Earth before the mission. We also show that local sleep-like events, another marker of sleep pressure, are more global in space (p < 0.001). By analysing the performances of the astronauts during a docking simulation, we found that local sleep-like events are more global when reaction times are slower (R-2 = 0.03, p = 0.006) and there is an increase of reaction times above 244 ms after 2 months in space (p = 0.012). Our analyses provide first evidence for increased sleep pressure in space and raise awareness on possible impacts on visuomotor performances in space.

In the current study, we specifically focused on possible changes in endogenous visual orienting that may be reflected in the electroencephalogram. A variant of the Posner cuing paradigm was employed with valid or invalid central cues that preceded target stimuli that were presented in the left or right visual field. The target stimuli consisted of vertical or horizontal stripes with low (two thick lines) or high (six thin lines) spatial frequencies. We examined lateralized alpha power in the cue-target interval as recent studies revealed that a contra vs. ipsilateral reduction in alpha power relates to the orienting of attention. An initial orienting effect in the lower alpha band was more pronounced for dyslexic individuals than for controls, suggesting that they oriented at an earlier moment in time. However, in contrast with controls, at the end of the cue-target interval no clear contralateral reduction in the upper alpha band was observed for dyslexic individuals. Dyslexic individuals additionally displayed slower responses, especially for invalidly cued high spatial frequency targets in the left visual field. The current data support the view that dyslexic individuals orient well to the cued location but have a problem with sustaining their attention.	[Van der Lubbe, Rob H.

Mathematical problem solving engages higher order cognition and a complex associative activity of functional neural networks occurs during demanding problem solving.Method: Twenty right handed subjects (mean age: 24.6years; SD = 3.97years; 50% female) participated in this study. An arithmetic logic puzzle was used as a demanding mathematical task. EEGs were recorded in the eye open rest and eye open task conditions. To clarify functional connectivity of brain networks, clustering coefficient, transitivity, global efficiency, degree and entropy were investigated in two conditions.Results: During problem solving, disrupted brain connectivity and decreased brain segregation were observed in the alpha band. However, in the beta band, increased connectivity, transitivity and clustering associated with higher modularity were observed. Theta exhibited unaltered brain network function.Conclusion: In the demanding problem solving task, decreased local alpha coupling may suggest that default mode network activity is interrupted. Since there is no significant difference within the theta network, the central executive network may not be as strongly involved.

The efficacy of emotional and motivational regulation can determine athletic performance. Giving the short duration and fast changing nature of emotions experienced by athletes in competition, it is important to examine the temporal dynamics of emotional and motivational regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate emotional and motivational regulation as measured by frontal alpha asymmetry in skilled golfers during putting performance after a performance failure. Methods. Twenty skilled university golfers were recruited and requested to perform 40 putts at an individualized difficulty level of 40-60% successful putting rate. Trials immediately after a failed putt were selected for analysis. Successful performances were those trials where a hole was and unsuccessful performances were those that failed. The frontal alpha asymmetry index of LnF4-LnF3 was derived for statistical analysis. Results. (1) Successful performance was preceded by a larger frontal alpha asymmetry index at T2 than that of T1, and (2) a larger frontal alpha asymmetry index was observed for unsuccessful performance than for successful performance at T1. Discussion. The results suggest that successful emotional and motivational regulation was characterized by a progressive increase of frontal alpha asymmetry, which led to subsequent putting success when facing an emotionally provocative putting failure. These findings shed light on the application of frontal alpha asymmetry for the understanding and enhancement of emotional and motivational regulation during sport performance.

Here we report physiological differences in humans of both sexes. During NREM sleep, the human hippocampus generates sharpwave ripples (SWRs) similar to those which in rodents mark memory replay. Weshow that while pHC generates SWRs, it also generates approximately as many spindle ripples (SSR: ripples phase-locked to local spindles). In contrast, SSRs are rare in aHC. Like SWRs, SSRs often co-occur with neocortical theta bursts (TBs), downstates (DSs), sleep spindles (SSs), and upstates (USs), which coordinate cortico-hippocampal interactions and facilitate consolidation in rodents. SWRs co-occur with these waves in widespread cortical areas, especially frontocentral. These waves typically occur in the sequence TB-DS-SS-US, with SWRs usually occurring before SS-US. In contrast, SSRs occur similar to 350 ms later, with a strong preference for co-occurrence with posterior-parietal SSs. pHC-SSs were strongly phase-locked with parietal-SSs, and pHC-SSRs were phase-coupled with pHC-SSs and parietal-SSs. HumanSWRs (and associated replay events, if any) are separated by similar to 5 s on average, whereas ripples on successive SSR peaks are separated by only similar to 80 ms. These distinctive physiological properties of pHC-SSR enable an alternative mechanism for hippocampal engagement with neocortex.

Different patterns of movement-related cortical oscillations in patients with myoclonus and in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERD/ERS analysis; Myoclonus; EPM1; Ataxia; SCA	UNVERRICHT-LUNDBORG-DISEASE; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; REACTION-TIME; MOTOR CORTEX; ALPHA-BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION; EPILEPSY; INVOLVEMENT; NETWORKS	Objective: To assess whether different patterns of EEG rhythms during a Go/No-go motor task characterize patients with cortical myoclonus (EPM1) or with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Methods: We analyzed event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) in the alpha and beta-bands during visually cued Go/No-go task in 22 patients (11 with EPM1, 11 with SCA) and 11 controls. Results: In the Go condition, the only significant difference was a reduced contralateral beta-ERS in the EPM1 patients compared with controls; in the No-go condition, the EPM1 patients showed prolonged alpha-ERD in comparison with both controls and SCA patients, and reduced or delayed alpha- and beta-ERS in comparison with controls. In both conditions, the SCA patients, unlike EPM1 patients and controls, showed minimal or absent lateralization of alpha- and beta-ERD. Conclusions: EPM1 patients showed abnormal ERD/ERS dynamics, whereas SCA patients mainly showed defective ERD lateralization. Significance: A different behavior of ERS/ERD distinguished the two patient groups: the pattern observed in EPM1 suggests a prominent defect of inhibition occurring in motor cortex contralateral to activated segment, whereas the pattern observed in SCA suggested a defective lateralization attributable to the damage of cerebello-cortical network, which is instead marginal in patients with cortical myoclonus.

Among these patients, 0.1-0.2% are victims of Accidental Awareness during General Anesthesia (AAGA), i.e., an unexpected awakening during a surgical procedure under general anesthesia. Although anesthesiologists try to closely monitor patients using various techniques to prevent this terrifying phenomenon, there is currently no efficient solution to accurately detect its occurrence. We propose the conception of an innovative passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on an intention of movement to prevent AAGA. Indeed, patients typically try to move to alert the medical staff during an AAGA, only to discover that they are unable to. First, we examine the challenges of such a BCI, i.e., the lack of a trigger to facilitate when to look for an intention to move, as well as the necessity for a high classification accuracy. Then, we present a solution that incorporates Median Nerve Stimulation (MNS). We investigate the specific modulations that MNS causes in the motor cortex and confirm that they can be altered by an intention of movement. Finally, we perform experiments on 16 healthy participants to assess whether an MI-based BCI using MNS is able to generate high classification accuracies. Our results show that MNS may provide a foundation for an innovative BCl that would allow the detection of AAGA.

Left parietal tACS at alpha frequency induces a shift of visuospatial attention	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; UNILATERAL NEGLECT; NEURAL ACTIVITY; 10 HZ; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; POWER	Background Voluntary shifts of visuospatial attention are associated with a lateralization of parieto-occipital alpha power (7-13Hz), i.e. higher power in the hemisphere ipsilateral and lower power contralateral to the locus of attention. Recent noninvasive neuromodulation studies demonstrated that alpha power can be experimentally increased using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Objective/Hypothesis We hypothesized that tACS at alpha frequency over the left parietal cortex induces shifts of attention to the left hemifield. However, spatial attention shifts not only occur voluntarily (endogenous/top-down), but also stimulus-driven (exogenous/bottom-up). To study the task-specificity of the potential effects of tACS on attentional processes, we administered three conceptually different spatial attention tasks. Methods 36 healthy volunteers were recruited from an academic environment. In two separate sessions, we applied either high-density tACS at 10Hz, or sham tACS, for 35-40 minutes to their left parietal cortex. We systematically compared performance on endogenous attention, exogenous attention, and stimulus detection tasks. Results In the endogenous attention task, a greater leftward bias in reaction times was induced during left parietal 10Hz tACS as compared to sham. There were no stimulation effects in either the exogenous attention or the stimulus detection task. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high-density tACS at 10Hz can be used to modulate visuospatial attention performance. The tACS effect is task-specific, indicating that not all forms of attention are equally susceptible to the stimulation.

Altered beta-band functional connectivity may be related to 'performance slowing' in good outcome aneurysmal subarachnoid patients	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Visual short-term memory; 1-back; Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; Functional connectivity; Phase lag index; Reaction time	VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; HEMORRHAGE; MOTOR; ATTENTION; DEFICITS; GLASGOW; EEG	Recent evidence suggests that good neurological outcome in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) does not equate to good neuropsychological and cognitive outcome. These individuals continue to face cognitive difficulties in tasks involving mental flexibility, short-term memory and attention, resulting in decreased independence in daily living and reduced ability to return to work. In the current study, we examined the functional connectivity profiles using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in SAH patients, versus controls, during a visual short-term memory, 1-back, task. Our results found that a global measure of MEG-based phase synchrony in the beta band (15-30 Hz), derived from a time window during correct recognition, significantly differentiated the controls from the patients. During correct recognition, the connectivity patterns in the controls were characterized by inter-hemispheric parieto-frontal connections, involving the posterior parietal cortex, while patients appeared to recruit an entirely different network of regions, involving the anterior frontal and temporal regions. Reduced beta-band synchrony during recognition was associated with overall poorer performance, demonstrated as lower accuracy and slower reaction times in patients, but not in controls. This differentiation between groups suggests an important and distinct role of beta-band phase synchronization, perhaps for memory retrieval, associated with good performance. Performance slowing, short-term memory and attention deficits in these patients may be attributed to the impaired beta-band connectivity among prefrontal regions and the posterior parietal cortex.

Stimulating the sleeping brain: Current approaches to modulating memory-related sleep physiology	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Closed-loop system; Memory consolidation; Non-Invasive brain stimulation; Pharmacological intervention; Sleep; Slow oscillations	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; INSULIN IMPROVES MEMORY; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; REM-SLEEP; TARGETED REACTIVATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; DEPENDENT MEMORY; EEG SPECTRA	Background: One of the most audacious proposals throughout the history of psychology was the potential ability to learn while we sleep. The idea penetrated culture via sci-fi movies and inspired the invention of devices that claimed to teach foreign languages, facts, and even quit smoking by simply listening to audiocassettes or other devices during sleep. However, the promises from this endeavor didn't stand up to experimental scrutiny, and the dream was shunned from the scientific community. Despite the historic evidence that the sleeping brain cannot learn new complex information (i.e., words, images, facts), a new wave of current interventions are demonstrating that sleep can be manipulated to strengthen recent memories. New method: Several recent approaches have been developed that play with the sleeping brain in order to modify ongoing memory processing. Here, we provide an overview of the available techniques to non-invasively modulate memory-related sleep physiology, including sensory, vestibular and electrical stimulation, as well as pharmacological approaches. Results: N/A. Comparison with existing methods: N/A. Conclusions: Although the results are encouraging, suggesting that in general the sleeping brain may be optimized for better memory performance, the road to bring these techniques in free-living conditions is paved with unanswered questions and technical challenges that need to be carefully addressed.

Theta activity has been related to hippocampal learning, and increased high-frequency theta activity occurs through efficient place learning training in the Morris maze. We wondered whether the place learning deficits observed in adult rats that had been neonatally treated with monosodium glutamate (MSG), were related to altered theta patterns in the hippocampus and prelimbic cortex, which were recorded during place learning training in the Morris maze. The MSG-treated group had a profound deficit in place learning ability, with a marginal reduction in escape latencies during the final days of training. Learning-related changes were observed in the relative power distribution in control and MSG-treated groups in the hippocampal EEG, but not in the prelimbic cortex. Increased prefrontal and reduced hippocampal absolute power that appeared principally during the final days of training, and reduced coherence between regions throughout the training (4-12 Hz), were observed in the MSG-treated rats, thereby suggesting a misfunction of the circuits rather than a hyperexcitable general state. In conclusion, neonatal administration of MSG, which caused a profound deficit in place learning at the adult age, also altered the theta pattern both in the hippocampus and prelimbic cortex.

However, how the brain integrates nociceptive inputs from different body areas remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the cortical integration of bilateral nociceptive inputs evoked by laser heat stimuli. Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 F, 8 M; age: 25.5 +/- 4.3) were recruited to participate in one session during which painful laser stimuli were applied to their hands with 2 Nd:YAP laser systems. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded to measure laser-evoked potentials and event-related spectral perturbations. Twenty nociceptive stimuli were applied in each of the 4 counterbalanced conditions: (1) right hand, (2) left hand, and both hands with (3) attention to the right or (4) attention to the let Compared with unilateral conditions, N2 and P2 peak amplitude as well as gamma oscillation power were decreased in bilateral conditions (P < 0.05), but these effects were not affected by the direction of attention (P > 0.1). By contrast, pain was not significantly different in any condition (P > 0.05). These findings show that although more nociceptive inputs reach the brain with multiple nociceptive stimuli, their sensory representation is decreased while pain perception remains unchanged. These interactions between cerebral processing of nociceptive information from different body regions could support coordinated behavioral responses when pain origins from multiple sources.

Quantitative electrocorticographic biomarkers of clinical outcomes in mesial temporal lobe epileptic patients treated with the RNS (R) system	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Refractory epilepsy; Seizure biomarkers; Interictal EEG; Responsive brain stimulation; Mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; SEIZURES; SPIKES; SPIKING; ADULTS	Objectives: Find interictal electrocorticographic (ECoG) biomarkers of clinical outcomes in mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) epilepsy patients. Methods: In the NeuroPace (R) RNS (R) System clinical trials with 256 patients, 20 MTL patients with the most reduction in clinical seizures at Year 7 compared to baseline (upper response quartile; -96.5% median change) and 20 with the least reduction in clinical seizures (lower response quartile; -17.4% median change) were evaluated. Clinical and interictal ECoG features from the two response quartiles were compared. Results: Demographic and clinical features were similar in the upper and lower response quartiles. Interictal spike rate (ISR) was substantially lower (p < 0.0001) in the upper quartile patients, while normalized theta (4-8 Hz) and normalized gamma (> 25 Hz) were also different (p < 0.05) between the two response quartiles. ISR was positively correlated (p < 0.05) with clinical seizure rates in 71% of the channels analyzed. ECoG records captured during months with no clinical seizures had the lowest ISR. Conclusions: ISR is a strong differentiator of clinical response in MTL patients. Normalized theta and gamma also differentiates clinical response. Significance: In MTL patients, the interictal spike rate along with spectral power computed from chronic ambulatory baseline ECoGs may serve as biomarkers of clinical outcomes and maybe used as treatment endpoints.

Here, we examined training-dependent and off-line changes of two sub-processes of procedural learning: namely, sequence learning and statistical learning. Whereas sequence learning requires the acquisition of order-based relationships between the elements of a sequence, statistical learning is based on the acquisition of probabilistic associations between elements. Seventy-eight healthy young adults (58 females and 20 males) completed the modified version of the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task that was designed to measure Sequence and Statistical Learning simultaneously. After training, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: active wakefulness, quiet rest, or daytime sleep. We examined off-line changes in Sequence and Statistical Learning as well as further improvements after extended practice. Performance in Sequence Learning increased during training, while Statistical Learning plateaued relatively rapidly. After the off-line period, both the acquired sequence and statistical knowledge was preserved, irrespective of the vigilance state (awake, quiet rest or sleep). Sequence Learning further improved during extended practice, while Statistical Learning did not. Moreover, within the sleep group, cortical oscillations and sleep spindle parameters showed differential associations with Sequence and Statistical Learning. Our findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes of multiple parallel learning and consolidation processes that occur during procedural memory formation.

Our study aimed to systematically evaluate the occurrence and development of SERs after tactile stimulus in preterm infants. We analysed SERs performed during 45 electroencephalograms (EEGs) from 29 infants at the mean post-menstrual age of 30.7 weeks. Altogether 2,087 SERs were identified visually at single-trial level from unfiltered signals capturing also their slowest components. We observed salient SERs with a high-amplitude slow component at a high success rate after hand (95%) and foot (83%) stimuli. There was a clear developmental change in both the slow wave and the higher-frequency components of the SERs. Infants with intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH; eleven infants) had initially normal SERs, but those with bilateral IVH later showed a developmental decrease in the ipsilateral SER occurrence after 30 weeks of post-menstrual age. Our study shows that tactile stimulus applied at bedside elicits salient SERs with a large slow component and an overriding fast oscillation, which are specific to the preterm period. Prior experimental research indicates that such SERs allow studying both subplate and cortical functions. Our present findings further suggest that they might offer a window to the emergence of neurodevelopmental sequelae after major structural brain lesions and, hence, an additional tool for both research and clinical neurophysiological evaluation of infants before term age.

A narrative review on existing physiological noise reduction techniques from fNIRS signal demonstrates that the most common methods are window based finite impulse response (FIR) and SG filters. However, these filters did not clarify why and how it is able to remove noises from the fNIRS signal. This paper shows a systemic investigation of works performed with window based FIR filter and SG filter and found very convincing results to use SG filter with specific conditions. Three main frequency bands (0-0.1 Hz, 0-0.14 Hz, and 0.03-0.1 Hz) have been considered as standard for fNIRS signal filtering and filtered the signals by window-based FIR filter. With a number of conditions of SG filter, the raw fNIRS signals were filtered again and checked the correlation between filtered signals by FIR and SG. By check and trial basis, the best correlations were revealed. To validate the proposed results, several golden standard statistical investigations were analyzed. The experimental results propose a recommendation which indicates the best conditions of the SG filter to remove physiological noises from the fNIRS signals.

Intermuscular coherence as biomarker for pallidal deep brain stimulation efficacy in dystonia	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Dystonia; Deep brain stimulation; Biomarker; Intermuscular coherence	INTERNAL GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; EMG COHERENCE; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; PATTERNS	Objective: Finding a non-invasive biomarker for Globus Pallidus interna Deep Brain Stimulation (GPiDBS) efficacy. Dystonia heterogeneity leads to a wide variety of clinical response to GPi-DBS, making it hard to predict GPi-DBS efficacy for individual patients. Methods: EEG-EMG recordings of twelve dystonia patients who received bilateral GPi-DBS took place pre-and 1 year post-surgery ON and OFF stimulation, during a rest, pinch, and flexion task. Dystonia severity was assessed using the BFMDRS and TWSTRS (pre-and post-surgery ON stimulation). Intermuscular coherence (IMC) and motorcortex corticomuscular coherence (CMC) were calculated. Low frequency (4-12 Hz) and beta band (13-30 Hz) peak coherences were studied. Results: Dystonia severity improved after 1 year GPi-DBS therapy (BFMDRS: 30%, median 7.8 (IQR 3-10), TWSTRS: 22%, median 6.8 (IQR 4-9)). 86% of IMC were above the 95% confidence limit. The highest IMC peak decreased significantly with GPi-DBS in the low frequency and beta band. Low frequency and beta band IMC correlated partly with dystonia severity and severity improvement. CMC generally were below the 95% confidence limit. Conclusions: Peak low frequency IMC functioned as biomarker for GPi-DBS efficacy, and partly correlated with dystonia severity. Significance: IMC can function as biomarker. Confirmation in a larger study is needed for use in clinical practice. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Pu, M; Yu, RJ				Pu, Min; Yu, Rongjun			Post-encoding frontal theta activity predicts incidental memory in the reward context	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Subsequent memory effect (SME); Post-encoding; Reward learning; Theta activity; Binding of information	LONG-TERM-MEMORY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; ACTIVATION; POWER; ANTICIPATION; NEGATIVITY; MECHANISMS	Memories for daily events require that individuals integrate initial fragile traces of events over time. Recent evidence suggests that reward anticipation enhances memory performance and amplifies frontal theta activity for remembered items vs. forgotten items. However, little is known about how incidental rewards after item presentation retrospectively modulate memory and the neural basis of this processing. Here, we used EEG combined with an incidental memory task to study how incidental reward association biased the post-encoding process. In the anticipatory stage, participants saw photos in win, loss and neutral contexts. Each photo was presented in a color frame that indicated the incentive condition (win vs. loss vs. neutral) and participants were asked to make a binary choice to predict whether the photo was associated with the left/right button. Feedback was presented to indicate arbitrary correctness and monetary outcomes. Recognition memory was tested after a short delay. During the encoding phase, left central-parietal theta power predicted subsequent memory performance in the win context. The post-encoding theta power at right central-frontal and central-parietal sites predicted later memory performance only in the win context. The size of frontal post-encoding related theta activity in the win context was correlated with the discriminate accuracy of the test stimulus. Our results suggest that post-encoding theta activity is closely linked to reward-based associative learning, providing evidence of a potential post-encoding mechanism of information binding.

In this study we extended the range of stimulation frequencies, using also low and medium stimulation frequencies (4, 6, 8, 12, 20, 40 Hz) and studied their susceptibility to the loss of consciousness in NREM sleep (N2 and N3 stages). Effects of NREM sleep were examined in power domain with relative power (RP), and in phase domain using inter-trial phase coherence (PC) parameter. The activity in power domain was also compared to no-stimulation data. Regions displaying significant waking-NREM sleep differences were selected using non-parametric suprathreshold cluster test. For 4, 6, 20 and 40 Hz stimulation relative power of ASSRs was lower in NREM sleep, with maximal change for 40 Hz stimulation. This decrease was not seen in no-stimulation condition. For all stimulation frequencies (except 12 Hz) we observed decrease of phase coherence of ASSR during NREM sleep. Our results demonstrate that low and medium frequency ASSRs are state-sensitive, thus susceptible to loss of consciousness during NREM sleep. Diminishing of power and phase coherence may result from cortical down states and/or thalamic inhibition. Our results support possible use of low- and medium-frequency ASSRs for discrimination between states of altered consciousness and emphasize the role of the auditory system in determining these variations.

Parvalbumin Cell Ablation of NMDA-R1 Leads to Altered Phase, But Not Amplitude, of Gamma-Band Cross-Frequency Coupling	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						ASD; cross-frequency coupling; gamma; phase; phase-amplitude coupling	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MICE; OSCILLATIONS; CHILDREN; NETWORK; RESPONSES; KETAMINE; DEFICITS; RHYTHMS	Altered gamma-band electrophysiological activity in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is well documented, and analogous gamma-band alterations are recapitulated in several preclinical murine models relevant to ASD. Such gamma-band activity is hypothesized to underlie local circuit processes. Gamma-band cross-frequency coupling (CFC), a related though distinct metric, interrogates local neural circuit signal integration. Several recent studies have observed perturbed gamma-band CFC in individuals with ASD, although the direction of change remains unresolved. It also remains unclear whether murine models relevant to ASD recapitulate this altered gamma-band CFC. As such, this study examined whether mice with parvalbumin (PV) cell-specific ablation of NMDA-R1 (PVcre/NR1(fl/fl)) demonstrated altered gamma-band CFC as compared with their control littermates (PVcre/NR1(+/+)-mice that do not have the PV cell-specific ablation of NMDA-R1). Ten mice of each genotype had 4 min of "resting" electroencephalography recorded and analyzed. First, resting electrophysiological power was parsed into the canonical frequency bands and genotype-related differences were subsequently explored so as to provide context for the subsequent CFC analyses. PVcre/NR1(fl/fl) mice exhibited an increase in resting power specific to the high gamma-band, but not other frequency bands, as compared with PVcre/NR1(+/+). CFC analyses then examined both the standard magnitude (strength) of CFC and the novel metric Phase(Max)-which denotes the phase of the lower frequency signal at which the peak higher frequency signal power occurred. PVcre/NR1(fl/fl) mice exhibited altered Phase(Max), but not strength, of gamma-band CFC as compared with PVcre/NR1(+/+) mice. As such, this study suggests a potential novel metric to explore when studying neuropsychiatric disorders.

The goal of a classification system is to understand the inherent heterogeneity of individuals experiencing and suffering from tinnitus and to identify what differentiates potential subgroups. Identification of different patient subgroups with distinct audiological, psychophysical, and neurophysiological characteristics will facilitate the management of patients with tinnitus as well as the design and execution of drug development and clinical trials, which, for the most part, have not yielded conclusive results. An alternative outcome of a precision medicine approach in tinnitus would be that additional mechanistic phenotyping might not lead to the identification of distinct drivers in each individual, but instead, it might reveal that each individual may display a quantitative blend of causal factors. Therefore, a precision medicine approach towards identifying these causal factors might not lead to subtyping these patients but may instead highlight causal pathways that can be manipulated for therapeutic gain. These two outcomes are not mutually exclusive, and no matter what the final outcome is, a mechanistic-driven precision medicine approach is a win-win approach for advancing tinnitus research and treatment. Although there are several controversies and inconsistencies in the tinnitus field, which will not be discussed here, we will give a few examples, as to how the field can move forward by exploring the major neurophysiological tinnitus models, mostly by taking advantage of the common features supported by all of the models. Our position stems from the central concept that, as a field, we can and must do more to bring studies of mechanisms into the realm of neuroscience.

Sleep oscillation-specific associations with Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers: novel roles for sleep spindles and tau	MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION			English	Article							SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; COGNITIVE DECLINE; MOUSE MODEL; PATHOLOGY; BETA; EEG; DIAGNOSIS	BackgroundBased on associations between sleep spindles, cognition, and sleep-dependent memory processing, here we evaluated potential relationships between levels of CSF A(42), P-tau, and T-tau with sleep spindle density and other biophysical properties of sleep spindles in a sample of cognitively normal elderly individuals.MethodsOne-night in-lab nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and morning to early afternoon CSF collection were performed to measure CSF A(42), P-tau and T-tau. Seven days of actigraphy were collected to assess habitual total sleep time.ResultsSpindle density during NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep was negatively correlated with CSF A(42), P-tau and T-tau. From the three, CSF T-tau was the most significantly associated with spindle density, after adjusting for age, sex and ApoE4. Spindle duration, count and fast spindle density were also negatively correlated with T-tau levels. Sleep duration and other measures of sleep quality were not correlated with spindle characteristics and did not modify the associations between sleep spindle characteristics and the CSF biomarkers of AD.ConclusionsReduced spindles during N2 sleep may represent an early dysfunction related to tau, possibly reflecting axonal damage or altered neuronal tau secretion, rendering it a potentially novel biomarker for early neuronal dysfunction. Given their putative role in memory consolidation and neuroplasticity, sleep spindles may represent a mechanism by which tau impairs memory consolidation, as well as a possible target for therapeutic interventions in cognitive decline.

J	Scheeringa, R; Fries, P				Scheeringa, Rene; Fries, Pascal			Cortical layers, rhythms and BOLD signals	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; LAMINAR ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ACTIVITY	This review investigates how laminar fMRI can complement insights into brain function derived from the study of rhythmic neuronal synchronization. Neuronal synchronization in various frequency bands plays an important role in neuronal communication between brain areas, and it does so on the backbone of layer-specific interareal anatomical projections. Feedforward projections originate predominantly in supragranular cortical layers and terminate in layer 4, and this pattern is reflected in inter-laminar and interareal directed gamma-band influences. Thus, gamma-band synchronization likely subserves feedforward signaling. By contrast, anatomical feedback projections originate predominantly in infragranular layers and terminate outside layer 4, and this pattern is reflected in inter-laminar and interareal directed alpha- and/or beta-band influences. Thus, alpha- beta band synchronization likely subserves feedback signaling. Furthermore, these rhythms explain part of the BOLD signal, with independent contributions of alpha- beta and gamma. These findings suggest that laminar fMRI can provide us with a potentially useful method to test some of the predictions derived from the study of neuronal synchronization. We review central findings regarding the role of layer-specific neuronal synchronization for brain function, and regarding the link between neuronal synchronization and the BOLD signal. We discuss the role that laminar fMRI could play by comparing it to invasive and non-invasive electrophysiological recordings. Compared to direct electrophysiological recordings, this method provides a metric of neuronal activity that is slow and indirect, but that is uniquely non-invasive and layer-specific with potentially whole brain coverage.

Feature-Based Attention Samples Stimuli Rhythmically	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							TOP-DOWN; BEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; EEG ACTIVITY; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; PHASE; SUPPRESSION; VOLUNTARY	Attention supports the allocation of resources to relevant locations and objects in a scene. Under most conditions, several stimuli compete for neural representation. Attention biases neural representation toward the response associated with the attended object [1, 2]. Therefore, an attended stimulus enjoys a neural response that resembles the response to that stimulus in isolation. Factors that determine and generate attentional bias have been researched, ranging from endogenously controlled processes to exogenous capture of attention [1-4]. Recent studies investigate the temporal structure governing attention. When participants monitor a single location, visual-target detection depends on the phase of an similar to 8-Hz brain rhythm [5, 6]. When two locations are monitored, performance fluctuates at 4 Hz for each location [7, 8]. The hypothesis is that 4-Hz sampling for two locations may reflect a common sampler that operates at 8 Hz globally, which is divided between relevant locations [5-7, 9]. The present study targets two properties of this phenomenon, called rhythmic-attentional sampling: first, sampling is typically described for selection over different locations. We examined whether rhythmic sampling is limited to selection over space or whether it extends to feature-based attention. Second, we examined whether sampling at 4 Hz results from the division of an 8-Hz rhythm over two objects. We found that two overlapping objects defined by features are sampled at similar to 4 Hz per object. In addition, performance on a single object fluctuated at 8 Hz. Rhythmic sampling of features did not result from temporal structure in eye movements.

Clinical and rsEEG rhythms in PD with dementia (N = 35), PD with mild cognitive impairment (N = 50), PD with normal cognition (N = 35), and normal (N = 50) older adults were available from an international archive. Cortical rsEEG sources were estimated by exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Compared with the normal older group, the PD groups showed reduced occipital alpha sources and increased widespread delta (<4 Hz) sources. Widespread frontal and temporal alpha sources exhibited an increase in PD with dementia compared with PD with mild cognitive impairment and PD with normal cognition groups, as function of dopamine depletion severity, typically greater in the former than the latter groups. A daily dose of levodopa induced a widespread reduction in cortical delta and alpha sources in a subgroup of 13 PD patients under standard chronic dopaminergic regimen. In PD patients in quiet wakefulness, alpha cortical source activations may reflect an excitatory effect of dopamine neuromodulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SCR-associated slow waves reflect homeostatic sleep functions. Adenosine accumulating during prolonged wakefulness and sleep deprivation (SD) may play a role in the delta power increment during recovery sleep. NREM sleep is a local, use-dependent process of the brain. In the present study, direct effect of adenosine on UP and DOWN states was tested by topical application to frontal, somatosensory and visual cortices, respectively, in urethane-anesthetized rats. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded using an electrode array inserted close to the location of adenosine application. Multiple unit activity (MUA) was measured from layer V-VI in close proximity of the recording array. In the frontal and somatosensory cortex, adenosine modulated SCR with slow kinetics on the LFP level while MUA remained mostly unaffected. In the visual cortex, adenosine modulated SCR with fast kinetics. In each region, delta power increment was based on the increased frequency of state transitions as well as increased height of UP-state associated slow waves. These results show that adenosine may directly modulate SCR in a complex and region-specific manner which may be related to the finding that restorative processes may take place with varying duration and intensity during recovery sleep in different cortical regions. Adenosine may play a direct role in the increment of the slow wave power observed during local sleep, furthermore it may shape the region-specific characteristics of the phenomenon.

This event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) can be readily recorded non-invasively using magneto-and electro-encephalography (M/EEG). In addition, event-related potentials and fields (i. e., evoked responses) can be elucidated during movement. There is some evidence that the frequency, amplitude and latency of the movement-related ERS/ERD changes with ageing, however the evidence surrounding this topic comes mainly from studies in sample sizes on the order of tens of participants. The objective of this study was to examine a large open-access MEG dataset for age-related changes in movement-related ERS/ERD and evoked responses. MEG data acquired at the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience during cued button pressing was used from 567 participants between the ages of 18 and 88 years. The characteristics movement-related ERD/ERS and evoked responses were calculated for each individual participant. Based on linear regression analysis, significant relationships were found between participant age and some response characteristics, although the predictive value of these relationships was low. Specifically, we conclude that peak beta rebound frequency and amplitude decreased with age, peak beta suppression amplitude increased with age, movement-related gamma burst amplitude decreased with age, and peak motor-evoked response amplitude increased with age. Given our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these responses, our findings suggest the existence of age-related changes in the neurophysiology of thalamocortical loops and local circuitry in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices.

In the infra-slow frequency range (<0.1 Hz), inter-regional phase lag is of importance for brain function (e.g., anti-phase between the default mode network and task positive network). However, the role of phase lag in cognitive processing remains unclear. Based on the frequency tagging experimental paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we investigated inter-regional phase lag and phase coherence using a face recognition task (n = 30, 15 males/15 females). Phase coherence within the face processing system was significantly increased during task state, highlighting the importance of regular inter-regional phase relationship for face recognition. Moreover, results showed decreased phase lag within the core and extended face areas (face processing system) and increased phase lag between the face processing system and frontoparietal network, indicating a reorganization of inter-regional relationships of the two systems. Inter-regional phase lag was modulated by the task at ascending and descending phases of the fMRI signal, suggesting a phase-dependent inter-regional relationship. Furthermore, phase lags between visual cortex and amygdala and between visual cortex and motor area were positively related to reaction time, indicating better task performance depends on both rapid emotional detection pathway and visual-motor pathway.

They reflect the processing of the stimulus in cortex and have a highly subject-specific morphology. However, we still have an incomplete picture of how event-related fields are generated, what the various waves signify, and why they are so subject-specific. Here, we focus on this problem through the lens of a computational model which describes auditory cortex in terms of interconnected cortical columns as part of hierarchically placed fields of the core, belt, and parabelt areas. We develop an analytical approach arriving at solutions to the system dynamics in terms of normal modes: damped harmonic oscillators emerging out of the coupled excitation and inhibition in the system. Each normal mode is a global feature which depends on the anatomical structure of the entire auditory cortex. Further, normal modes are fundamental dynamical building blocks, in that the activity of each cortical column represents a combination of all normal modes. This approach allows us to replicate a typical auditory event-related response as a weighted sum of the single-column activities. Our work offers an alternative to the view that the event-related field arises out of spatially discrete, local generators. Rather, there is only a single generator process distributed over the entire network of the auditory cortex. We present predictions for testing to what degree subject-specificity is due to cross-subject variations in dynamical parameters rather than in the cortical surface morphology.	[May, Patrick J.

Recently, it has been shown that expectations can enhance the likelihood that a stimulus is consciously reported, but the neural mechanisms supporting this enhancement are still unclear. We manipulated stimulus expectations within the attentional blink (AB) paradigm using letters and combined visual psychophysics with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings to investigate whether prior expectations may enhance conscious access by sharpening stimulus-specific neural representations. We further explored how stimulus-specific neural activity patterns are affected by the factors expectation, stimulus relevance and conscious report. First, we show that valid expectations about the identity of an upcoming stimulus increase the likelihood that it is consciously reported. Second, using a series of multivariate decoding analyses, we show that the identity of letters presented in and out of the AB can be reliably decoded from MEG data. Third, we show that early sensory stimulus-specific neural representations are similar for reported and missed target letters in the AB task (active report required) and an oddball task in which the letter was clearly presented but its identity was task-irrelevant. However, later sustained and stable stimulus-specific representations were uniquely observed when target letters were consciously reported (decision-dependent signal). Fourth, we show that global pre-stimulus neural activity biased perceptual decisions for a 'seen' response. Fifth and last, no evidence was obtained for the sharpening of sensory representations by top-down expectations. We discuss these findings in light of emerging models of perception and conscious report highlighting the role of expectations and stimulus relevance.

Twenty individuals formally diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and in a current Major Depressive Episode (11 females and 8 males; aged between 26 and 65 years) undertook a 5 weeks intervention consisting of music listening combined with rhythmic sensory stimulation. Participants listened to a set of designed instrumental music tracks embedded with low-frequency sounds (3070 Hz). The stimuli were delivered for 30 min, 5 times per week, using a portable consumer device with built-in stereo speakers and a low-frequency transducer, which allowed the low-frequency sounds embedded in the music to be experienced as a mild vibrotactile sensation around the lower back. Changes from baseline to post-intervention in measures of depression symptoms, sleep quality, quality of life, anhedonia, and music-reward processing were assessed with clinician-based assessments as well as self-reports and a monetary incentive behavioral task. The study results indicated that there were significant changes from baseline in measures of depression and associated symptoms, including sleep quality, quality of life, and anhedonia. However, individual differences in treatment response need to be considered. These findings corroborate previous evidence that music-based intervention, when added to standard care, is a promising adjunctive treatment for Major Depressive Disorder, and open new avenues to investigate the effect of music-based therapy to ameliorate anhedonia-specific dysfunction in major depressive disorder and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

J	Zink, N; Zhang, R; Chmielewski, WX; Beste, C; Stock, AK				Zink, Nicolas; Zhang, Rui; Chmielewski, Witold X.; Beste, Christian; Stock, Ann-Kathrin			Detrimental effects of a high-dose alcohol intoxication on sequential cognitive flexibility are attenuated by practice	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Alcohol intoxication; Backward inhibition; Binge drinking; RIDE; Switching	THETA OSCILLATIONS; BINGE DRINKING; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BACKWARD INHIBITION; ERP COMPONENTS; TASK; DECOMPOSITION; EEG; MECHANISMS; SUBPROCESSES	It is well-known that alcohol impairs behavioral control and motor response inhibition, but it has remained rather unclear whether it also impairs cognitive inhibition. As automatized behavior is less vulnerable towards the detrimental effects of alcohol than cognitive control processes, potential cognitive inhibition deficits might however improve with training. We investigated the effect of an acute, binge-like alcohol intoxication in a balanced within-subjects design, asking n = 32 healthy young males to perform a backward inhibition paradigm once sober and once while intoxicated (similar to 1.1 parts per thousand). To identify the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, we analyzed stimulus- and response selection-related processes in neurophysiological data after Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE). Alcohol generally impaired behavioral task performance (accuracy and response times) during task switching. This was associated with impaired attentional processing of the task-relevant cue (reflected by reduced P1 and N1 amplitudes), which likely resulted in a larger need for reactive control at the later stage of response selection and control (reflected by increased fronto-central theta power). Without prior practice (similar to 30 minutes), the intoxicated participants further struggled to overcome the cognitive inhibition of a previously relevant task set (reflected by a larger backward inhibition effect). This was linked to reduced posterior theta power, which reflects alcohol-induced impairments in working memory capacity and task set-relevant memory retrieval. As individuals with similar to 30 min task practice did not show the same alcohol-related deficit, it may be deduced that (partial) task set automatization via stimulus-response associations may help to reduce the detrimental effects of alcohol on cognitive inhibition during task switching.

One possible explanation for this disconnection between state and trait positive affect is the extent to which individuals with schizophrenia engage in elaborative processing of positive stimuli. To assess this, we examined evoked gamma band activity in response to positive words over several seconds in a group with schizophrenia, a group with major depressive disorder, and a healthy control group. From a pre-stimulus baseline to 2000 ms after onset of the stimulus (henceforth, "early period"), the schizophrenia group showed a reliable increase in gamma activity compared to both the control and depressed groups, who did not differ from each other. In contrast, the depressed group showed a reliable increase in gamma activity from 2001 to 8000 ms (henceforth, "late period") compared to the other groups, who did not differ from each other. At the same time, the schizophrenia group showed a reliable decrease from the early to late period while the depressed group showed the opposite pattern. In addition, self-reported depression and social anhedonia in the schizophrenia group were related to decreased gamma band activity over the entire processing window. Overall, these results suggest that schizophrenia is associated with increased initial reactivity but decreased sustained elaborative processing over time, which could be related to decreased trait positive affect. The results also highlight the importance of considering depressive symptomology and anhedonia when examining emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods Eleven patients undergoing stereoelectroencephalography for seizure localization were recruited prospectively for local field potential (LFP) recording directly from the ANT. The SOZ was identified using line length and epileptogenicity index. Changes in power spectral density (PSD) were compared between the two anatomic sites as seizures (N = 53) transitioned from interictal baseline to the posttermination stage. Results At baseline, the thalamic LFPs were significantly lower and distinct from the SOZ with the presence of higher power in the fast ripple band (P < 0.001). Temporal changes in ictal power of neural activity within ANT mimic those of the SOZ, are increased significantly at seizure onset (P < 0.05), and are distinct for seizures that impaired awareness or that secondarily generalized (P < 0.05). The onset of seizure was preceded by a decrease in the mean power spectral density (PSD) in ANT and SOZ (P < 0.05). Neural activity correlated with different states of vigilance at seizure onset within the ANT but not in the SOZ (P = 0.005). Interpretation The ANT can be recruited at the onset of mesial temporal lobe seizures, and the recruitment pattern differs with seizure subtypes. Furthermore, changes in neural dynamics precede seizure onset and are widespread to involve temporo-thalamic regions, thereby providing an opportunity to intervene early with closed-loop DBS.

Intra-"cortical" activity during avian non-REM and REM sleep: variant and invariant traits between birds and mammals	SLEEP			English	Article						avian; NREM sleep; slow-waves; propagation; spindles; REM sleep; cortex	DIAZEPAM-INDUCED CHANGES; PIGEON COLUMBA-LIVIA; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; SPINDLE OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-WULST; LOCAL SLEEP; IN-VIVO; EEG; CORTEX; PROJECTIONS	Several mammalian-based theories propose that the varying patterns of neuronal activity occurring in wakefulness and sleep reflect different modes of information processing. Neocortical slow-waves, hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, and thalamocortical spindles occurring during mammalian non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep are proposed to play a role in systems-level memory consolidation. Birds show similar NREM and REM (rapid eye-movement) sleep stages to mammals; however, it is unclear whether all neurophysiological rhythms implicated in mammalian memory consolidation are also present. Moreover, it is unknown whether the propagation of slow-waves described in the mammalian neocortex occurs in the avian "cortex" during natural NREM sleep. We used a 32-channel silicon probe connected to a transmitter to make intracerebral recordings of the visual hyperpallium and thalamus in naturally sleeping pigeons (Columba livia). As in the mammalian neocortex, slow-waves during NREM sleep propagated through the hyperpallium. Propagation primarily occurred in the thalamic input layers of the hyperpallium, regions that also showed the greatest slow-wave activity (SWA). Spindles were not detected in both the visual hyperpallium, including regions receiving thalamic input, and thalamus, using a recording method that readily detects spindles in mammals. Interestingly, during REM sleep fast gamma bursts in the hyperpallium (when present) were restricted to the thalamic input layers. In addition, unlike mice, the decrease in SWA from NREM to REM sleep was the greatest in these layers. Taken together, these variant and invariant neurophysiological aspects of avian and mammalian sleep suggest that there may be associated mechanistic and functional similarities and differences between avian and mammalian sleep.

Neural correlates of infant action processing relate to theory of mind in early childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						alpha-ERD; effortful control; mu-ERD; social cognition; theory of mind; theta-ERS	BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; EXECUTIVE-FUNCTION; FALSE-BELIEF; EEG-ALPHA; SELECTIVELY REPRODUCE; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EFFORTFUL CONTROL; PRESCHOOL THEORY	The mechanisms that support infant action processing are thought to be involved in the development of later social cognition. While a growing body of research demonstrates longitudinal links between action processing and explicit theory of mind (TOM), it remains unclear why this link emerges in some measures of action encoding and not others. In this paper, we recruit neural measures as a unique lens into which aspects of human infant action processing (i.e., action encoding and action execution; age 7 months) are related to preschool TOM (age 3 years; n = 31). We test whether individual differences in recruiting the sensorimotor system or attention processes during action encoding predict individual differences in TOM. Results indicate that reduced occipital alpha during action encoding predicts TOM at age 3. This finding converges with behavioral work and suggests that attentional processes involved in action encoding may support TOM. We also test whether neural processing during action execution draws on the proto-substrates of effortful control (EC). Results indicate that frontal alpha oscillatory activity during action execution predicted EC at age 3-providing strong novel evidence that infant brain activity is longitudinally linked to EC. Further, we demonstrate that EC mediates the link between the frontal alpha response and TOM. This indirect effect is specific in terms of direction, neural response, and behavior. Together, these findings converge with behavioral research and demonstrate that domain general processes show strong links to early infant action processing and TOM.

Experimental data was recorded from eyes-opened volunteers during listening the musical chords by piano. Complexity estimation methods were compared to each other for classification of groups (professional musicians and non-musicians) by using both classifiers (support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB)) and statistical tests (one-way ANOVA) with respect to electrode locations. Permutation entropy (PermEn) is found to be the best metric (p << 0.0001, 98.37% and 98.41% accuracies for tonal and atonal ensembles) at fronto-temporal regions which are responsible for cognitive task evaluation and perception of sound. PermEn also provides the meaningful results at the whole cortex (p << 0.0001, 99.81% accuracy for both tonal and atonal ensembles) through SVM with Radial Basis kernels superior to Gaussians. Almost the similar performance is also obtained for temporal features. Although, performance improvements are observed for spectral methods with NB, the considerable better results are obtained with SVM. The results indicate that musical stimuli cause pattern variations instead of spectral variations on STABO due to relatively higher neuronal activities around auditory cortex. In conclusion, temporal regions produce response to auditory stimuli, while frontal area integrates the auditory task at the same time. As well, the parietal cortex produces neural information according to the degree of attention generated by environmental changes such as atonal stimuli. It can be clearly stated that musical experience enhances the neural encoding performance of sound tonality at mostly fronto-temporal regions.

J	Pena-Ortega, F				Pena-Ortega, Fernando			Brain Arrhythmias Induced by Amyloid Beta and Inflammation: Involvement in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Inflammation-related Pathologies	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Review						Amyloid; inflammation; oscillations; theta; gamma; epileptiform	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RESTING-STATE FMRI; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; EEG DELTA-ACTIVITY; NON-REM SLEEP; MOUSE MODEL	A variety of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), involve amyloid beta (A beta) accumulation and/or neuroinflammation, which can alter synaptic and neural circuit functions. Consequently, these pathological conditions induce changes in neural network rhythmic activity (brain arrhythmias), which affects many brain functions. Neural network rhythms are involved in information processing, storage and retrieval, which are essential for memory consolidation, executive functioning and sensory processing. Therefore, brain arrhythmias could have catastrophic effects on circuit function, underlying the symptoms of various neurological diseases. Moreover, brain arrhythmias can serve as biomarkers for a variety of brain diseases. The aim of this review is to provide evidence linking AD and inflammation to neural network dysfunction, focusing on alterations in brain rhythms and their impact on cognition and sensory processing. I reviewed the most common brain arrhythmias characterized in AD, in AD transgenic models and those induced by A beta. In addition, I reviewed the modulations of brain rhythms in neuroinflammatory diseases and those induced by immunogens, interleukins and microglia. This review reveals that A beta and inflammation produce a complex set of effects on neural network function, which are related to the induction of brain arrhythmias and hyperexcitability, both closely related to behavioral alterations. Understanding these brain arrhythmias can help to develop therapeutic strategies to halt or prevent these neural network alterations and treat not only the arrhythmias but also the symptoms of AD and other inflammation-related pathologies.

However, it remains unknown how this novel and challenging gait training shapes the cortico-cortical network and cortico-spinal network during walking in chronic stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to examine how a novel type of gait training, which is an unfamiliar but effective task for people with chronic stroke, enhances brain reorganization.MethodsSubjects in the experimental and control groups received 30min of turning-based treadmill training and regular treadmill training, respectively. Cortico-cortical connectivity and cortico-muscular connectivity during walking and gait performance were assessed before and after completing the 12-session training.ResultsEighteen subjects (n=9 per group) with a mean age of 52.59.7years and an overground walking speed of 0.610.26m/s consented and participated in this study. There were significant group by time interactions for gait speed, temporal gait symmetry, and cortico-cortical connectivity as well as cortico-muscular connectivity in walk-related frequency (24-40Hz) over the frontal-central-parietal areas. Compared with the regular treadmill training, the turning-based treadmill training resulted in greater improvements in these measures. Moreover, the increases in cortico-cortical connectivity and cortico-muscular connectivity while walking were associated with improvements in temporal gait symmetry.Conclusions Our findings suggest this novel turning-based treadmill training is effective for enhancing brain functional reorganization underlying cortico-cortical and corticomuscular mechanisms and thus may result in gait improvement in people with chronic stroke.Trial registration ACTRN12617000190303.

Yet the low-frequency neural dynamics of distinct task-specific and domain-general mechanisms sub-serving mental flexibility are still ill-defined. Here we estimated phase electroencephalogram synchronization by using inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) at the source space while twenty six young participants were intermittently cued to switch or repeat their perceptual categorization rule of Gabor gratings varying in color and thickness (switch task). Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether a proactive control is associated with connectivity only in the frontoparietal theta network, or also involves distinct neural connectivity within the delta band, as distinct neural signatures while preparing to switch or repeat a task set, respectively. To this end, we focused the analysis on late-latencies (from 500 to 800 msec post-cue onset), since they are known to be associated with top-down cognitive control processes. We confirmed that proactive control during a task switch was associated with frontoparietal theta connectivity. But importantly, we also found a distinct role of delta band oscillatory synchronization in proactive control, engaging more posterior frontotemporal regions as opposed to frontoparietal theta connectivity. Additionally, we built a regression model by using the ITPC results in delta and theta bands as predictors, and the behavioral accuracy in the switch task as the criterion, obtaining significant results for both frequency bands. All these findings support the existence of distinct proactive cognitive control processes related to functionally distinct though highly complementary theta and delta frontoparietal and temporoparietal oscillatory networks at late-latency temporal scales.

Current theories postulate a two-stage process in which early visual areas perform feature extraction, whereas higher-order regions perform attentional selection. Such a model implies iterative communication between low- and high-level regions to sequentially select candidate targets in the array, focus attention on these elements, and eventually permit target recognition. This leads to two independent predictions: (1) high-level, attentional regions and (2) early visual regions should both be involved periodically during the search. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the frontal eye field (FEF) in humans, known to be involved in attentional selection, at various delays while observers performed a difficult, attentional search task. We observed a periodic pattern of interference at similar to 6 Hz (theta) suggesting that the FEF is periodically involved during this difficult search task. We further compared this result with two previous studies (Dugue et al., 2011, 2015a) in which a similar TMS procedure was applied over the early visual cortex (V1) while observers performed the same task. This analysis revealed the same pattern of interference, i.e., V1 is periodically involved during this difficult search task, at the theta frequency. Past V1 evidence reappraised for this paper, together with our current FEF results, confirm both of our independent predictions, and suggest that difficult search is supported by low- and high-level regions, each involved periodically at the theta frequency.

However, it remains unclear whether alterations of TRN activity can account for abnormal electroencephalographic activity observed in patients, namely reduced spindles (10-15 Hz) during sleep and increased delta (0.5-4 Hz) and gamma-band activity (30-80 Hz) during wakefulness. Here, we utilized optogenetic and reverse-microdialysis approaches to modulate activity of the major subpopulation ofTRN GABAergic neurons, which express the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), and are implicated in schizophrenia dysfunction. An automated algorithm with enhanced efficiency and reproducibility compared to manual detection was used for sleep spindle assessment. A novel, low power, waxing-and-waning optogenetic stimulation paradigm preferentially induced spindles that were indistinguishable from spontaneously occurring sleep spindles without altering the behavioral state, when compared to a single pulse laser stimulation used by us and others. Direct optogenetic inhibition ofTRN-PV neurons was ineffective in blocking spindles but increased both wakefulness and cortical delta/gamma activity, as well as impaired the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response. For the first time we demonstrate that spindle density is markedly reduced by (i) optogenetic stimulation of a major GABA/PV inhibitory input to TRN arising from basal forebrain parvalbumin neurons (BF-PV) and; (ii) localized pharmacological inhibition of low-threshold calcium channels, implicated as a genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. Together with clinical findings, our results support impaired TRN-PV neuron activity as a potential cause of schizophrenia-linked abnormalities in cortical delta, gamma, and spindle activity. Modulation of the BF-PV input to TRN may improve these neural abnormalities.

Beyond Hypnograms: Assessing Sleep Stability Using Acoustic and Electrical Stimulation	NEUROMODULATION			English	Article						PSG; sleep architecture; sleep ERP; sleep stability; sleep tACS	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS	Objective Conventional polysomnographic recordings reflect brain dynamics associated with sleep architecture. We hypothesized that noninvasive tools like transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and acoustic stimulation (for generating event related potentials [ERPs]) would help to predict sleep stability and provide a window to actively assess brain activity during sleep. Materials and Methods Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in the multiple whole-night polysomnography (PSG) recording protocol. Acoustic tones (100 msec duration) were presented throughout night to evaluate ERP during sleep. Furthermore, 30 sec tACS were presented during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep on subsequent two nights without disturbing the subject's sleep. For ERP analysis, event-locked artifact-free epochs from each sleep stage were averaged separately. For tACS analysis, 30 sec prestimulus and poststimulus artifact-free EEG epochs were subjected to bootstrapping-based comparison of power spectral values. Results Acoustic stimulation generated sleep stage-dependent ERP components (N350, N550, and P900) in all participants. The tACS stimulation during NREM sleep (0.75 Hz) increased parietal delta power but decreased frontocentral theta and increased frontal gamma power when delivered during REM sleep (40Hz). These interventions provide details on sleep stability as larger N550-P900 ERP-complex correlated with lower NREM disruptions (Spearman's rho = -0.553; p = 0.049; n = 10) and tACS-related theta power perturbation with higher REM disruptions (Spearman's rho = 0.734; p = 0.030; n = 7). Conclusions Noninvasive brain stimulation approaches such as sleep ERP and sleep tACS are reliable tools to evaluate sleep stability during NREM and REM sleep, respectively, but more large-sample studies are warranted.

Toward an understanding of alpha gating in a discrete aiming task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha gating; golf putting; neural efficiency; practice variability	CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE; SCHEMA THEORY; MOTOR SKILL; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS; MARKSMEN; MARKER	Prior to and during movement, oscillatory alpha activity gates cognitive resources toward motor areas of the cortex by inhibiting neuronal excitability in nonmotor areas. The present study examined the effect of manipulating target variability on this alpha gating phenomenon. Using a baseline-test-retention design, we measured EEG alpha power, performance accuracy, and task difficulty in 32 recreational golfers as they putted golf balls (20 per target) to one central target (baseline, retention) and four targets of different directions and extents (manipulation). For participants in the random group (n = 16), target location varied with each repetition in a random fashion, whereas for participants in the blocked group (n = 16), it was kept constant within blocks. Regional analyses revealed a focal pattern of lower central alpha and higher occipital and temporal alpha. This topography was specific to preparation for movement and was associated with performance: smallest performance errors were preceded by decreased central combined with increased occipital alpha. The random group performed worse than the blocked group and found the task more difficult. Importantly, left temporal alpha prior to movement onset was lower for the random group than the blocked group. No group differences were found at baseline or retention. Our study proved that alpha gating can be altered by manipulating intertrial variability and thereby demonstrated the utility of the alpha gating model. Our findings underscore the importance of inhibiting occipital and left temporal areas when performing movements and provide further evidence that alpha gating reflects neural efficiency during motor tasks.

We have different meditation practices associated with many cultures and traditions across the globe. Current literature suggests significant changes in the neural activity among the different practices of meditation, as each of these practices contributes to distinct physiological and psychological effects. Although this is the case, we want to find out if there is an underlying commonality among all these different practices. Thus, we ask the following questions related to different practices of meditation, the traditional goal of meditation and its significance-what is the central purpose of meditation? Do traditions define the final goal of all the practices of meditation? Are the purpose and goal of these practices different or is there a common goal to be attained through all these distinct practices? Embracing the traditional perspective, through this paper, we want to emphasize that, although these techniques and practices may appear different on the periphery, eventually, they seem to subject one to the same experience at the end, a natural meditative state (discussed in various spiritual traditions as the goal of meditation). In view of future studies on different meditation practices and also those exploring this subjective state, we offer some interesting ideas based on the traditional insights into meditation. In this context, we would also like to make a few comments on the way contemporary researchers view different practices of meditation.	[Reddy, J.

Frontal theta predicts specific cognitive control-induced behavioural changes beyond general reaction time slowing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Medial prefrontal cortex; Task switch; Theta; Midfrontal theta; Cognitive control; Single trial regression	TASK-SET CONTROL; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; CONFLICT; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; ERROR; EEG; RECONFIGURATION; ALPHA; POWER	Investigations into the neurophysiological underpinnings of control suggest that frontal theta activity is increased with the need for control. However, these studies typically show this link by reporting associations between increased theta and RT slowing - a process that is contemporaneous with cognitive control but does not strictly reflect the specific use of control. In this study, we assessed frontal theta responses that underpinned the switch cost in task switching - a specific index of cognitive control that does not rely exclusively on RT slowing. Here, we utilised a single-trial regression approach to assess 1) how cognitive control demands beyond simple RT slowing were linked to midfrontal theta and 2) whether midfrontal theta effects remained stable over time. In a large cohort that included a longitudinal subsample, we found that midfrontal theta was modulated by switch costs, with enhanced theta power when preparing to switch vs. repeating a task. These effects were reliable after a two-year interval (Cronbach's alpha.39-0.74). In contrast, we found that trial-by-trial modulations of midfrontal theta power predicted the size of the switch cost - so that switch trials with increased theta produced smaller switch costs. Interestingly, these relationships between theta and behaviour were less stable over time (Cronbach's alpha 0-0.61), with participants first using both delta and theta bands to influence behaviour whereas after two years only theta associations with behaviour remained. Together, these findings suggest midfrontal theta supports the need for control beyond simple RT slowing and reveal that midfrontal theta effects remain relatively stable over time.

J	Murin, Y; Goldsmith, A; Aazhang, B				Murin, Yonathan; Goldsmith, Andrea; Aazhang, Behnaam			Estimating the Memory Order of Electrocorticography Recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electrocorticography recordings; Markov order; non-parametric estimation; prediction	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION; BRAIN; EEG; PREDICTION; NETWORKS; MODEL; FMRI	Objective: This paper presents a data-driven method for estimating the memory order (the average length of the statistical dependence of a given sample on previous samples) of a recorded electrocorticography (ECoG) sequence. Methods: The proposed inference method is based on the relationship between the loss in predicting the next sample in a time-series and the dependence of this sample on the previous samples. Specifically, the memory order is estimated to be the number of past samples that minimize the least squares error (LSE) in predicting the next sample. To deal with the lack of an analytical model for ECoG recordings, the proposed method combines a collection of different predictors, thereby achieving LSE at least as low as the LSE achieved by each of the different predictors. Results: ECoG recordings from six patients with epilepsy were analyzed, and the empirical cumulative density functions (ECDFs) of the memory orders estimated from these recordings were generated, for rest as well as pre-ictal time intervals. For pre-ictal time intervals, the electrodes corresponding to the seizure-onset-zone were separately analyzed. The estimated ECDFs were different between patients and between different types of blocks. For all the analyzed patients, the estimated memory orders were on the order of tens of milliseconds (up to 100 ms). Significance: The proposed method facilitates the estimation of the causal associations between ECoG recordings, as these associations strongly depend on the recordings' memory. An improved estimation of causal associations can improve the performance of algorithms that use ECoG recordings to localize the epileptogenic zone. Such algorithms can aid doctors in their pre-surgical planning for the surgery of patients with epilepsy.

J	Man, Y; Zheng, KK				Man, Yi; Zheng, Kuikui			QUALITATIVE DIAGNOSIS OF PCT AND BEAM IN ACUTE CEREBRAL INFARCTION	ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA			English	Article						Acute cerebral infarction; PCT; BEAM; hemodynamics	CT-PERFUSION; DUAL-ENERGY; PREDICTION; CANCER	Objective: To explore the qualitative diagnosis of perfusion computed tomography (PCT) and brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM) in acute cerebral infarction, the quantitative evaluation of the severity of the lesion, and the application value of in the judgment of infarct area and ischemic penumbra (IP), so as to guide the clinical treatment. Methods: 41 patients with acute cerebral infarction within 24 hours of onset in hospitalized in First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 2017 to December 2017 were selected. All patients were examined by routine CT, PCT and BEAM. Routine CT examination was based on OM line, scanning upward, and 5mm thickness, scanning 20 levels in total. After routine CT scan, 80 reconstructed images of the basal ganglia and its upper or lower layers were processed with a special CT perfusion software package. The perfusion images were obtained, the parameters of the brain's sensory interested areas were measured, and the images were analyzed quantitatively. The sensory interested areas were animated by hand, either on one side or in the form of mirror image in the corresponding area. BEAM was performed with a randomly worn electrode cap. 21 electrodes were placed according to the international 10/20 system, and the earlobes were used as reference electrodes. The quiet closed-eye EEG was recorded for 3 minutes. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was conducted with 30 seconds non-interference EEG input into the computer to display the frequency band power distribution map. The band power distribution map was analyzed to observe the characteristics of routine CT, PCT and BEAM in acute stage of cerebral infarction, calculate their positive rates and make statistical analysis. Results: Firstly, within 24 hours after the onset of cerebral infarction, the positive rate of routine CT was 34.1%, PCT was 87.8%, and BEAM was 90.2%. Statistical analysis showed that the positive rates of routine CT and PCT, routine CT and BEAM were significantly different (P<0.01), and there was no significant difference between BEAM and PCT (P=1). Secondly, BEAM could accurately determine the lesion side, but the positioning accuracy was worse than that of PCT, and PCT positioning and lateral positioning were very accurate. Parameters cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and time to peak (TP) values of PCT were significantly different between the central and peripheral lesions (P<0.01), while time to start (TS) and peak enhancement (PE) values were significantly different (P<0.05). CBF values in the central and peripheral lesions were 623 +/- 2.71 mL/min/100g) and 19.15 +/- 4.68 mL/min/100g), respectively. CBF values between the mean lesion area and the corresponding contralateral areas were significantly different (P<0.01), and CBV and TP values were also different (P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in TS and PE values (P >= 0.05). The parameters of PCT were significantly different among the mild, moderate and severe groups (P<0.01). There were significant differences in CBF, CBV and TP among the three groups. There were significant differences in TS and PE between the mild, moderate and severe groups, but there were no significant differences between the moderate and severe groups. There was a positive correlation between CBF and CBV in PCT, and a negative correlation between CBF and TP. There was a significant difference between the average power of BEAM 8 band power diagram in abnormal leads in the lesion area and the average power of the corresponding area in the opposite side. Conclusion: PCT can improve the diagnostic rate of acute cerebral infarction, visualize and quantify the severity of the disease, and discover hemodynamic changes beyond the infarct focus. BEAM can diagnose acute cerebral infarction early, and can accurately determine its side, showing IP with abnormal functions.The localization of BEAM is not as accurate as PCT; but because of the limitation of perfusion layer, the range of PCT is not as wide as BEAM.

Higher grand-average cortical response amplitudes, an increased interhemispheric response asymmetry, and lack of amplitude habituation were less consistently demonstrated in response to any kind of sensory stimulation in MA patients. Studies with single-pulse and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have reported abnormal cortical responsivity manifesting as greater motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, lower threshold for phosphenes production, and paradoxical effects in response to both depressing or enhancing repetitive TMS methodologies. Studies of the trigeminal system in MA are sparse and the few available showed lack of blink reflex habituation and abnormal findings on SFEMG reflecting subclinical, probably inherited, dysfunctions of neuromuscular transmission. The limited studies that were able to investigate patients during the aura revealed suppression of evoked potentials, desynchronization in extrastriate areas and in the temporal lobe, and large variations in direct current potentials with magnetoelectroencephalography. Contrary to what has been observed in the most common forms of migraine, patients with familial hemiplegic migraine show greater habituation in response to visual and trigeminal stimuli, as well as a higher motor threshold and a lower MEP amplitude than healthy subjects.ConclusionSince most of the electrophysiological abnormalities mentioned above were more frequently present and had a greater amplitude in migraine with aura than in migraine without aura, neurophysiological techniques have been shown to be of great help in the search for the pathophysiological basis of migraine aura.

Auditory steady-state response at 40-Hz (40-Hz ASSR) is utilized as an index of gamma activity and is proposed as a biomarker of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, the link between ASSRs and cognitive functions is not clear. This study explores a possible relationship between the performance on cognitive tasks and the 40-Hz ASSRs in a controlled uniform sample of young healthy males, as age and sex may have complex influence on ASSRs. Twenty-eight young healthy male volunteers participated (mean age +/- SD 25.8 +/- 3.3) in the study. The 40-Hz click trains (500 ms) were presented 150 times with an inter-stimulus interval set at 700-1000 ms. The phase-locking index (PLI) and event-related power perturbation (ERSP) of the ASSR were calculated in the 200-500 ms latency range, which corresponds to the steady part of the response. The Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) task battery was used to assess five cognitive subdomains: the Choice response time task, the Stroop test, the Tower of London test, the Lexical decision task and the Semantic categorisation task. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to access the relationships; no multiple-test correction was applied as the tests were explorative in nature. A significant positive correlation was observed for the late-latency gamma and the mean number of steps in the Tower of London task reflecting planning and problem-solving abilities. These findings support the concept that 40-Hz ASSR might highlight top-down mechanisms which are related to cognitive functioning. Therefore, 40-Hz ASSRs can be used to explore the relationship between cognitive functioning and neurophysiological indices of brain activity.

While the extent of the anatomical brain lesion is only poorly correlated with the prognosis, functional measures of cortical synchrony, brain networks and cortical plasticity seem to be good predictors of clinical recovery. In this field, gamma ( > 30 Hz) cortical synchrony is an ideal marker of brain function, as it plays a crucial role for the integration of information, it is an indirect marker of Glutamate/GABA balance and it directly estimates the reserve of parvalbulin-positive neurons, key players in synaptic plasticity. In this study we measured gamma synchronization driven by external auditory stimulation with magnetoencephalography and tested whether it was predictive of the clinical outcome in stroke survivors undergoing intensive rehabilitation in a tertiary rehabilitation center. Material and methods: Eleven stroke survivors undergoing intensive rehabilitation were prospectively recruited. Gamma synchrony was measured non-invasively within one month from stroke onset with magnetoencephalography, both at rest and during entrainment with external 40 Hz amplitude modulated binaural sounds. Lesion location and volume were quantitatively assessed through a high-resolution anatomical MRI. Barthel index (BI) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scales were measured at the beginning and at the end of the admission to the rehabilitation unit. Results: The spatial distribution of cortical gamma synchrony was altered, and the physiological right hemispheric dominance observed in healthy controls was attenuated or lost. Entrained gamma synchronization (but not resting state gamma synchrony) showed a very high correlation with the clinical status at both admission and discharge (both BI and FIM). Neither clinical status nor gamma synchrony showed a correlation with lesion volume. Conclusions: Cortical gamma synchrony related to auditory entrainment can be reliably measured in stroke patients. Gamma synchrony is strongly associated with the clinical outcome of stroke survivors undergoing rehabilitation.

TTV describes the variability in the amplitude of the stimulus-evoked response across trials, and it is generally observed to be reduced, or quenched. While such TTV quenching has been observed on both the cellular and regional levels, its exact behavioral relevance and neuronal basis remains unclear. Applying a novel paradigm for testing neural markers of individuality in internally-guided decision-making, we here investigated whether TTV (i) represents an individually specific response by comparing individualized vs shared stimuli; and (ii) is mediated by the complexity of prestimulus activity as measured by the Lempel-Ziv Complexity index (LZC). We observed that TTV - and other electrophysiological markers such as ERP, ERSP, and ITC - showed first significant differences between individualized and shared stimuli (while controlling for task-related effects) specifically in the alpha and beta frequency bands, and secondly that TTV in the beta band correlated significantly with reaction time and eLORETA activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the complexity (LZC) of neuronal activity is higher in the prestimulus period while it decreases during the poststimulus period, with the former also correlating specifically with poststimulus individualized TTV in alpha (but not with shared Try). Together, our results show that the Try represents a marker of 'neural individualization' which, being related to internal processes on both neural and psychological levels, is mediated by the information complexity of prestimulus activity. More generally, our results inform the pre-post-stimulus dynamics of rest-stimulus interaction, which is a basic and ubiquitous neural phenomenon in the brain and highly relevant for mental features including their individuality.

It is now more compelling to consider these nonauditory cortices and the whole "tinnitus network" as targets for tinnitus treatment to achieve a better outcome. Objective: We aimed to investigate the effects of active dual-site rTMS treatment in tinnitus reduction using a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Method: In study 1, the dual-site rTMS treatment group (n = 17) was treated daily for 4 consecutive days. The sham group (n = 13) also visited the clinic for 4 days; they received sham treatment for the same duration as the dual-site rTMS treatment group. In study 2, the rTMS treatment protocol was exactly the same as in study 1. Magnetoencephalography recordings were performed before and 1 week after the last rTMS treatment. The outcome measure was the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score and the visual analog scale score. The effects of treatment were assessed 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after rTMS treatment in study 1. Then the mean band power and network changes were compared between pre- and post-treatment values after rTMS in study 2. Result: Patients in the dual-site rTMS treatment group exhibited significantly improved THI scores at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after rTMS treatment compared with the pretreatment scores. However, the sham group did not show any significant reduction in THI scores. When the mean band power changes were compared between pre- and post-treatment assessments, an increased oscillation power was observed in the alpha band after rTMS. Conclusion: A beneficial effect of rTMS on tinnitus suppression was found in the dual-site active rTMS group, but not in the sham rTMS group.

Macroscopic approaches applied at the level of the whole organism, view sleep as a global behaviour and allow for investigation into aspects such as the effects of insufficient or disrupted sleep on cognitive function, metabolism, thermoregulation and sensory processing. While significant progress has been achieved using such large-scale approaches, the inherent complexity of sleep-wake regulation has necessitated the development of methods which tackle specific aspects of sleep in isolation. One way this may be achieved is by investigating specific cellular or molecular phenomena in the whole organism in situ, either during spontaneous or induced sleep-wake states. This approach has greatly advanced our knowledge about the electrophysiology and pharmacology of ion channels, specific receptors, intracellular pathways and the small networks implicated in the control and regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Importantly though, there are a variety of external and internal factors that influence global behavioural states which are difficult to control for using these approaches. For this reason, over the last few decades, ex vivo experimental models have become increasingly popular and have greatly advanced our understanding of many fundamental aspects of sleep, including the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of sleep states, sleep regulation, the origin and dynamics of specific sleep oscillations, network homeostasis as well as the functional roles of sleep. This chapter will focus on the use of small neuronal networks as experimental models and will highlight the most significant and novel insights these approaches have provided.

Measuring Neural Mechanisms Underlying Sleep-Dependent Memory Consolidation During Naps in Early Childhood	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 152; polysomnography; memory; consolidation; actigraphy; sleep spindles; visuospatial memory; early childhood; nap; sleep	SLOW OSCILLATIONS; SPINDLES; PATTERNS; CHILDREN	Sleep is critical for daily functioning. One important function of sleep is the consolidation of memories, a process that makes them stronger and less vulnerable to interference. The neural mechanisms underlying the benefit of sleep for memory can be investigated using polysomnography (PSG). PSG is a combination of physiological recordings including signals from the brain (EEG), eyes (EOG), and muscles (EMG) that are used to classify sleep stages. In this protocol, we describe how PSG can be used in conjunction with behavioral memory assessments, actigraphy, and parent-report to examine sleep-dependent memory consolidation. The focus of this protocol is on early childhood, a period of significance as children transition from biphasic sleep (consisting of a nap and overnight sleep) to monophasic sleep (overnight sleep only). The effects of sleep on memory performance are measured using a visuospatial memory assessment across periods of sleep and wakeful-rest. A combination of actigraphy and parent report is used to assess sleep rhythms (i.e., characterizing children as habitual or non-habitual nappers). Finally, PSG is used to characterize sleep stages and qualities of those stages (such as frequencies and the presence of spindles) during naps. The advantage of using PSG is that it is the only tool currently available to assess sleep quality and sleep architecture, pointing to the relevant brain state that supports memory consolidation. The main limitations of PSG are the length of time it takes to prepare the recording montage and that recordings are typically taken over one sleep bought. These limitations can be overcome by engaging young participants in distracting tasks during application and combining PSG with actigraphy and self/parent-report measures to characterize sleep cycles. Together, this unique combination of methods allows for investigations into how naps support learning in preschool children.

J	Lazic, K; Ciric, J; Saponjic, J				Lazic, Katarina; Ciric, Jelena; Saponjic, Jasna			Sleep spindle dynamics during NREM and REM sleep following distinct general anaesthesia in control rats and in a rat model of Parkinson's disease cholinopathy	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						high voltage sleep spindles; ketamine/diazepam; pentobarbital; post-anaesthesia NREM sleep; post-anaesthesia REM sleep; sleep spindles	EEG MICROSTRUCTURE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; STATE; OSCILLATIONS; DISORDER; NETWORK; ACTIVATION; KETAMINE; RELEASE	On the basis of our previous studies and the important role of the thalamo-cortical network in states of unconsciousness, such as anaesthesia and sleep, and in sleep spindles generation, we investigated sleep spindles (SS) and high-voltage sleep spindle (HVS) dynamics during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following different types of general anaesthesia in both physiological controls and in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) cholinopathy, to follow the impact of anaesthesia on post-anaesthesia sleep at the thalamo-cortical level through an altered sleep spindle dynamics. We recorded 6 hr of spontaneous sleep in all rats, both before and 48 hr after ketamine/diazepam or pentobarbital anaesthesia, and we used 1 hr of NREM or REM sleep from each to validate visually the automatically detected SS or HVS for their extraction and analysis. In the controls, SS occurred mainly during NREM, whereas HVS occurred only during REM sleep. Ketamine/diazepam anaesthesia promoted HVS, prolonged SS during NREM, induced HVS of increased frequency during REM, and increased SS/HVS densities during REM versus NREM sleep. Pentobarbital anaesthesia decreased the frequency of SS during NREM and the HVS density during REM sleep. Although the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus lesion prolonged SS only during NREM sleep, in these rats, ketamine/diazepam anaesthesia suppressed HVS during both sleep states, whereas pentobarbital anaesthesia promoted HVS during REM sleep. The different impacts of two anaesthetic regimens on the thalamo-cortical regulatory network are expressed through their distinct sleep spindle generation and dynamics that are dependent on the NREM and REM state regulatory neuronal substrate.

Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity in Schizophrenia with Magnetoencephalography and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Do Different Timescales Tell a Different Story?	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC); functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); magnetoencephalography (MEG); schizophrenia	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE FMRI; MEG; EEG; BOLD; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNAL; DYSCONNECTIVITY; DISCONNECTION	The importance of how brain networks function together to create brain states has become increasingly recognized. Therefore, an investigation of eyes-open resting-state dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) of healthy controls (HC) versus that of schizophrenia patients (SP) via both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a novel magnetoencephalography (MEG) pipeline was completed. The fMRI analysis used a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to determine the networks on which the dFNC was based. The MEG analysis utilized a source space activity estimate (minimum norm estimate [MNE]/dynamic statistical parametric mapping [dSPM]) whose result was the input to a spatial ICA, on which the networks of the MEG dFNC were based. We found that dFNC measures reveal significant differences between HC and SP, which depended on the imaging modality. Consistent with previous findings, a dFNC analysis predicated on fMRI data revealed HC and SP remain in different overall brain states (defined by a k-means clustering of network correlations) for significantly different periods of time, with SP spending less time in a highly connected state. The MEG dFNC, in contrast, revealed group differences in more global statistics: SP changed between meta-states (k-means cluster states that are allowed to overlap in time) significantly more often and to states that were more different, relative to HC. MEG dFNC also revealed a highly connected state where a significant difference was observed in interindividual variability, with greater variability among SP. Overall, our results show that fMRI and MEG reveal between-group functional connectivity differences in distinct ways, highlighting the utility of using each of the modalities individually, or potentially a combination of modalities, to better inform our understanding of disorders such as schizophrenia.

However, compared with pharmacological treatment, previous studies have reported that a relatively limited proportion of patients respond to tDCS treatment. In addition, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tDCS treatment remain unclear, making it difficult to identify response predictors for tDCS treatment based on neurophysiological function. Because treatment effects are achieved by repetitive application of tDCS, studying the immediate effects of tDCS in depressive patients could extend understanding of its treatment mechanisms. However, immediate changes in a single session of tDCS are not well documented. Thus, in the current study, we focused on the immediate impact of tDCS and its association with pre-stimulus brain activity. To address this question, we applied anodal tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in 14 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 19 healthy controls (HCs), at an intensity of 1.0 mA for 20 min in a single session. To evaluate anxiety, the state trait anxiety inventory was completed before and after tDCS. We recorded resting electroencephalography before tDCS, and calculated electrical neuronal activity in the theta and alpha frequency bands using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. We found that, during application of left DLPFC tDCS to patients with MDD, the anxiety reduction effect of tDCS was related to higher baseline theta-band activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and no medication with benzodiazepine used as hypnotic. For DMPFC stimulation in MDD, the anxiety reduction effect was associated with lower baseline alpha-band activity in the left inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, in HCs, the anxiety reduction effect was associated with higher baseline alpha activity in the precuneus during DMPFC stimulation. The current results suggest that the association between pre-tDCS brain activity and the anxiety reduction effect of tDCS depends on psychopathology (depressed or non-depressed) as well as the site of stimulation (DMPFC or left DLPFC) and insomnia. Furthermore, the results suggest that tDCS response might be associated with baseline resting state electrophysiological neural activity.

It is therefore important to better understand how age-related differences in neurostructural factors such as cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA) are related to neurophysiological sensitivity to speech cues in younger and older adults. Age-related differences in CT and CSA of bilateral auditory-related areas were extracted using FreeSurfer in younger and older adults with normal peripheral hearing. Behavioral and neurophysiological sensitivity to prosodic speech cues (word stress and fundamental frequency of oscillation) was evaluated using discrimination tasks and a passive oddball paradigm, while EEG was recorded, to quantify mismatch negativity responses. Results revealed (a) higher neural sensitivity (i.e., larger mismatch negativity responses) to word stress in older adults compared to younger adults, suggesting a higher importance of prosodic speech cues in the speech processing of older adults, and (b) lower CT in auditory-related regions in older compared to younger individuals, suggesting neuronal loss associated with aging. Within the older age group, less neuronal loss (i.e., higher CT) in a right auditory-related area (i.e., the supratemporal sulcus) was related to better performance in fundamental frequency discrimination, while higher CSA in left auditory-related areas was associated with higher neural sensitivity toward prosodic speech cues as evident in the mismatch negativity patterns. Overall, our results offer evidence for neurostructural changes in aging that are associated with differences in the extent to which left and right auditory-related areas are involved in speech processing in older adults. We argue that exploring age-related differences in brain structure and function associated with decline in speech perception in older adults may help develop much needed rehabilitation strategies for older adults with central age-related hearing loss.

Mechanisms of Persistent Neurobiological Changes Following Adolescent Alcohol Exposure: NADIA Consortium Findings	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Review						Adolescence; Binge Drinking; Development; Neuroimmune; Epigenetic; Behavior; Acetylcholine	CHRONIC-INTERMITTENT ETHANOL; EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN REGIONAL VOLUMES; BINGE-PATTERN ETHANOL; ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; ADULT RATS; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; VAPOR EXPOSURE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PROTRACTED WITHDRAWAL	The Neurobiology of Adolescent Drinking in Adulthood (NADIA) Consortium has focused on the impact of adolescent binge drinking on brain development, particularly on effects that persist into adulthood. Adolescent binge drinking is common, and while many factors contribute to human brain development and alcohol use during adolescence, animal models are critical for understanding the specific consequences of alcohol exposure during this developmental period and the underlying mechanisms. Using adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure models, NADIA investigators identified long-lasting AIE-induced changes in adult behavior that are consistent with observations in humans, such as increased alcohol drinking, increased anxiety (particularly social anxiety), increased impulsivity, reduced behavioral flexibility, impaired memory, disrupted sleep, and altered responses to alcohol. These behavioral changes are associated with multiple molecular, cellular, and physiological alterations in the brain that persist long after AIE exposure. At the molecular level, AIE results in long-lasting changes in neuroimmune/trophic factor balance and epigenetic-microRNA (miRNA) signaling across glia and neurons. At the cellular level, AIE history is associated in adulthood with reduced expression of cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neuron markers, attenuated cortical thickness, decreased neurogenesis, and altered dendritic spine and glial morphology. This constellation of molecular and cellular adaptations to AIE likely contributes to observed alterations in neurophysiology, measured by synaptic physiology, EEG patterns, and functional connectivity. Many of these AIE-induced brain changes replicate findings seen in postmortem brains of humans with alcohol use disorder (AUD). NADIA researchers are now elucidating mechanisms of these adaptations. Emerging data demonstrate that exercise, antiinflammatory drugs, anticholinesterases, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and other pharmacological compounds are able to prevent (administered during AIE) and/or reverse (given after AIE) AIE-induced pathology in adulthood. These studies support hypotheses that adolescent binge drinking increases risk of adult hazardous drinking and influences brain development, and may provide insight into novel therapeutic targets for AIE-induced neuropathology and AUDs.

Src deficient mice demonstrate behavioral and electrophysiological alterations relevant to psychiatric and developmental disease	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						NMDA; Schizophrenia; EEG; MMN; ERP; Social interaction; Working memory	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY DEFICITS; NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MUTANT MICE; C-SRC; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DOPAMINE; KETAMINE; AUTISM; OSCILLATIONS	Much evidence suggests that hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) may contribute broadly towards a subset of molecular, cognitive and behavioral abnormalities common among psychiatric and developmental diseases. However, lithe is known about the specific molecular changes that lead to NMDAR dysfunction. As such, personalized approaches to remediating NMDAR dysfunction based on a specific etiology remains a challenge. Sarcoma tyrosine kinase (Src) serves as a hub for multiple signaling mechanisms affecting GluN2 phosphorylation and can be disrupted by convergent alterations of various signaling pathways. We recently showed reduced Src signaling in post mortem tissue from schizophrenia patients, despite increased MK-801 binding and NMDA receptor complex expression in the postsynaptic density (PSD). These data suggest that Src dysregulation may be an important underlying mechanism responsible for reduced glutamate signaling. Despite this evidence for a central role of Src in NMDAR signaling, little is known about how reductions in Src activity might regulate phenotypic changes in cognition and behavior. As such, the current study sought to characterize behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes in mice heterozygous for the Src Act gene (Src + / - mice). Src + / - mice demonstrated decreased sociability and working memory relative to Src + / + (WT) mice while no significant differences were seen on locomotive activity and anxiety-related behavior. In relation to WT mice, Src + / - mice showed decreased mid-latency P20 auditory event related potential (aERP) amplitudes, decreased mismatch negativity (MMN) and decreased evoked gamma power, which was only present in males. These data indicate that Src + / - mice are a promising new model to help understand the pathophysiology of these electrophysiological, behavioral and cognitive changes. As such, we propose that Src + / - mice can be used in the future to evaluate potential therapeutic approaches by targeting increased Src activity as a common final pathway for multiple etiologies of SCZ and other diseases characterized by reduced glutamate function.

Spatial and spectral trajectories in typical neurodevelopment from childhood to middle age	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neurodevelopment; MEG; Functional connectivity; Phase synchronisation; Power spectral density; Maturational trajectories; Resting state	HUMAN-BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; NETWORKS; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MATURATION; EEG; SYNCHRONY	Detailed characterization of typical human neurodevelopment is key if we are to understand the nature of mental and neurological pathology. While research on the cellular processes of neurodevelopment has made great advances, in vivo human imaging is crucial to understand our uniquely human capabilities, as well as the pathologies that affect them. Using magnetoencephalography data in the largest normative sample currently available (324 participants aged 6-45 years), we assess the developmental trajectory of resting-state oscillatory power and functional connectivity from childhood to middle age. The maturational course of power, indicative of local processing, was found to both increase and decrease in a spectrally dependent fashion. Using the strength of phase-synchrony between parcellated regions, we found significant linear and nonlinear (quadratic and logarithmic) trajectories to be characterized in a spatially heterogeneous frequency-specific manner, such as a superior frontal region with linear and nonlinear trajectories in theta and gamma band respectively. Assessment of global efficiency revealed similar significant nonlinear trajectories across all frequency bands. Our results link with the development of human cognitive abilities; they also highlight the complexity of neurodevelopment and provide quantitative parameters for replication and a robust footing from which clinical research may map pathological deviations from these typical trajectories. Author SummaryImagine that we could predict which children will go on to develop depression or anxiety disorders using functional brain imaging? This would allow early intervention and, in some, negation of the illness. The first step toward this goal is understanding the neurodevelopmental trajectory of healthy individuals. We can then recognize the developmental deviations with specific illnesses.We used the largest developmental MEG dataset available (n = 324) to characterize the developmental trajectories of functional connectivity in a cohort aged 6-45 years. We find evidence for nonlinear trajectories in two graph theory metrics, heterogeneously defined in brain space with opposing trajectories in different oscillatory frequencies. Our findings highlight the intricacy of typical neurodevelopment and provide foundational quantifications for replication in different modalities and application to clinical cohorts.

EDS in acute stroke was studied repeatedly, but there is a modest amount of data in post-stroke patients. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of EDS and characterize sleep architecture in patients >3 months after stroke and identify factors which may affect EDS. 66 patients were enrolled, of which 33 had experienced stroke. All underwent a standardized overnight, diagnostic single night polysomnography, including electrocephalogram (EEG) leads, electrooculograms (EOG), chin electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was used to measure subjects' level of daytime sleepiness. We observed similar total ESS score, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, as well as respiratory disturbance index/apnea-hypopnea index (RDI/AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and mean heart rate in both groups. We observed positive linear correlation between EDS and mean heart rate in the stroke group (r = 0.46, p < 0.05) as well as between EDS and REM duration (r = 0.23, p < 0.05). In the non-stroke group EDS didn't correlate with the heart rate or with the REM duration. In the non-stroke group EDS correlated positively with RDI/AHI and ODI index (r = 0.46; p = < 0.05 r = 0.41, p < 0.05 and maximal desaturation (r = 0.55, p < 0.05), this correlation was not observed in post-stroke group. In the both groups we observed negative linear correlation between BMI and saturation (stroke group-mean as well as minimal saturation (r = 0.458, p < 0.05; r = 0.578, p < 0.05), non stroke group-minimal but not mean saturation rate (r = 0.544, p < 0.05). We also noticed in both groups positive correlation between BMI and both AHI and ODI index (stroke group respectively: r = 0.430, p < 0.05; r = 0.451, p < 0.05; non-stroke group-BMI and ODI: r = 0.405, p < 0.05). The positive BMI correlation with RDI/AHI was not significant in the non-stroke group. We noticed that BMI correlates with non-REM sleep N1 (r = 0.760, p < 0.05) in post-stroke group, while it correlates negatively with REM sleep (r = -0.709, p < 0.05). There was no such correlation in the non-stroke group. In summary, in stroke patients subjective daytime sleepiness is associated with heart rate, but not with the severity of OSA. Thus ESS (Epworth Scale Score) may be not as useful as a marker of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) presence or severity in post stroke patient as in the general population.

However, a serotonin syndrome is not always followed by serotonergic injury, indicating different mechanisms responsible for two adverse effects. The goal of present study was to determine causes for two adverse events and further test that dose and environment have a differential role in initiating and intensifying MDMA neurotoxicity. Methods Initiation and intensification were examined by comparing neurotoxic effects of a high-dose (10 mg/kg x 3 at 2 h intervals) with a low-dose (2 mg/kg x 3) under controlled-environmental conditions. Initiation of a serotonin syndrome was estimated by measuring extracellular 5-HT, body-core temperature, electroencephalogram and MDMA concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, while intensification determined in rats examined under modified environment. Initiation and intensification of the serotonergic injury were assessed in rats by measuring tissue 5-HT content, SERT density and functional integrity of serotonergic retrograde transportation. Results Both low- and high-dose could cause increases in extracellular 5-HT to elicit a serotonin syndrome at the same intensity. Modification of environmental conditions, which had no impact on MDMA-elicited increases in 5-HT levels, markedly intensified the syndrome intensity. Although either dose would cause the severe syndrome under modified environments, only the high-dose that resulted in high MDMA concentrations in the brain could cause serotonergic injury. Conclusion Our results reveal that extracellular 5-HT is the cause of a syndrome and activity of postsynaptic receptors critical for the course of syndrome intensification. Although the high-dose has the potential to initiate serotonergic injury due to high MDMA concentrations present in the brain, whether an injury is observed depends upon the drug environment via the levels of reactive oxygen species generated. This suggests that brain MDMA concentration is the determinant in the injury initiation while reactive oxygen species generation associated with the injury intensification. It is concluded that the two adverse events utilize distinctly different mediating molecules during the toxic initiation and intensification.

However, the neural mechanisms through which DBS produces therapeutic benefits, and in some cases unwanted side effects, in these disorders are only partially understood. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques that can assess the neural effects of active stimulation are important for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of DBS therapy. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a safe, passive imaging modality with relatively high spatiotemporal resolution, which makes it a potentially powerful method for examining the cortical network effects of DBS. However, the degree to which magnetic artifacts produced by stimulation and the associated hardware can be suppressed from MEG data, and the comparability between signals measured during DBS-on and DBS-off conditions, have not been fully quantified. The present study used machine learning methods in conjunction with a visual perception task, which should be relatively unaffected by DBS, to quantify how well neural data can be salvaged from artifact contamination introduced by DBS and how comparable DBS-on and DBS-off data are after artifact removal. Machine learning also allowed us to determine whether the spatiotemporal pattern of neural activity recorded during stimulation are comparable to those recorded when stimulation is off. The spatiotemporal patterns of visually evoked neural fields could be accurately classified in all 8 patients with DBS implants during both DBS-on and DBS-off conditions and performed comparably across those two conditions. Further, the classification accuracy for classifiers trained on the spatiotemporal patterns evoked during DBS-on trials and applied to DBS-off trials, and vice versa, were similar to that of the classifiers trained and tested on either trial type, demonstrating the comparability of these patterns across conditions. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of MEG preprocessing techniques, like temporal signal space separation, to salvage neural data from recordings contaminated with DBS artifacts and validate MEG as a powerful tool to study the cortical consequences of DBS.

Measures of Listening Effort Are Multidimensional	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Alpha power; Listening effort; Pupil size; Reaction time; Self-reported listening effort; Skin conductance	HEARING IMPAIRMENT; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; PUPIL-DILATION; FATIGUE; RECOGNITION; EEG; INTELLIGIBILITY; RELIABILITY; VALIDITY	Objectives: Listening effort can be defined as the cognitive resources required to perform a listening task. The literature on listening effort is as confusing as it is voluminous: measures of listening effort rarely correlate with each other and sometimes result in contradictory findings. Here, we directly compared simultaneously recorded multimodal measures of listening effort. After establishing the reliability of the measures, we investigated validity by quantifying correlations between measures and then grouping-related measures through factor analysis. Design: One hundred and sixteen participants with audiometric thresholds ranging from normal to severe hearing loss took part in the study (age range: 55 to 85 years old, 50.3% male). We simultaneously measured pupil size, electroencephalographic alpha power, skin conductance, and self-report listening effort. One self-report measure of fatigue was also included. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) was adjusted at 71% criterion performance using sequences of 3 digits. The main listening task involved correct recall of a random digit from a sequence of six presented at a SNR where performance was around 82 to 93%. Test-retest reliability of the measures was established by retesting 30 participants 7 days after the initial session. Results: With the exception of skin conductance and the self-report measure of fatigue, interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) revealed good test-retest reliability (minimum ICC: 0.71). Weak or nonsignificant correlations were identified between measures. Factor analysis, using only the reliable measures, revealed four underlying dimensions: factor 1 included SNR, hearing level, baseline alpha power, and performance accuracy; factor 2 included pupillometry; factor 3 included alpha power (during speech presentation and during retention); factor 4 included self-reported listening effort and baseline alpha power. Conclusions: The good ICC suggests that poor test reliability is not the reason for the lack of correlation between measures. We have demonstrated that measures traditionally used as indicators of listening effort tap into multiple underlying dimensions. We therefore propose that there is no "gold standard" measure of listening effort and that different measures of listening effort should not be used interchangeably. When choosing method(s) to measure listening effort, the nature of the task and aspects of increased listening demands that are of interest should be taken into account. The findings of this study provide a framework for understanding and interpreting listening effort measures.

Can absence seizures be predicted by vigilance states?: Advanced analysis of sleep-wake states and spike-wave discharges' occurrence in rats	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Spike-wave discharges; Sleep-wake states; WAG/Rij rats; Predictability; Conditional Shannon entropy; Absence epilepsy	CATEGORICAL-DATA; SLOW-WAVE; EPILEPSY; PATTERNS; DYNAMICS; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Spike-wave discharges (SWDs) are the main manifestation of absence epilepsy. Their occurrence is dependent on the behavioral state, and they preferentially occur during unstable vigilance periods. The present study investigated whether the occurrence of SWDs can be predicted by the preceding behavioral state and whether this relationship is different between the light and the dark phases of the 24-h day. Twenty-four-hour (12:12 light/dark phases) electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of 12 Wistar Albino Glaxo, originally bred in Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats, a well-known genetic model of absence epilepsy, were analyzed and transformed into sequences of 2-s length intervals of the following 6 possible states: active wakefulness (AW), passive wakefulness (PW), deep slow-wave sleep (DSWS). light slow-wave sleep (LSWS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and SWDs, given discrete series of categorical data. Probabilities of all transitions between states and Shannon entropy of transitions were calculated for the light and dark phases separately and statistically analyzed. Common differences between the light and the dark phases were found regarding the time spent in AW, LSWS, DSWS, and SWDs. The most probable transitions were that AW was preceded and followed by PW and vice versa regardless of the phase of the photoperiod. A similar relationship was found for light and deep slow-wave sleep. The most probable transitions to and from SWDs were AW and LSWS, respectively, with these transition likelihoods being consistent across both circadian phases. The second most probable transitions around SWDs appeared more variable between light and dark. During the light phase, SWDs occurred around PW and participated exclusively in sleep initiation: in the dark phase. SWDs were seen on both, ascending and descending steps towards and from sleep. Conditional Shannon entropy showed that AW and DSWS are the most predictable events, while the possible prediction horizon of SWDs is not larger than 4 s and despite the higher occurrence of SWDs in the dark phase, did not differ between phases. It can be concluded that although SWDs show a stable, strong circadian rhythm with a peak in number during the dark phase, their occurrence cannot be reliably predicted by the preceding behavioral state, except at a very short time base.

Focal epilepsies are caused by a malfunction of nerve cells localised in one part of one cerebral hemisphere. In studies, estimates of the number of individuals with focal epilepsy who do not become seizure-free despite optimal drug therapy vary between at least 20% and up to 70%. If the epileptogenic zone can be located, surgical resection offers the chance of a cure with a corresponding increase in quality of life. Objectives The primary objective is to assess the overall outcome of epilepsy surgery according to evidence from randomised controlled trials. Secondary objectives are to assess the overall outcome of epilepsy surgery according to non-randomised evidence, and to identify the factors that correlate with remission of seizures postoperatively. Search methods For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 11March 2019: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRSWeb), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 toMarch 08, 2019), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Selection criteria Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included at least 30 participants in a well-defined population (age, sex, seizure type/frequency, duration of epilepsy, aetiology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis, surgical findings), with an MRI performed in at least 90% of cases and an expected duration of follow-up of at least one year, and reporting an outcome related to postoperative seizure control. Cohort studies or case series were included in the previous version of this review. Data collection and analysis Three groups of two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed study quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. Outcomes were proportions of participants achieving a good outcome according to the presence or absence of each prognostic factor of interest. We intended to combine data with risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Main results We identified 182 studies with a total of 16,855 included participants investigating outcomes of surgery for epilepsy. Nine studies were RCTs (including two that randomised participants to surgery or medical treatment (99 participants included in the two trials received medical treatment)). Risk of bias in these RCTs was unclear or high. Most of the remaining 173 non-randomised studies followed a retrospective design. We assessed study quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool and determined that most studies provided moderate or weak evidence. For 29 studies reporting multivariate analyses, we used the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool and determined that very few studies were at low risk of bias across domains. In terms of freedom from seizures, two RCTs found surgery (n = 97) to be superior to medical treatment (n = 99); four found no statistically significant differences between anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) with or without corpus callosotomy (n = 60), between subtemporal or transsylvian approach to selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) (n = 47); between ATL, SAH and parahippocampectomy (n = 43) or between 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm ATL resection (n = 207). One RCT found total hippocampectomy to be superior to partial hippocampectomy (n = 70) and one found ATL to be superior to stereotactic radiosurgery (n = 58); and another provided data to show that for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, no significant differences in seizure outcomes were evident between those treated with resection of the epileptogenic zone and those treated with resection of the epileptogenic zone plus corpus callosotomy (n = 43). We judged evidence from the nine RCTs to be of moderate to very low quality due to lack of information reported about the randomised trial design and the restricted study populations. Of the 16,756 participants included in this review who underwent a surgical procedure, 10,696 (64%) achieved a good outcome from surgery; this ranged across studies from 13.5% to 92.5%. Overall, we found the quality of data in relation to recording of adverse events to be very poor. In total, 120 studies examined between one and eight prognostic factors in univariate analysis. We found the following prognostic factors to be associated with a better post-surgical seizure outcome: abnormal pre-operative MRI, no use of intracranial monitoring, complete surgical resection, presence of mesial temporal sclerosis, concordance of pre-operative MRI and electroencephalography, history of febrile seizures, absence of focal cortical dysplasia/malformation of cortical development, presence of tumour, right-sided resection, and presence of unilateral interictal spikes. We found no evidence that history of head injury, presence of encephalomalacia, presence of vascular malformation, and presence of postoperative discharges were prognostic factors of outcome. Twenty-nine studies reported multi-variable models of prognostic factors, and showed that the direction of association of factors with outcomes was generally the same as that found in univariate analyses. We observed variability in many of our analyses, likely due to small study sizes with unbalanced group sizes and variation in the definition of seizure outcome, the definition of prognostic factors, and the influence of the site of surgery Authors' conclusions Study design issues and limited information presented in the included studies mean that our results provide limited evidence to aid patient selection for surgery and prediction of likely surgical outcomes. Future research should be of high quality, follow a prospective design, be appropriately powered, and focus on specific issues related to diagnostic tools, the site-specific surgical approach, and other issues such as extent of resection. Researchers should investigate prognostic factors related to the outcome of surgery via multi-variable statistical regression modelling, where variables are selected for modelling according to clinical relevance, and all numerical results of the prognostic models are fully reported. Journal editors should not accept papers for which study authors did not record adverse events from a medical intervention. Researchers have achieved improvements in cancer care over the past three to four decades by answering well-defined questions through the conduct of focused RCTs in a step-wise fashion. The same approach to surgery for epilepsy is required.
