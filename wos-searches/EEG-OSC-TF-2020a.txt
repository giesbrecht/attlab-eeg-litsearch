Novel Signal Processing Technique for Capture and Isolation of Blink-Related Oscillations Using a Low-Density Electrode Array for Bedside Evaluation of Consciousness	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Oscillators; Electrodes; Noise reduction; Filtering; Pollution measurement; Blink-related oscillations; artifact removal; biomedical signal processing; electroencephalography (EEG); point-of-care assessment; neurotechnology	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VEGETATIVE STATE; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; SINGLE-CHANNEL; BRAIN-FUNCTION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; WIRELESS EEG; ARTIFACTS; REMOVAL; DISORDERS	Objective: Blink-related oscillations derived from electroencephalography (EEG) have recently emerged as an important measure of awareness. Combined with portable EEG hardware with low-density electrode arrays, this neural marker may crucially augment the existing bedside assessments of consciousness in unresponsive patients. Nonetheless, the close relationship between signal characteristics of the neural response of interest and blink-induced oculomotor artifacts poses particular challenges when measuring blink-related oscillations using a point-of-care platform. This study presents a novel denoising approach based on time-frequency (TF) filtering that exploits the differential temporal and spectral features to isolate the neural response from ocular artifact in a low-density array. Methods: We investigated the effectiveness of the TF filtering technique using 64-channel EEG data collected in healthy adults, with focal analysis of the Pz and POz channels. Results: TF filtering showed comparable performance in denoising the signal relative to the established gold-standard independent component analysis approach, with strong similarities in morphological characteristics as measured by intraclass correlations (p < 0.001), extent of artifact rejection based on the ocular contamination index (p < 0.006), as well as time- and frequency-domain signal capture (p < 0.05). Results are robust at the individual and group levels, and are crucially validated using raw data from only four electrodes comprising Pz, POz, Fp2, and T7. Conclusion: These results demonstrate for the first time that TF filtering enables the successful capture and isolation of the blink-related oscillations response using a four-electrode array. Significance: This significantly advances the translation of the blink-related oscillations marker to a point-of-care platform for eventual bedside applications.

Other brain imaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), have been used for investigating the electrophysiological basis of RSNs. To date, it is largely unclear how neural oscillations measured with EEG and MEG are related to functional connectivity in the resting state. In addition, it remains to be elucidated whether and how the observed neural oscillations are related to the spatial distribution of the network nodes over the cortex. To address these questions, we examined frequency-dependent functional connectivity between the main nodes of several RSNs, spanning large part of the cortex. We estimated connectivity using band-limited power correlations from high-density EEG data collected in healthy participants. We observed that functional interactions within RSNs are characterized by a specific combination of neuronal oscillations in the alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-80 Hz) bands, which highly depend on the position of the network nodes. This finding may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms through which neural oscillations support functional connectivity in the brain.

J	Kang, SS				Kang, Seung Suk			Addressing Measurement Issues in Electroencephalography Studies of Meditations as Alternative Interventions of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder COMMENT	PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY			English	Editorial Material						electroencephalography; meditation; posttraumatic stress disorder	EEG; VETERANS; MINDFULNESS; REDUCTION; ARTIFACTS	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental disorder affecting numerous U.S. citizens, but conventional interventions have shown limited success in treating PTSD symptoms (e.g., high dropout rates). Various meditative techniques have been used as alternative interventions to treat PTSD, demonstrating that these interventions have strong potential to improve symptoms and quality of life in people with PTSD. Despite the initial promise, our limited understanding of the mechanisms of meditation has hindered the establishment of meditation as an evidence-based clinical intervention optimized for trauma survivors. Therefore, it is imperative to determine the neurobiological mechanism of meditation using rigorous functional outcome measures of the central nervous system. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used as an ideal tool for mechanistic studies of meditation because it provides a sensitive functional neural measurement of synchronized brain networks that may reflect meditation-related trait and state changes in brain dynamics. However, recent meta-analyses of EEG meditation studies have provided mixed findings, with some consistencies across (e.g., enhanced theta and alpha frequency neural oscillations) as well as a number of inconsistent findings across studies. The present commentary addresses critical measurement issues in meditation EEG studies that are often disregarded and thus underlie the replication problems, which represent one of the major obstacles in mechanistic studies of meditation using EEG. In particular, the physiological artifact-related issues in time, frequency, and time-frequency measures and spatial-domain measurement problems inherent to EEG are reviewed, and standard methods of EEG processing and analysis are recommended to resolve the problems.

Estimation of Time-Varying Spectral Peaks and Decomposition of EEG Spectrograms	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Kalman filter; parameter estimation; sleep; spectral analysis; spectral peaks; spectrogram	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SLEEP-SPINDLE; FREQUENCY; SLOW; COHERENCE; POWER; ARCHITECTURE; FINGERPRINT; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS	Detection of spectral peaks and estimation of their properties, including frequency and amplitude, are fundamental to many applications of signal processing. Electroencephalography (EEG) of sleep, in particular, displays characteristic oscillations that change continuously throughout the night. Capturing these dynamics is essential to understanding the sleep process and characterizing the heterogeneity observed across individuals. Most sleep EEG analyses rely on either time-averaged spectra or bandpassed amplitude/power. Unfortunately, these approaches obscure the time-variability of peak properties, require specification of a priori criteria, and cannot distinguish power from nearby oscillations. More sophisticated approaches, using various spectral models, have been proposed to better estimate oscillatory properties, but these too have limitations. We present an improved approach to spectrogram decomposition, tracking time-varying parameterized peak functions and dynamically estimating their parameters using a modified form of the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) that incorporates discrete On/Off-switching of peak combinations and a sampling step to draw the initial reference trajectory. We evaluate this approach on two types of simulated examples-one nearly within the model class and one outside. We find excellent performance, in terms of spectral fits and accuracy of estimated states, for both simulation types. We then apply the approach to real EEG data of sleep onset, obtaining quality spectral estimates with estimated peak combinations closely matching the expert-scored sleep stages. This approach offers not only the ability to estimate time-varying parameters of spectral peaks but, moving forward, the potential to estimate the governing dynamics and analyze their variability across nights, subjects, and clinical groups.

Specifically, we propose an EEG-based approach for decoding visually imagined objects by using the Choi-Williams time-frequency distribution to analyze the EEG signals in the joint time-frequency domain and extract a set of twelve time-frequency features (TFFs). The extracted TFFs are used to construct a multi-class support vector machine classifier to decode various visually imagined objects. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, we have recorded an EEG dataset for 16 healthy subjects while imagining objects that belong to four different categories, namely nature (fruits and animals), decimal digits, English alphabet (capital letters), and arrow shapes (arrows with different colors and orientations). Moreover, we have designed two performance evaluation analyses, namely the channel-based analysis and feature-based analysis, to quantify the impact of utilizing different groups of EEG electrodes that cover various regions on the scalp and the effect of reducing the dimensionality of the extracted TFFs on the performance of our proposed approach in decoding the imagined objects within each of the four categories. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in decoding visually imagined objects. Particularly, the average decoding accuracies obtained for each of the four categories were as high as 96.67%, 93.64%, 88.95%, and 92.68%.

Here, we test whether changes in beta frequency are related to the preparation of adapted movements in human, and whether such effects generalise to other species (cat). Eleven healthy adult humans performed a joystick visuomotor adaptation task. Beta (15-25 Hz) scalp EEG signals recorded over the motor cortex during a pre-movement preparatory phase were, on average, significantly reduced in amplitude during early adaptation trials compared to baseline, late adaptation, or aftereffect trials. The changes in beta were not related to measurements of reaction time or reach duration. We also recorded local field potential (LFP) activity within the primary motor cortex of three cats during a prism visuomotor adaptation task. Analysis of these signals revealed similar reductions in motor cortical LFP beta frequencies during early adaptation. This effect was present when controlling for any influence of the reaction time and reach duration. Overall, the results are consistent with a reduction in pre-movement beta oscillations predicting an increase in adaptive drive in upcoming task performance when motor errors are largest in magnitude and the rate of adaptation is greatest.

For this class of disorders, which are characterized by affective, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, electroencephalography remains the dominant tool for providing insight into the physiological and molecular underpinnings of the disease state and predicting the effectiveness of investigational new drugs. Within the spectrum of electrical activity present in the CNS, high-frequency oscillations in the gamma band are frequently altered in these patient populations. Measurement of gamma oscillation can be further classified into baseline and evoked, each of which offers a specific commentary on disease state. Baseline gamma analysis provides a surrogate of pharmacodynamics and predicting the time course effects of clinical candidate drugs, while alterations in evoked (time-locked) gamma power may serve as a disease biomarker and have utility in assessing patient response to new drugs. Together, these techniques offer complimentary methods of analysis for discrete realms of clinical and translational medicine. In terms of drug development, comprehensive analysis containing aspects of both baseline and evoked gamma oscillations may prove more useful in establishing better workflow and more accurate criteria for the testing of investigational new drugs.

J	Wei, H; Zhou, RL				Wei, Hua; Zhou, Renlai			High working memory load impairs selective attention: EEG signatures	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; EEG oscillations; ERPs; flanker; working memory	COGNITIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL THETA; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; POWER; INHIBITION; DYNAMICS; FLANKER; REVEAL	According to the load theory of attention, increased working memory load impairs selective attention, resulting in greater distractor interference during inhibitory control processing. However, the EEG signatures correlated with this modulation effect of working memory on inhibitory control remain unclear. In present study, 25 healthy human participants performed a flanker task in a low and high working memory load conditions, while behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. The results showed a larger reaction time interference effect while increasing working memory load, and this was accompanied by a larger N2 amplitude and a smaller P3 amplitude for incongruent trials. Time-frequency analysis revealed that, increased working memory load had no significant modulation effect on flanker related theta-ERS magnitude. Incongruent trials evoked smaller alpha-ERD magnitude than congruent trials in both low and high working memory load conditions. Increased working memory load was associated with larger flanker related alpha-ERD magnitude. Taken together, these results suggested that increased working memory load can impair top-down cognitive control processes, impairing inhibitory control processes during performance of the flanker task.

Despite some inter-individual similarities, there is reason to believe that a discernible portion of the individual brain activity is subject-specific. In order to encompass the potential individual source of variance in EEG data and psychometric parameters, we introduce an innovative application of linear mixed-effects models (LMM) as an alternative procedure for the analysis of resting-state EEG data. Using LMM, individual differences can be modelled through the assumptions of idiosyncrasy of all responses and dependency among data points (e.g., from the same subject within and across units of time) via random effects parameters. This report provides an example of how LMM can be used for the statistical analysis of resting-state EEG data in a heterogeneous group of subjects; namely, people who suffer from tinnitus (ringing in the ear/s). Results from 49 participants (38 male, mean age of 46.69 +/- 12.65 years) revealed that EEG signals were not only associated with specific recording sites, but exhibited regional specific oscillations in conjunction to symptom severity. Tinnitus distress targeted the frequency bands beta3 (23.5-35 Hz) and gamma (35.5-45 Hz) in right frontal regions, whereas delta (0.5-4 Hz) exhibited significant changes in temporal-parietal sources. Further, 57.8% of the total variance in EEG power was subject-specific and acknowledged by the LMM framework and its prediction. Thus, a deeper understanding of both the underlying statistical and physiological patterns of EEG data was gained.

Early gamma-oscillations as correlate of localized nociceptive processing in primary sensorimotor cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma-band oscillation; nociception; pain; time-frequency analyses	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; A-DELTA-FIBER; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; CLINICAL-USEFULNESS; PAIN INTENSITY; TACTILE INPUT; MEDIAN-NERVE	Recent studies put forward the idea that stimulus-evoked gamma-band oscillations (GBOs; 30-100 Hz) play a specific role in nociception. So far, evidence for the specificity of GBOs for nociception, their possible involvement in nociceptive sensory discriminatory abilities, and knowledge regarding their cortical sources is just starting to grow. To address these questions. we used electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain activity evoked by phasic nociceptive laser stimuli and tactile stimuli applied at different intensities to the right hand and foot of 12 healthy volunteers. The EEG was analyzed in the time domain to extract phase-locked event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and in three regions of interest in the time-frequency domain (delta/theta, 40-Hz gamma, 70-Hz gamma) to extract stimulus-evoked changes in the magnitude of non-phase-locked brain oscillations. Both nociceptive and tactile stimuli, matched with respect to subjective intensity, elicited phase locked ERPs of increasing amplitude with increasing stimulus intensity. In contrast, only nociceptive stimuli elicited a significant enhancement of GBOs (65-85 Hz, 150-230 ms after stimulus onset), whose magnitude encoded stimulus intensity, whereas tactile stimuli led to a GBO decrease. Following nociceptive hand stimulation, the topographical distribution of GBOs was maximal at contralateral electrode C3. whereas maximum activity following foot stimulation was recorded at the midline electrode Cz. compatible with generation of GBOs in the representations of the hand and foot of the primary sensorimotor cortex, respectively. The differential behavior of high-frequency GBOs and low-frequency 40-Hz GBOs is indicating different functional roles and regions in sensory processing. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Gamma-band oscillations show hand-foot somatotopy compatible with generation in primary sensorimotor cortex and are present following nociceptive but not tactile stimulation of the hand and foot in humans.

Several acoustic therapies such as retraining therapy, auditory discrimination therapy, enriched acoustic environment and binaural therapy have been proposed to induce habituation and/or diminution of the tinnitus perception. The effect of the auditory stimulus in use is not, however, well understood yet. At present, the effectiveness of the acoustic therapies on patients suffering from tinnitus is only monitored via visual analog scales or questionnaires, what could not reflect accurately the patient evolution. It is well known that neuroimaging techniques are widely applied to monitor neural activity for diagnosing brain disorders, and predicting treatment outcome success. From those techniques, Electroencephalography (EEG) has become the most commonly used method since it gives an insight into the temporal behavior of neural oscillations, and it is relatively a low-cost and low-maintenance system in comparison to other techniques. EEG signals are modulated by the internal communication between neural networks, and the inter-communication among those networks. As is hypothesized that subjective tinnitus is the result of increased neural synchrony and spontaneous firing rates in the auditory system, EEG analysis may be an objective method to monitor the effect of acoustic therapies for tinnitus. In this paper, the state-of-the-art on acoustic therapies for tinnitus, and recent advances on the follow-up treatment based on EEG analysis is discussed. In general, this paper outlines evidence showing that EEG signal processing offers to investigate (1) internal communication in neural nodes (absolute and relative power), (2) inter-communication of neural nodes (coherence), (3) time-frequency analysis with high resolution in both low and high frequencies (Fourier and Wavelet analysis), (4) rate at which neural information is being produced (entropy), (5) genesis of abnormal neural synchrony on the basis of biophysical assumptions (source localization) or statistical evaluations (ACA and ICA), and (6) level of neural synchrony over time (ERD/ERS maps).

Electroencephalographic Density Spectral Array monitoring facilitates the interpretation of unprocessed electroencephalogram data, providing the anesthesiologist with real-time drug-specific information on hypnotic depth. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the clinical applicability of Density Spectral Array with a commercially available monitor as the Narcotrend EEG monitor in teenagers under procedural sedation using propofol. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of EEG data. Unprocessed electroencephalogram data from 37 patients, aged 12-18 years, scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy under propofol sedation, were used for analysis. The relationship between non-steady state propofol concentrations and Density Spectral Array, represented by the four electroencephalographic frequency bands beta, alpha, theta and delta was investigated. RESULTS: Increasing propofol concentration caused augmentation in the amplitude of frontal d oscillations and a decrease in the amplitude of frontal beta oscillations. The expression of a oscillations showed a biphasic pattern related to increasing the propofol concentration. Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between propofol concentration and relative EEG power in beta (r -0.84, P<0.0001), theta (r 0.50, P=0.004) and delta (r 0.63, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We were able to show that DSA displayed in real time, on a commercially available DoA monitor (the Narcotrend EEG monitor), can provide the anesthesiologist with understandable information regarding the dose-dependent EEG effects of propofol in teenagers.

Currently, electroencephalography (EEG) is the most popular tool to investigate the presence of autism biomarkers. Generally, EEG recordings generate huge volume data with dynamic behaviour. In current practice, the massive EEG data are visually analysed by specialist clinicians to identify autism, which is time consuming, costly, subject to human error, and reduces decision-making reliability. Hence this Letter aims to develop an efficient autism diagnostic system that can automatically identify autism based on time-frequency spectrogram images from EEG signals. Firstly, the raw EEG data is pre-processed using several techniques, such as re-referencing, filtering and normalisation. After that, the pre-processed EEG signals are converted to two-dimensional images using a short-time Fourier transform. Then, textural features are extracted, and significant features are selected using principal component analysis, and feed to support vector machine classifier for classification. The proposed system achieved an average of 95.25% accuracy in ten-fold cross-validation evaluation.

The purpose of the presurgical evaluation is to lateralize and localize the epileptic focus using a combination of data: the semiology of the clinical seizure, neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG). EEG and noninvasive electrophysiological assessment is required to establish spatial and temporal relationships of the clinical manifestations (seizure semiology) of an electrographic seizure. Although EEG offers a sampling of brain activity from a more extensive surface with a high temporal resolution, EEG remains less sensitive in detecting deeper and smaller cortical areas. A number of noninvasive neurophysiological methods have emerged to localize the epileptogenic focus in the recent years such as magnetoencephalography-EEG (MEG-EEG), EEG source modeling, recording paroxysmal activity with high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) or infraslow activity (ISA) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy-EEG (fNIRS-EEG).

In order to study cortical activity during real locomotion, electroencephalography (EEG) appears to be particularly appropriate. It is now possible to record changes in cortical neural synchronization/desynchronization during gait. Studying gait initiation is also of particular interest because it implies motor and cognitive cortical control to adequately perform a step. Time-frequency analysis enables to study induced changes in EEG activity in different frequency bands. Such analysis reflects cortical activity implied in stabilized gait control but also in more challenging tasks (obstacle crossing, changes in speed, dual tasks horizontal ellipsis ). These spectral patterns are directly influenced by the walking context but, when analyzing gait with a more demanding attentional task, cortical areas other than the sensorimotor cortex (prefrontal, posterior parietal cortex, etc.) seem specifically implied. While the muscular activity of legs and cortical activity are coupled, the precise role of the motor cortex to control the level of muscular contraction according to the gait task remains debated. The decoding of this brain activity is a necessary step to build valid brain-computer interfaces able to generate gait artificially.

The areas of the brain associated with the consequence of epilepsy are termed as epileptogenic regions. The focal EEG signals are generated from epileptogenic areas, and the nonfocal signals are obtained from other regions of the brain. Thus, the classification of the focal and non-focal EEG signals are necessary for locating the epileptogenic areas during surgery for epilepsy. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the automated classification of focal and non-focal EEG signals. The method is based on the use of the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification. The time-frequency matrices of EEG signal are evaluated using both Fourier SST (FSST) and wavelet SST (WSST). The two-dimensional (2D) deep CNN is used for the classification using the time-frequency matrix of EEG signals. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method attains the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of more than 99% for the classification of focal and non-focal EEG signals. The method is compared with existing approaches for the discrimination of focal and non-focal categories of EEG signals.

The organ most affected by alcohol is the brain. It has been shown that alcohol causes neuronal loss in the brain and reduces brain blood flow and oxygen use. Electroencephalography is a method that measures the instantaneous electrical activity of the brain. It is known that valuable information can be obtained by observing the biological effects of alcohol through EEG. As their methods of signal processing and analysis have evolved, Electroencephalography signals have attracted the attention of researchers in this field. In this study, methods of the time-frequency analysis were applied to Electroencephalography signals obtained from normal and alcoholic subjects. For this purpose, the Cohen's class distribution was examined. Ambiguity function analysis, which was in the structure of the distribution, was applied to the signals. Then, from the kernel structure inside the distribution, the Wigner-Ville distribution, which was very common, was reached and this distribution was examined. The inadequacy of the distribution resolution was seen and analysis of the new time-frequency distributions, which were obtained by making convolution with 4 types of kernel functions (nonseparable, separable, Doppler independent, lag independent), was performed. As a result, it was shown that the resolution of time-frequency distributions could be improved with proper kernel functions. Thus, at the end of these analyses, changes that alcohol caused in brain functions were revealed.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has its advantages over other brainwave monitoring tools in cost, portability and monitoring frequency and accuracy. The interpretation of the relatively large amount of EEG signals is of key importance to understand brain functionality. Traditional machine learning and signal preprocessing methods alone fail to provide robust and in-time EEG signal interpretation and partially relied on professionally trained expert. For further developments and applications of robust and in-time EEG interpretation, we investigated the application of the deep learning models on a classification task of a motor imagery EEG signal dataset with both spatial and temporal information. We adopt sliding window with specified window sizes and strides to generate training samples for deep learning models and standardize the training samples to improve the model performance. Convolutional neural network, variants of recurrent neural network are investigated and compared on the classification and interpretation performance over the interested dataset. The convolutional neural network demonstrates superior performance in terms of both training efficiency and accuracy to other models.

Here we report simultaneous scalp and intracerebral EEG responses to face stimuli in a unique epileptic patient implanted with 27 intracerebral recording contacts in the right occipitotemporal cortex. The patient was shown images of faces appearing at a frequency of 6 Hz, which elicits neural responses at this exact frequency. Response quantification at this frequency allowed to objectively relate the neural activity measured inside and outside the brain. The patient exhibited typical 6 Hz responses on the scalp at the right occipitotemporal sites. Moreover, there was a clear spatial correspondence between these scalp responses and intracerebral signals in the right lateral inferior occipital gyrus, both in amplitude and in phase. Nevertheless, the signal measured on the scalp and inside the brain at nearby locations showed a 10-fold difference in amplitude due to electrical insulation from the head. To further quantify the relationship between the scalp and intracerebral recordings, we used an approach correlating time-varying signals at the stimulation frequency across scalp and intracerebral channels. This analysis revealed a focused and right-lateralized correspondence between the scalp and intracerebral recordings that were specific to the face stimulation is more broadly distributed in various control situations. These results demonstrate the interest of a frequency tagging approach in characterizing the electrical propagation from brain sources to scalp EEG sensors and in identifying the cortical sources of brain functions from these recordings.

Visual Imagery and Perception Share Neural Representations in the Alpha Frequency Band	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							MENTAL-IMAGERY; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; MODELS; INFORMATION; VARIABILITY; FEEDFORWARD; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS	To behave adaptively with sufficient flexibility, biological organisms must cognize beyond immediate reaction to a physically present stimulus. For this, humans use visual mental imagery [1, 2], the ability to conjure up a vivid internal experience from memory that stands in for the percept of the stimulus. Visually imagined contents subjectively mimic perceived contents, suggesting that imagery and perception share common neural mechanisms. Using multivariate pattern analysis on human electroencephalography (EEG) data, we compared the oscillatory time courses of mental imagery and perception of objects. We found that representations shared between imagery and perception emerged specifically in the alpha frequency band. These representations were present in posterior, but not anterior, electrodes, suggesting an origin in parieto-occipital cortex. Comparison of the shared representations to computational models using representational similarity analysis revealed a relationship to later layers of deep neural networks trained on object representations, but not auditory or semantic models, suggesting representations of complex visual features as the basis of commonality. Together, our results identify and characterize alpha oscillations as a cortical signature of representations shared between visual mental imagery and perception.

Synchronizing TMS pulses with instantaneous brain oscillations can reduce variability and increase efficacy of TMS-induced plasticity. Objective: To study whether brain oscillation-synchronized rTMS is feasible, safe and has neuromodulatory effects when targeting the DLPFC of patients with MDD. Methods: Using real-time EEG-triggered TMS we conducted a pseudo-randomized controlled single-session crossover trial of brain oscillation-synchronized rTMS of left DLPFC in 17 adult patients with antidepressant-resistant MDD. Stimulation conditions in separate sessions were: (1) rTMS triggered at the negative EEG peak of instantaneous alpha oscillations (alpha-synchronized rTMS), (2) a variation of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (modified iTBS), and (3) a random alpha phase control condition. Results: Triggering TMS at the negative peak of instantaneous alpha oscillations by real-time analysis of the electrode F5 EEG signal was successful in 15 subjects. Two subjects reported mild transient discomfort at the site of stimulation during stimulation; no serious adverse events were reported. Alpha-synchronized rTMS, but not modified iTBS or the random alpha phase control condition, reduced resting-state alpha activity in left DLPFC and increased TMS-induced beta oscillations over frontocentral channels. Conclusions: Alpha-synchronized rTMS of left DLPFC is feasible, safe and has specific single-session neuromodulatory effects in patients with antidepressant-resistant MDD. Future studies need to further elucidate the mechanisms, optimize the parameters and investigate the therapeutic potential and efficacy of brain oscillation-synchronized rTMS in MDD.

Due to ease of use and relative accuracy, Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition has become a hot topic in the affective computing field. However, scalp EEG is a mixed-signal and cannot directly indicate the exact information about active cortex sources of different emotions. In this paper, we analyze the significant differences of active source regions and frequency bands for pairs of emotions-based reconstructed EEG sources using sLORETA, and 26 Brodmann areas are selected as the regions of interest (ROI). And then, six kinds of time- and frequency-domain features from significant active regions and frequency bands are extracted to classify different emotions using support vector machines. Furthermore, we compare the classification performances of emotion features extracted from active source regions and EEG sensors. We have demonstrated that the features from selected source regions can improve the classification accuracy by extensive experiments on the DEAP and TYUT 2.0 EEG-based datasets.

AD is preceded by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), typically refers to early-stage AD disease. The purpose of this study is to classify MCI patients from the multi-domain features of their electroencephalography (EEG). Firstly, we extracted the multi-domain (time, frequency and information theory) features from resting-state EEG signals before and after a cognitive task from 15 MCI groups and 15 age-matched healthy controls. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to perform feature selection. After that, we compared the performance between SVM and KNN on our EEG dataset. The good performance was observed both from SVM and KNN, which demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-domain features. Furthermore, KNN performs better than SVM and the EEG signals after the cognitive task works better than those before the task.

The electroencephalography (EEG) recording method is the most frequently used clinical practice in the diagnosis and monitoring of epilepsy. Many computer-aided analysis methods have been developed in the literature to facilitate the analysis of long-term EEG signals. In the proposed study, the patient-based seizure detection approach is proposed using a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation named Synchrosqueezed Transform (SST) method. The SST of two different data sets called the IKCU data set and CHB-MIT data set are obtained, and Higher-order joint TF (HOJ-TF) based and Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based features are calculated using these SSTs. Using some machine learning methods such as Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Logistic Regression (LR), classification processes are conducted. High patient-based seizure detection success is achieved for both the IKCU data set (94.25%) and the CHB-MIT data set (95.15%).

The emergence of affordable ECG and EEG sensors and ubiquitous mobile devices provides an opportunity to make such analysis accessible to everyone. In this paper, we propose the implementation of a neural network-based method for the automatic identification of the relationship between the previously known conditions of older adults and the different features calculated from the various signals. The data were collected using a smartphone and low-cost ECG and EEG sensors during the performance of the timed-up and go test. Different patterns related to the features extracted, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, average QRS amplitude, average R-R interval, and average R-S interval from ECG data, and the frequency and variability from the EEG data were identified. A combination of these parameters allowed us to identify the presence of certain diseases accurately. The analysis revealed that the different institutions and ages were mainly identified. Still, the various diseases and groups of diseases were difficult to recognize, because the frequency of the different diseases was rare in the considered population. Therefore, the test should be performed with more people to achieve better results.

P300, theta (4-7 Hz), and alpha (8-13 Hz) power are related to cognitive functions. In this paper, we selected long-term cognitive tasks to induce mental fatigue. Sternberg-WM paradigm was performed before and after fatigue, and EEG data was collected and analyzed. P300 amplitude had no significant difference in the normal state, but significantly reduced with increasing of the workload in parietal region in the fatigue state. This indicated that mental fatigue reduced the allocatable cognitive resources in the high workload. P300 latency had no significant difference between the normal and fatigue state, indicating that mental fatigue had no significant effect on the speed of cognitive resource allocation. Theta power increased significantly with increasing of the workload only in the normal state, indicating that the high workload required more top-down attention resource input to promote memory retrieval. Mental fatigue weakened attention resource input. Alpha power significantly decreased with increasing of the workload only in the fatigue state, indicating that mental fatigue reduced the energy of suppressing irrelevant information interference in the high workload. Long-term cognitive tasks can impair the allocation of cognitive resources, reduce cognitive ability, and lead to behavioral errors in the high workload. P300 can be used as a biomarker for monitoring mental fatigue in the high workload, besides, theta and alpha rhythms can be used as potential targets for neural oscillations regulation.

Over the past 23 years, electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to probe the neural signatures of feedback processing. Seminal work demonstrated a difference in the human event-related potential (ERP) dependent on whether people were processing correct or incorrect feedback. Since then, these feedback evoked ERPs have been associated with reinforcement learning and conflict monitoring, tied to subsequent behavioral adaptations, and shown to be sensitive to a wide range of factors (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Recently, research has turned to frequency decomposition techniques to examine how changes in the EEG power spectra are related to underlying learning mechanisms. Although the literature on the neural correlates of feedback processing is vast, there are still methodological discrepancies and differences in results across studies. Here, we provide reference results and an investigation of methodological considerations for the ERP (reward positivity) and frequency (delta and theta power) correlates of feedback evaluation with a large sample size. Specifically, participants (n = 500) performed a two-armed bandit task while we recorded EEG. Our findings provide key information about the data characteristics and relationships that exist between the neural signatures of feedback evaluation. Additionally, we conclude with selected methodological recommendations for standardization of future research. All data and scripts are freely provided to facilitate open science.

Although most efforts focusing on exploring the listening brain have been made through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), sensor-level electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) technique, little is known about how neural rhythms are involved in the brain network activity under naturalistic stimuli. This study exploited cortical oscillations through analysis of ongoing EEG and musical feature during freely listening to music. We used a data-driven method that combined music information retrieval with spatial Fourier Independent Components Analysis (spatial Fourier-ICA) to probe the interplay between the spatial profiles and the spectral patterns of the brain network emerging from music listening. Correlation analysis was performed between time courses of brain networks extracted from EEG data and musical feature time series extracted from music stimuli to derive the musical feature related oscillatory patterns in the listening brain. We found brain networks of musical feature processing were frequency-dependent. Musical feature time series, especially fluctuation centroid and key feature, were associated with an increased beta activation in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus. An increased alpha oscillation in the bilateral occipital cortex emerged during music listening, which was consistent with alpha functional suppression hypothesis in task-irrelevant regions. We also observed an increased delta-beta oscillatory activity in the prefrontal cortex associated with musical feature processing. In addition to these findings, the proposed method seems valuable for characterizing the large-scale frequency-dependent brain activity engaged in musical feature processing.

This study proposes a novel hybrid asynchronous BCI system based on a combination of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in the EEG signal and blink-related electrooculography (EOG) signals. Methods: Twelve buttons corresponding to 12 characters are included in the graphical user interface (GUI). These buttons flicker at different fixed frequencies and phases to evoke SSVEPs and are simultaneously highlighted by changing their sizes. The user can select a character by focusing on its frequency-phase stimulus and simultaneously blinking his/her eyes in accordance with its highlighting as his/her EEG and EOG signals are recorded. A multifrequency band-based canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method is applied to the EEG data to detect the evoked SSVEPs, whereas the EOG data are analyzed to identify the user's blinks. Finally, the target character is identified based on the SSVEP and blink detection results. Results: Ten healthy subjects participated in our experiments and achieved an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 105.52 bits/min, an average accuracy of 95.42%, an average response time of 1.34 s and an average false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.8%. Conclusion: The proposed BCI generates multiple commands with a high ITR and low FPR. Significance: The hybrid asynchronous BCI has great potential for practical applications in communication and control.

Electrophysiological indicators of gesture perception	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Gesture processing; Mirror neuron; Mu; EEG	MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM; MU-SUPPRESSION; MOTOR; RECOGNITION; MECHANISMS; LANGUAGE; EXECUTION; IMITATION; ALPHA; EEG	Electroencephalography (EEG) activity in the mu frequency band (8-13 Hz) is suppressed during both gesture performance and observation. However, it is not clear if or how particular characteristics within the kinematic execution of gestures map onto dynamic changes in mu activity. Mapping the time course of gesture kinematics onto that of mu activity could help understand which aspects of gestures capture attention and aid in the classification of communicative intent. In this work, we test whether the timing of inflection points within gesture kinematics predicts the occurrence of oscillatory mu activity during passive gesture observation. The timing for salient features of performed gestures in video stimuli was determined by isolating inflection points in the hands' motion trajectories. Participants passively viewed the gesture videos while continuous EEG data was collected. We used wavelet analysis to extract mu oscillations at 11 Hz and at central electrodes and occipital electrodes. We used linear regression to test for associations between the timing of inflection points in motion trajectories and mu oscillations that generalized across gesture stimuli. Separately, we also tested whether inflection point occurrences evoked mu/alpha responses that generalized across participants. Across all gestures and inflection points, and pooled across participants, peaks in 11 Hz EEG waveforms were detected 465 and 535 ms after inflection points at occipital and central electrodes, respectively. A regression model showed that inflection points in the motion trajectories strongly predicted subsequent mu oscillations (R2=0.921,p<0.01); effects were weaker and non-significant for low (17 Hz) and high (21 Hz) beta activity. When segmented by inflection point occurrence rather than stimulus onset and testing participants as a random effect, inflection points evoked mu and beta activity from 308 to 364 ms at central electrodes, and broad activity from 226 to 800 ms at occipital electrodes. The results suggest that inflection points in gesture trajectories elicit coordinated activity in the visual and motor cortices, with prominent activity in the mu/alpha frequency band and extending into the beta frequency band. The time course of activity indicates that visual processing drives subsequent activity in the motor cortex during gesture processing, with a lag of approximately 80 ms.

However, it is as of yet unclear whether these EEG components are really unique to time perception or reflect the perception of magnitudes in general. In the current study we recorded EEG while participants had to make judgments about duration (time condition) or numerosity (number condition) in a comparison task. This design allowed us to directly compare EEG signals between the processing of time and number. Stimuli consisted of a series of blue dots appearing and disappearing dynamically on a black screen. Each stimulus was characterized by its duration and the total number of dots that it consisted of. Because it is known that tasks like these elicit perceptual interference effects that we used a maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure to determine, for each participant and dimension separately, to what extent time and numerosity information were taken into account when making a judgement in an extensive post hoc analysis. This approach enabled us to capture individual differences in behavioral performance and, based on the MLE estimates, to select a subset of participants who suppressed task-irrelevant information. Even for this subset of participants, who showed no or only small interference effects and thus were thought to truly process temporal information in the time condition and numerosity information in the number condition, we found CNV patterns in the time-domain EEG signals for both tasks that was more pronounced in the time-task. We found no substantial evidence for differences between the processing of temporal and numerical information in the time-frequency domain.

There has been little attempt, however, in validating the findings in an application-oriented context involving longer test spans with realistic learning materials encompassing more items. Hence, the present study investigates subsequent memory prediction within the application context of foreign-vocabulary learning. We employed an off-line, EEG-based paradigm in which Korean participants without prior German language experience learned 900 German words in paired-associate form. Our results using convolutional neural networks optimized for EEG-signal analysis show that above-chance classification is possible in this context allowing us to predict during learning which of the words would be successfully remembered later.

NFT is considered to be a promising tool for healthy people to enhance cognition, however its specific effects on response-conflict are unknown. This study employed 50 healthy participants into two groups (NFT group = 25, control group = 25), in order to explore the NFT effects towards response-conflict resolution phenomenon. Changes in Absolute power and functional connectivity in different bands of response-conflict EEG, were investigated. The EEG of each participant was recorded while performing a response-conflict task before and after NFT. The results show an increase in theta and alpha band powers and functional connectivity. No training specific modulation is observed in beta band functional connectivity. A significant improvement in theta and alpha band functional connectivity is observed in the NFT group that is not present in the control group. These findings provide a strong rationale for the use of NFT in the resolution of response-conflict phenomenon in healthy human beings.

Neurocognitive measures like the electroencephalography (EEG) offer the opportunity to assess mind wandering non-invasively without interfering with the primary task. However, the literature on electrophysiological correlates of mind wandering is rather inconsistent. The present study aims toward clarifying this picture by breaking down the temporal dynamics of mind wandering encounters using a cluster-based permutation approach. Participants performed a switching task during which mind wandering was occasionally assessed via thought probes applied after trial completion at random time points. In line with previous studies, response accuracy was reduced during mind wandering. Moreover, alpha power during the inter-trial interval was a significantly increased on those trials on which participants reported that they had been mind-wandering. This spatially widely distributed effect is theoretically well in line with recent findings linking an increased alpha power to an internally oriented state of attention. Measurements of alpha power may, therefore, be used to detect mind wandering online during critical tasks in traffic and industry in order to prevent failures.

J	Zalewska, E				Zalewska, Ewa			Is So Called "Split Alpha" in EEG Spectral Analysis a Result of Methodological and Interpretation Errors?	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); spectral analysis; Fast Fourier Transform (FFT); spurious peaks; Gibbs phenomenon		This paper attempts to explain some methodological issues regarding EEG signal analysis which might lead to misinterpretation and therefore to unsubstantiated conclusions. The so called "split-alpha," a "new phenomenon" in EEG spectral analysis described lately in few papers is such a case. We have shown that spectrum feature presented as a "split alpha" can be the result of applying improper means of analysis of the spectrum of the EEG signal that did not take into account the significant properties of the applied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. Analysis of the shortcomings of the FFT method applied to EEG signal such as limited duration of analyzed signal, dependence of frequency resolution on time window duration, influence of window duration and shape, overlapping and spectral leakage was performed. Our analyses of EEG data as well as simulations indicate that double alpha spectra called as "split alpha" can appear, as spurious peaks, for short signal window when the EEG signal being studied shows multiple frequencies and frequency bands. These peaks have no relation to any frequencies of the signal and are an effect of spectrum leakage. Our paper is intended to explain the reasons underlying a spectrum pattern called as a "split alpha" and give some practical indications for using spectral analysis of EEG signal that might be useful for readers and allow to avoid EEG spectrum misinterpretation in further studies and publications as well as in clinical practice.

However, the neurophysiological basis for stimulation effects as well as their inter-individual differences is not yet understood. In the present study, we used a closed-loop electroencephalography-tACS(EEG-tACS) protocol to examine the modulation of alpha oscillations generated in occipito-parietal areas. In particular, we investigated the effects of a repeated short-time intermittent stimulation protocol (1 s in every trial) applied over the visual cortex (Cz and Oz) and adjusted according to the phase and frequency of visual alpha oscillations on the amplitude of these oscillations. Based on previous findings, we expected higher increases in alpha amplitudes for tACS applied in-phase with ongoing oscillations as compared to an application in anti-phase and this modulation to be present in low-alpha amplitude states of the visual system (eyes opened, EO) but not high (eyes closed, EC). Contrary to our expectations, we found a transient suppression of alpha power in inter-individually derived spatially specific parieto-occipital components obtainedviathe estimation of spatial filters by using the common spatial patterns approach. The amplitude modulation was independent of the phase relationship between the tACS signal and alpha oscillations, and the state of the visual system manipulatedviaclosed- and open-eye conditions. It was also absent in conventionally analyzed single-channel and multi-channel data from an average parieto-occipital region. The fact that the tACS modulation of oscillations was phase-independent suggests that mechanisms driving the effects of tACS may not be explained by entrainment alone, but rather require neuroplastic changes or transient disruption of neural oscillations. Our study also supports the notion that the response to tACS is subject-specific, where the modulatory effects are shaped by the interplay between the stimulation and different alpha generators. This favors stimulation protocols as well as analysis regimes exploiting inter-individual differences, such as spatial filters to reveal otherwise hidden stimulation effects and, thereby, comprehensively induce and study the effects and underlying mechanisms of tACS.

It is believed that the dynamic electrophysiological brain networks with specific frequency modes, transiently form and dissolve to support ongoing cognitive function during continuous task performance. Here, we propose a novel method based on tensor component analysis (TCA), to characterize the spatial, temporal, and spectral signatures of dynamic electrophysiological brain networks in electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during free music-listening. A three-way tensor containing time-frequency phase-coupling between pairs of parcellated brain regions is constructed. Nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is then applied to extract three interconnected, low-dimensional descriptions of data including temporal, spectral, and spatial connection factors. Musical features are also extracted from stimuli using acoustic feature extraction. Correlation analysis is then conducted between temporal courses of musical features and TCA components to examine the modulation of brain patterns. We derive several brain networks with distinct spectral modes (described by TCA components) significantly modulated by musical features, including higher-order cognitive, sensorimotor, and auditory networks. The results demonstrate that brain networks during music listening in EEG are well characterized by TCA components, with spatial patterns of oscillatory phase-synchronization in specific spectral modes. The proposed method provides evidence for the time-frequency dynamics of brain networks during free music listening through TCA, which allows us to better understand the reorganization of electrophysiological networks.

For the treatment of prognosis of stroke patients, Motor imagery (MI) as a novel experimental paradigm, clinically it is effective because MI based Brain-Computer interface system can promote rehabilitation of stroke patients. There is being a hot and challenging topic to recognize multi-class motor imagery action classification accurately based on electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. In this work, we propose a novel framework named MRC-MLP. Multiple Riemannian covariance is used for EEG feature extraction. We make a multi-scale spectral division to filter EEG signals. They consist of different frequency bandwidths name sub-band. We concatenate and vectorize features extracted by Riemannian covariance on each sub-band. We design a fully connected MLP model with an improved loss function for motor imagery EEG classification. Furthermore, our proposed method MRC-MLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves approximately mean accuracy with 76%.

Furthermore, a large body of research demonstrates that intrinsic oscillations are entrained by external rhythms, allowing a simple and efficient way to enhance human brain functions. As an external stimulation source, repeating acoustic stimuli have been shown to provide a possible pacing signal for modulating the electrical activity recorded by the electroencephalogram (EEG). In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding how rhythmic auditory stimulation can selectively modulate EEG oscillations. Despite growing evidence, recent evidence suggests that standard methods of data analysis are often insufficient for a definite proof of entrainment in some instances. In particular, we stressed that the complexity of the elicited modulations, often varying in phase and frequency on a short timescale, requires time-frequency measures that are better appropriate to analyze driven brain phenomena. Once entrainment is clearly established, one can assess the specificity of its expression, thus providing a better understanding of the physiology underlying brain modulation and a faster translation to treatment programs in various psychopathologic conditions.

The Oscillatory ReConstruction Algorithm adaptively identifies frequency bands to improve spectral decomposition in human and rodent neural recordings	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha oscillations; electroencephalography; intersubject frequency variability; ORCA; time-series analysis	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG; MEMORY; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS	Algorithm adaptively identifies frequency bands to improve spectral decomposition in human and rodent neural recordings. J Neurophysiol 124: 1914-1922, 2020. First published October 14, 2020; doi:10.1152/ jn.00292.2020.-Neural oscillations are routinely analyzed using methods that measure activity in fixed frequency bands (e.g., alpha, 8?12 Hz), although the frequency of neural signals varies within and across individuals based on numerous factors including neuroanatomy, behavioral demands, and species. Furthermore, band-limited activity is an often assumed, typically unmeasured model of neural activity, and band definitions vary considerably across studies. Together, these factors mask individual differences and can lead to noisy spectral estimates and interpretational problems when linking electrophysiology to behavior. We developed the Oscillatory ReConstruction Algorithm ("ORCA"), an unsupervised method to measure the spectral characteristics of neural signals in adaptively identified bands, which incorporates two new methods for frequency band identification. ORCA uses the instantaneous amplitude, phase, and frequency of activity in each band to reconstruct the signal and directly quantify spectral decomposition performance using each of four different models. To reduce researcher bias, ORCA provides spectral estimates derived from the best model and requiresminimal hyperparameterization. Analyzing human scalp EEG data during eyes-open and eyes-closed "resting" conditions, we first identify variability in the frequency content of neural signals across subjects and electrodes. We demonstrate that ORCA significantly improves spectral decomposition compared with conventional methods and captures the well-known increase in low-frequency activity during eye closure in electrode-and subject-specific frequency bands. We further illustrate the utility of our method in rodent CA1 recordings. ORCA is a novel analytic tool that allows researchers to investigate how nonstationary neural oscillations vary across behaviors, brain regions, individuals, and species. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural oscillations show substantial variability within and across individuals and brain regions, yet most existing studies analyze oscillations using canonical, fixed frequency bands. Thus, there is an ongoing need for tools that capture oscillatory variability in neural signals. Toward this end, Oscillatory ReConstruction Algorithm is a novel and adaptive analytic tool that allows researchers to measure neural oscillations with more precision and less researcher bias.

Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to calibrate RSVP display parameters, such as spatial alignments or presentation rates, to suit the reader's information processing ability at high presentation speeds. Existing methods rely on comprehension and subjective workload scores, which are influenced by the user's knowledge base and subjective perception. Here, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to directly determine how individual information processing varies with changes in RSVP display parameters. Eighteen participants read text excerpts with RSVP in a repeated-measures design that manipulated the Text Alignment and Presentation Speed of text representation. We evaluated how predictive EEG metrics were of gains in reading speed, subjective workload, and text comprehension. We found significant correlations between EEG and increasing Presentation Speeds and propose how EEG can be used for dynamic selection of RSVP parameters.

Pain-specific activity patterns within and between these local networks remain, however, largely unknown. We measured neuronal network oscillations in different relevant regions of the mouse brain during acute pain, induced by subcutaneous injection of capsaicin into the left hind paw. Field potentials were recorded from primary somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior insula, ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus, parietal cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and olfactory bulb. Analysis included power spectra of local signals as well as interregional coherences and cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Capsaicin injection caused hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli for at least one hour. At the same time, CFC between low (1-12 Hz) and fast frequencies (80-120 Hz) was increased in the ACC, as well as interregional coherence of low frequency oscillations (< 30 Hz) between several networks. However, these changes were not significant anymore after multiple comparison corrections. Using a variable selection method (elastic net) and a logistic regression classifier, however, the pain state was reliably predicted by combining parameters of power and coherence from various regions. Distinction between capsaicin and saline injection was also possible when data were restricted to frequencies <30 Hz, as used in clinical electroencephalography (EEG). Our findings indicate that changes of distributed brain oscillations may provide a functional signature of acute pain or pain-related alterations in activity.

Alpha frequency oscillations are believed to depict idling or inhibition of task-irrelevant cortical activities. However, recent studies on alpha oscillations (particularly alpha phase) hypothesize that they have an active and direct role in the mechanisms of attention and working memory. To understand the role of alpha oscillations in several cognitive processes, accurate estimations of phase, amplitude, and frequency are required. Herein, we propose an approach for time-series forward prediction by comparing an autoregressive (AR) model and an adaptive method (least mean square (LMS)-based AR model). This study tested both methods for two prediction lengths of data. Our results indicate that for shorter data segments (prediction of 128 ms), the AR model outperforms the LMS-based AR model, while for longer prediction lengths (256 ms), the LMS- based AR model surpasses the AR model. LMS with low computational cost can aid in electroencephalography (EEG) phase prediction (alpha oscillations) in basic research to reveal the functional role of the oscillatory phase as well as for applications for brain-computer interfaces.

To this end, combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) provides a non-invasive tool to simultaneously perturb and measure neurophysiological correlates of cortical function, including oscillatory activity, cortical inhibition, connectivity, and synchronization. In this review, we summarize the findings from a variety of studies that apply TMS/EEG to understand the fundamental features of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia. These results lend to future applications of TMS/EEG in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

An exploration of neural dynamics of motor imagery for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS); motor imagery (MI)	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; MOVEMENT; BAND; EEG; ALS; MU; DISCRIMINATION	Objective. Studies of the neuropathological effects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) on the underlying motor system have investigated abnormalities in the magnitude and timing of the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) during motor execution (ME). However, the spatio-spectral-temporal dynamics of these sensorimotor oscillations during motor imagery (MI) have not been fully explored for these patients. This study explores the neural dynamics of sensorimotor oscillations for ALS patients during MI by quantifying ERD/ERS features in frequency, time, and space. Approach. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded from six patients with ALS and 11 age-matched healthy controls (HC) while performing a MI task. ERD/ERS features were extracted using wavelet-based time-frequency analysis and compared between the two groups to quantify the abnormal neural dynamics of ALS in terms of both time and frequency. Topographic correlation analysis was conducted to compare the localization of MI activity between groups and to identify subject-specific frequencies in the mu and beta frequency bands. Main results. Overall, reduced and delayed ERD was observed for ALS patients, particularly during right-hand MI. ERD features were also correlated with ALS clinical scores, specifically disease duration, bulbar, and cognitive functions. Significance. The analyses in this study quantify abnormalities in the magnitude and timing of sensorimotor oscillations for ALS patients during MI tasks. Our findings reveal notable differences between MI and existing results on ME in ALS. The observed alterations are speculated to reflect disruptions in the underlying cortical networks involved in MI functions. Quantifying the neural dynamics of MI plays an important role in the study of EEG-based cortical markers for ALS.	[Hosni, Sarah M.; Deligani, R. J.; McLinden, J.; Borgheai, S.

We constructed a functional brain network for LHI patients with an acute consciousness disorder to identify new diagnostic markers related to ECDs by analyzing brain network characteristics and mechanisms. Methods Between August 1, 2017, and September 30, 2018, patients with acute (< 1 month) LHI were admitted to the neurocritical care unit at Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded, and the MATLAB platform (2017b) was used to calculate spectral power, entropy, coherence and phase synchronization. The quantitative EEG and brain network characteristics of different consciousness states and different frequency bands were analyzed (alpha = 0.05). EEG data were recorded 38 times in 30 patients, 25 of whom were in the ECD group, while 13 patients were in the conscious group. Results (1) Spectral power analysis: The conscious group had higher beta relative spectral power across the whole brain, higher alpha spectral power in the frontal-parietal lobe on the infarction contralateral side, and lower theta and delta spectral power in the central-occipital lobe on the infarction contralateral side than the ECD group. (2) Entropy analysis: The conscious group had higher approximate entropy (ApEn) and permutation entropy (PeEn) across the whole brain than the ECD group. (3) Coherence: The conscious group had higher alpha coherence in nearly the whole brain and higher beta coherence in the bilateral frontal-parietal and parietal-occipital lobes than the ECD group. (4) Phase synchronization: The conscious group had higher alpha and beta synchronization in nearly the whole brain, particularly in the frontal-parietal and parietal-occipital lobes, than the ECD group. (5) Graph theory: The conscious group had higher small-worldness in each frequency band than the ECD group. Conclusion In patients with LHI, higher levels of consciousness were associated with more alpha and beta oscillations and fewer delta and theta oscillations. Higher ApEn, PeEn, total brain connectivity, and small-worldness and a wider signal distribution range corresponded to a higher consciousness level.

MEG studies also revealed a cortical contribution to the high gamma oscillations at the fundamental frequency (f(0)) of a vowel stimulus. Therefore, studying the cortical component of the frequency-following response could provide insights into how pitch information is encoded at the cortical level. Comparing how aging affects the different responses may help to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying speech understanding deficits in older age. We simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG responses to the syllable /ba/. MEG beamformer analysis localized sources in bilateral auditory cortices and the midbrain. Time-frequency analysis showed a faithful representation of the pitch contour between 106 Hz and 138 Hz in the cortical activity. A cross-correlation revealed a latency of 20 ms. Furthermore, stimulus onsets elicited cortical 40-Hz responses. Both the 40-Hz and the f(0) response amplitudes increased in older age and were larger in the right hemisphere. The effects of aging and laterality of the f(0) response were evident in the MEG only, suggesting that both effects were characteristics of the cortical response. After comparing f(0) and N1 responses in EEG and MEG, we estimated that approximately one-third of the scalp-recorded f(0) response could be cortical in origin. We attributed the significance of the cortical f(0) response to the precise timing of cortical neurons that serve as a time-sensitive code for pitch.

During concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state recordings, whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) strength is spatially correlated across modalities. However, cross-modal investigations have commonly remained correlational, and joint analysis of EEG-fMRI connectivity is largely unexplored. Here we investigated if there exist (spatially) independent FC networks linked between modalities. We applied the recently proposed hybrid connectivity independent component analysis (connlCA) framework to two concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state datasets (total 40 subjects). Two robust components were found across both datasets. The first component has a uniformly distributed EEG frequency fingerprint linked mainly to intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in both modalities. Conversely, the second component is sensitive to different EEG frequencies and is primarily linked to intra-ICN connectivity in fMRI but to inter-ICN connectivity in EEG. The first hybrid component suggests that connectivity dynamics within well-known ICNs span timescales, from millisecond range in all canonical frequencies of FCEEG to second range of FCfMRI. Conversely, the second component additionally exposes linked but spatially divergent neuronal processing at the two timescales. This work reveals the existence of joint spatially independent components, suggesting that parts of resting-state connectivity are co-expressed in a linked manner across EEG and fMRI over individuals.

This study compared OHS with equally obese obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, with similar apnea-hypopnea indices. Methods Resting wake and overnight sleep electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, neurocognitive tests, and sleepiness, depression and anxiety scores were assessed before and after 3 months of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in 15 OHS and 36 OSA patients. Results Pretreatment, greater slow frequency EEG activity during wake and sleep states (increased delta-alpha ratio during sleep, and theta power during awake) was observed in the OHS group compared to the OSA group. EEG slowing was correlated with poorer performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (slowest 10% of reciprocal reaction times, psychomotor vigilance test [PVT SRRT], primary outcome), and worse sleep-related hypoxemia measures in OHS. There was no between-group significant difference in PVT performance at pre or post-treatment. Similarly, despite both groups demonstrating improved sleepiness, anxiety and depression scores with PAP therapy, there were no differences in treatment response between the OSA and OHS groups. Conclusion Patients with OHS have greater slow frequency EEG activity during sleep and wake than equally obese patients with OSA. Greater EEG slowing was associated with worse vigilance and lower oxygenation during sleep.	[Sivam, Sheila; Wong, Keith K.

In this study, a decision-making cognitive task of rock-paper-scissors was designed, and the complex decision-making task was divided into three stages (decision planning, confirmation, and feedback). 64 channels of EEG signals were simultaneously recorded using the Neuroscan QuikCap system during the whole task. The average spectral power and phase synchronization values of each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha and beta band) were extracted and compared within and across different stages. The results showed the desire to win or not to lose within the first stage might be accompanied by the increase of alpha and theta components. In the second stage, the spectral power inhibition of alpha wave and phase synchronization increase of delta wave indicated that subjects would improve their attentions when they confirmed their choice. In the third stage, the theta increased effect and alpha decreased effect were related to different feedback. This pilot study suggests that the time-frequency analysis of EEG signals could be a great tool to visualize the brain activities in response to different cognitive tasks.

Protocol for the Prognosticating Delirium Recovery Outcomes Using Wakefulness and Sleep Electroencephalography (P-DROWS-E) study: a prospective observational study of delirium in elderly cardiac surgical patients	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; CONFUSION ASSESSMENT METHOD; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS; VISUAL EEG-ANALYSIS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SUBSYNDROMAL DELIRIUM; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SPINDLE CHARACTERISTICS; POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM	Introduction Delirium is a potentially preventable disorder characterised by acute disturbances in attention and cognition with fluctuating severity. Postoperative delirium is associated with prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay, cognitive decline and mortality. The development of biomarkers for tracking delirium could potentially aid in the early detection, mitigation and assessment of response to interventions. Because sleep disruption has been posited as a contributor to the development of this syndrome, expression of abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) patterns during sleep and wakefulness may be informative. Here we hypothesise that abnormal EEG patterns of sleep and wakefulness may serve as predictive and diagnostic markers for postoperative delirium. Such abnormal EEG patterns would mechanistically link disrupted thalamocortical connectivity to this important clinical syndrome. Methods and analysis P-DROWS-E (Prognosticating Delirium Recovery Outcomes Using Wakefulness and Sleep Electroencephalography) is a 220-patient prospective observational study. Patient eligibility criteria include those who are English-speaking, age 60 years or older and undergoing elective cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. EEG acquisition will occur 1-2 nights preoperatively, intraoperatively, and up to 7 days postoperatively. Concurrent with EEG recordings, two times per day postoperative Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) evaluations will quantify the presence and severity of delirium. EEG slow wave activity, sleep spindle density and peak frequency of the posterior dominant rhythm will be quantified. Linear mixed-effects models will be used to evaluate the relationships between delirium severity/duration and EEG measures as a function of time. Ethics and dissemination P-DROWS-E is approved by the ethics board at Washington University in St. Louis. Recruitment began in October 2018. Dissemination plans include presentations at scientific conferences, scientific publications and mass media.	[Smith, S.

The main differences between them concern the a priori information used and its sensitivity to high noise levels. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been recently applied to electroencephalography EEG-based neural activity reconstruction to provide a priori time-frequency information to improve the estimation of neural activity. EMD has the specific ability to identify independent oscillatory modes in non-stationary signals with multiple oscillatory components. However, attempts to use EMD in EEG analysis have not yet provided optimal reconstructions, due to the intrinsic mode-mixing problem of EMD. Several studies have used single-channel analysis, whereas others have used multiple-channel analysis for other applications. Here, we present the results of multiple-channel analysis using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to reduce the mode-mixing problem and provide useful a priori time-frequency information for the reconstruction of neuronal activity using several low-density EEG electrode montages. The methods were evaluated using real and synthetic EEG data, in which the reconstructions were performed using the multiple sparse priors (MSP) algorithm with EEG electrode montages of 32, 16, and 8 electrodes. The quality of the source reconstruction was assessed using the Wasserstein metric. A comparison of the solutions without pre-processing and those after applying MEMD showed the source reconstructions to be improved using MEMD as a priori information for the low-density montages of 8 and 16 electrodes. The mean source reconstruction error on a real EEG dataset was reduced by 59.42 and 66.04% for the 8 and 16 electrode montages, respectively, and that on a simulated EEG with three active sources, by 87.31 and 31.45% for the same electrode montages.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is another noninvasive, painless and safe method, to modulate nerve cells activity. TMS has been increasingly used as a tool in neurosciences. However, its basic mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Simultaneous TMS/EEG recordings are technically challenging, but could provide some more useful information. Eleven normal subjects were submitted to TMS/EEG to investigate its effect on the primary motor cortex area, describing its properties both in time and frequency domains. TMS was also applied to a non-human head model (muskmelon - Cucumis sp.), to evaluate the effect of stimuli artifacts in the electrodes. Time domain techniques revealed the P60, N100, P190 and N280 components. In frequency domain analysis, oscillations between 0.5-70 Hz were observed. After adjusting the TMS capacitor recharge time in order to avoid artifacts during the acquired signal stretch, oscillations were reduced to the 0.5-20 Hz range. Results from other publications were replicated in our population. This information may be useful for motor pathways future studies. TMS capacitors recharge time must be setup to avoid undesired artifacts that could put results in doubt. It is also advisable that the recharge time must also be clearly informed in other works involving THE and EEG. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study tested the hypothesis that enhanced beta-band oscillations may be a marker of compensatory neural plasticity during the recovery period in SCI. We tested this hypothesis at baseline in SCI subjects and also in response to cortical stimulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT). Methods: In this neurophysiological analysis of a randomized controlled trial, thirty-nine patients with incomplete SCI were included. They received 30 sessions of either active or sham anodal tDCS over the primary motor area for 20 min combined with RAGT. We analyzed the Electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum and task-related power modulation of EEG oscillations, and their association with gait function indexed by Walk Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI-II). Univariate and multivariate linear/logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the predictors of gait function and recovery. Results: Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that in the sensorimotor area: (1) Anodal tDCS combined with RAGT can modulate high-beta EEG oscillations power and enhance gait recovery; (2) higher high-beta EEG oscillations power at baseline can predict baseline gait function; (3) high-beta EEG oscillations power at baseline can predict gait recovery - the higher power at baseline, the better gait recovery; (4) decreases in relative high-beta power and increases in beta power decrease during walking are associated with gait recovery. Conclusions: Enhanced EEG beta oscillations in the sensorimotor area in SCI subjects may be part of a compensatory mechanism to enhance local plasticity. Our results point to the direction that interventions enhancing local plasticity such as tDCS combined with robotic training also lead to an immediate increase in sensorimotor cortex activation, improvement in gait recovery, and subsequent decrease in high-beta power. These findings suggest that beta-band oscillations may be potential biomarkers of gait function and recovery in SCI. Significance: These findings are significant for rehabilitation in SCI patients, and as EEG is a portable, inexpensive, and easy-to-apply system, the clinical translation is feasible to follow better the recovery process and to help to individualize rehabilitation therapies of SCI patients.

However, the different network patterns under different emotional states in the high gamma band (50-80 Hz) remain unclear. In this paper, we investigate different emotional states using functional network analysis on various frequency bands. We constructed multiple functional networks on different frequency bands and performed functional network analysis and time-frequency analysis on these frequency bands to determine the significant features that represent different emotional states. Furthermore, we verified the effectiveness of these features by using them in emotion recognition. Our experimental results revealed that the network connections in the high gamma band with significant differences among the positive, neutral, and negative emotional states were much denser than the network connections in the other frequency bands. The connections mainly occurred in the left prefrontal, left temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Moreover, long-distance connections with significant differences among the emotional states were observed in the high frequency bands, particularly in the high gamma band. Additionally, high gamma band fusion features derived from the global efficiency, network connections, and differential entropies achieved the highest classification accuracies for both our dataset and the public dataset. These results are consistent with literature and provide further evidence that high gamma band EEG signals are more sensitive and effective than the EEG signals in other frequency bands in studying human affective perception.

This paper proposes a novel solution for classification of left/right hand movement by exploiting a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with attention mechanism to learn the electroencephalogram (EEG) time-series information. To this end, a wide range of time and frequency domain features are extracted from the EEG signals and used to train an LSTM network to perform the classification task. We conduct extensive experiments with the EEG Movement dataset and show that our proposed solution our method achieves improvements over several benchmarks and state-of-the-art methods in both intra-subject and cross-subject validation schemes. Moreover, we utilize the proposed framework to analyze the information as received by the sensors and monitor the activated regions of the brain by tracking EEG topography throughout the experiments.

Neurofeedback (NF) has been reported effective in enhancing alpha oscillation. Our objectives were to assess the alpha oscillation during laparoscopic skills training, and to verify the usefulness of NF in improving the learning efficacy. Methods Sixty medical students without laparoscopic experience were recruited. Multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded during training of peg transfer task. Training performance was assessed based on the task completion time. All subjects participated in the first experiment comprising eight training blocks and one testing block. Subjects were ranked based on performance: the top 20 subjects were classified as the good performance group and the bottom 20 subjects as the fair performance group. In the second experiment, the fair performance group were randomly divided into the NF and control groups. Spectral analysis of EEG signals was used to calculate alpha power and alpha band coherence. Training performance and EEG alpha powers were compared between the NF and control groups. Results In the first experiment, the completion time was significantly faster in the good performance group (62.5 +/- 2.8 s) compared with the fair performance group (75.0 +/- 5.6 s) (P < 0.05). EEG oscillations showed strong alpha power and alpha coherence in the posterior electrode clusters in the good performance group. In the second experiment, the NF group showed much stronger alpha activity power and coherence compared with the control group. Furthermore, the NF training led to a significant performance improvement from 75.1 +/- 5.9 s in the first experiment to 64.3 +/- 4.9 s in the second experiment (P = 0.003). Conclusions The learning performance of laparoscopic skills varies among individuals. Subjects with good performance results had high alpha power and strong alpha coherence. The alpha enhancement NF increased alpha oscillations, leading to improved learning efficacy.

To enhance seizure detection accuracy and reduce power consumption, this paper has proposed a selection method of optimal features customized for each patient. A feature pool consisting of several popular features is constructed. Then, the customized multi-domain features for each patient are selected from feature pool based on minimum redundancy maximum relevance. By removing redundant features, the computational complexity of on-line seizure detection can be greatly reduced, which is desired in wearable device where low-power and real-time operation are required. Four test datasets are used to evaluate the performance of proposed method, with detection accuracy calculated. Experiment results show that different datasets vary in optimal features. By using the proposed method, the detection accuracy and the value of area under receiver operating characteristic curve can be improved by 11.49% and 0.13 respectively, while feature dimension being reduced to 1.

Nonlinear interaction decomposition (NID): A method for separation of cross-frequency coupled sources in human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Nonlinear interaction decomposition; NID; Cross-frequency coupling; MEG; EEG; Nonlinear neuronal interactions; Independent component analysis; ICA	EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; COMMUNICATION; NETWORKS; RHYTHMS	Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between neuronal oscillations reflects an integration of spatially and spectrally distributed information in the brain. Here, we propose a novel framework for detecting such interactions in Magneto- and Electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), which we refer to as Nonlinear Interaction Decomposition (NID). In contrast to all previous methods for separation of cross-frequency (CF) sources in the brain, we propose that the extraction of nonlinearly interacting oscillations can be based on the statistical properties of their linear mixtures. The main idea of NID is that nonlinearly coupled brain oscillations can be mixed in such a way that the resulting linear mixture has a non-Gaussian distribution. We evaluate this argument analytically for amplitude-modulated narrow-band oscillations which are either phase-phase or amplitude-amplitude CF coupled. We validated NID extensively with simulated EEG obtained with realistic head modelling. The method extracted nonlinearly interacting components reliably even at SNRs as small as -15 dB. Additionally, we applied NID to the resting-state EEG of 81 subjects to characterize CF phase-phase coupling between alpha and beta oscillations. The extracted sources were located in temporal, parietal and frontal areas, demonstrating the existence of diverse local and distant nonlinear interactions in resting-state EEG data.

However, these methods suffer from important limitations. Source imaging is based on an ill-posed inverse problem leading to instability of source localization solutions, has a limited capacity to localize high frequency oscillations and loses its robustness for induced responses (ill-defined trigger). The drawback of TFM is that it involves independent analysis of signals from a number of frequency bands, and from co-localized sensors. In the present article, a regression-based multi-sensor space-time-frequency analysis (MSA) approach, which integrates co-localized sensors and/or multi-frequency information, is proposed. To estimate task-specific brain activations, MSA uses cross-validated, shifted, multiple Pearson correlation, calculated from the time-frequency transformed brain signal and the binary signal of stimuli. The results are projected from the sensor space onto the cortical surface. To assess MSA performance, the proposed method was compared to the weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE) source imaging method, in terms of spatial selectivity and robustness against an ill-defined trigger. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings were performed in fourteen subjects during two motor tasks: finger tapping and elbow flexion/extension. In particular, our results show that the MSA approach provides good localization performance when compared to wMNE and statistically significant improvement of robustness against ill-defined trigger.

Some monitoring systems like the SEDLine Root allow export of the EEG to be used for retrospective analysis. We show that changes made to the SEDLine display during recording affected the recorded EEG. These changes can strongly impact retrospective analysis of EEG signals. Real-time changes of the feed speed in the SEDLine Root device display modifies the sampling rate of the exported EEG. We used a patient as well as a simulated EEG recording to highlight the effects of the display settings on the extracted EEG. Therefore, we changed EEG feed and amplitude resolution on the display in a systematic manner. To visualize the effects of these changes, we present raw EEG segments and the density spectral array of the recording. Changing the display's amplitude resolution affects the amplitudes. If the amplitude resolution is too fine, the exported EEG contains clipped amplitudes. If the resolution is too coarse, the EEG resolution becomes too low leading to a low-quality signal making frequency analysis impossible. The proportion of clipped or zero-line data caused by the amplitude setting was > 60% in our sedated patient. Changing the display settings results in undocumented changes in EEG amplitude, sampling rate, and signal quality. The occult nature of these changes could make the analysis of data sets difficult if not invalid. We strongly suggest researchers adequately define and keep the EEG display settings to export good quality EEG and to ensure comparability among patients.

Previous research has suggested that neuronal oscillations at different frequency bands are associated with top-down cognitive control; however, whether distinct neural oscillations have similar or different functions for cognitive control is not well understood. The aim of the current study was to investigate the oscillatory neuronal mechanisms underlying two distinct components of hierarchical cognitive control: the level of abstraction of a rule, and the number of rules that must be maintained (set-size). We collected EEG data in 31 men and women who performed a hierarchical cognitive control task that varied in levels of abstraction and set-size. Results from time-frequency analysis in frontal electrodes showed an increase in theta amplitude for increased set-size, whereas an increase in delta was associated with increased abstraction. Both theta and delta amplitude correlated with behavioral performance in the tasks but in an opposite manner: theta correlated with response time slowing when the number of rules increased, whereas delta correlated with response time when rules became more abstract. Phase-amplitude coupling analysis revealed that delta phase-coupled with beta amplitude during conditions with a higher level of abstraction, whereby beta band may potentially represent motor output that was guided by the delta phase. These results suggest that distinct neural oscillatory mechanisms underlie different components of hierarchical cognitive control.

Linguistic Structure and Meaning Organize Neural Oscillations into a Content-Specific Hierarchy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						combinatorial processing; lexical semantics; mutual information; neural oscillations; prosody; sentence comprehension	TEMPORAL RECEPTIVE WINDOWS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CONTINUOUS SPEECH; CUE INTEGRATION; ENTRAINMENT; LANGUAGE; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; TRACKING; PROGRAM	Neural oscillations track linguistic information during speech comprehension (Ding et al., 2016; Keitel et al., 2018), and are known to be modulated by acoustic landmarks and speech intelligibility (Doelling et al., 2014; Zoefel and VanRullen, 2015). However, studies investigating linguistic tracking have either relied on non-naturalistic isochronous stimuli or failed to fully control for prosody. Therefore, it is still unclear whether low-frequency activity tracks linguistic structure during natural speech, where linguistic structure does not follow such a palpable temporal pattern. Here, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) and manipulated the presence of semantic and syntactic information apart from the timescale of their occurrence, while carefully controlling for the acoustic-prosodic and lexical-semantic information in the signal. EEG was recorded while 29 adult native speakers (22 women, 7 men) listened to naturally spoken Dutch sentences, jabberwocky controls with morphemes and sentential prosody, word lists with lexical content but no phrase structure, and backward acoustically matched controls. Mutual information (MI) analysis revealed sensitivity to linguistic content: MI was highest for sentences at the phrasal (0.8-1.1Hz) and lexical (1.9-2.8Hz) timescales, suggesting that the delta-band is modulated by lexically driven combinatorial processing beyond prosody, and that linguistic content (i.e., structure and meaning) organizes neural oscillations beyond the timescale and rhythmicity of the stimulus. This pattern is consistent with neurophysiologically inspired models of language comprehension (Martin, 2016, 2020; Martin and Doumas, 2017) where oscillations encode endogenously generated linguistic content over and above exogenous or stimulus-driven timing and rhythm information.

In this paper, a weighted k-nearest neighbor classifier based on Bray Curtis distance (WBCKNN) is proposed to implement automatic detection of epilepsy. The Fourier transform can transform the time-domain characteristics of the signal into frequency domain, which can display more useful information. The WBCKNN classifier can well overcome the sensitivity of the neighborhood size k and has good robustness. Therefore, it can classify EEG signals more accurately for different situations. WBCKNN is applied on public dataset and tested by k-fold cross-validation. Experimental results show that the best accuracy of the two-classification problems and three-classification problems is 99.67% and 99%, respectively. Compared to other classifiers, the accuracy of classification is also improved. In addition, this method is superior to traditional methods in sensitivity, specificity and false alarm rate of epilepsy classification. This method can be applied to the medical market to help doctors diagnose epilepsy.

Here, we investigated the relation between the ERN and error-related theta oscillations and the emergence of error awareness by conducting time- and phase-locked averaging analysis based on 4-8 Hz filtered data and phase-locked time frequency analysis. Results showed that while the ERN did not differ significantly between aware and unaware errors, theta power was stronger for aware errors than for unaware errors. Further, when continuous EEG was filtered outside the theta band, the ERN results confirmed this pattern. Additionally, when the non-phase-locked component was removed from continuous EEG, stronger theta power was still observed in aware errors compared to unaware errors. Collectively, these findings may suggest that (1) the ERN emerges from phase-locked component of theta band EEG activities; (2) the ERN engages in conscious error perception and serves the emerging error awareness through the activity of theta oscillations. Thus, early error monitoring is a precursor to error awareness, but this relationship is masked by high-frequency activity in aware errors when the ERN is not filtered outside the theta band in the Go/No-go task.

We also explored whether changes in spectral power or functional connectivity are associated with polysomnographic characteristics and/or neuropsychological performance. Methods: In sum, 19 OSA subjects (apnea-hypopnea index >= 20, age: 63.6 +/- 6.4) and 22 controls (apnea-hypopnea index <= 10, age: 63.6 +/- 6.7) underwent a full night of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) followed by a waking EEG and a neuropsychological assessment. Waking EEG spectral power and imaginary coherence were compared between groups for all EEG frequency bands and scalp regions. Correlation analyses were performed between selected waking EEG variables, polysomnographic parameters and neuropsychological performance. Results: No group difference was observed for EEG spectral power for any frequency band. Regarding the imaginary coherence, when compared to controls, OSA subjects showed decreased EEG connectivity between frontal and temporal regions in theta and alpha bands as well as increased connectivity between frontal and parietal regions in delta and beta 1 bands. In the OSA group, these changes in connectivity correlated with lower sleep efficiency, lower total sleep time and higher apnea-hypopnea index. No relationship was found with neuropsychological performance. Conclusions: Contrary to spectral power, imaginary coherence was sensitive enough to detect changes in brain function in middle-aged and older subjects with OSA when compared to controls. Whether these changes in cerebral connectivity predict cognitive decline needs to be investigated longitudinally. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simultaneously acquired MEG-EEG data are inherently multi-dimensional and exhibit coupling. This study uses a coupled tensor decomposition to extract the signal sources from MEG-EEG during intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). We employ the Coupled Semi-Algebraic framework for approximate CP decomposition via SImultaneous matrix diagonalization (C-SECSI). After comparing its performance with alternative methods using simulated benchmark data, we apply it to MEG-EEG recordings of 12 participants during IPS with fractions of the individual alpha frequency between 0.4 and 1.3. In the benchmark tests, C-SECSI is more accurate than SECSI and alternative methods, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, e.g., involving collinear factors or noise sources with different variances. The component field-maps allow us to separate physiologically meaningful oscillations of visually evoked brain activity from background signals. The frequency signatures of the components identify either an entrainment to the respective stimulation frequency or its first harmonic, or an oscillation in the individual alpha band or theta band. In the group analysis of both, MEG and EEG data, we observe a reciprocal relationship between alpha and theta band oscillations. The coupled tensor decomposition using C-SECSI is a robust, powerful method for the extraction of physiologically meaningful sources from multidimensional biomedical data. Unsupervised signal source extraction is an essential solution for rendering advanced multi-modal signal acquisition technology accessible to clinical diagnostics, pre-surgical planning, and brain computer interface applications.

These symptoms adversely affect the user experience and hinder the widespread application of 3D media. Existing studies mainly used electroencephalography (EEG) power (based on frequency domain analysis) to evaluate 3D visual fatigue (3DVF), but their results were often contradictory and confusing. To address this problem, we investigated the relationship between EEG features and visual fatigue from the perspective of both time and time-frequency domain. Random-dot stereograms (RDS) with various disparities were employed to elicit depth-related visual evoked potentials (VEPs). The experiment lasted about 27 min for each subject to induce fatigue, and the EEG was recorded synchronously. VEPs of different fatigue levels were processed to extract both time (such as P-120 and N-170 components in VEPs) and time-frequency (like event-related spectral perturbation [ERSP]) domain characteristics. A significant increase in P-120 amplitude was observed in the parietal region, and time-frequency analysis also revealed a significant ERSP decrease of theta bands in the central-frontal region with a latency of 200 to 300 ms when subjects suffered fatigue. Our results confirm the hypothesis that activity of theta decreased with 3DVF level, or rather, we found ERSPs of theta bands on FC4 and Cz in the 200- to 300-ms window decreased significantly across four fatigue levels. Furthermore, we first reported the relationship between P-120 amplitude and 3DVF, which implied this feature could be considered as a feature of 3DVF evaluation. In summary, our studies could provide a new insight for 3DVF evaluation using EEG.

Midfrontal theta phase coordinates behaviorally relevant brain computations during cognitive control	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neuronal oscillations; Midfrontal cortex; Theta; Phase-resolved correlations; Conflict processing	RESPONSE CONFLICT; OSCILLATORY DYNAMICS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; EEG DYNAMICS; TIME; COMMUNICATION; ADAPTATION; STIMULUS; RHYTHMS	Neural oscillations are thought to provide a cyclic time frame for orchestrating brain computations. Following this assumption, midfrontal theta oscillations have recently been proposed to temporally organize brain computations during conflict processing. Using a multivariate analysis approach, we show that brain-behavior relationships during conflict tasks are modulated according to the phase of ongoing endogenous midfrontal theta oscillations recorded by scalp EEG. We found reproducible results in two independent datasets, using two different conflict tasks: brain-behavior relationships (correlation between reaction time and theta power) were theta phase-dependent in a subject-specific manner, and these "behaviorally optimal" theta phases were also associated with fronto-parietal cross-frequency dynamics emerging as theta phase-locked beta power bursts. These effects were present regardless of the strength of conflict. Thus, these results provide empirical evidence that midfrontal theta oscillations are involved in cyclically orchestrating brain computations likely related to response execution during the tasks rather than purely related to conflict processing. More generally, this study supports the hypothesis that phase-based computation is an important mechanism giving rise to cognitive processing.

We identify two linked problems related to estimating the phase of EEG rhythms with a specific focus on the alpha-band: 1) when the signal after a specific stimulus is unknown (real-time case), or 2) when it is corrupted by the presence of the stimulus itself (offline analysis). We propose methods to estimate the phase at the presentation time of these stimuli.Approach.Machine learning methods are used to learn the causal mapping from an unprocessed EEG recording to a phase estimate generated with a non-causal signal processing chain. This mapping is then used to predict the phase causally where non-causal methods are inappropriate.Main results.We demonstrate the ability of these machine learning methods to estimate instantaneous phase from an EEG signal subjected to very minor pre-processing with higher accuracy than commonly used signal-processing methods.Significance.Neural oscillations have been implicated in a wide variety of sensory, cognitive and motor functions. The instantaneous phase of these rhythms may reflect specific processes of computation which can be acted upon if they can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Such brain-state dependent paradigms are of increasing medical and scientific interest.	[McIntosh, J.

Electroencephalography (EEG)-based driving fatigue studies showed promising performance in fatigue monitoring. However, complex methodologies are not suitable for practical implementation. In our simulation-based setup that retained the constraints of real driving, we took a step closer to fatigue estimation in a practical scenario. We adopted a preprocessing pipeline with low computational complexity, which can be easily and practically implemented in real time. Moreover, regression-based continuous fatigue estimation was achieved using power spectral features in conjunction with time as the fatigue label. We sought to compare three regression models and three time windows to demonstrate their effects on the performance of fatigue estimation. Dynamic time warping was proposed as a new measure for evaluating the performance of fatigue estimation. The results derived from the validation of the proposed framework on 19 subjects showed that our proposed framework was promising toward practical implementation. Fatigue estimation by the support vector regression with radial basis function kernel and 5-s window length achieved the best performance. We also provided a comprehensive analysis on the spatial distribution of channels and frequency bands mostly contributing to fatigue estimation, which can inform the feature and channel reduction for real-time fatigue monitoring in practical driving. After reducing the number of electrodes by 75%, the proposed framework retained comparable performance in fatigue estimation. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and adaptability of our proposed framework in practical implementation of mental fatigue estimation.

Thus, objective indicators of ASD are of great interest to clinicians. In this study, we sought biomarkers from resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data that could be used to accurately distinguish children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Methods We recorded resting-state EEG from 46 children with ASD and 63 age-matched TD children aged 3 to 5 years. We applied singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to the EEG sequences to eliminate noise components and accurately extract the alpha rhythm. Results When we used individualized alpha peak frequency (iAPF) and individualized alpha absolute power (iABP) as features for a linear support vector machine, ASD versus TD classification accuracy was 92.7%. Conclusion This study suggested that our methods have potential to assist in clinical diagnosis.

If we want to improve those lives affected, we need to perform real-time epilepsy detection with constant monitoring of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Typically, the statistical behavior of the EEG signals presents heavy-tail phenomena, therefore their analysis must be particular in order to define a strong framework based on statistical parameters to detect seizures. In this article, the heavy-tail characterization of EEG signals is studied, a simple real-time epilepsy detection using an alpha-stable estimator is proposed, and the false-positive rate is analyzed. The performance of the proposed estimator is compared to others previously reported in the literature, and we show that one of the signal parameters characterized as an alpha-stable distribution, serves as an indicator of epilepsy episodes more efficiently. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm presents low sensitivity to noise below the 3.8 dB.

Unfortunately, due to the current stimulation artifact, problems remain in the context of analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal recorded during ongoing stimulation. To address this problem, we propose the use of a simple moving average subtraction as a method for artifact elimination. This method involves the creation of a template of the stimulation artifact from EEG signal recorded during non-invasive electrical stimulation with a sinusoidal alternating current. The present report describes results of the effects of a simple moving average filtration that varies based on averaging parameters; in particular, we varied the number of sinusoidal periods per segment of the recorded signal and the number of segments used to construct an artifact template. Given the ongoing lack of a mathematical model that allows for the prediction of the "hidden" EEG signal with the alternating current stimulation artifact, we propose performing an earlier simulation that is based on the addition of artificial stimulation artifact to the known EEG signal. This solution allows for the optimization of filtering parameters with detailed knowledge about the accuracy of artifact removal. The algorithm, designed in the MATLAB environment, has been tested on data recorded from two volunteers subjected to sinusoidal transorbital alternating current stimulation. Analysis of the percentage difference between the original and filtered signal in time and frequency domain highlights the advantage of 1-period filtration.

In this paper we evaluate the detection of cognitive load using an off the shelf low cost electroencephalography (EEG) device, namely the EMOTIV EPOC+, by utilising four classifiers including random forest, neural network, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and logistic regression. We relied on automatic power spectral features calculated from the EmotivPro software for evaluation of classifiers. Using power spectral features automatically calculated from the EMOTIVE headset, we show that the cognitive load levels can be efficiently distinguished (reaching upto 95% accuracy) using the Random forest classification method in near real-time at 8 Hz frequency.

To date, electrophysiological measures of the efficiency of monophasic tPCS have not been reported. Objective: We aimed to explore the effects of monophasic anodal and cathodal-tPCS (a-tPCS/c-tPCS) at theta (4 Hz) and gamma (75 Hz) frequencies on theta and high gamma electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory power. Methods: In a single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover design, 15 healthy participants were randomly assigned into 5 experimental sessions in which they received a-PCS/c-tPCS at 4 and 75 Hz or sham stimulation over the left primary motor cortex (M1) for 15 min at an intensity of 1.5 mA. Changes in theta and high gamma oscillatory power were recorded at baseline, immediately after, and 30 min after stimulation using EEG at rest with eyes open. Results: a-tPCS at 4 Hz showed a significant increase in theta power compared with sham, whereas c-tPCS at 4 Hz had no significant effect on theta power. a-tPCS at 75 Hz produced no changes in high gamma power compared with sham. Importantly, c-tPCS at 75 Hz led to a significant reduction in high gamma power compared with baseline, as well as compared with c-tPCS at 4 Hz and sham stimulation. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the modulation of oscillatory brain activity by monophasic tPCS, and highlight the need for future studies on a larger scale to confirm these initial findings. Impact statement Transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) is a novel brain stimulation technique. Recently, tPCS has been introduced to directly modulate brain oscillations by applying pulsatile current over the target brain area. Using both anodal and cathodal monophasic tPCS at theta and gamma frequencies, we demonstrate the ability of the stimulation to modulate brain activity. The present findings are the first direct electroencephalography evidence of an interaction between tPCS and ongoing oscillatory activity in the human motor cortex. Our work recommends tPCS as a tool for investigating human brain oscillations and open more studies in this area.

J	Wirsich, J; Giraud, AL; Sadaghiani, S				Wirsich, Jonathan; Giraud, Anne-Lise; Sadaghiani, Sepideh			Concurrent EEG- and fMRI-derived functional connectomes exhibit linked dynamics	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; PULSE ARTIFACT; TIME-SERIES; HUMAN BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; FLUCTUATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Long-range connectivity has become the most studied feature of human functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), yet the spatial and temporal relationship between its whole-brain dynamics and electrophysiological connectivity remains largely unknown. FMRI-derived functional connectivity exhibits spatial reconfigurations or time-varying dynamics at infraslow (<0.1Hz) speeds. Conversely, electrophysiological connectivity is based on cross-region coupling of fast oscillations (similar to 1-100Hz). It is unclear whether such fast oscillation-based coupling varies at infraslow speeds, temporally coinciding with infraslow dynamics across the fMRI-based connectome. If so, does the association of fMRI-derived and electrophysiological dynamics spatially vary over the connectome across the functionally distinct electrophysiological oscillation bands? In two concurrent electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI resting-state datasets, oscillation-based coherence in all canonical bands (delta through gamma) indeed reconfigured at infraslow speeds in tandem with fMRI-derived connectivity changes in corresponding region-pairs. Interestingly, irrespective of EEG frequency-band the cross-modal fie of connectivity dynamics comprised a large proportion of connections distributed across the entire connectome. However, there were frequency-specific differences in the relative strength of the cross-modal association. This association was strongest in visual to somatomotor connections for slower EEG-bands, and in connections involving the Default Mode Network for faster EEG-bands. Methodologically, the findings imply that neural connectivity dynamics can be reliably measured by fMRI despite heavy susceptibility to noise, and by EEG despite shortcomings of source reconstruction. Biologically, the findings provide evidence that contrast with known territories of oscillation power, oscillation coupling in all bands slowly reconfigures in a highly distributed manner across the whole-brain connectome.

However, LiTT of the mesial temporal (MT) structures is still inferior to anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) in terms of postoperative outcome. In this pilot study, we identify intracranial EEG (iEEG) biomarkers that distinguish patients with favorable outcome from those with poor outcome after MT LiTT. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 9 adult refractory epilepsy patients who underwent stereotactic electroencephalography (sEEG) followed by LiTT of MT structures. Their iEEG was retrospectively reviewed in both time and frequency domains. Results: In the time-domain, the presence of sustained 14-30 Hz in MT electrodes coupled with its absence from extra-MT electrodes at ictal onset was highly correlated with favorable outcomes, whereas the appearance of sustained 14-30 Hz or >30 Hz activity in extra-MT sites was negatively correlated to favorable outcomes. In the frequency domain, a declining spectral phase, beginning at the high frequency range (>14 Hz) at ictal onset and following a smooth progressive decline toward lower frequencies as the seizure further evolved, was positively correlated with improved outcomes. On the contrary, low frequency (<14 Hz) patterns and "crescendo-decrescendo" patterns with an early increasing frequency component at ictal onset that reaches the high-beta and low gamma bands before decreasing smoothly, were both correlated with poor surgical outcomes. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates the first evidence that iEEG analysis can provide neurophysiological markers for successful MT LiTT and therefore we strongly advocate for systematic sEEG investigations before offering MT LiTT to TLE and MTLE patients.

Impaired Potentiation of Theta Oscillations During a Visual Cortical Plasticity Paradigm in Individuals With Schizophrenia	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						schizophrenia; cortical plasticity; long-term potentation; neural oscillations; theta band; electroencephalography	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; WORKING-MEMORY; NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL PLASTICITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; DENTATE GYRUS	Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a form of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity mediated by glutamatergic transmission at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Impaired neuroplasticity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, possibly due to underlying NMDAR hypofunction. Analogous to the high frequency electrical stimulation used to induce LTP in vitro and in vivo in animal models, repeated high frequency presentation of a visual stimulus in humans in vivo has been shown to induce enduring LTP-like neuroplastic changes in electroencephalography (EEG)-based visual evoked potentials (VEPs) elicited by the stimulus. Using this LTP-like visual plasticity paradigm, we previously showed that visual high-frequency stimulation (VHFS) induced sustained changes in VEP amplitudes in healthy controls, but not in patients with schizophrenia. Here, we extend this prior work by re-analyzing the EEG data underlying the VEPs, focusing on neuroplastic changes in stimulus-evoked EEG oscillatory activity following VHFS. EEG data were recorded from 19 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls during the visual plasticity paradigm. Event-related EEG oscillations (total power, intertrial phase coherence; ITC) elicited by a standard black and white checkerboard stimulus (similar to 0.83 Hz, several 2-min blocks) were assessed before and after exposure to VHFS with the same stimulus (similar to 8.9 Hz, 2 min). A cluster-based permutation testing approach was applied to time-frequency data to examine LTP-like plasticity effects following VHFS. VHFS enhanced theta band total power and ITC in healthy controls but not in patients with schizophrenia. The magnitude and phase synchrony of theta oscillations in response to a visual stimulus were enhanced for at least 22 min following VHFS, a frequency domain manifestation of LTP-like visual cortical plasticity. These theta oscillation changes are deficient in patients with schizophrenia, consistent with hypothesized NMDA receptor dysfunction.

The analysis of particular (electroencephalographic) EEG frequency bands has revealed new insights relative to the neural dynamics that, when studying the EEG spectrum as a whole, would have remained hidden. This study is aimed at characterizing spectral resting state EEG patterns for assessing possible differences of episodic and chronic migraine during the interictal period. For that purpose, a novel methodology for analyzing specific frequencies of interest was performed. Methods. Eighty-seven patients with migraine (45 with episodic and 42 with chronic migraine) and 39 age- and sex-matched controls performed a resting-state EEG recording. Spectral measures were computed using conventional frequency bands. Additionally, particular frequency bands were determined to distinguish between controls and migraine patients, as well as between migraine subgroups. Results. Frequencies ranging from 11.6 Hz to 12.8 Hz characterized migraine as a whole, with differences evident in the central and left parietal regions (controlling for false discovery rate). An additional band between 24.1 Hz and 29.8 Hz was used to discriminate between migraine subgroups. Interestingly, the power in this band was positively correlated with time from onset in episodic migraine, but no correlation was found for chronic migraine. Conclusions. Specific frequency bands were proposed to identify the spectral characteristics of the electrical brain activity in migraine during the interictal stage. Our findings support the importance of discriminating between migraine subgroups to avoid hiding relevant features in migraine.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected the economy, daily life, and mental/physical health. The latter includes the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in clinical practice and research. We report a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on the use of clinical EEG in practice and research in several countries, and the recommendations of an international panel of experts for the safe application of EEG during and after this pandemic. Methods. Fifteen clinicians from 8 different countries and 25 researchers from 13 different countries reported the impact of COVID-19 on their EEG activities, the procedures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and precautions planned or already implemented during the reopening of EEG activities. Results. Of the 15 clinical centers responding, 11 reported a total stoppage of all EEG activities, while 4 reduced the number of tests per day. In research settings, all 25 laboratories reported a complete stoppage of activity, with 7 laboratories reopening to some extent since initial closure. In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings. The continued use of EEG is important in those with psychiatric diseases, particularly in times of social alarm such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We studied clinical parameters and cortical oscillations related to STN-DBS to identify patients with suboptimal responses. High-density EEG was recorded during a visual oddball three-stimuli paradigm in DBS "off" and "on" conditions in 32 PD patients with STN-DBS. Pre-processed data were reconstructed into the source space and the time-frequency analysis was evaluated. We identified a subgroup of six patients with longer reaction times (RT) during the DBS "on" state than in the DBS "off" state after target stimuli. These subjects had lower motor responsiveness to DBS and decreased memory test results compared to the other subjects. Moreover, the alpha and beta power decrease (event-related desynchronizations, ERD), known as an activation correlate linked to motor and cognitive processing, was also reduced in the DBS "on" condition in these patients. A subgroup of PD patients with a suboptimal response to STN-DBS was identified. Evaluation of RT could potentially serve as a biomarker for responsiveness to STN-DBS.

Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy on Evoked and Induced Gamma Oscillations in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; evoked and induced gamma oscillations; EEG; TMS; oddball task; reaction time; aberrant and repetitive behaviors	GABA CONCENTRATION; ILLUSORY FIGURES; FREQUENCY; EXCITATION; RTMS; ABNORMALITIES; MODULATION; ATTENTION; AMPLITUDE; DYNAMICS	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally diagnosed neurodevelopmental condition of unknown pathology. Research suggests that abnormalities of elecltroencephalogram (EEG) gamma oscillations may provide a biomarker of the condition. In this study, envelope analysis of demodulated waveforms for evoked and induced gamma oscillations in response to Kanizsa figures in an oddball task were analyzed and compared in 19 ASD and 19 age/gender-matched neurotypical children. The ASD group was treated with low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), (1.0 Hz, 90% motor threshold, 18 weekly sessions) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In ASD subjects, as compared to neurotypicals, significant differences in evoked and induced gamma oscillations were evident in higher magnitude of gamma oscillations pre-TMS, especially in response to non-target cues. Recordings post-TMS treatment in ASD revealed a significant reduction of gamma responses to task-irrelevant stimuli. Participants committed fewer errors post-TMS. Behavioral questionnaires showed a decrease in irritability, hyperactivity, and repetitive behavior scores. The use of a novel metric for gamma oscillations. i.e., envelope analysis using wavelet transformation allowed for characterization of the impedance of the originating neuronal circuit. The results suggest that gamma oscillations may provide a biomarker reflective of the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the cortex and a putative outcome measure for interventions in autism.

To fill this gap, we explored significant differences between early AD patients and controls based on frequency domain and spatial properties using functional connectivity in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD datasets. Four global metrics, network resilience, connection-level metrics and node versatility were used to distinguish between controls and patients. The results show that the main frequency bands that are different between MCI patients and controls are the theta and low alpha bands, and the differently affected brain areas are the frontal, left temporal and parietal areas. Compared to MCI patients, in patients with mild AD, the main frequency bands that are different are the low and high alpha bands, and the main differently affected brain region is a larger right temporal area. Four LOFC bands were used as input to train the ResNet-18 model. For the MCI dataset, the average accuracy of 20 runs was 93.42% and the best accuracy was 98.33%, while for the mild AD dataset, the average accuracy was 98.54% and the best accuracy was 100%. To determine the timing of early treatment and discovering the susceptible patients, and to slow the progression of the disease, we assume that the occurrence of MCI and mild AD and their progression to more serious AD and dementia could be inferred by analyzing the topological structure of the brain network generated by EEG. Our findings provide a novel solution for connectome-based biomarker analysis to improve personalized medicine.

The findings mainly concern the occurrence, the neurophysiological and clinical significance of epileptiform EEG discharges in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In addition to well-known interictal and ictal discharges, a growing number of recently recognized epileptiform phenomena have been described. The first reports suggested that they might be relevant for the comprehensive description of epileptic dysfunction and might contribute to diagnosis and treatment as well. However, considerable improvement of present-day "standard" EEG technique is necessary to give an appropriate answer to most challenges. Reliable registration and quantitative assessment of well-known epileptiform transients require extended electrode coverage of the head (high- density EEG) and long-term recordings including waking and sleep states to estimate frequency and dynamics of targeted activities. Computer-based automatic event detection is preferable to spare time and cost of the evaluation. The authors review recent progress concerning epidemiology, neurophysiology and clinical impact of well-known epileptiform transients and candidate epileptiform activities in neurological and psychiatric conditions. However, recent results need confirmation in large patient populations; therefore, research should not be restricted to a few central laboratories.

The tests were performed for different light intensities and different distances between the LEDs. In total, 22 participants were recruited and the mean accuracy was 99.1 +/- 2.27 % with a decision time of 1 second.

Starting from this evidence, a growing interest has been raised regarding the involvement of the sleep EEG in brain maturation and cognitive functioning during typical development (TD). The aim of this review is to provide a general framework about the maturational changes and the functional role of the human sleep EEG during TD from birth to late adolescence (<= 22 years). The reviewed findings show large developmental modifications in several sleep EEG hallmarks (slow wave activity, sleep spindles, theta activity, and cyclic alternating pattern) during TD, and many studies support the notion of an active role of sleep slow wave activity in supporting brain maturation. Moreover, we focus on the possible relation between sleep microstructure, intelligence, and several memory domains (declarative, emotional, procedural), showing that sleep EEG oscillations seem involved in intellectual abilities and learning processes during TD, although results are often conflicting and divergent from findings in adults. Starting from the present literature, we propose that larger methodological uniformity, greater attention to the topographical and maturational aspects of the sleep EEG oscillations and their mutual interactions, and a higher number of longitudinal studies will be essential to clarify the role of the sleep EEG in cognitive functioning during TD.

Because the cognitive mechanisms such as human sensation and perception from cognitive science are fast responses ranging from a few milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds, the method of pattern recognition and analysis of these brain signals must be done and it is necessary to derive some information. In this paper, we investigated time-series data of cognitive function of the brain obtained using a non-invasive technique on multiple channels via signal classification and analysis, using a cognitive science approach and experiments. The test dataset was collected in 19 channels using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) techniques with multiple rests and working conditions on eight subjects. From this perspective, the main contributions of this paper are that it completes the collection and analysis of cognitive-scientific time-series data and has scientific implications that extend to other integrated domains, energy, manufacturing, bioinformatics, and finance area. The use of Shapelet and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) classification techniques on brain signal time-series shows the potential to identify neuro-biological phenomena that can proactively signal a disease or disorder. EEG bandwidth and frequency-specific data have also been categorized as machine learning algorithms and have shown accurate patterns and trends in measuring cognitive functions of scientific, biological and academic importance.

Although magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) signals at sensor level are robust and reliable, they suffer from different degrees of distortion due to changes in brain tissue conductivities, known as field spread and volume conduction effects. To estimate original neural generators from M/EEG activity acquired at sensor level, diverse source localisation algorithms have been proposed; however, they are not exempt from limitations and usually involve time-consuming procedures. Connectivity and network-based M/EEG analyses have been found to be affected by field spread and volume conduction effects; nevertheless, the influence of the aforementioned effects on widely used local activation parameters has not been assessed yet. The goal of this study is to evaluate the consistency of various local activation parameters when they are computed at sensor- and source-level.Approach. Six spectral (relative power, median frequency, and individual alpha frequency) and non-linear parameters (Lempel-Ziv complexity, sample entropy, and central tendency measure) are computed from M/EEG signals at sensor- and source-level using four source inversion methods: weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE), standardised low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV), and dynamical statistical parametric mapping (dSPM).Main results. Our results show that the spectral and non-linear parameters yield similar results at sensor- and source-level, showing high correlation values between them for all the source inversion methods evaluated and both modalities of signal, EEG and MEG. Furthermore, the correlation values remain high when performing coarse-grained spatial analyses.Significance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analysing how field spread and volume conduction effects impact on local activation parameters computed from resting-state neural activity. Our findings evidence that local activation parameters are robust against field spread and volume conduction effects and provide equivalent information at sensor- and source-level even when performing regional analyses.

Low-Frequency Oscillations Are a Biomarker of Injury and Recovery After Stroke	STROKE			English	Article						brain; electroencephalography; functional neuroimaging; inpatients; motor cortex	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-FUNCTION; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG; MECHANISMS; PLASTICITY; COHERENCE; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS	Background and Purpose- Low-frequency oscillations reflect brain injury but also contribute to normal behaviors. We examined hypotheses relating electroencephalography measures, including low-frequency oscillations, to injury and motor recovery poststroke. Methods- Patients with stroke completed structural neuroimaging, a resting-state electroencephalography recording and clinical testing. A subset admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility also underwent serial electroencephalography recordings. The relationship that electroencephalography measures (power and coherence with leads overlying ipsilesional primary motor cortex [iM1]) had with injury and motor status was assessed, focusing on delta (1-3 Hz) and high-beta (20-30 Hz) bands. Results- Across all patients (n=62), larger infarct volume was related to higher delta band power in bilateral hemispheres and to higher delta band coherence between iM1 and bilateral regions. In chronic stroke, higher delta power bilaterally correlated with better motor status. In subacute stroke, higher delta coherence between iM1 and bilateral areas correlated with poorer motor status. These coherence findings were confirmed in serial recordings from 18 patients in an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Here, interhemispheric coherence between leads overlying iM1 and contralesional M1 was elevated at inpatient rehabilitation facility admission compared with healthy controls (n=22), declining to control levels over time. Decreases in interhemispheric coherence between iM1 and contralesional M1 correlated with better motor recovery. Conclusions- Delta band coherence with iM1 related to greater injury and poorer motor status subacutely, while delta band power related to greater injury and better motor status chronically. Low-frequency oscillations reflect both injury and recovery after stroke and may be useful biomarkers in stroke recovery and rehabilitation.

Recent studies suggest that the use of noninvasive closed-loop neuromodulation combining electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may be a promising avenue for the treatment of neurological disorders. However, the attenuation of tACS artifacts in EEG data is particularly challenging, and computationally efficient methods are needed to enable closed-loop neuromodulation experiments. Here we introduce an original method to address this methodological issue.Approach. Our alternating current regression (AC-REG) method is an adaptive (time-varying) spatial filtering method. It relies on a data buffer of preset size, on which principal component analysis (PCA) is applied. The resulting components are used to build a spatial filter capable of regressing periodic signals in phase with the stimulation. PCA is performed each time that a new sample enters the buffer, such that the spatial filter can be continuously updated and applied to the EEG data.Main results.The AC-REG accuracy in terms of tACS artifact attenuation was assessed using simulated and real EEG data. Alternative offline processing techniques, such as the superimposition of moving averages (SMA) and the Helfrich method (HeM), were used as benchmark. Using simulations, we found that AC-REG can yield a more reliable reconstruction of the stimulation signal for any frequency between 1 and 80 Hz. Analysis of real EEG data of 18 healthy volunteers showed that AC-REG was able to better recover hidden neural activity as compared to SMA and HeM. Also, significantly higher correlations between power spectrum densities in tACS on and off conditions, respectively, were obtained using AC-REG (r = 0.90) than using SMA (r = 0.80) and HeM (r = 0.86).Significance. Thanks to its low computational complexity, the AC-REG method can be employed in noninvasive closed-loop neuromodulation experiments, with potential applications both in healthy individuals and in neurological patients.

Properties of beta oscillations in Dup15q syndrome	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Dup15q syndrome; Autism; Biomarkers; EEG; GABA; UBE3A; Neurodevelopmental disorders	ANGELMAN-SYNDROME; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ADAPTIVE-BEHAVIOR; CHILDREN; AUTISM; GAMMA; DUPLICATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; MECHANISMS; SEIZURES	Background Duplications of 15q11.2-q13.1 (Dup15q syndrome) are highly penetrant for autism, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and epilepsy. The 15q region harbors genes critical for brain development, particularlyUBE3Aand a cluster of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) genes. We recently described an electrophysiological biomarker of the syndrome, characterized by excessive beta oscillations (12-30 Hz), resembling electroencephalogram (EEG) changes induced by allosteric modulation of GABA(A)Rs. In this follow-up study, we tested a larger cohort of children with Dup15q syndrome to comprehensively examine properties of this EEG biomarker that would inform its use in future clinical trials, specifically, its (1) relation to basic clinical features, such as age, duplication type, and epilepsy; (2) relation to behavioral characteristics, such as cognition and adaptive function; (3) stability over time; and (4) reproducibility of the signal in clinical EEG recordings. Methods We computed EEG power and beta peak frequency (BPF) in a cohort of children with Dup15q syndrome (N= 41, age range 9-189 months). To relate EEG parameters to clinical (study 1) and behavioral features (study 2), we examined age, duplication type, epilepsy, cognition, and daily living skills (DLS) as predictors of beta power and BPF. To evaluate stability over time (study 3), we derived the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) from beta power and BPF computed from children with multiple EEG recordings (N= 10, age range 18-161 months). To evaluate reproducibility in a clinical setting (study 4), we derived ICCs from beta power computed from children (N= 8, age range 19-96 months), who had undergone both research EEG and clinical EEG. Results The most promising relationships between EEG and clinical traits were found using BPF. BPF was predicted both by epilepsy status (R-2= 0.11,p= 0.038) and the DLS component of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (R-2= 0.17,p= 0.01). Beta power and peak frequency showed high stability across repeated visits (beta power ICC = 0.93, BPF ICC = 0.92). A reproducibility analysis revealed that beta power estimates are comparable between research and clinical EEG (ICC = 0.94). Conclusions In this era of precision health, with pharmacological and neuromodulatory therapies being developed and tested for specific genetic etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders, quantification and examination of mechanistic biomarkers can greatly improve clinical trials. To this end, the robust beta oscillations evident in Dup15q syndrome are clinically reproducible and stable over time. With future preclinical and computational studies that will help disentangle the underlying mechanism, it is possible that this biomarker could serve as a robust measure of drug target engagement or a proximal outcome measure in future disease modifying intervention trials.

Activation Complexity: A Cognitive Impairment Tool for Characterizing Neuro-isolation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EEG; DYNAMICS	Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method for recording electrical activity, indicative of cortical brain activity from the scalp. EEG has been used to diagnose neurological diseases and to characterize impaired cognitive states. When the electrical activity of neurons are temporally synchronized, the likelihood to reach their threshold potential for the signal to propagate to the next neuron, increases. This phenomenon is typically analyzed as the spectral intensity increasing from the summation of these neurons firing. Non-linear analysis methods (e.g., entropy) have been explored to characterize neuronal firings, but only analyze temporal information and not the frequency spectrum. By examining temporal and spectral entropic relationships simultaneously, we can better characterize how neurons are isolated, (the signal's inability to propagate to adjacent neurons), an indicator of impairment. A novel time-frequency entropic analysis method, referred to as Activation Complexity (AC), was designed to quantify these dynamics from key EEG frequency bands. The data was collected during a cognitive impairment study at NASA Langley Research Center, involving hypoxia induction in 49 human test subjects. AC demonstrated significant changes in EEG firing patterns characterize within explanatory (p < 0.05) and predictive models (10% increase in accuracy). The proposed work sets the methodological foundation for quantifying neuronal isolation and introduces new potential technique to understand human cognitive impairment for a range of neurological diseases and insults.

It is so difficult to remove undesirable noises using static filtering approaches as the performance of such techniques is strongly relying on specific EEG signal sub-bands, whose locations differ from one subject to another. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic filtering approach, which makes use of Finite and Infinite Impulse Response (FIR and IIR) filters along with a Recurrent Neural Networks using a Gated-Recurrent Unit (RNN-GRU), to identify and preprocess the most informative sub-bands pertaining to a particular neurological disorder. This combination of RNN with GRU requires more hidden layers than for conventional NN structures, and therefore offers much higher capacity to learn fitting and extract features from highly complex EEG data recording to afford better harmonization of the diagnosis process. Followed by an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm, all extracted features become independent to facilitate classification of clinical disorders using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed diagnosis system achieves an average of 100% classification accuracy for epilepsy according to an offline diagnosis process using Bonn and MIT datasets, and when the same system is applied to autism provides an average accuracy of 99.5% using KAU dataset. The presented dynamic deep-learning approach applied to EEG classification pipeline, which includes artifact removal, feature extraction and classification, leads to significant improvements in the accuracy of the diagnosis classification regarding the targeted neurological pathologies.

We propose to represent time-localized frequency domain characterizations of EEG data as region-referenced functional data. This representation is coupled with a hierarchical regression modeling approach to multivariate functional observations. Within this familiar setting we discuss how several prior models relate to structural assumptions about multivariate covariance operators. An overarching modeling framework, based on infinite factorial decompositions, is finally proposed to balance flexibility and efficiency in estimation. The motivating application stems from a study of implicit auditory learning, in which typically developing (TD) children, and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were exposed to a continuous speech stream. Using the proposed model, we examine differential band power dynamics as brain function is interrogated throughout the duration of a computer-controlled experiment.

J	Xu, T; Kurth, CD; Yuan, IA; Vutskits, L; Zhu, T				Xu, Ting; Kurth, Charles Dean; Yuan, Ian; Vutskits, Laszlo; Zhu, Tao			An approach to using pharmacokinetics and electroencephalography for propofol anesthesia for surgery in infants	PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA			English	Article						EEG; electroencephalography; infant; neonate; propofol; remifentanil; total intravenous anesthesia; total intravenous anesthesia	TARGET-CONTROLLED INFUSION; BISPECTRAL INDEX; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; CHILDREN; REMIFENTANIL; EEG; CONSCIOUSNESS; EMERGENCE; RECOVERY; TIVA	Safe and effective techniques for propofol total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) in infants are not well imbedded into clinical practice, resulting in practitioner unfamiliarity and potential for over- and under-dosing. In this education article, we describe our approach to TIVA dosing in infants and toddlers (birth to 36 months) which combines the use of pharmacokinetic models with EEG multi-parameter analysis. Pharmacokinetic models describe propofol and remifentanil effect site concentrations (Ce) over time in different age groups for a given dosing regimen. These models display substantial biological variability between individuals within age groups, impeding their application to clinical practice. Nevertheless, they reveal that younger infants require a higher propofol loading dose, a lower propofol maintenance dose, and a higher remifentanil dose compared with older infants. Proprietary EEG indices (eg, Bispectral Index) can serve as a biomarker of propofol Ce in adults and children to guide dosing to the individual patient; however, they are not recommended for infants as their validity remains uncertain this population. In our experience, EEG waveforms and processed parameters can reflect propofol Ce in infants, reflected by spectral edge frequency (SEF), density spectral array (DSA), and waveform patterns. In our practice, we use a "lookup table" of age-based dosing regimens or target-controlled infusion (TCI) based on the pharmacokinetic models to deliver a target propofol Ce and co-administer remifentanil and/or regional technique for analgesia. We analyze Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms, SEF, and DSA to adjust the propofol dose or TCI target concentration to the individual infant. EEG analysis mitigates against biological variability inherent in the pharmacokinetic models and has improved our experience with TIVA for infants.

Event-related oscillations (EROs) as oscillatory responses in the EEG to specific events further provide the possibility to track the cognitive decline in a task-specific manner. Current study in search for potential ERO biomarkers to distinguish different stages of cognitive decline along the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continuum re-analyzed a combined set of data collected and analyzed in previous studies by Basar and coworkers. Target responses of a visual oddball experiment recorded from 33 AD patients, 46 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and 48 age, gender, and education matched normal elderly controls were analyzed for both evoked (phase-locked) and total (phase-locked + non-phase-locked) ERO powers in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands by applying continuous wavelet transform (WT) on averaged and single trial data, respectively. The cluster-based non-parametric permutation test implemented in the FieldTrip toolbox revealed significant differences among the three groups. While the total delta and theta responses already significantly declined in the MCI stage with further spatial expansion of the decline in AD, the evoked delta response reached a statistically significant reduction level in the AD stage. We obtained no significant difference among groups for alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. These results suggest that total delta and theta EROs to oddball targets may be useful for early detection of the disease in MCI stage, while the evoked delta response allows detecting the conversion to AD.

Nevertheless, the role of the EEG electrical reference on such BHI estimates has not been investigated yet. Here we present a pilot study assessing BHI in 4 minutes resting-state in 10 healthy subjects through methods including heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP) and oscillations, Maximal Information Coefficient, and our recently proposed model based on Synthetic Data Generation (SDG). EEG signals were re-referenced to the Cz channel, common average, mastoids, and Laplacian. Results for EEG power in the a band indicate that the most significant differences between BHI methods are with the Laplacian reference while a higher agreement exists between HEP and SDG approaches.

However, the mechanisms underlying TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) remain largely unknown. We assessed TEP sensitivity to changes in excitatory neurotransmission mediated by n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors following stimulation of non-motor regions. In fourteen male volunteers, resting EEG and TEPs from prefrontal (PFC) and parietal (PAR) cortex were measured before and after administration of either dextromethorphan (NMDA receptor antagonist) or placebo across two sessions in a double-blinded pseudo-randomised crossover design. At baseline, there were amplitude differences between PFC and PAR TEPs across a wide time range (15-250 ms), however the signals were correlated after similar to 80 ms, suggesting early peaks reflect site-specific activity, whereas late peaks reflect activity patterns less dependent on the stimulated sites. Early TEP peaks were not reliably altered following dextromethorphan compared to placebo, although findings were less clear for later peaks, and low frequency resting oscillations were reduced in power. Our findings suggest that early TEP peaks (<80 ms) from PFC and PAR reflect stimulation site specific activity that is largely insensitive to changes in NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission.

In particular, there is scarce knowledge about modulations in induced EEG (nonphase activity) for diverse frequency bands related to attentional deficits in this pathology. The present study analyzes phase and nonphase alpha and gamma modulations in 26 remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis patients during their participation in the attention network test compared with twenty-six healthy controls (HCs) matched in sociodemographic variables. Behavioral results showed that the MS group exhibited general slowing, suggesting impairment in alerting and orienting networks, as has been previously described in other studies. Time-frequency analysis of EEG revealed that the gamma band was related to the spatial translation of the attentional focus, and the alpha band seemed to be related to the expectancy mechanisms and cognitive processing of the target. Moreover, phase and nonphase modulations differed in their psychophysiological roles and were affected differently in the MS and HC groups. In summary, nonphase modulations can unveil hidden cognitive mechanisms for phase analysis and complete our knowledge of the neural basis of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis pathology.

The present study examined the functional network connectivity in Chinese dyslexic children with resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. EEG data were recorded from 27 dyslexic children and 40 age-matched controls, and a minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis was performed to examine the network connectivity in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. The results show that, compared to age-matched controls, Chinese dyslexic children had global network deficiencies in the beta band, and the network topology was more path-like. Moderate correlations are observed between MST degree metric and rapid automatized naming and morphological awareness tests. These observations, together with the findings in alphabetic languages, show that brain network deficiency is a common neural underpinning of dyslexia across writing systems.

WU-NEAT: A clinically validated, open-source MATLAB toolbox for limited-channel neonatal EEG analysis	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Spectral edge frequency; Open source; Neonates; Quantitative methods; MATLAB	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED EEG; SPECTRAL EDGE FREQUENCY; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; PRETERM INFANTS; 1ST WEEK; LIFE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PREDICTS; INJURY	Background: Limited-channel EEG research in neonates is hindered by lack of open, accessible analytic tools. To overcome this limitation, we have created the Washington University-Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (WU-NEAT), containing two of the most commonly used tools, provided in an open-source, clinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first algorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by filtering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with subsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge frequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-defined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was validated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings of fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a reference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm. Using standard methodology, reviewers assigned a background pattern classification. Inter/intra-rater reliability was assessed. For the SEF, calculations were made using the same fourteen recordings, first with the reference and then with the WU-NEAT algorithm. Results were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: For the aEEG algorithm, intra- and inter-rater reliability was 100% and 98%, respectively. For the SEF, the meanISD Pearson correlation coefficient between algorithms was 0.96+0.04. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a clinically-validated toolbox for generating the aEEG as well as calculating the SEF from EEG data.

This process is time-consuming, burdensome, subject to error and bias. Hence the aim of this study is to develop an automatic SZ identification scheme using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that can eradicate the aforementioned problems and support clinicians and researchers. This study introduces a methodology design involving empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique for diagnosis of SZ from EEG signals to perfectly handle the behavior of non-stationary and nonlinear EEG signals. In this study, each EEG signal is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by the EMD algorithm and then twenty-two statistical characteristics/features are calculated from these IMFs. Among them, five features are selected as significant feature applying Kruskal Wallis test. The performance of the obtained feature set is tested through several renowned classifierson a SZ EEG dataset. Among the considered classifiers, theensemble bagged tree performed as the best classifier producing 93.21% correct classification rate for SZ, with an overall accuracy of 89.59% for IMF 2. These results indicate that EEG signals discriminate SZ patients from healthy control (HC) subjects efficiently and have the potential to become a tool for the psychiatrist to support the positive diagnosis of SZ.

J	Espinosa, R; Talero, J; Weinstein, A				Espinosa, Ricardo; Talero, Jesica; Weinstein, Alejandro			Effects of Tau and Sampling Frequency on the Regularity Analysis of ECG and EEG Signals Using ApEn and SampEn Entropy Estimators	ENTROPY			English	Article						electrophysiological signals; nonlinear signals; entropy; sampling frequencies; time delay	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; CHALLENGE; PHYSIONET; COMPUTERS; ONSET	Electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide clinical information relevant to determine a patient's health status. The nonlinear analysis of ECG and EEG signals allows for discovering characteristics that could not be found with traditional methods based on amplitude and frequency. Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sampling entropy (SampEn) are nonlinear data analysis algorithms that measure the data's regularity, and these are used to classify different electrophysiological signals as normal or pathological. Entropy calculation requires setting the parameters r (tolerance threshold), m (immersion dimension), and tau (time delay), with the last one being related to how the time series is downsampled. In this study, we showed the dependence of ApEn and SampEn on different values of tau, for ECG and EEG signals with different sampling frequencies (F-s), extracted from a digital repository. We considered four values of F-s (128, 256, 384, and 512 Hz for the ECG signals, and 160, 320, 480, and 640 Hz for the EEG signals) and five values of tau (from 1 to 5). We performed parametric and nonparametric statistical tests to confirm that the groups of normal and pathological ECG and EEG signals were significantly different (p < 0.05) for each F and tau value. The separation between the entropy values of regular and irregular signals was variable, demonstrating the dependence of ApEn and SampEn with F-s and tau. For ECG signals, the separation between the conditions was more robust when using SampEn, the lowest value of F-s, and tau larger than 1. For EEG signals, the separation between the conditions was more robust when using SampEn with large values of F-s and tau larger than 1. Therefore, adjusting tau may be convenient for signals that were acquired with different F-s to ensure a reliable clinical classification. Furthermore, it is useful to set tau to values larger than 1 to reduce the computational cost.

Study Design In this multicenter observational study, we analyzed blood pressure of infants meeting these criteria: (1) neonatal encephalopathy determined by modified Sarnat exam, (2) continuous mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) data between 18 and 27 hours after birth, and (3) continuous EEG performed for at least 48 hours. Adverse outcome was defined as moderate-severe grade EEG at 48 hours. Standardized signal preprocessing was used; the power spectral density was computed without interpolation. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to identify which MABP time and frequency domain metrics provided improved predictive power for adverse outcomes compared with standard clinical predictors (5-minute Apgar score and cord pH) using receiver operator characteristic analysis. Results Ninety-one infants met inclusion criteria. The mean gestational age was 38.4 +/- 1.8 weeks, the mean birth weight was 3,260 +/- 591 g, 52/91 (57%) of infants were males, the mean cord pH was 6.95 +/- 0.21, and 10/91 (11%) of infants died. At 48 hours, 58% of infants had normal or mildly abnormal EEG background and 42% had moderate or severe EEG backgrounds. Clinical predictor variables (10-minute Apgar score, Sarnat stage, and cord pH) were modestly predictive of 48 hours EEG outcome with area under curve (AUC) of 0.66 to 0.68. A composite model of clinical and optimal time- and frequency-domain blood pressure variability had a substantially improved AUC of 0.86. Conclusion Time- and frequency-domain blood pressure variability biomarkers offer a substantial improvement in prediction of later adverse EEG outcomes over perinatal clinical variables in a two-center cohort of infants with HIE.

By modeling the EEG signals as a time-varying (TV) multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) process, a new AF-KF with variable number of measurements (AF-KF-VNM) is proposed for estimating the spectra of the EEG signals and identifying their functional connectivity. The proposed AF-KF-VNM algorithm uses a new adaptive fading method to adaptively update the model parameters of the KF for improved state estimation and utilizes multiple measurements for better adaptation to the nonstationary signal observations. Experimental results on a simulated data for modeling the TV directed interactions in multivariate neural data show that the proposed AF-KF-VNM method yields better tracking performance than other approaches tested. The proposed algorithm is then integrated into a novel methodology for combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) activation maps and EEG spectrum analyses for quantifying the differences in spectrum contents and information flows between the target and standard conditions in a visual oddball paradigm. The results and findings show that the proposed methodology agrees well with the literature and is capable of revealing significant frequency components and information flow involved as well as their time variations.

Accurate classification of seizure types based on EEG signals can provide vital information for diagnosis and treatment. Since visual inspection and interpretation of seizure types are time consuming and prone to errors, a novel classification method combining wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and local detrended fluctuation analysis (L-DFA) is proposed for the computer-aided diagnostic system. The proposed method is able to classify a wide variety of seizures automatically and accurately. As the first step towards this goal, raw EEG signals are decomposed by WPD according to intrinsic frequency bands of human brain. Then L-DFA is applied to characterise the dynamical fractal structure of sub-band signals. Finally, EEG signals are classified by support vector machine based on the combined fractal spectrum features. The experimental results on Temple University Hospital database show that the proposed method achieves a total classification accuracy of 97.80%, outperforming existing methods based on the same database.

A deep CNN approach to decode motor preparation of upper limbs from time-frequency maps of EEG signals at source level	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Electroencephalography; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; Time-frequency analysis; Beamforming	NEURAL-NETWORKS; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGERY; INTERFACES	A system that can detect the intention to move and decode the planned movement could help all those subjects that can plan motion but are unable to implement it. In this paper, motor planning activity is investigated by using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals with the aim to decode motor preparation phases. A publicly available database of 61-channels EEG signals recorded from 15 healthy subjects during the execution of different movements (elbow flexion/extension, forearm pronation/supination, hand open/close) of the right upper limb was employed to generate a dataset of EEG epochs preceding resting and movement's onset. A novel system is introduced for the classification of premovement vs resting and of premovement vs premovement epochs. For every epoch, the proposed system generates a time-frequency (TF) map of every source signal in the motor cortex, through beamforming and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), then all the maps are embedded in a volume and used as input to a deep CNN. The proposed system succeeded in discriminating premovement from resting with an average accuracy of 90.3% (min 74.6%, max 100%), outperforming comparable methods in the literature, and in discriminating premovement vs premovement with an average accuracy of 62.47%. The achieved results encourage to investigate motor planning at source level in the time-frequency domain through deep learning approaches. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EEG spectral power abnormalities and their relationship with cognitive dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Cognitive aging; Type-2 diabetes mellitus; Alzheimer's disease; EEG; Oscillations; Neuropsychology	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; RESTING AWAKE EEG; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; PARKINSON DISEASE; BAND OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL RHYTHMS; COMPOSITE SCORE	Rhythmic neural activity has been proposed to play a fundamental role in cognition. Both healthy and pathological aging are characterized by frequency-specific changes in oscillatory activity. However, the cognitive relevance of these changes across the spectrum from normal to pathological aging remains unknown. We examined electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of cognitive function in healthy aging and 2 of the most prominent and debilitating age-related disorders: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Relative to healthy controls (HC), patients with AD were impaired on nearly every cognitive measure, whereas patients with T2DM performed worse mainly on learning and memory tests. A continuum of alterations in resting-state EEG was associated with pathological aging, generally characterized by reduced alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) power (AD < T2DM < HC) and increased delta (delta) and theta (theta) power (AD > T2DM > HC), with some variations across different brain regions. There were also reductions in the frequency and power density of the posterior dominant rhythm in AD. The ratio of (alpha + beta)/(delta + theta) was specifically associated with cognitive function in a domain- and diagnosis-specific manner. The results thus captured both similarities and differences in the pathophysiology of cerebral oscillations in T2DM and AD. Overall, pathological brain aging is marked by a shift in oscillatory power from higher to lower frequencies, which can be captured by a single cognitively relevant measure of the ratio of (alpha + beta) over (delta + theta) power.

Flanker tasks, which require responding to stimuli surrounded by distracters that trigger incompatible action tendencies, are frequently used to measure this conflict. Even though the interference generated in these situations has been broadly studied, multivariate analysis techniques can shed new light into the underlying neural mechanisms. The current study is an initial approximation to adapt an interference Flanker paradigm embedded in a Demand-Selection Task (DST) to a format that allows measuring concurrent high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode conflict-related electrophysiological markers associated with congruent or incongruent target events in a time-frequency resolved way. Our results replicate findings obtained with other analysis approaches and offer new information regarding the dynamics of the underlying mechanisms, which show signs of reinstantiation. Our findings, some of which could not have been obtained with classic analytical strategies, open novel avenues of research.	[Lopez-Garcia, David; Sobrado, Alberto; Penalver, Jose M.

However, the acquisition and basic analysis of rodent EEG have only recently been standardized. Since a number of software platforms and increased computational power have become widely available, advanced rodent EEG analysis is now more accessible to investigators working with rodent models of epilepsy. In this review, the approach to the analysis of rodent EEG will be examined, including the evaluation of both epileptiform and background activity. Major caveats when employing these analyses, cellular and circuit-level correlates of EEG changes, and important differences between rodent and human EEG are also reviewed. The currently available techniques show great promise in gaining a deeper understanding of the complexities hidden within the EEG in rodent models of epilepsy.

However, the magnetoencephalography of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy can be difficult without sedation and/or general anesthesia. Our objective is to describe our experience with intravenous dexmedetomidine as sedation for magnetoencephalography and its effect, if any, on the ability to recognize epileptic spikes. Methods In this retrospective study, we reviewed the records of 89 children who presented for Magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (EEG) scans between August of 2008 and May of 2015. Data analyzed included demographics and the frequency of epileptic spikes. Sedated magnetoencephalography recordings were compared to nonsedated video-electroencephalography (vEEG) recordings in the same patients to determine the impact of dexmedetomidine. Results Spike frequency between magnetoencephalography with sedation and video-electroencephalography without sedation was compared in 85 patients. Magnetoencephalography and video-electroencephalography were considered clinically concordant in 80 patients (94.1%) and discordant in 5 patients (5.9%), all with less spikes during Magnetoencephalography. The median (range) bolus dose of dexmedetomidine was 2 (1-2) mcg/kg. The median (range) infusion rate of dexmedetomidine was 2 (0.5-4) mcg/kg/h. All patients experienced reductions in heart rate after administration of dexmedetomidine; these reductions were statistically, but not clinically, significant. Conclusions Our results suggest that dexmedetomidine-based protocol provides reliable sedation in children undergoing MEG scanning because of the high success rate, limited interictal artifacts, and minimal impacts on spike frequency.

However, whether and how cognitive or sensory processes modulate various components of the alpha rhythm is poorly understood. Sensory input and resting states were manipulated in human subjects while electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded in three conditions: eyes-open fixating on a visual stimulus, eyes-open without visual input (darkness), and eyes-closed without visual input (darkness). We show that alpha power and peak frequency increase when visual input is reduced compared to the eyes open, fixating condition. These results suggest that increases in alpha power reflect a shift from an exteroceptive to interoceptive state and that increases in peak frequency following restricted visual input (darkness) may reflect increased sampling of the external environment in order to detect stimuli. They further demonstrate how sensory information modulates alpha and the importance of selecting an appropriate resting condition in studies of alpha.

Methods: PAC patterns observed in intracerebral electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings were retrospectively studied during seizures of seven patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. The time locked index (TLI) measure was introduced to quantify the degree of harmonicity between frequency bands associated to the emergence of PAC during epileptic seizures. Results: (1) Harmonic and non harmonic PAC patterns coexist during the seizure dynamics in iEEG recordings with macroelectrodes. (2) Harmonic PAC patterns are an emergent property of the periodic non sinusoidal waveform constituting the epileptiform activity. (3) The TLI metric allows to distinguish the non harmonic PAC pattern, which has been previously associated with the ictal core through the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts mechanism of seizure propagation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the spectral harmonicity of the ictal activity plays a relevant role in the visual analysis of the iEEG recordings performed by the epileptologists to define the SOZ, and that it should be considered for the proper interpretation of ictal mechanisms. Significance: The proposed harmonicity analysis can be used to improve the delineation of the SOZ by reliably identifying non harmonic PAC patterns emerging from fully recruited cortical and subcortical areas.

It is generally assumed that CFC can play a crucial role in perception, memory, and attention. In this study, two new indices for evaluating frequency-amplitude coupling (FAC) through generalized linear model (GLM) and linear regression method were introduced and investigated along with other CFC indices. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded during covert visual attention tasks to find out the CFC index capability so as to distinguish different states in the mentioned tasks. To this end, machine learning algorithms were used and four various types of CFC, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), phase-phase coupling (PPC), amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), and frequency-amplitude coupling (FAC) in recorded signals were considered as inputs for classifiers. The results demonstrated that the proposed method used for evaluating FAC through linear regression can provide more information about the different states in two covert attention tasks using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) by classification performance of 94.21% and 90.54% in color and direction tasks, respectively. Also, FAC that used a GLM model and PAC had a higher performance compared with PPC and AAC in color task (90.74 and 92.24% against 83.21 and 86.22). We can conclude that CFC can encompass useful information about semantic category of stimuli in covert attention tasks and can be used as an acceptable alternative for the time-frequency features of brain signals.

Producing movements in VR holds enormous promise for rehabilitation and offers a platform from which to understand the neural control of movement. However, no study has examined the impact of a 3D fully immersive head-mounted display (HMD) VR system on the integrity of neural data. We assessed the quality of 64-channel EEG data with and without HMD VR during rest and during a full-body reaching task. We compared resting EEG while subjects completed three conditions: No HMD (EEG-only), HMD powered off (VR-off), and HMD powered on (VR-on). Within the same session, EEG were collected while subjects completed full-body reaching movements in two conditions (EEG-only, VR-on). During rest, no significant differences in data quality and power spectrum were observed between EEG-only, VR-off, and VR-on conditions. During reaching movements, the proportion of components attributed to the brain was greater in the EEG-only condition compared to the VR-on condition. Despite this difference, neural oscillations in source space were not significantly different between conditions, with both conditions associated with decreases in alpha and beta power in sensorimotor cortex during movements. Our findings demonstrate that the integrity of EEG data can be maintained while individuals execute full-body reaching movements within an immersive 3D VR environment. Clinical impact: Integrating VR and EEG is a viable approach to understanding the cortical processes of movement. Simultaneously recording movement and brain activity in combination with VR provides the foundation for neurobiologically informed rehabilitation therapies.	[Wang, Wei-En; Ho, Rachel L.

The study included 23 unmedicated ADHD patients and 23 healthy controls. The EEG signal was analyzed in time domain by nonlinear brain dynamics and morphological features, and in time-frequency domain with wavelet coefficients. Selected features were applied to various machine learning techniques including; Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, k-nearest neighbor, Adaptive Boosting, Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify ADHD patients and healthy controls. Longer P300 latencies and smaller P300 amplitudes were observed in ADHD patients relative to controls. In fractal dimension calculation relative to the control group, the ADHD group demonstrated reduced complexity. In addition, certain wavelet coefficients provided significantly different values in both groups. Combining these extracted features, our results indicated that Multilayer Perceptron method provided the best classification with an accuracy rate of 91.3% and a high level of reliability of concurrence (Kappa = 0.82). The results showed that combining time and frequency domain features can be a useful and discriminative for diagnostic purposes in ADHD. The study presents a supporting diagnostic tool that uses EEG signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The findings would be helpful in the objective diagnosis of ADHD.

MI EEG decoding has a core problem which is extracting as many multiple types of features as possible from the multi-channel time series of EEG to understand brain activity accurately. Recently, deep learning technology has been widely used in EEG decoding. However, the variability of the simple network framework is insufficient to satisfy the complex task of EEG decoding. A multi-scale fusion convolutional neural network based on the attention mechanism (MS-AMF) is proposed in this paper. The network extracts spatio temporal multi-scale features from multi-brain regions representation signals and is supplemented by a dense fusion strategy to retain the maximum information flow. The attention mechanism we added to the network has improved the sensitivity of the network. The experimental results show that the network has a better classification effect compared with the baseline method in the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. We conducted visualization analysis in multiple parts of the network, and the results show that the attention mechanism is also convenient for analyzing the underlying information flow of EEG decoding, which verifies the effectiveness of the MS-AMF method.

This phenomenon, termed "repetition suppression", is the basis for many functional imaging studies that have used Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity differences between novel and repeated items as an index of neural selectivity in hippocampal subfields. However, it is not clear how hippocampal neural activity changes across repeated exposure to a stimulus. Here, we used direct intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings of hippocampal activity to examine whether neural activity in the human hippocampus is modulated across successive repetitions of an item. Time-frequency analyses revealed that high-frequency activity, which is thought to include gamma oscillations and possible correlates of multi-unit activity, declined monotonically across successive presentations of an item. In contrast, low-frequency oscillations in the alpha and beta bands monotonically increased across successive presentations of an object. These results provide support for the assumption that, at least under some circumstances, repetition suppression (as measured by declines in high frequency activity) can be observed in the hippocampus, and these effects are accompanied by increases in low frequency oscillations as well.

Characteristic patterns of EEG oscillations in sheep (Ovis aries) induced by ketamine may explain the psychotropic effects seen in humans	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANIMAL-MODELS; ANESTHESIA; IMPACT; NMDA	Ketamine is a valuable anaesthetic and analgesic that in recent years has gained notoriety as a recreational drug. Recently, ketamine has also been proposed as a novel treatment for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Beyond its anaesthetic actions, however, the effects of ketamine on brain activity have rarely been probed. Here we examined the cortical electroencephalography (EEG) response to ketamine of 12 sheep. Following ketamine administration, EEG changes were immediate and widespread, affecting the full extent of the EEG frequency spectrum measured (0-125Hz). After recovery from sedation during which low frequency activity dominated, the EEG was characterised by short periods (2-3s) of alternating low (<14Hz) and high (>35Hz) frequency oscillation. This alternating EEG rhythm phase is likely to underlie the dissociative actions of ketamine, since it is during this phase that ketamine users report hallucinations. At the highest intravenous dose used (24mg/kg), in 5/6 sheep we observed a novel effect of ketamine, namely the complete cessation of cortical EEG activity. This persisted for up to several minutes, after which cortical activity resumed. This phenomenon is likely to explain the 'k-hole', a state of oblivion likened to a near death experience that is keenly sought by ketamine abusers.	[Nicol, A. U.; Morton, A.

Although it has been systematically reported that the entrained EEG oscillation persists for approximately three cycles after stimulus offset, the neural mechanisms underpinning it remain unknown. Focusing on alpha oscillations, we adopt the dynamical excitation/inhibition framework, which suggests that phases of entrained EEG signals correspond to alternating excitatory/inhibitory states of the neural circuitry. We hypothesize that the duration of the persistence of entrainment is determined by the specific functional state of the entrained neural network at the time the stimulus ends. Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) were elicited in 19 healthy volunteers at the participants' individual alpha peaks. Visual stimulation consisted of a sinusoidally-varying light terminating at one of four phases: 0, pi/2, pi, and 3 pi/2. The persistence duration of the oscillatory activity was analyzed as a function of the terminating phase of the stimulus. Phases of the SSVEP at the stimulus termination were distributed within a constant range of values relative to the phase of the stimulus. Longer persistence durations were obtained when visual stimulation terminated towards the troughs of the alpha oscillations, while shorter persistence durations occurred when stimuli terminated near the peaks. Source localization analysis suggests that the persistence of entrainment reflects the functioning of fronto-occipital neuronal circuits, which might prime the sensory representation of incoming visual stimuli based on predictions about stimulus rhythmicity. Consequently, different states of the network at the end of the stimulation, corresponding to different states of intrinsic neuronal coupling, may determine the time windows over which coding of incoming sensory stimulation is modulated by the preceding oscillatory activity.

The EEG signal consists of different frequency bands, which correspond to the different emotional and mental activities of the humans. Most of the research work uses the whole frequency spectrum for the detection of seizures. In this paper, first time the proposed automated system utilizing machine learning technique using only alpha band (8-12 Hz). This paper uses Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) due to its high speed and less complexity in hardware implementation to convert EEG data in time-frequency (t-f) plane. As brain oscillations of a person vary in different health conditions, four statistical features have been extracted from t-f plane of alpha band. The detection performance of the features of alpha band has been analyzed on six classifiers using tenfold cross-validation which shows that the Random Forest (RF) classifier gives the best performance among different classifiers for most of the experiments performed. This study has achieved the best classification accuracy of 98% and ROC analysis revealed maximum Area Under Curve (AUC) of 1 to distinguish the seizures and healthy. Hence, the statistical features of the alpha band depict to be a potential biomarker for the real time detection system.

In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to a frequency-based multilayer functional network constructed from nonstationary multivariate data by analyzing recurrences in application to electroencephalography. Using the recurrence-based index of synchronization, we construct intralayer (within-frequency) and interlayer (cross-frequency) graph edges to model the evolution of a whole-head functional connectivity network during a prolonged stimuli classification task. We demonstrate that the graph edges' weights increase during the experiment and negatively correlate with the response time. We also show that while high-frequency activity evolves toward synchronization of remote local areas, low-frequency connectivity tends to establish large-scale coupling between them.

Internally directed cognition (IDC) was shown to differ from externally directed cognition in a range of neurophysiological indicators such as electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha activity and eye behavior. Methods In this EEG-eye-tracking coregistration study, we investigated effects of attention direction on EEG alpha activity and various relevant eye parameters. We used an established paradigm to manipulate internal attention demands in the visual domain within tasks by means of conditional stimulus masking. Results Consistent with previous research, IDC involved relatively higher EEG alpha activity (lower alpha desynchronization) at posterior cortical sites. Moreover, IDC was characterized by greater pupil diameter (PD), fewer microsaccades, fixations, and saccades. These findings show that internal versus external cognition is associated with robust differences in several indicators at the neural and perceptual level. In a second line of analysis, we explored the intrinsic temporal covariation between EEG alpha activity and eye parameters during rest. This analysis revealed a positive correlation of EEG alpha power with PD especially in bilateral parieto-occipital regions. Conclusion Together, these findings suggest that EEG alpha activity and PD represent time-sensitive indicators of internal attention demands, which may be involved in a neurophysiological gating mechanism serving to shield internal cognition from irrelevant sensory information.

Audio-visual stimulation is used to generate emotions at the time of experiment. After recording of EEG signals, feature extraction and classification has been applied to classify the emotions (happy, angry, sad and relaxing). The main highlights of the study include: 1) identification/characterization of audio-visual stimulation which generate harmful emotions and 2) proposed approach to reduce the number of EEG channels for emotion classification. Intention behind identification of audio-visual stimulation (video) responsible for harmful emotions like sad and anger is to control their access over social media and another public platform. EEG channels are selected on the basis of their activation probability, calculated from the correlation matrix of EEG channels. Three types of features are extracted from EEG signals, time domain, frequency domain and entropy based. After feature extraction three different algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and naive bayes (NB) are used to classify the emotions. This study is conducted over the DEAP (Database for emotion analysis using Physiological signals) database of EEG signals recorded at different emotional states of several subjects. To compare performance after channel selection, parameters like accuracy, average precision and average recall are calculated. After result analysis, ANN is found as best classifier with 97.74% average accuracy. Among listed features, entropy-based features are found as best features with 90.53% average accuracy.

Cortical dynamics of movement-evoked pain in chronic low back pain	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						chronic low back pain; electroencephalography; motor control; neural oscillations; reaching movement; sensorimotor system	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; MOTOR VARIABILITY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN MECHANISMS; LUMBAR FLEXION; EEG; FEAR; SUPPLEMENTARY; ACTIVATION; RECOVERY	Key points Cortical activity underlying movement-evoked pain is not well understood, despite being a key symptom of chronic musculoskeletal pain. We combined high-density electroencephalography with a full-body reaching protocol in a virtual reality environment to assess cortical activity during movement-evoked pain in chronic low back pain. Movement-evoked pain in individuals with chronic low back pain was associated with longer reaction times, delayed peak velocity and greater movement variability. Movement-evoked pain was associated with attenuated disinhibition in prefrontal motor areas, as evidenced by an attenuated reduction in beta power in the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area. Although experimental pain alters neural activity in the cortex, evidence of changes in neural activity in individuals with chronic low back pain (cLBP) remains scarce and results are inconsistent. One of the challenges in studying cLBP is that the clinical pain fluctuates over time and often changes during movement. The goal of the present study was to address this challenge by recording high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) data during a full-body reaching task to understand neural activity during movement-evoked pain. HD-EEG data were analysed using independent component analyses, source localization and measure projection analyses to compare neural oscillations between individuals with cLBP who experienced movement-evoked pain and pain-free controls. We report two novel findings. First, movement-evoked pain in individuals with cLBP was associated with longer reaction times, delayed peak velocity and greater movement variability. Second, movement-evoked pain was associated with an attenuated reduction in beta power in the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area. Our observations move the field forward by revealing attenuated disinhibition in prefrontal motor areas during movement-evoked pain in cLBP.	[Wang, Wei-en; Ho, Rachel L.

Experimental-design Specific Changes in Spontaneous EEG and During Intermittent Photic Stimulation by High Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); electroencephalography (EEG); Intermittent photic stimulation; EEG photic driving	BRAIN-STIMULATION; DC POLARIZATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SAFETY; TRIAL; PAIN; TDCS	Electroencephalography (EEG) as a biomarker of neuromodulation by High Definition transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) offers promise as both techniques are deployable and can be integrated into a single head-gear. The present research addresses experimental design for separating focal EEG effect of HDtDCS in the '4-cathode x 1-anode' (4 x 1) montage over the left motor area (C3). We assessed change in offline EEG at the homologous central (C3, C4), and occipital (01, 02) locations. Interhemispheric asymmetry was accessed for background EEG at standard frequency bands; and for the intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). EEG was compared post- vs pre-intervention in three HD-tDCS arms: Active (2 mA), Sham (ramp up/down at the start and end), and No-Stimulation (device was not powered), each intervention lasting 20 min. The asymmetric background EEG changes were only in the central areas with right-side amplitude spectra prevalence, most pronounced in the no-stimulation arm, where they depended on comparison time-points and were consistent with markers of transition between drowsiness and vigilance - bilateral decrease in the delta and asymmetric central increase in the alpha and betal bands. For the active arm, similar but less pronounced changes occurred in the alpha band. In contrast, responses to IPS developed similar asymmetric amplitude increase at four harmonics of the IPS of 3 Hz only in the active arm, against a background of a brain-wide symmetric increase in both active and sham arms. Our protocols and analyses suggest methodological caveats for how EEG of tDCS studies could be conducted to isolate putative brain polarization outcomes. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Since the EEG signal has complex, nonlinear, nonstationary, and highly random behaviour, numerous linear feature extraction methods related to the short-time windowing technique do not satisfy higher classification accuracy. Since biosignals are highly subjective, the symptoms may appear at random in the time scale and very small variations in EEG signals may depict a definite type of brain abnormality it is valuable and vital to extract and analyze the EEG signal parameters using computers. The challenge is to design and develop signal processing algorithms that extract this subtle information and use it for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of subjects suffering from psychiatric disorders. For this purpose, finite impulse response-based filtering process was employed rather than traditional time and frequency domain methods. Finite impulse response subbands were analyzed further to obtain feature vectors of different entropy markers and these features were fed into a classifier namely multilayer perceptron. The performances of the classifiers were finally compared considering overall classification accuracies, area under receiver operating characteristic curve scores. Our results underline the potential benefit of the introduced methodology is promising and is to be treated as a clinical interface in dichotomizing substance use disorders subjects and for other medical data analysis studies. The results also indicate that entropy estimators can distinguish normal and opioid use disorder subjects. EEG data and theta frequency band have distinctive capability for almost all types of entropies while nonextensive Tsallis entropy outperforms compared with other types of entropies.

Twenty-six AD patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the training group (TG) and control group (CG). TG executed progressive combined exercises with visual stimulation twice a week for 12 weeks. Training included muscle endurance, balance, flexibility, and aerobic exercises with eyes closed and opened. Brain oscillation on electroencephalography (EEG) and a series of physical, cognitive, and mental tests were taken before and post-intervention. There was a significant improvement after training protocol in cognitive function, particularly in short-term and working memory, attention, and executive function (p < 0.01). Besides, there were substantial improvements in depression status (GDS scale), aerobic fitness (6 min walking), flexibility (chair sit and reach) functional ability (chair stand, timed up and go test), strength (knee extensions, preacher biceps curl, handgrip) in TG compared to CG. These signs of progress were associated with a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the frequency of brain oscillation and a decrease in the theta/alpha ratio. In addition to physical performance, the regular combined training with visual stimulation improves brain health as indicated by improving cognitive function and reducing the theta/alpha ratio.

In this study, we investigated the cortical response measured by electroencephalography (EEG) on the fine touch sensory impairment during textile fabric stimulation after stroke. Approach Both participants with chronic stroke (n = 12, stroke group) and those unimpaired (n = 15, control group) were recruited. To investigate fine touch during textile fabric stimulations, full brain EEG recordings (64-channel) were used, as well as the touch sensation questionnaires based on the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) Evaluation Procedure 5. During the EEG measurement, relative spectral power (RSP) and EEG topography were used to evaluate the neural responses toward the fabric stimuli. In the subjective questionnaire, the fine touch for fabric stimuli was rated and represented by 13 different sensation parameters. The correlation between the fine touch evaluated by the EEG and the questionnaire was also investigated. Main results The neural responses of individuals with fine touch impairments after stroke were characterized by a shifted power spectrum to a higher frequency band, enlarged sensory cortical areas and higher RSP intensity (P < 0.05). Asymmetric neural responses were obtained when stimulating different upper limbs for both unimpaired participants and stroke participants (P < 0.05). The fine touch sensation of the stroke participants was impaired even in the unaffected limb. However, as a result of different neural processes, the correlation between the EEG and the questionnaire was weak (r < 0.2). Significance EEG RSP was able to capture the varied cortical responses induced by textile fabric fine touch stimulations related to the fine touch sensory impairment after stroke.

Seizure detection hardware requires accurate feature extraction, which is conventionally done in the digital domain by extracting power in different EEG frequency bands over a particular time window. This paper presents an analog counterpart to digital feature extraction. A received signal strength indicator (RSSI) circuit is used for extracting EEG power features in the analog domain. A high-precision RSSI circuit was designed in the sub-threshold domain with ultra-low power consumption and low sensitivity to process-voltage-temperature variations with CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the RSSI circuit consumes 24 nW power, and has a dynamic range of 53 dB with a linearity error of +/- 0.5 dB, sufficient to accurately extract features for seizure classification. The analysis of 16 hours of patient EEG data indicates a seizure classification accuracy of 94%, and a non-seizure classification of 86%.

A novel generalized system is proposed to encode the alpha oscillations modulated during video viewing by employing the visual saliency involved in the presented natural video stimuli. Focusing on the parietal and occipital lobes, the encoding effects at different alpha frequency bins and brain locations are examined by a real-valued genetic algorithm (GA), and possible links between alpha features and saliency patterns are constructed. The robustness and reliability of the proposed system are demonstrated in a 10-fold cross-validation. The results show that stimuli with different saliency levels can induce significant changes in occipito-parietal alpha oscillations and that alpha at higher frequency bins responded the most in involuntary attention related to bottom-up-based visual processing. This study provides a novel approach to understand the processing of involuntary attention in the brain dynamics and would further be beneficial to the development of brain-computer interfaces and visual design.

However, current BCI systems could only implement a small number of command codes, which hampers their applicability. Methods: This study developed a high-speed hybrid BCI system containing as many as 108 instructions, which were encoded by concurrent P300 and steadystate visual evoked potential (SSVEP) features and decoded by an ensemble task-related component analysis method. Notably, besides the frequency-phase-modulated SSVEP and time-modulated P300 features as contained in the traditional hybrid P300 and SSVEP features, this study found two new distinct EEG features for the concurrent P300 and SSVEP features, i.e., time-modulated SSVEP and frequency-phase- modulated P300. Ten subjects spelled in both offline and online cued-guided spelling experiments. Other ten subjects took part in online copy-spelling experiments. Results: Offline analyses demonstrate that the concurrent P300 and SSVEP features can provide adequate classification information to correctly select the target from 108 characters in 1.7 seconds. Online cued-guided spelling and copy-spelling tests further show that the proposed BCI system can reach an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 172.46 +/- 32.91 bits/min and 164.69 +/- 33.32 bits/min respectively, with a peak value of 238.41 bits/min (The demo video of online copy-spelling can be found at https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW2Q08oHSBo). Conclusion: We expand a BCI instruction set to over 100 command codes with high-speed in an efficient manner, which significantly improves the degree of freedom of BCIs. Significance: This study hold promise for broadening the applications of BCI systems.

Heritability of alpha and sensorimotor network changes in temporal lobe epilepsy	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; INSULAR CORTEX; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; FREQUENCY; SEIZURES; CARBAMAZEPINE; VARIABILITY; MEMORY	Objective Electroencephalography (EEG) features in the alpha band have been shown to differ between people with epilepsy and healthy controls. Here, in a group of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), we seek to confirm these EEG features, and using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigate whether brain networks related to the alpha rhythm differ between patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we investigate whether alpha abnormalities are found as an inherited endophenotype in asymptomatic relatives. Methods We acquired scalp EEG and simultaneous EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging in 24 unrelated patients with unilateral mTLE, 23 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of patients with mTLE, and 32 healthy controls. We compared peak alpha power and frequency from electroencephalographic data in patients and relatives to healthy controls. We identified brain networks associated with alpha oscillations and compared these networks in patients and relatives to healthy controls. Results Patients had significantly reduced peak alpha frequency (PAF) across all parietal and occipital electrodes. Asymptomatic relatives also had significantly reduced PAF over 14 of 17 parietal and occipital electrodes. Both patients and asymptomatic relatives showed a combination of increased activation and a failure of deactivation in relation to alpha oscillations compared to healthy controls in the sensorimotor network. Interpretation Genetic factors may contribute to the shift in PAF and alterations in brain networks related to alpha oscillations. These may not entirely be a consequence of anti-epileptic drugs, seizures or hippocampal sclerosis and deserve further investigation as mechanistic contributors to mTLE.

Latent Phase Identification of High-Frequency Micro-Scale Gamma Spike Transients in the Hypoxic Ischemic EEG of Preterm Fetal Sheep Using Spectral Analysis and Fuzzy Classifiers	SENSORS			English	Article						hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); automatic detection and quantification; high-frequency micro-scale gamma spikes; spectral Fourier transform analysis; fuzzy; electroencephalogram (EEG); electrocorticogram (ECoG)	OSCILLATIONS; ASPHYXIA; SEIZURES; INJURY	Premature babies are at high risk of serious neurodevelopmental disabilities, which in many cases are related to perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Studies of neuroprotection in animal models consistently suggest that treatment must be started as early as possible in the first 6 h after hypoxia-ischemia (HI), the so-called latent phase before secondary deterioration, to improve outcomes. We have shown in preterm sheep that EEG biomarkers of injury, in the form of high-frequency micro-scale spike transients, develop and evolve in this critical latent phase after severe asphyxia. Real-time automatic identification of such events is important for the early and accurate detection of HI injury, so that the right treatment can be implemented at the right time. We have previously reported successful strategies for accurate identification of EEG patterns after HI. In this study, we report an alternative high-performance approach based on the fusion of spectral Fourier analysis and Type-I fuzzy classifiers (FFT-Type-I-FLC). We assessed its performance in over 2520 min of latent phase EEG recordings from seven asphyxiated in utero preterm fetal sheep exposed to a range of different occlusion periods. The FFT-Type-I-FLC classifier demonstrated 98.9 +/- 1.0% accuracy for identification of high-frequency spike transients in the gamma frequency band (namely 80-120 Hz) post-HI. The spectral-based approach (FFT-Type-I-FLC classifier) has similar accuracy to our previous reverse biorthogonal wavelets rbio2.8 basis function and type-1 fuzzy classifier (rbio-WT-Type-1-FLC), providing competitive performance (within the margin of error: 0.89%), but it is computationally simpler and would be readily adapted to identify other potentially relevant EEG waveforms.

However, the interpretation of EEG signals is still a challenging computational task. Emerging evidence has shown that the non-stationary traits of EEG signals hinder the way of informative interpretation. Compared to the classical Welch frequency analysis method (short-time Fourier transform), Hilbert Huang Transform(HHT) is more suitable for non-linear and non-stationary signals. This paper proposes a band energy extraction method based on EEMD-HHT for time-frequency analysis of EEG signals. We evaluate the method on an EEG database obtained through the emotional cognitive experiment. The auditory stimulus in this paper are selected from CHEAVD2 which is a speech emotion database of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The correlation coefficients between the predict and target values reach 0.51 and 0.43 for arousal and valence dimension, respectively. This method shows great potentials in applications of computational neuroscience and cognition of art creation.

However, few attempts have been conducted for using the delay magnitude as a feature of synchrony events. A new methodology for studying synchrony in EEG data is presented here. It includes synchrony detection and a novel mechanism to estimate delay magnitude and sign - hence causality - between narrow bandwidth signals. Synchrony detection and delay estimation are separated in two steps: first, significant synchrony is detected using a measure based on phase differences, then, delay is estimated by analyzing the dispersion of measure maxima in the space spanned by time, frequency and delays. Synthetic EEG data is used to validate the methodology using a synchrony spectral model with controlled bandwidth and multivariate autoregressive models (MVAR). The proposed methodology achieves a superior performance in causality estimation than state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and robustness to noise. We also present an analysis of data from a psychophysiological experiment of figure categorization. This methodology provides a reliable method to estimate the delay magnitude of synchrony events and it is a better alternative for studying causality than the state-of-the-art techniques employed here.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze intraoperative stress in real time in terms of electroencephalography signals and heart rate variability using a wearable device during spine surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Five orthopedic spine surgeons with experience ranging from 1 to 30 years were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures included stress levels among the spine surgeons and differences in stress parameters between novice and expert surgeons and between assistants and operators. METHODS: From June 2018 to November 2018, 179 consecutive records of intraoperative stress measures, including intraoperative electroencephalography signals and heart rate variability, comprising beats per minute (BPM) and low frequency/high frequency ratio, for the orthopedic spine surgeons were prospectively gathered, compared, and analyzed. RESULTS: Among all measures, sensory-motor rhythm (SMR) waves, gamma waves, and BPM differed significantly during surgery (analysis of variance; p=.040,.013,.002, respectively). Surgery duration and intraoperative bleeding were positively correlated with stress parameters, including gamma waves and tension. For operators, surgeon experience was negatively correlated with concentration, tension, and SMR, gamma, M-beta, and H-beta waves (Pearson correlation, p<.05). However, for assistants, surgeon experience was positively correlated with concentration, tension, BPM, and SMR, M-beta, H-beta, and gamma waves. Bleeding amounts were correlated positively with gamma waves and tension for both operators and assistants (Pearson correlation, p<. 05). Stress among operators was higher than that among assistants in terms of low frequency/high frequency ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Operators and surgeons with low experience exhibited higher stress levels during surgery, which should be addressed when scheduling elective surgery to ensure optimal conditions among spine surgeons.

Signal-Space Projection Suppresses the tACS Artifact in EEG Recordings	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; artifact; phantom head; signal-space projection; tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation)	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; MENTAL ROTATION; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; MEG; ENTRAINMENT; DYNAMICS	Background To probe the functional role of brain oscillations, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has proven to be a useful neuroscientific tool. Because of the excessive tACS-caused artifact at the stimulation frequency in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, tACS + EEG studies have been mostly limited to compare brain activity between recordings before and after concurrent tACS. Critically, attempts to suppress the artifact in the data cannot assure that the entire artifact is removed while brain activity is preserved. The current study aims to evaluate the feasibility of specific artifact correction techniques to clean tACS-contaminated EEG data. New Method In the first experiment, we used a phantom head to have full control over the signal to be analyzed. Driving pre-recorded human brain-oscillation signals through a dipolar current source within the phantom, we simultaneously applied tACS and compared the performance of different artifact-correction techniques: sine subtraction, template subtraction, and signal-space projection (SSP). In the second experiment, we combined tACS and EEG on one human subject to demonstrate the best-performing data-correction approach in a proof of principle. Results The tACS artifact was highly attenuated by SSP in the phantom and the human EEG; thus, we were able to recover the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory activity. In the human experiment, event-related desynchronization could be restored after correcting the artifact. Comparison With Existing Methods The best results were achieved with SSP, which outperformed sine subtraction and template subtraction. Conclusion Our results demonstrate the feasibility of SSP by applying it to a phantom measurement with pre-recorded signal and one human tACS + EEG dataset. For a full validation of SSP, more data are needed.

It is essential to extract an effective and accurate EEG rhythm indicator that can reflect the dynamical behavior of a given EEG signal. Time-frequency analysis is a promising method to achieve this end, but existing methods still have limitations in real implementation making this kind of methods still progressive until the present day. In this paper, along the line of ongoing research on time-frequency methods, we present a new method based on graph-based modeling. By virtue of this method, an effective and accurate EEG rhythm indicator can be extracted to characterize the dynamical EEG time series. Together with the extracted EEG rhythm indicator, an automatic analysis of continuous monitoring of EEG signal, is developed by means of a null hypothesis testing to inspect whether an EEG change occurs or not during a monitoring period. The proposed framework is applied to both simulated data and real signals respectively to validate its effectiveness. Experimental results, together with theoretical interpretation and discussions, suggest its promising potentials in practice.

J	Domracheva, M; Kulikova, S				Domracheva, Marina; Kulikova, Sofya			EEG correlates of perceived food product similarity in a cross-modal taste-visual task	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						Taste perception; EEG; N400; Induced gamma oscillations; Cross-modal tasks	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; BRAIN	The most common tools to understand perception of food products are hall tests, surveys and observations. However, these approaches require large samples to get reliable results and they are rather costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, they are also highly expert-dependent and rely on the assumption that study participants can express their preferences consciously and explicitly. In our paper, we suggest an electroencephalography-based (EEG) approach to evaluate perceived product similarly in a cross-modal taste-visual task. We tested two potential neurometrics measured from Fz electrode: the amplitude of the N400-like evoked response potentials (ERP) and the power of induced gamma oscillations during 400-600 ms period after visual stimulus presentation. Both metrics showed a strong correlation with the perceived similarly scores at both individual and group levels; however, N400-like amplitude had greater inter-subject variability making it less suitable for practical applications. The results based on the power of induced gamma oscillations (N = 18) could be compared to traditional hall-tests (N = 200) and may potentially reveal subtle differences in food perception that can not be captured in the hall-tests.

The study sought to assess how much the game contents activated brain to see if they were suitable for cognitive functional training. For Electroencephalography signal analysis, power spectral analysis was implemented to classify signals according to frequency. To test signal variation according to the degree of brain activation before and after performing the game, variation comparison and paired f-test were conducted. Results showed that there was reduction in a wave signaling which implied that the subjects concentrate on the content, and increase in beta wave signifying that they were engaged in cognitive activities such as remembering and assessing. Consequentially, the produced contents in this study are expected to be useful for cognitive functional training.

However, there is a challenging task for detecting seizures from EEG signals, which is due to the non-stationary nature of EEG signals. This paper proposes a novel automatic EEG signal recognition method to assist epilepsy detection. Specifically, the multi-wavelet basis function (MWBF) expansion method is first adopted to construct a time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) model of EEG signals, and a robust ultra-orthogonal least squares (UOLS) algorithm aided by derivative information of EEG signals is then utilized for model structure detection; besides, the power spectral density (PSD) estimation method is applied to extract high-resolution time-frequency features; particularly, to fully exploited the spatiotemporal information of the extracted features, features were fed into the spiking neural networks (SNN) for classification. Experimental results on a widely-used benchmark dataset show that proposed methods outperform other related methods in terms of classification performance.

Electroencephalography profiles as a biomarker of wellbeing: A twin study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Well-being; Mental health; Heritability; Twins; Alpha power	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; STRESS SCALES DASS; DELTA-OSCILLATIONS; MENTAL-HEALTH; HERITABILITY; EEG; DEPRESSION; CONNECTIVITY; POWER; LIFE	Alterations to electroencephalography (EEG) power have been reported for psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, but not for mental wellbeing in a healthy population. This study examined the resting EEG profiles associated with mental wellbeing, and how genetics and environment contribute to these associations using twin modelling. Mental wellbeing was assessed using the COMPAS-W Wellbeing Scale which measures both subjective and psychological wellbeing. In 422 healthy adult monozygotic and dizygotic twins aged 18-61 years, we examined the association between mental wellbeing and EEG power (alpha, beta, theta, delta) using linear mixed models. This was followed by univariate and multivariate twin modelling to assess the heritability of wellbeing and EEG power, and whether the association was driven by shared genetics or environment. A significant association between wellbeing and an interaction of alpha, beta, and delta (ABD) power was found (beta = -0.33, p < 0.001) whereby a profile of high alpha and delta and low beta was associated with higher wellbeing, independent of depression and anxiety symptoms. This finding was supported by a five-fold cross-validation analysis. A significant genetic correlation (rG = - 0.43) was found to account for 94% of the association between wellbeing and the EEG power interaction. Together, this study has identified a novel EEG profile with a common genetic component that may be a potential biomarker of mental wellbeing. Future studies need to clarify the causal direction of this association.	[Chilver, Miranda R.; Park, Haeme R.

Examination of interareal coupling of resting-state oscillatory activity has revealed that the brain's resting activity is composed of functional networks, whose topographies differ depending on oscillatory frequency, suggesting a role for carrier frequency as a means of creating multiplexed, or functionally segregated, communication channels between brain areas. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we examined spectrally resolved resting-state connectivity patterns derived from magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings to determine the relationship between connectivity intrinsic to different frequency channels and a battery of over a hundred behavioral and demographic indicators, in a group of 89 young healthy participants. We demonstrate that each of the classical frequency bands in the range 1-40 Hz (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) delineates a subnetwork that is behaviorally relevant, spatially distinct, and whose expression is either negatively or positively predictive of individual traits, with the strongest link in the a- band being negative and networks oscillating at different frequencies, such as theta, beta, and gamma carrying positive function.

The excavation of valuable and discriminative feature information needs to be based on the reliable time-frequency analysis, which is the foremost precondition for feature engineering. However, relying on the high temporal resolution of MI-EEG, traditional feature extraction methods can only conduct the time-frequency analysis according to the superficial neurophysiological rhythm of EEG in the sensor domain. And more detailed time-frequency characteristics could hardly be embodied in a few channels of MI-EEG signals, which leads to a coarse selection of time-frequency interval and the resulted lower decoding effect. Therefore, a neurophysiology-based technique is needed for performing more exact time-frequency analysis. Based on the advanced EEG Source Imaging, a Wrapped Time-Frequency combined Selection in the Source Domain, which is denoted as WTFS-SD, is proposed for decoding the MI-tasks by applying Weighted Minimum Norm Estimate and CSP based sub-band feature extraction in this paper. Abundant comparative experiments are conducted on the BCI2000 system dataset with six subjects, and the results show that the proposed methods can select subject-specific optimal frequency band and TOI, which yields the highest average classification rate of 93.14% by 9-fold cross-validation at the same chance level as well as a superior mean kappa coefficient of 0.8627 across all subjects compared to other prevalent methods. This study will enhance the decoding of complex MI-tasks and be helpful for the development of intelligent BCI system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and heartbeat-derived series has been widely used, the role of EEG preprocessing on a BHI quantification is yet unknown. To this extent, here we investigate on four different EEG electrical referencing techniques associated with BHI quantifications over 4-minute resting-state in 15 healthy subjects. BHI methods include the synthetic data generation model, heartbeat-evoked potentials, heartbeat-evoked oscillations, and maximal information coefficient (MIC). EEG signals were offline referenced under the Cz channel, common average, mastoids average, and Laplacian method, and statistical comparisons were performed to assess similarities between references and between BHI techniques. Results show a topographical agreement between BHI estimation methods depending on the specific EEG reference. Major differences between BHI methods occur with the Laplacian reference, while major differences between EEG references are with the MIC analysis. We conclude that the choice of EEG electrical reference may significantly affect a functional BHI quantification.

Methods: The network connectivity of 22 patients was investigated with MEG at the source level. Network connectivity of spikes and slow waves was computed with accumulated source imaging (ASI) and correlation analysis. Time-frequency analysis was used to characterize the network changes during the ictal-onset period of each patient and the potential factors. Results: We found that spectral power increased at around 1 s and distributed at 2-4 Hz in all patients. Ictal spikes simultaneously showed elevation of network connectivity, predominantly excitatory connections, when generalized firing activity spread to the overall brain. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) were prone to detect overexcited neuronal firing in certain focal areas. Conclusions: Personal network changes during ictal onset had unique features in the time range and parallel seizure rhythm uniformly in every patient. There was an important time point for generalized discharges of the epileptic network. Ictal spiking activity played an important role in the epileptic network synchronicity of childhood absence epilepsy. Frequency oscillations provided references for locating abnormal changes in neuromagnetic signals.

In recent years, several inconsistencies were found across different EEG studies, which authors often attributed to methodological differences. However, the assessment of such discrepancies is deeply underexplored. It is currently unknown if methodological differences can fully explain emerging differences and the nature of these differences. This study aims to contrast widely used methodological approaches in EEG processing and compare their effects on the outcome variables. To this end, two publicly available datasets were collected, each having unique traits so as to validate the results in two different EEG territories. The first dataset included signals with event-related potentials (visual stimulation) from 45 subjects. The second dataset included resting state EEG signals from 16 subjects. Five EEG processing steps, involved in the computation of power and phase quantities of EEG frequency bands, were explored in this study: artifact removal choices (with and without artifact removal), EEG signal transformation choices (raw EEG channels, Hjorth transformed channels, and averaged channels across primary motor cortex), filtering algorithms (Butterworth filter and Blackman-Harris window), EEG time window choices (-750 ms to 0 ms and -250 ms to 0 ms), and power spectral density (PSD) estimation algorithms (Welch's method, Fast Fourier Transform, and Burg's method). Powers and phases estimated by carrying out variations of these five methods were analyzed statistically for all subjects. The results indicated that the choices in EEG transformation and time-window can strongly affect the PSD quantities in a variety of ways. Additionally, EEG transformation and filter choices can influence phase quantities significantly. These results raise the need for a consistent and standard EEG processing pipeline for computational EEG studies. Consistency of signal processing methods cannot only help produce comparable results and reproducible research, but also pave the way for federated machine learning methods, e.g., where model parameters rather than data are shared.

This research is done to reveal the detailed effects of 2D in comparison with 3D technology on the human brain waves. The impact of 2D&3D video watching using electroencephalography (EEG) brain signals is studied. A group of eight healthy volunteers with the average age of 31 +/- 3.06 years old participated in this three-stage test. EEG signal recording consisted of three stages: After a bit of relaxation (a), a 2D video was displayed (b), the recording of the signal continued for a short period of time as rest (c), and finally the trial ended. Exactly the same steps were repeated for the 3D video. Power spectrum density (PSD) based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) was used to analyze the brain signals of 2D&3D video viewers. After testing all the EEG frequency bands, delta and theta were extracted as the features. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms were considered in order to classify EEG signals obtained as the result of 2D&3D video watching. Successful classification results were obtained by selecting the correct combinations of effective channels representing the brain regions.

The aim of this study was to calculate the time lag between electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) responses, to clarify the changes in the relationship between the cerebral cortex (CC) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during emotional recall processing. Twenty-two healthy young adults were examined. Their EEG and ECG data were simultaneously recorded during emotional audiovisual recall tasks using pleasant and unpleasant stimuli for 180 s, with three repetitions (Epochs 1 & 2 and Epoch 3). The EEG data were analyzed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain a time series of relative power spectra, X-E, in the theta 1, theta 2, alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 bands. Time series of RR (inter-beat) intervals (time intervals between successive R waves) derived from the ECG spectral analysis using FFT was applied to the resampled time series of RR intervals over about 60 s to obtain a time series of power spectra for the ratio low frequency/high frequency (LH/HF), X-C, which reflects the activity of the sympathetic nervous function. The time lag between X-E and X-C was calculated using wavelet-crosscorrelation analysis. The results demonstrated that the brain responded to unfamiliar emotionally pleasant stimuli in Epochs 1 & 2 earlier than the SNS, whereas the brain and SNS responded to unfamiliar unpleasant stimuli nearly simultaneously. The brain was activated rapidly in response to familiar unpleasant stimuli, although SNS responded more rapidly to familiar pleasant stimuli than the brain in Epoch 3. Our results quantitatively describe the relationship between the CC and the ANS during emotional recall.	[Mizuno-Matsumoto, Yuko; Inoguchi, Yuji; Carpels, Steven M.

This observational registry-based study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Korea using the data of all consecutive adult non-traumatic comatose OHCA survivors who underwent standard electroencephalography during TTM between 2010 and 2018. The primary outcome was a 6-month favourable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2). Among 170 comatose OHCA survivors with median electroencephalography time of 22 h, a 6-month favourable neurologic outcome was observed in 34.1% (58/170). After adjusting other clinical characteristics, an electroencephalography background with dominant alpha and theta waves had the highest odds ratio of 13.03 (95% confidence interval, 4.69-36.22) in multivariable logistic analysis. A combination of other clinical features (age < 65 years, initial shockable rhythm, resuscitation duration < 20 min) with an electroencephalography background with dominant alpha and theta waves increased predictive performance for favourable neurologic outcomes with a high specificity of up to 100%. A background with dominant alpha and theta waves in standard electroencephalography during TTM could be a simple and early favourable prognostic finding in comatose OHCA survivors.

We ran an automated detection of arousals over 35 sleep EEG recordings in healthy young and older individuals and compared it against human visual detection from two research centres with the aim to evaluate the algorithm performance. Comparison across human scorers revealed a high variability in the number of detected arousals, which was always lower than the number detected automatically. Despite indexing more events, automatic detection showed high agreement with human detection as reflected by its correlation with human raters and very good Cohen's kappa values. Finally, the sex of participants and sleep stage did not influence performance, while age may impact automatic detection, depending on the human rater considered as gold standard. We propose our freely available algorithm as a reliable and time-sparing alternative to visual detection of arousals.

The aim of this study was to develop a real-time, continuous physiological medical signal data acquisition system in seizure detection for intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: This prospective study was conducted in National Taiwan University Hospital from August 2018 to October 2019. This study included 20 patients who (a) had a sustained return of spontaneous circulation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, (b) were over 18 years old, (c) and were admitted to the emergency ICU for post-cardiac-arrest care. One-lead electrocardiography and bilateral two-channel electroencephalography recorders were synchronically used to conduct measurements for a maximum of 72 hours. The recorded data were wirelessly real-time transmitted by a proxy transmitting module through an access point and a local gateway. A system with a novel algorithm processed the signals and conducted feature extraction and supervised learning for seizure detection. Results: A total of 89 nonseizure and 83 seizure events were detected by the system. Seizure occurred in two-thirds of the patients assessed by intensivists and neurologists. Four HRV parameters, namely standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-wave intervals, high frequency, low frequency-high frequency ratio, and sample entropy, were determined as potential features for identifying seizures. The sensitivity and specificity of the developed system were 0.74 and 0.81, respectively, and the positive predictive value was 0.82. Conclusion: The developed system can be used to identify seizure events through HRV features. Significance: The current study achieved real-time seizure detection and overcame previous limitations on continuity and accessibility.

Here, we paired WM training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the frontoparietal network over four days. Active tDCS enhanced WM performance by modulating interactions between frontoparietal theta oscillations and gamma activity, as measured by pre- and post-training high-density electroencephalography (EEG). Increased phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the prefrontal stimulation site and temporo-parietal gamma activity explained behavioral improvements, and was most effective when gamma occurred near the prefrontal theta peak. These results demonstrate for the first time that tDCS-linked WM training elicits lasting changes in behavior by optimizing the oscillatory substrates of prefrontal control.

However, most of these studies have addressed this relationship in a laboratory environment. In this study, we investigated the correlation between comfort level and brainwaves in a real-world environment. Field experiments were performed at two subway stations, a comfortable station and an uncomfortable station, to measure and compare the EEGs of 30 healthy students. The EEG signal patterns showed that the beta and gamma band powers were higher at the uncomfortable station than at the comfortable station. However, unlike previous studies where significant gamma bands activity was not observed, significantly high gamma band activity was observed in uncomfortable field environments in this study. In addition, in contrast to the results of previous studies, the alpha band activity did not increase in the comfortable field environment in this study. The present study shows that brainwave measurements can be used as an additional method to observe the responses of a participant in field environments that do not appear in laboratory experiments.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), is one of the clinical manifestations of conversion disorder that epileptiform discharges do not accompany. Factors capable of increasing susceptibility to these seizures have not been adequately investigated yet. This study aims to investigate the quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) findings for PNES by evaluating the resting EEG spectral power changes during the periods between seizures. Methods. Thirty-nine patients (29 females, 10 males) diagnosed with PNES (group 1) and 47 patients (23 females, 24 males) without any psychiatric diagnosis (group 2) were included in the study. The patients underwent a psychiatric examination at their first visit, were diagnosed and their EEGs were recorded. Using fast Fourier transformation (FFT), spectral power analysis was calculated for delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz), high-beta (25-30 Hz), gamma-1 (31-40 Hz), gamma-2 (41-50 Hz), and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency bands. Results. Six separate EEG band power, namely (C3-high beta, C3-gamma, C3-gamma-1, C3-gamma-2, P3-gamma, P3 gamma-1), were found to be higher in the patients diagnosed with PNES than in the control group. Conclusion. Our findings show that PNES correlate with high-frequency oscillations on central motor and somatosensory cortices.

The most common technique used by medical teams is to visualize the raw signal in order to find pathological events such as interictal epileptic spikes (IESs) or abnormal oscillations. More and more efforts are being adopted to try to facilitate the work of doctors by automating this process. Our goal was to analyze signal density fields to improve the visualization and automatic detection of pathological events. We transformed the EEG signal into images on which we applied a convolution filter based on a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This method that we propose to call CKDE for Convolutional Kernel Density Estimation allowed the emergence of local density fields leading to a better visualization as well as automatic detection of IESs. Future work will be necessary to make this technique more efficient, but preliminary results are very encouraging and show a high performance compared to a visual inspection of the data or some other automatic detection techniques.

Including Measures of High Gamma Power Can Improve the Decoding of Natural Speech From EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; temporal response function (TRF); high gamma power; decoding attention; speech envelope	HIGH-FREQUENCY; BAND ACTIVITY; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; TEMPORAL ENVELOPE; ATTENDED SPEAKER; WORKING-MEMORY; COCKTAIL PARTY; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; TIME	The human auditory system is highly skilled at extracting and processing information from speech in both single-speaker and multi-speaker situations. A commonly studied speech feature is the amplitude envelope which can also be used to determine which speaker a listener is attending to in those multi-speaker situations. Non-invasive brain imaging (electro-/magnetoencephalography [EEG/MEG]) has shown that the phase of neural activity below 16 Hz tracks the dynamics of speech, whereas invasive brain imaging (electrocorticography [ECoG]) has shown that such processing is strongly reflected in the power of high frequency neural activity (around 70-150 Hz; known as high gamma). The first aim of this study was to determine if high gamma power scalp recorded EEG carries useful stimulus-related information, despite its reputation for having a poor signal to noise ratio. Specifically, linear regression was used to investigate speech envelope and attention decoding in low frequency EEG, high gamma power EEG, and in both EEG signals combined. The second aim was to assess whether the information reflected in high gamma power EEG may be complementary to that reflected in well-established low frequency EEG indices of speech processing. Exploratory analyses were also completed to examine how low frequency and high gamma power EEG may be sensitive to different features of the speech envelope. While low frequency speech tracking was evident for almost all subjects as expected, high gamma power also showed robust speech tracking in some subjects. This same pattern was true for attention decoding using a separate group of subjects who participated in a cocktail party attention experiment. For the subjects who showed speech tracking in high gamma power EEG, the spatiotemporal characteristics of that high gamma tracking differed from that of low-frequency EEG. Furthermore, combining the two neural measures led to improved measures of speech tracking for several subjects. Our results indicated that high gamma power EEG can carry useful information regarding speech processing and attentional selection in some subjects. Combining high gamma power and low frequency EEG can improve the mapping between natural speech and the resulting neural responses.

The purpose of this study was to investigate brain network alterations in patients with TLE with or without depression using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), and to explore the potential mechanisms of TLE with comorbid depression. Methods: Forty patients with TLE and 20 healthy controls (HC) were recruited for administered the BDI-II and HAMD-17 surveys. The patients with TLE were divided into those with depression (PDS, n = 20) and those without depression (nPDS, n = 20) according to the surveys. Neural oscillations and functional connectivity during performance of EC tasks were calculated during EEG. Results: Theta oscillation and functional connectivity were significantly weakened in the PDS group compared to the nPDS and HC groups. Furthermore, the PDS group showed more serious EC dysfunction than nPDS group. Conclusions: Our results indicated that weakened theta oscillation and functional connectivity in the frontal lobe may be a mechanism of EC dysfunction in TLE with comorbid depression.

We hypothesize that meditation reflects changes in the neural representations of visceral activity, such as cardiac behavior, and investigated the integration of neural and visceral systems and the spontaneous whole brain spatiotemporal dynamics underlying traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation. In a large cohort of long-term Tibetan Buddhist monk meditation practitioners, we found distinct transient modulations of the neural response to heartbeats in the default mode network (DMN), along with large-scale network reconfigurations in the gamma and theta bands of electroencephalography (EEG) activity induced by meditation. Additionally, temporal-frontal network connectivity in the EEG theta band was negatively correlated with the duration of meditation experience, and gamma oscillations were uniquely, directionally coupled to theta oscillations during meditation. Overall, these data suggest that the neural representation of cardiac activity in the DMN and large-scale spatiotemporal network integrations underlie the fundamental neural mechanism of meditation and further imply that meditation may utilize cortical plasticity, inducing both immediate and long-lasting changes in the intrinsic organization and activity of brain networks.

In this research, we explore multimodal physiological phenomena in response to driving fatigue through simultaneous functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with the aim of investigating the relationships between hemodynamic and electrical features and driving performance. Sixteen subjects participated in an event-related lane-deviation driving task while measuring their brain dynamics through fNIRS and EEGs. Three performance groups, classified as Optimal, Suboptimal, and Poor, were defined for comparison. From our analysis, we find that tonic variations occur before a deviation, and phasic variations occur afterward. The tonic results show an increased concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO(2)) and power changes in the EEG theta, alpha, and beta bands. Both dynamics are significantly correlated with deteriorated driving performance. The phasic EEG results demonstrate event-related desynchronization associated with the onset of steering vehicle in all power bands. The concentration of phasic HbO(2) decreased as performance worsened. Further, the negative correlations between tonic EEG delta and alpha power and HbO(2) oscillations suggest that activations in HbO(2) are related to mental fatigue. In summary, combined hemodynamic and electrodynamic activities can provide complete knowledge of the brain's responses as evidence of state changes during fatigue driving.

Now functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are recognized as the most informative methods of studying these processes. To assess the course of the neuroplastic process, we used EEG rhythms power indicators during the period of movement imagining in the paretic arm in right - handed patients after stroke in the left hemisphere in dynamics -before and after the neurorehabilitation course with use of the brain-computer interface controlling the exoskeleton of the hand. Initially, a strong exciting interaction of the primary motor cortex and the frontal-parietal regions in the affected and "intact" hemispheres was revealed, which probably reflected the reorganization of neural networks. After the treatment, we discovered restoration of bioelectric activity in the primary motor cortex as a result of effective communication with the premotor and upper parietal areas, the reduction of pathological influence of the contralateral hemisphere is revealed.

Effects of Visual Scene Complexity on Neural Signatures of Spatial Attention	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; visual spatial attention; alpha oscillations; evoked potential; scene complexity	SUSTAINED INATTENTIONAL BLINDNESS; FEATURE-INTEGRATION-THEORY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SURFACE LAPLACIAN; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; TARGET; ENHANCEMENT; INHIBITION; PERCEPTION	Spatial selective attention greatly affects our processing of complex visual scenes, yet the way in which the brain selects relevant objects while suppressing irrelevant objects is still unclear. Evidence of these processes has been found using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). However, few studies have characterized these measures during attention to dynamic stimuli, and little is known regarding how these measures change with increased scene complexity. Here, we compared attentional modulation of the EEG N1 and alpha power (oscillations between 8-14 Hz) across three visual selective attention tasks. The tasks differed in the number of irrelevant stimuli presented, but all required sustained attention to the orientation trajectory of a lateralized stimulus. In scenes with few irrelevant stimuli, top-down control of spatial attention is associated with strong modulation of both the N1 and alpha power across parietal-occipital channels. In scenes with many irrelevant stimuli in both hemifields, however, top-down control is no longer represented by strong modulation of alpha power, and N1 amplitudes are overall weaker. These results suggest that as a scene becomes more complex, requiring suppression in both hemifields, the neural signatures of top-down control degrade, likely reflecting some limitation in EEG to represent this suppression.

However, this discovery has been primarily based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The role of this whole-brain organization in fast oscillation-based connectivity as measured, for example, by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is only beginning to emerge. Here, we review studies of intrinsic connectivity and its whole-brain organization in EEG, MEG, and intracranial electrophysiology with a particular focus on direct comparisons to connectome studies in fMRI. Synthesizing this literature, we conclude that irrespective of temporal scale over four orders of magnitude, intrinsic neurophysiological connectivity shows spatial similarity to the connectivity organization commonly observed in fMRI. A shared structural connectivity basis and cross-frequency coupling are possible mechanisms contributing to this similarity. Acknowledging that a stable whole-brain organization governs long-range coupling across all timescales of neural processing motivates researchers to take "baseline" intrinsic connectivity into account when investigating brain-behavior associations, and further encourages more widespread exploration of functional connectomics approaches beyond fMRI by using EEG and MEG modalities.

Gamma somatosensory cortical oscillations are attenuated during the stance phase of human walking	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Gait; Sensory; Cortical oscillations	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SENSORY INPUT; MODULATION; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; CENTRIFUGAL; ACTIVATION; VIBRATION; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS	It is well appreciated that processing of peripheral feedback by the somatosensory cortices plays a prominent role in the control of human motor actions like walking. However, very few studies have actually quantified the somatosensory cortical activity during walking. In this investigation, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and beamforming source reconstruction methods to quantify the frequency specific neural oscillations that are induced by an electrical stimulation that is applied to the right tibial nerve under the following experimental conditions: 1) sitting, 2) standing in place, and 3) treadmill walking. Our experimental results revealed that the peripheral stimulation induced a transient increase in theta-alpha (4-12 Hz; 50-350 ms) and gamma (40-80 Hz; 40-100 ms) activity in the leg region of the contralateral somatosensory cortices. The strength of the gamma oscillations were similar while sitting and standing, but were markedly attenuated while walking. Conversely, the strength of the theta-alpha oscillations were not different across the respective experimental conditions. Prior research suggests the afferent feedback from the Ia sensory fibers are likely attenuated during walking, while afferent feedback from the beta polysynaptic sensory fibers are not. We suggest that the attenuated gamma oscillations seen during walking reflect the gating of the Ia afferents, while the similarity of theta-alpha oscillations across the experimental conditions is associated with the afferent information from the type II (A alpha and beta) polysynaptic sensory fibers.

This capacity can be investigated with multiple object tracking (MOT) tasks, which have shown that it varies greatly between individuals. The neuronal mechanisms underlying capacity limits have remained poorly understood. Phase synchronization of cortical oscillations coordinates neuronal communication within the fronto-parietal attention network and between the visual regions during endogenous visual attention. We tested a hypothesis that attentional capacity is predicted by the strength of pretarget synchronization within attention-related cortical regions. We recorded cortical activity with magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) while measuring attentional capacity with MOT tasks and identified large-scale synchronized networks from source-reconstructed M/EEG data. Individual attentional capacity was correlated with load-dependent strengthening of theta (3-8 Hz), alpha (8-10 Hz), and gamma-band (30-120 Hz) synchronization that connected the visual cortex with posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices. Individual memory capacity was also preceded by crossfrequency phase-phase and phase-amplitude coupling of alpha oscillation phase with beta and gamma oscillations. Our results show that good attentional capacity is preceded by efficient dynamic functional coupling and decoupling within brain regions and across frequencies, which may enable efficient communication and routing of information between sensory and attentional systems.

Electroencephalography (EEG), a useful measure for analyzing the brain's electrical activity, has been widely used for the diagnosis of epileptic seizures. In an EEG diagnosis report, synchrony of epileptiform discharges should be included in the description. Correlation coefficient analysis could be used to measure the synchrony feature. However, the existing correlation coefficient overlooks the importance of epileptiform discharges in EEG data of epilepsy. In this paper, in order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel correlation coefficient to measure the synchrony feature. This method combines the attention mechanism with the correlation coefficient. We use the first-order difference to assign the attention weights and apply the weight to the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The first-order difference can highlight the high-frequency and high-amplitude waveforms in the original time series. Therefore, epileptiform discharges could play a more important role in the calculation of the correlation coefficient. We collected the EEG of epileptic patients during the interictal period and labeled the epileptiform discharge segments for experimental tests. In our case study, the Pearson's correlation coefficient with attention weights gave better results than the direct use of Pearson's correlation coefficient.

Sensorimotor Peak Alpha Frequency Is a Reliable Biomarker of Prolonged Pain Sensitivity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						alpha; EEG; individual alpha frequency; pain sensitivity; prolonged pain	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BAND OSCILLATIONS; TOPICAL CAPSAICIN; EEG; PREDICTS; HYPERALGESIA; MODULATION; MODEL; HEAT; VARIABILITY	Previous research has observed that the speed of alpha band oscillations (8-12 Hz range) recorded during resting electroencephalography is slowed in chronic pain patients. While this slowing may reflect pathological changes that occur during the chronification of pain, an alternative explanation is that healthy individuals with slower alpha oscillations are more sensitive to prolonged pain, and by extension, more susceptible to developing chronic pain. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the pain-free, resting alpha oscillation speed of healthy individuals and their sensitivity to two models of prolonged pain, Phasic Heat Pain and Capsaicin Heat Pain, at two visits separated by 8 weeks on average (n = 61 Visit 1, n = 46 Visit 2). We observed that the speed of an individual's pain-free alpha oscillations was negatively correlated with sensitivity to both models and that this relationship was reliable across short (minutes) and long (weeks) timescales. Furthermore, the speed of pain-free alpha oscillations can successfully identify the most pain sensitive individuals, which we validated on data from a separate, independent study. These results suggest that alpha oscillation speed is a reliable biomarker of prolonged pain sensitivity with potential for prospectively identifying pain sensitivity in the clinic.

Recent studies have reported conflicting results on alterations in resting-state functional brain networks in ALS by adopting unimodal techniques that measure either electrophysiological or vascular-hemodynamic neural functions. However, no study to date has explored simultaneous electrical and vascular-hemodynamic changes in the resting-state brain in ALS. Using complementary multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recording and analysis techniques, we explored the underlying multidimensional neural contributions to altered oscillations and functional connectivity in people with ALS. Methods: 10 ALS patients and 9 age-matched controls underwent multimodal EEG-fNIRS recording in the resting state. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and power spectra of both modalities in both groups were analyzed and compared statistically. Results: Increased fronto-parietal EEG connectivity in the alpha and beta bands and increased interhemispheric and right intra-hemispheric fNIRS connectivity in the frontal and prefrontal regions were observed in ALS. Frontal, central, and temporal theta and alpha EEG power decreased in ALS, as did parietal and occipital alpha EEG power, while frontal and parietal hemodynamic spectral power increased in ALS. Significance: These results suggest that electro-vascular disruption in neuronal networks extends to the extra-motor regions in ALS patients, which can ultimately introduce novel neural markers of ALS that can be exploited further as diagnostic and prognostic tools.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; brain&#8211; computer interface; electroencephalography; oscillations; phase; real time; response time; visual perception	BAND OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTS; RHYTHMS; MECHANISM; WAVES; EXCITABILITY; ENTRAINMENT; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION	Electrical brain oscillations reflect fluctuations in neural excitability. Fluctuations in the alpha band (alpha, 8-12 Hz) in the occipito-parietal cortex are thought to regulate sensory responses, leading to cyclic variations in visual perception. Inspired by this theory, some past and recent studies have addressed the relationship between alpha-phase from extra-cranial EEG and behavioural responses to visual stimuli in humans. The latest studies have used offline approaches to confirm alpha-gated cyclic patterns. However, a particularly relevant implication is the possibility to use this principle online, whereby stimuli are time-locked to specific alpha-phases leading to predictable outcomes in performance. Here, we aimed at providing a proof of concept for such real-time neurotechnology. Participants performed a speeded response task to visual targets that were presented upon a real-time estimation of the alpha-phase via an EEG closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI). According to the theory, we predicted a modulation of reaction times (RTs) along the alpha-cycle. Our BCI system achieved reliable trial-to-trial phase locking of stimuli to the phase of individual occipito-parietal alpha-oscillations. Yet, the behavioural results did not support a consistent relation between RTs and the phase of the alpha-cycle neither at group nor at single participant levels. We must conclude that although the alpha-phase might play a role in perceptual decisions from a theoretical perspective, its impact on EEG-based BCI application appears negligible.

Initial studies assessing the neural correlates of mind wandering in the context of meditation practice have identified an important role of theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) neural oscillations. In this study, we use a probe-caught experience sampling paradigm to assess spectral changes in the theta-alpha frequency range during mind wandering in the context of breath focus meditation. Electroencephalography (EEG) was measured in 25 novice meditation practitioners during a breath focus task in which they were repeatedly probed to report whether they were focusing on their breath or thinking about something else. Mind wandering episodes were associated with an increase in the amplitude and a decrease in the frequency of theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations. Conversely, alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz) were shown to decrease in amplitude and increase in frequency during mind wandering relative to breath focus. In addition, mind wandering episodes were shown to be accompanied by increased harmonicity and phase synchrony between alpha and theta rhythms. Because similar spectral changes in the theta-alpha frequency range have been reported during controlled cognitive processes involving memory and executive control, we speculate that mind wandering and controlled processes could share some neurocognitive mechanisms. From a translational perspective, this study indicates that oscillatory activity in the theta-alpha frequency range could form adequate parameters for developing EEG-neurofeedback protocols aimed at facilitating the detection of mind wandering during meditation practice.

The feature extraction of motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) is to find the most effective characteristics of complex EEG signal that can represent the consciousness task, to differentiate the feature vectors extracted from different consciousness tasks, and to maximize the correlation between the feature vector and the consciousness task. On the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous research works, this paper proposes a new EEG feature extraction algorithm based on common spatial pattern (CSP) and adaptive auto-regressive (AAR), and demonstrates feasibility of band energy, sample entropy and order accumulation to be the characteristics of motor imagery classification, and finally compares the classification effects of linear discrimination classifier, common space classifier and Bayesian classifier. The simulation results show that the proposed method and algorithm can effectively extract the features of EEG signals during motor imagery. The research results of this paper provide a reference for the further study of feature extraction of brain-computer interface EEG.

Deep learning methods have been introduced to functional network classification only very recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially focused on a single type of connectivity measure. Methods: We propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived brain connectome in schizophrenia (SZ). To capture complementary aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore combination of various connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics of effective connectivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial directed coherence, and complex network measures of network topology. We design a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of 1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains and dimensions using different fusion strategies. We also consider an extension to dynamic brain connectivity using the recurrent neural networks. Results: Hierarchical latent representations learned by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveals apparent group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform traditional support vector machine classifier. The MDC-CNN with combined connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain CNNs using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of 91.69% with a decision-level fusion. Conclusion: The proposed MDC-CNN by integrating information from diverse brain connectivity descriptors is able to accurately discriminate SZ from HC. Significance: The new framework is potentially useful for developing diagnostic tools for SZ and other disorders.

In our current study we found a high degree of correlation between the modulation index of phase related amplitude changes in the EEG of horses (n = 6 measurements with three different horses, mare and gelding) and their facial expression, measured by the use of the horse grimace scale. Furthermore, the pattern of phase amplitude coupling (PAC) was significantly different between a rest condition and a stress condition in horses. This pilot study paves the way for a possible use of EEG derived PAC as an objective tool for the assessment of animal welfare. Beyond that, the method might be useful to assess welfare aspects in the clinical setting for human patients, as for example in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is another neurovascular imaging technique but low cost, can be performed serially at the bedside, and may be combined with electroencephalography (EEG), which are important advantages compared to fMRI. Combined NIRS-EEG, however, has never been evaluated for the assessment of neurovascular coupling and consciousness in acute brain injury. Methods We explored resting-state oscillations in eight-channel NIRS oxyhemoglobin and eight-channel EEG band-power signals to assess neurovascular coupling, the prerequisite for neurovascular-based imaging detection of consciousness, in patients with acute brain injury in the ICU (n = 9). Conscious neurological patients from step-down units and wards served as controls (n = 14). Unsupervised adaptive mixture-independent component analysis (AMICA) was used to correlate NIRS-EEG data with levels of consciousness and clinical outcome. Results Neurovascular coupling between NIRS oxyhemoglobin (0.07-0.13 Hz) and EEG band-power (1-12 Hz) signals at frontal areas was sensitive and prognostic to changing consciousness levels. AMICA revealed a mixture of five models from EEG data, with the relative probabilities of these models reflecting levels of consciousness over multiple days, although the accuracy was less than 85%. However, when combined with two channels of bilateral frontal neurovascular coupling, weighted k-nearest neighbor classification of AMICA probabilities distinguished unresponsive patients from conscious controls with > 90% accuracy (positive predictive value 93%, false discovery rate 7%) and, additionally, identified patients who subsequently failed to recover consciousness with > 99% accuracy. Discussion We suggest that NIRS-EEG for monitoring of acute brain injury in the ICU is worthy of further exploration. Normalization of neurovascular coupling may herald recovery of consciousness after acute brain injury.

Here, we investigated if a fundamental oscillatory network activity pattern, often related to cognitive control, frontal midline theta (FMT) oscillations, are modulated by steroids hormones, P4 and T. We measured the concentration of P4 and T using salivary enzyme immunoassay and FMT oscillations using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during eyes-open resting-state in 55 healthy women and men. Electrical brain activity was analyzed using Fourier analysis, aperiodic signal fitting, and beamformer source localization. Steroid hormone concentrations and biological sex were used as predictors for scalp and source-estimated amplitude of theta oscillations. Elevated concentrations of P4 predicted increased amplitude of FMT oscillations across both sexes, and no relationship was found with T. The positive correlation with P4 was specific to the frontal midline electrodes and survived correction for the background aperiodic signal of the brain. Using source localization, FMT oscillations were localized to the frontal-parietal network (FPN). Additionally, theta amplitude within the FPN, but not the default mode network, positively correlated with P4 concentration. Our results suggest that P4 concentration modulates brain activity via upregulation of theta oscillations in the FPN.

Beta oscillations in the parietal cortex were found to be associated to crowding, with higher beta amplitude related to better crowding resilience. An open question is whether beta activity directly and selectively modulates crowding. We employed Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) in the beta band (18-Hz), in the alpha band (10-Hz) or in a sham regime, asking whether 18-Hz tACS would selectively improve the perception of crowded stimuli by increasing parietal beta activity. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was measured before and after stimulation to test the influence of tACS on endogenous oscillations. Consistently with our predictions, we found that 18-Hz tACS, as compared to 10-Hz tACS and sham stimulation, reduced crowding. This improvement was found specifically in the contralateral visual hemifield and was accompanied by an increased amplitude of EEG beta oscillations, confirming an effect on endogenous brain rhythms. These results support a causal relationship between parietal beta oscillations and visual crowding and provide new insights into the precise oscillatory mechanisms involved in human vision.

The human corticomuscular system is characterized by beta activity and is readily probed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS inputs arriving at the excitable phase of beta oscillations in the motor cortex are known to lead to muscle responses of greater amplitude. Here we explore two other possible manifestations of rhythmic excitability in the beta band; windows of reduced response variability and shortened latency. We delivered single-pulse TMS to the motor cortex of healthy human volunteers (10 females and 7 males) during electroencephalography recordings made at rest. TMS delivered at a particular phase of the beta oscillation benefited from not only stronger, but also less variable and more rapid transmission, as evidenced by the greater amplitude, lower coefficient of variation, and shorter latency of motor evoked potentials. Thus, inputs aligned to the optimal phase of the beta EEG in the motor cortex enjoy transmission amplitude gain, but may also benefit from less variability and shortened latencies at subsequent synapses. Neuronal phase may therefore impact corticospinal communication.

Abnormal Spontaneous Gamma Power Is Associated With Verbal Learning and Memory Dysfunction in Schizophrenia	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						spontaneous gamma oscillation; resting-state electroencephalography (EEG); schizophrenia; cognitive function; memory; verbal learning; translational biomarker	WORKING-MEMORY; 1ST EPISODE; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; 1ST-EPISODE; COHERENCE; DEFICITS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SYNCHRONIZATION; METAANALYSIS	Background Schizophrenia patients exhibit cognitive deficits across multiple domains, including verbal memory, working memory, and executive function, which substantially contribute to psychosocial disability. Gamma oscillations are associated with a wide range of cognitive operations, and are important for cortico-cortical transmission and the integration of information across neural networks. While previous reports have shown that schizophrenia patients have selective impairments in the ability to support gamma oscillations in response to 40-Hz auditory stimulation, it is unclear if patients show abnormalities in gamma power at rest, or whether resting-state activity in other frequency bands is associated with cognitive functioning in schizophrenia patients. Methods Resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) was assessed over 3 min in 145 healthy comparison subjects and 157 schizophrenia patients. Single-word reading ability was measuredviathe reading subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test-3 (WRAT). Auditory attention and working memory were evaluated using Letter-Number Span and Letter-Number Sequencing. Executive function was assessedviaperseverative responses on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Verbal learning performance was measured using the California Verbal Learning Test second edition (CVLT-II). Results Schizophrenia patients showed normal levels of delta-band power but abnormally elevated EEG power in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. An exploratory correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation of gamma-band power and verbal learning performance in schizophrenia patients. Conclusions Patients with schizophrenia have abnormal resting-state EEG power across multiple frequency bands; gamma-band abnormalities were selectively and negatively associated with impairments in verbal learning. Resting-state gamma-band EEG power may be useful for understanding the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction and developing novel therapeutics in schizophrenia patients.

With a prevalence of 2-4% in adults, DOAs are significant disorders that are currently gaining attention among physicians. The paper describes a simultaneous EEG and fMRI experiment conducted in adult individuals with DOAs (n=10). Both EEG and fMRI data were validated by reproducing well established EEG and fMRI associations. A method for identification of both brain functional areas and EEG rhythms associated with DOAs in shallow sleep was designed. Significant differences between patients and controls were found in delta, theta, and alpha bands during awakening epochs. General linear models of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal have shown the secondary visual cortex and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex to be associated with alpha spectral power fluctuations, and the precuneus with delta spectral power fluctuations, specifically in patients and not in controls. Future EEG-fMRI sleep studies should also consider subject comfort as an important aspect in the experimental design.

Unimanual and Bimanual Reach-and-Grasp Actions Can Be Decoded From Human EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Task analysis; Extraterrestrial measurements; Grasping; Time-domain analysis; Decoding; Muscles; Unimanual reach-and-grasp action; bimanual reach-and-grasp action; movement-related cortical potential; grasp decoding; brain-computer interface; electroencephalogram (EEG)	CORTICAL POTENTIALS; MOTOR IMAGERY; BRAIN; STIMULATION	While most tasks of daily life can be handled through a small number of different grasps, many tasks require the action of both hands. In these bimanual tasks, the second hand has either a supporting role (e.g. for fixating a jar) or a more active role (e.g. grasping a pot on both handles). In this study we attempt to discriminate the neural correlates of unimanual (performed with left and right hand) from bimanual reach-and-grasp actions using the low-frequency time-domain electroencephalogram (EEG). In a self-initiated movement task, 15 healthy participants were asked to perform unimanual (palmar and lateral grasps with left and right hand) and bimanual (double lateral, mixed palmar/lateral) reach-and-grasps on objects of daily life. Using EEG time-domain features in the frequency range of 0.3-3 Hz, we achieved multiclass-classification accuracies of 38.6 +/- 6.6% (7 classes, 17.1% chance level) for a combination of 6 movements and 1 rest condition. The grand average confusion matrix shows highest true positive rates (TPR) for the rest (63%) condition while TPR for the movement classes varied between 33 to 41%. The underlying movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) show significant differences between unimanual (e.g left hand vs. right hand grasps) as well unimanual vs. bimanual conditions which both can be attributed to lateralization effects. We believe that these findings can be exploited and further used for attempts in providing persons with spinal cord injury a form of natural control for bimanual neuroprostheses.

Cerebral Cortical Activity Following Non-invasive Cerebellar Stimulation-a Systematic Review of Combined TMS and EEG Studies	CEREBELLUM			English	Review						Cerebellum; Cerebellarthalamocortical tract; TMS; EEG; Non-invasive brain stimulation; TMS-evoked potentials; Neural oscillations	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS	The cerebellum sends dense projections to both motor and non-motor regions of the cerebral cortex via the cerebellarthalamocortical tract. The integrity of this tract is crucial for healthy motor and cognitive function. This systematic review examines research using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the cerebellum with combined cortical electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the temporal features of cerebellar-cortical connectivity. A detailed discussion of the outcomes and limitations of the studies meeting review criteria is presented. Databases were searched between 1 December 2017 and 6 December 2017, with Scopus alerts current as of 23 July 2019. Of the 407 studies initially identified, 10 met review criteria. Findings suggested that cerebellar-cortical assessment is suited to combined TMS and EEG, although work is required to ensure experimental procedures are optimal for eliciting a reliable cerebellar response from stimulation. A distinct variation in methodologies and outcome measures employed across studies, and small sample sizes limited the conclusions that could be drawn regarding the electrophysiological signatures of cerebellar-cortical communication. This review highlights the need for stringent protocols and methodologies for cerebellar-cortical assessments via combined TMS and EEG. With these in place, combined TMS and EEG will provide a valuable means for exploring cerebellar connectivity with a wide range of cortical sites. Assessments have the potential to aid in the understanding of motor and cognitive function in both healthy and clinical groups, and provide insights into long-range neural communication generally.

Chronic jaw pain attenuates neural oscillations during motor-evoked pain	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Chronic jaw pain; EEG; Neural oscillations; Motor-evoked pain; Motor system	LOW-BACK-PAIN; BETA-BAND ACTIVITY; EEG; ATTENTION; ALPHA; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; MOVEMENTS	Motor- and pain-related processes separately induce a reduction in alpha and beta power. When movement and pain occur simultaneously but are independent of each other, the effects on alpha and beta power are additive. It is not clear whether this additive effect is evident during motor-evoked pain in individuals with chronic pain. We combined highdensity electroencephalography (EEG) with a paradigm in which motor-evoked pain was induced during a jaw force task. Participants with chronic jaw pain and pain-free controls produced jaw force at 2% and 15% of their maximum voluntary contraction. The chronic jaw pain group showed exacerbated motor-evoked pain as force amplitude increased and showed increased motor variability and motor error irrespective of force amplitude. The chronic jaw pain group had an attenuated decrease in power in alpha and lower-beta frequencies in the occipital cortex during the anticipation and experience of motor-evoked pain. Rather than being additive, motor-evoked pain attenuated the modulation of alpha and beta power, and this was most evident in occipital cortex. Our findings provide the first evidence of changes in neural oscillations in the cortex during motor-evoked jaw pain.	[Wang, Wei-en; Ho, Rachel L.

J	Jiang, YC; Cai, X; Zhang, QF				Jiang Yuchen; Cai Xiao; Zhang Qingfang			Theta band (4 similar to 8 Hz) oscillations reflect syllables processing in Chinese spoken word production	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						speech production; syllable; theta band; time-frequency analysis	REPETITION SUPPRESSION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SPEECH PRODUCTION; GAMMA; COMPREHENSION; RESPONSES; MANDARIN; BRAIN; EEG; FREQUENCY	Languages may differ in the proximate units of phonological encoding in spoken word production. It has been demonstrated that syllables are proximate units of phonological encoding in Chinese speech production. Previous studies report that the theta band oscillations has been associated with syllables processing in language comprehension, however, it remains unknown what are the neural oscillations for syllables retrieval in speech production. The present study aims to investigate the neural oscillations of syllables retrieval at the stage of phonological encoding in Chinese spoken word production. We employed a masked priming paradigm and electrophysiological signals were recorded concurrently. In the task, participants were instructed to name pictures with disyllabic words which were preceded by briefly presented and masked prime words. Prime words were syllabically or phonemically related to the first syllable of targets or were unrelated, and the experimental design includes prime type (syllable vs. phoneme), relatedness related vs. unrelated), and repetition (first vs. second). Behavioral data analysis showed a significant triple interaction among prime type, relatedness and repetition. In the first repetition, naming latencies were faster in syllabically related than unrelated condition, whereas latencies were longer in the phonemically related than unrelated condition. Time-frequency analysis also showed a significant interaction between prime type and relatedness in the time window of 300-600 ms after pictures onset. Specifically, theta band power was lower for syllabically related than unrelated while no significant differences between phonemically related and unrelated. Cluster based permutation test showed that, in the first repetition, syllabically related condition elicited lower theta band power than unrelated in the time window of 270-460 ms, while phoneme relatedness produced marginally higher theta band power than phoneme unrelatedness in the 340-390 ms time window. These effects were absent in the second repetition. In sum, we found that syllable priming effect was reflected by the decrease of theta oscillation in spoken word production in Chinese. Time-frequency analysis also revealed an early syllable priming effect, and a late phonemic inhibition effect in Chinese spoken word production, which provides evidence for the proximate units principle.

Methods: Seventeen-year-old male patient with intractable ES underwent chronic subdural electrode implantation for presurgical evaluation. Networks were evaluated in ictal periods using high-frequency oscillation (HFO) analysis and in interictal periods using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and simultaneous electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI). Cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) were recorded to trace connections among the networks. Results: Ictal HFO revealed a network comprising multilobar cortical regions (frontal, parietal, and temporal), but sparing the positive motor area. Interictally, MEG and EEG-fMRI revealed spike-and-wave-related activation in these cortical regions. Analysis of CCEPs provided evidence of connectivity within the cortico-cortical network. Additionally, EEG-fMRI results indicate the involvement of subcortical structures, such as bilateral thalamus (predominantly right) and midbrain. Conclusions: In this case study, integrated neurophysiological techniques provided converging evidence for the involvement of a cortico-cortical network (sparing the positive motor area) and a cortico-subcortical network in the generation of ES in the patient. Significance: Cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical pathways, with the exception of the direct descending corticospinal pathway from the positive motor area, may play important roles in the generation of ES.

Antidepressants are widely prescribed, but their efficacy relative to placebo is modest, in part because the clinical diagnosis of major depression encompasses biologically heterogeneous conditions. Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.

Two main threads of thought guided Basar's scientific labor: i) the study of brain oscillations and ii) its marriage to basic principles of physics. These two threads provided him with the crucial element to introduce nonlinear random theory into brain research. Until the decade of the seventies, the underling paradigm in studying the electrical activity of the brain was dominated by a simplistic linear systems model that entailed absolute separation between a determinist evoked responses to stimuli and a superimposed background electrical activity considered as "noise". Basar questioned this simplistic linear model and its interpretation. Basar underscored the nonlinear dynamics of the brain, demonstrated for the first time the interaction between evoked and background activity, and widened the study of event-related activity from the time domain to the frequency and time-frequency domain, heralding a new understanding of the event-related dynamics. These advances were a consequence of Basar's fascination with the physics and mathematics of dynamical physical systems which he rightly believed to be the key to understanding the brain. Here we carry out a selected review, based on a scientometric analysis of Basar's scientific trajectory in the field of Brain Dynamics as embodied in 278 peer-reviewed papers. We also report the geographical distribution of Basar's collaborators, distribution of his citations, and his interaction with many international groups. This analysis illustrates the importance of his innovative contributions and the impact it had on our field. It underscores that he is one of the initiators of a "scientific revolution" in neurophysiology: from linear systems to random non-linear systems analysis and the new vision of the brain as a dynamical system.

The impact of task load on the integration of explicit contextual priors and visual information during anticipation	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive load; decision making; electroencephalography (EEG); soccer	WORKING-MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EEG-ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; SOCCER; SKILL; MEANINGFULNESS; ATTENTION; WORKLOAD	There is limited knowledge about the impact of task load on experts' integration of contextual priors and visual information during dynamic and rapidly evolving anticipation tasks. We examined how experts integrate contextual priors--specifically, prior information regarding an opponent's action tendencies--with visual information such as movement kinematics, during a soccer-specific anticipation task. Furthermore, we combined psychophysiological measures and retrospective self-reports to gain insight into the cognitive load associated with this integration. Players were required to predict the action of an oncoming opponent, with and without the explicit provision of contextual priors, under two different task loads. In addition to anticipation performance, we compared continuous electroencephalography (EEG) and self-reports of cognitive load across conditions. Our data provide tentative evidence that increased task load may impair performance by disrupting the integration of contextual priors and visual information. EEG data suggest that cognitive load may increase when contextual priors are explicitly provided, whereas self-report data suggested a decrease in cognitive load. The findings provide insight into the processing demands associated with integration of contextual priors and visual information during dynamic anticipation tasks, and have implications for the utility of priors under cognitively demanding conditions. Furthermore, our findings add to the existing literature, suggesting that continuous EEG may be a more valid measure than retrospective self-reports for in-task assessment of cognitive load.

In our work, we proposed a novel approach to mild depression recognition using electroencephalography (EEG). First, we explored abnormal organization in the functional connectivity network of mild depression using graph theory. Second, we proposed a novel classification model for recognizing mild depression. Considering the powerful ability of CNN to process two-dimensional data, we applied CNN separately to the two-dimensional data form of the functional connectivity matrices from five EEG bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). In addition, inspired by recent breakthroughs in the ability of deep recurrent CNNs to classify mental load, we merged the functional connectivity matrices from the three EEG bands that performed the best into a three-channel image to classify mild depression-related and normal EEG signals using the CNN. The results of the graph theory analysis showed that the brain functional network of the mild depression group had a larger characteristic path length and a lower clustering coefficient than the healthy control group, showing deviation from the small-world network. The proposed classification model obtained a classification accuracy of 80.74% for recognizing mild depression. The current study suggests that the combination of a CNN and functional connectivity matrix may provide a promising objective approach for diagnosing mild depression. Deep learning approaches such as this might have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on psychiatric disorders.

Objective measurement of sleep in mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis	SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS			English	Review						Polysomnography; Electroencephalography; Dementia; Cognitive function; EEG power; Quantitative EEG analysis	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; EEG TOPOGRAPHY ALTERATIONS; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; MIDDLE YEARS; POOR SLEEP; DEMENTIA; MEMORY	Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at-risk of developing dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. While some research suggests that alterations in sleep architecture may mediate cognitive decline, the nature and magnitude of changes to sleep macro- (sleep stages) and micro-architecture (electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations) in MCI is not yet clear. This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse case-control studies objectively measuring sleep in MCI. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase and Psycinfo databases and after review, a total of 10 studies met inclusion criteria. Of these, all reported sleep macro-architecture and four reported micro-architecture outcomes. A combined total of 430 participants (209 with and 221 without MCI) underwent objective sleep assessments in the included full text articles. Findings show that compared to healthy controls, those with MCI have pronounced changes in sleep macro-architecture with greater wake after sleep onset, reduced total sleep time, lower sleep efficiency, longer sleep onset latency, longer rapid eye movement sleep (REM) latency, reduced REM sleep, greater N1 sleep, and worse severity of hypoxemia. Pooling of sleep micro-architecture EEG measures was not possible due to limited studies, however reduced spindles in non-REM sleep and greater EEG slowing in REM sleep were reported.

Recent studies claimed their detectability on the scalp surface. We aimed to investigate the applicability of high-frequency oscillation analysis to routine surface EEG obtained at an epilepsy monitoring unit. Methods:We retrospectively analyzed surface EEGs of 18 patients with focal epilepsy and six controls, recorded during sleep under maximal medication withdrawal. As a proof of principle, the occurrence of motor task-related events during wakefulness was analyzed in a subsample of six patients with seizure- or syncope-related motor symptoms. Ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (>250 Hz) were identified by semi-automatic detection. Using semi-parametric statistics, differences in spontaneous and task-related occurrence rates were examined within subjects and between diagnostic groups considering the factors diagnosis, brain region, ripple type, and task condition. Results:We detected high-frequency oscillations in 17 out of 18 patients and in four out of six controls. Results did not show statistically significant differences in the mean rates of event occurrences, neither regarding the laterality of the epileptic focus, nor with respect to active and inactive task conditions, or the moving hand laterality. Significant differences in general spontaneous incidence [WTS(1) = 9.594;p= 0.005] that indicated higher rates of fast ripples compared to ripples, notably in patients with epilepsy compared to the control group, may be explained by variations in data quality. Conclusion:The current analysis methods are prone to biases. A common agreement on a standard operating procedure is needed to ensure reliable and economic detection of high-frequency oscillations.

Vortioxetine has also been shown to alleviate cognitive symptoms in preclinical studies and in patients with depression. However, it is largely unclear how vortioxetine affects the brain processing in humans. The present study was conducted in 32 healthy males in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, active comparator, four-way crossover design. Treatments were 10 and 20 mg/day vortioxetine, 15 mg/day escitalopram, and placebo, administered orally once daily for three days. Results were compared to placebo. Treatment effect was assessed by recording spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and 40 Hz auditory steady state responses. For the spontaneous EEG, both vortioxetine and escitalopram decreased the frequency content in the theta band (4-8 Hz) and increased power in the beta (12-32 Hz) and gamma (32-45 Hz) bands. Vortioxetine and escitalopram decreased connectivity during rest in the theta band and increased connectivity in the gamma bands. Finally, both treatments caused decreased power in the evoked gamma band in response to 40 Hz auditory stimulation. Although the global EEG changes were comparable between vortioxetine and escitalopram, subtle differences between treatment effects on the EEG in terms of effect size and regional distribution of the EEG changes were apparent. To our knowledge, the current results are the first data on how vortioxetine affects EEG in humans. The present study calls for further investigations addressing the possible electrophysiological and cognitive effects of vortioxetine. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These measurements have an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and iEEG signals have often been used to decode brain activity or drive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). iEEG recordings are typically done for seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients who have these electrodes placed for a clinical purpose: to localize both brain regions that are essential for function and others where seizures start. Brain regions not involved in epilepsy are thought to function normally and provide a unique opportunity to learn about human neurophysiology. Intracranial electrodes measure the aggregate activity of large neuronal populations and recorded signals contain many features. Different features are extracted by analyzing these signals in the time and frequency domain. The time domain may reveal an evoked potential at a particular time after the onset of an event. Decomposition into the frequency domain may show narrowband peaks in the spectrum at specific frequencies or broadband signal changes that span a wide range of frequencies. Broadband power increases are generally observed when a brain region is active while most other features are highly specific to brain regions, inputs, and tasks. Here we describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of several iEEG signals that have often been used to decode brain activity and drive BCIs.

Whereas the primary symptom of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is memory problems greater than normal for age and education, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show impairments in other cognitive domains in addition to memory dysfunction. Resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) studies in physiological aging indicate a global increase in low-frequency oscillations' power and the reduction and slowing of alpha activity. The enhancement of slow and the reduction of fast oscillations, and the disruption of brain functional connectivity, however, are characterized as major rsEEG changes in AD. Recent rodent studies also support human evidence of age- and AD-related changes in resting-state brain oscillations, and the neuroprotective effect of brain stimulation techniques through gamma-band stimulations. Cumulatively, current evidence moves toward optimizing rsEEG features as reliable predictors of people with aMCI at risk for conversion to AD and mapping neural alterations subsequent to brain stimulation therapies. The present paper reviews the latest evidence of changes in rsEEG oscillations in physiological aging, aMCI, and AD, as well as findings of various brain stimulation therapies from both human and non-human studies.

Effectiveness was measured not only with traditional measures, but also with electroencephalography (EEG). Using a within-subjects design, 26 university students viewed three sets of short lectures, each presenting a different set of English vocabulary words and were asked to use a different learning strategy for each set of lectures. Participants' EEG signals were assessed while watching the videos; learning experience (self-reported motivation and engagement) and learning performance (vocabulary recall test score) were assessed after watching the videos. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed that the self-explaining and teaching strategies were more beneficial than the passive viewing strategy, as indicated by higher EEG theta and alpha band power, a more positive learning experience (higher motivation and engagement) and better learning performance. However, whereas the teaching strategy elicited greater neural oscillations related to working memory and attention compared to the self-explanation strategy, the two groups did not differ on self-reported learning experience or learning performance. Our findings are discussed in terms of potential application in courses using video lectures and in terms of their heuristic value for future research on the neural processes that differentiate learning strategies.

Scott			Spectral dissociation of lateralized brain rhythms	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Symmetry; Mu; Alpha; Rhythms; Oscillations; Synchrony; Metastability	COORDINATION DYNAMICS; PRINCIPLES; COMPLEXITY; SYMMETRY	Using high resolution spectral methods to uncover neuromarkers of social, cognitive and behavioral function, we have found that hemi-ateralized pairs of oscillations such as left and right occipital alpha or left and right rolandic mu dissociate spectrally. That is, they show a shifted frequency distribution, with one member of the pair peaking at a slightly lower frequency than the other. Resorting to the analysis of EEG spatio-spectral patterns, we provide examples of dissociations in the 10Hz frequency band. Occasionally, hemi-lateralized pairs blend into medial aggregates, probably when functional interactions lead to strongly coherent dynamics through frequency-locking or metastability. Our observations support the hypothesis that homologous pairs of neuromarkers have characteristically distinct intrinsic frequencies and coordinate their oscillations into synchronous ensembles only transiently. This property could play a role in the balance of integration and segregation in the brain: spectral separation of the oscillations from homologous cortical areas allows them to function independently under certain circumstances, all the while preserving a potential for stronger interactions supported by structural and functional symmetries. Spectral dissociation (and its methodological corollary: spectral analysis with high frequency resolution) may be harnessed to better track the individual power of each member of a hemi-lateralized pair and their respective time-course, leading to enhanced internal validity and reproducibility of research on neural oscillations. Resulting insights may shed light on the functional interaction between homologous cortices in studies of attention (alpha), e.g. during perceptual and social interaction tasks, and in studies of somatomotor processing (mu), e.g. in bimanual coordination and neuroprosthetics.

While other modalities infer brain function indirectly by measuring changes in blood flow, metabolism, and oxygenation, magnetoencephalography measures neuronal and synaptic function directly with submillisecond temporal resolution. The brain's magnetic field is recorded by neuromagnetometers surrounding the head in a helmet-shaped sensor array. Because magnetic signals are not distorted by anatomy, magnetoencephalography allows for a more accurate measurement and localization of brain activities than electroencephalography. Magnetoencephalography has become an indispensable part of the armamentarium at epilepsy centers.

Thus, in an EEG signal, anything other than the desired electrical activity, which is produced due to coordinated electrochemical process, can be considered as unwanted or noise. To make brain dynamics more analyzable, it is necessary to remove noise in the temporal location of interest, as well as to denoise data from a specific spatial location. In this paper, we propose a novel method for noisy EEG analysis with accompanying toolbox which includes adaptive, data-driven noise removal technique based on the improved intersection of confidence interval (ICI)-based algorithm. Next, a local entropy-based method for EEG data analysis was designed and included in the toolbox. As shown in the paper, the relative intersection of confidence interval (RICI) procedure retains the dominant dipole activity projected on electrodes, while the local (short-term) Renyi entropy-based analysis of the EEG representation in the time-frequency domain is efficient in detecting the presence of P300 event-related potential (ERP) at specific electrodes. Namely, the P300 are detected as sharp drop of entropy in the temporal domain that enabled accurate calculation of the index of the noise class for the EEG signals.

J	Seha, SNA; Hatzinakos, D				Seha, Sherif Nagib Abbas; Hatzinakos, Dimitrios			EEG-Based Human Recognition Using Steady-State AEPs and Subject-Unique Spatial Filters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Biometrics (access control); Electroencephalography; Authentication; Steady-state; Visualization; Frequency modulation; Electrodes; Biometric authentication; brainwaves; auditory evoked potentials; canonical correlation analysis; cross-session performance	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PERMANENCE; CEREBRE	In recent years, brainwaves (EEG) have gained increasing attention in the field of biometric authentication because they feature vital advantages being more secure and impossible to replicate. In this paper, a new approach for the EEG-based biometric recognition system is proposed using steady-state Auditory Evoked Potentials (AEPs). This class of modular brainwaves adds extra features to the system like cancelability and two-step authentication. To investigate the biometric potential of AEPs, brainwaves from 40 subjects were recorded while being stimulated by multiple auditory tones modulated at two frequency bands; 40 Hz (m-40) and 80 Hz (m-80). Each subject participated in two sessions on two different days for time-permanence evaluation. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) techniques were adopted here for the rapid estimation of the AEPs using canonical correlation analysis. The energy distribution of the AEPs in different frequency bands represented the subject-unique features. For intra-session setup, correct recognition rates up to 96.46% and equal error rates as low as 0% were achieved using the m-80 stimulation over all the 40 subjects. Moreover, results across different sessions showed high recognition rates (94.5 - 96.5%) and low error rates (2 - 4%) over the same number of subjects. These results show that AEPs carry subject discriminating features allowing the possibility of employing AEPs as a biometric trait.

Study of neural oscillations as assessed by EEG appears to be a promising proposition to understand the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in patients and their first-degree relatives, where disturbances in neural oscillations point towards genetic predisposition. Therefore, present study aims at establishing EEG based biomarkers for early detection and management strategies. Thirty-two patients with schizophrenia, 28 first-degree relatives and 31 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Resting brain activity was recorded using 128-channel electroencephalography. After pre-processing and independent component analysis (ICA), an equivalent current dipole was estimated for each IC. Total of 1551 independent and localizable EEG components across all groups were used in subsequent analysis. Power spectral density and source coherence between IC clusters were computed. Patients and first-degree relatives displayed significantly higher power spectral density (PSD) than HC for all frequency bands in left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) (-7, -26, 8; BA 27). Another region within left deep PHG (-4, -28, 1), however, distinguished patients from first-degree relatives and HC in terms of significantly lower PSD in higher frequency bands. Functional connectivity (FC) was found to be lower in patients and higher in relatives compared to HC between different resting-state network areas. In patients, connectivity was lower compared to first-degree relatives. Altered activity within left PHG and FC of primarily this with other areas in resting-state network can serve as state and trait markers of schizophrenia. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) has been widely used to build BCIs. However, currently developed algorithms do not predict the modulation of SSVEP amplitude, which is known to change as a function of stimulus luminance contrast. In this study, we aim to develop an integrated approach to simultaneously estimate the frequency and contrast-related amplitude modulations of the SSVEP signal. To achieve that, we developed a behavioral task in which human participants focused on a visual flicking target which the luminance contrast can change through time in several ways. SSVEP signals from 16 subjects were then recorded from electrodes placed at the central occipital site using a low-cost, consumer-grade EEG. Our results demonstrate that the filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) performed well in SSVEP frequency recognition, while the support vector regression (SVR) outperformed the other supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting the contrast-dependent amplitude modulations of the SSVEPs. These findings indicate the applicability and strong performance of our integrated method at simultaneously predicting both frequency and amplitude of visually evoked signals, and have proven to be useful for advancing SSVEP-based applications.

Seizure initiation in infantile spasms vs. focal seizures: proposed common cellular mechanisms	REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						electrodecremental response; fast oscillations; intracranial EEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PEDIATRIC CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; EPILEPTIC SPASMS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; WEST SYNDROME; SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS; INTERICTAL DISCHARGES; DEPENDENT MODULATION; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; PLATEAU POTENTIALS	Infantile spasms (IS) and seizures with local onset have different clinical expressions, even when electroencephalography (EEG) associated with IS has some degree of focality. Oddly, identical pathology (with, however, age-dependent expression) can lead to IS in one patient vs. focal seizures in another or even in the same, albeit older, patient. We therefore investigated whether the cellular mechanisms underlying seizure initiation are similar in the two instances: spasms vs. focal. We noted that in-common EEG features can include (i) a background of waves at alpha to delta frequencies; (ii) a period of flattening, lasting about a second or more - the electrodecrement (ED); and (iii) often an interval of very fast oscillations (VFO; similar to 70 Hz or faster) preceding, or at the beginning of, the ED. With IS, VFO temporally coincides with the motor spasm. What is different between the two conditions is this: with IS, the ED reverts to recurring slow waves, as occurring before the ED, whereas with focal seizures the ED instead evolves into an electrographic seizure, containing high-amplitude synchronized bursts, having superimposed VFO. We used in vitro data to help understand these patterns, as such data suggest cellular mechanisms for delta waves, for VFO, for seizure-related burst complexes containing VFO, and, more recently, for the ED. We propose a unifying mechanistic hypothesis - emphasizing the importance of brain pH - to explain the commonalities and differences of EEG signals in IS versus focal seizures.

However, realization of an effective biomarker for spiking behaviour of neural population proves to be an elusive subject matter with its impact evident in highly contrasting results in the literature. In this article, we took an information-theoretic stance on analysis of the EEG time series of the brain activity during hypnotic suggestions, thereby capturing the variability in pattern of brain neural activity in terms of its information content. For this purpose, we utilized differential entropy (DE, i.e., the average information content in a continuous time series) of theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands of fourteen-channel EEG time series recordings that pertain to the brain neural responses of twelve carefully selected high and low hypnotically suggestible individuals. Our results show that the higher hypnotic suggestibility is associated with a significantly lower variability in information content of theta, alpha, and beta frequencies. Moreover, they indicate that such a lower variability is accompanied by a significantly higher functional connectivity (FC, a measure of spatiotemporal synchronization) in the parietal and the parieto-occipital regions in the case of theta and alpha frequency bands and a non-significantly lower FC in the central region's beta frequency band. Our results contribute to the field in two ways. First, they identify the applicability of DE as a unifying measure to reproduce the similar observations that are separately reported through adaptation of different hypnotic biomarkers in the literature. Second, they extend these previous findings that were based on neutral hypnosis (i.e., a hypnotic procedure that involves no specific suggestions other than those for becoming hypnotized) to the case of hypnotic suggestions, thereby identifying their presence as a potential signature of hypnotic experience.

For this purpose, brain responses of the brain to changes in brightness were explored comparatively using different emotional images (pleasant, unpleasant and neutral) with different luminance levels. In the study, electroencephalography recordings from 12 different electrode sites of 31 healthy participants were used. The power spectra obtained from the analysis of the recordings using short time Fourier transform were analyzed, and a statistical analysis was performed on features extracted from these power spectra. Statistical findings were compared with those obtained from behavioral data. The results showed that the brightness of visual stimuli affected the power of brain responses depending on frequency, time and location. According to the statistically verified findings, the increase in the brightness of pleasant and neutral images increased the average power of responses in the parietal and occipital regions whereas the increase in the brightness of unpleasant images decreased the average power of responses in these regions. Moreover, the statistical results obtained for unpleasant images were found to be in accordance with the behavioral data. The results revealed that the brightness of visual stimuli could be represented by changing the activity power of the brain cortex. The findings emphasized that the brightness of visual stimuli should be viewed as an important parameter in studies using emotional image techniques such as image classification, emotion evaluation and neuro-marketing.

The question remains if the pathophysiological background of both factors is also separate at levels of investigation beyond core symptoms. This would allow a clearer understanding and a more focused treatment approach even with tools derived from these levels. Hence, we assumed that an implicit additive diagnostic model also holds at the levels of associated psychopathology, neuropsychological performance and brain oscillations. We investigated this hypothesis using data of 61 boys (7-12 years old) with ADHD and 43 typically developing children. There were no significant differences in age and IQ between groups. Children were examined with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Integrated Visual and Auditory Test (IVA), and brain oscillations during eyes closed resting state. Inattention characteristics were associated with more pronounced internalizing problems, lower attention, and vigilance during IVA performance and at the Electroencephalography level with elevated Theta and diminished Beta power during eyes closed rest. In contrast, hyperactivity/impulsivity characteristics led to general psychopathology problems and showed at the neuropsychological level faster response speed and deficits in cognitive control and performance consistency, but were on the electroencephalography level without any deficits in EEG power. Considering differences in behavioral, neuropsychology, and electroencephalography levels in each subtype, separate clinical approaches should be recommended for them and an additive model for their combination.

The present study aims to test the hypothesis that slow blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) oscillations with frequency components greater than 0.10 Hz result from a central neural pacemaker located in the brain stem. We predict that a central oscillator modulates cardiac beat-to-beat interval (RRI) fluctuations rapidly, with only a short neural lag around 0.3 s. Spontaneous BOLD fluctuations in the brain stem, however, are considerably delayed due to the hemodynamic response time of about similar to 2-3 s. In order to test these predictions, we analyzed the time delay between slow RRI oscillations from thorax and BOLD oscillations in the brain stem by calculating the phase locking value (PLV). Our findings show a significant time delay of 2.2 +/- 0.2 s between RRI and BOLD signals in 12 out of 23 (50%) participants in axial slices of the pons/brain stem. Adding the neural lag of 0.3 s to the observed lag of 2.2 s we obtain 2.5 s, which is the time between neural activity increase and BOLD increase, termed neuro-BOLD coupling. Note, this time window for neuro-BOLD coupling in awake humans is surprisingly of similar size as in awake head-fixed adult mice (Mateo et al., 2017).

The BCI is based on biomarkers derived from spectral properties of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), subsequently classified by a linear discriminant analysis classifier. The BCI was trained on a visual WM task, tested in a real-time visual WM task, and further validated in a real-time cross task (mental arithmetic). Throughout each trial of the cross task, subjects were given real or sham feedback about their WM load. At the end of the trial, subjects were asked whether the feedback provided was real or sham. The high rate of correct answers provided by the subjects validated not only the global behaviour of the WM-load feedback, but also its real-time dynamics. On average, subjects were able to provide a correct answer 82% of the time, with one subject having 100% accuracy. Possible cognitive and motor confounding factors were disentangled to support the claim that our EEG-based markers correspond indeed to WM.

Automatic detection of epileptic events is one of the important subjects that have aroused wide interest from more and more investigators. This paper proposes a new model in classification of multi-category electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using time-frequency image and block texture features. The one-dimensional EEG is first mapped to time-frequency domain by means of short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which is adapted to obtain a two-dimensional time-frequency image (2D-TFI). With the idea of multi-scale blocking, the obtained phase images and amplitude images are divided into several sub-blocks corresponding to different frequency ranges and time periods. Then the texture features are calculated to describe the behaviour of EEG signals. Particularly, a novel quadratic feature selection method based on kernel entropy component analysis (KECA) and Kruskal-Wallis test (KW) has been proposed for dimension reduction, by which the features that contained most distinctive information were provided. Eventually, the optimal KECA-based features are fed to support vector machine (SVM) for deciding the class of corresponding EEG. The proposed model is found to achieve at least 99.30% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity for each of the eight clinical problems. Our scheme is proven to be effective for seizure detection, which can help doctors optimize the diagnosis workflow, reduce workload and improve detection precision.

The features extracted from the method of DMD clearly capture the phase transition of a specific frequency among the channels corresponding to the ictal state and the channel corresponding to the interictal state, such as direct current shift (DC-shift or ictal slow shifts) and high-frequency oscillation (HFO). By performing classification tests with Electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings of one patient measured at different timings, it is shown that the captured phenomenon is the unique pattern that occurs in the ictal onset zone of the patient. We eventually explain how advantageously the DMD captures some specific characteristics to distinguish the ictal state and the interictal state. The method presented in this study allows simultaneous interpretation of changes in the channel correlation and particular information for activity related to an epileptic seizure so that it can be applied to identification and prediction of the ictal state and analysis of the mechanism on its dynamics.

Dynamic analysis of fMRI activation during epileptic spikes can help identify the seizure origin	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						EEG; fibre tractography; fMRI; focal epilepsy; IED variability; source imaging	LOW-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; EEG-FMRI; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; FOCAL EPILEPSY; NETWORKS; TRACTOGRAPHY; COMBINATION; DISCHARGES; MODEL	Objective We use the dynamic electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) method to incorporate variability in the amplitude and field of the interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) into the fMRI analysis. We ask whether IED variability analysis can (a) identify additional activated brain regions during the course of IEDs, not seen in standard analysis; and (b) demonstrate the origin and spread of epileptic activity. We explore whether these functional changes recapitulate the structural connections and propagation of epileptic activity during seizures. Methods Seventeen patients with focal epilepsy and at least 30 IEDs of a single type during simultaneous EEG-fMRI were studied. IED variability and EEG source imaging (ESI) analysis extracted time-varying dynamic changes. General linear modeling (GLM) generated static functional maps. Dynamic maps were compared to static functional maps. The dynamic sequence from IED variability was compared to the ESI results. In a subset of patients, we investigated structural connections between active brain regions using diffusion-based fiber tractography. Results IED variability distinguished the origin of epileptic activity from its propagation in 15 of 17 (88%) patients. This included two cases where no result was obtained from the standard GLM analysis. In both of these cases, IED variability revealed activation in line with the presumed epileptic focus. Two cases showed no result from either method. Both had very high spike rates associated with dysplasia in the postcentral gyrus. In all 15 cases with dynamic activation, the observed dynamics were concordant with ESI. Fiber tractography identified specific white matter pathways between brain regions that were active at IED onset and propagation. Significance Dynamic techniques involving IED variability can provide additional power for EEG-fMRI analysis, compared to standard analysis, revealing additional biologically plausible information in cases with no result from the standard analysis and gives insight into the origin and spread of IEDs.

J	Li, MA; Han, JF; Duan, LJ				Li, Ming-Ai; Han, Jian-Fu; Duan, Li-Juan			A Novel MI-EEG Imaging With the Location Information of Electrodes	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; convolutional neural network; interpolation method; machine learning; MI-EEG imaging method	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; MOTOR IMAGERY	Combination of the Motor Imagery EEG (MI-EEG) imaging and Deep Convolutional Neural Network is a prospective recognition method in brain computer interface. Nowadays, the frequency or time-frequency analysis has been applied to each channel of MI-EEG signal to obtain a spatio-frequency or time-frequency image, and even the images from several channels are infused to generate a combined image. However, the real position information of channels or electrodes is lost in these MI-EEG images, and this is contradictory to the activation area of MI-tasks. In this paper, the MI period and the frequency band covered by mu and beta rhythms are divided into ten time windows and three sub-bands, respectively. Then, for each electrode, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is employed to transform each time window to spectrum, and its inverse FFT is calculated for each sub-band. The time-domain powers of ten time windows are averaged for the same sub-band. So, three average powers are generated as the time-frequency features of each electrode of MI-EEG. They are further arranged to the electrode coordinate figure by using Clough-Tocher interpolation algorithm, and a complicated image, in which the time-frequency features are correctly located at the real position of each electrode, is obtained to embody the MI-EEG in detail. Furthermore, a VGG network is modified to perform effective recognition for MI-EEG image, and it is called mVGG. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, and the 10-folds cross validation accuracies of 88.62%, 92.28% and 96.86% are achieved respectively, and they are higher than that of the state-of-the-art imaging methods. Kappa values and ROC curves demonstrate our method has lower class skew and error costs. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of proposed MI-EEG imaging method, and it is well-matched with mVGG.

The periods of initiation and discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass could be high-risk periods. Certain frontal EEG patterns might plausibly occur with unintended intraoperative awareness. This study sought to quantify the incidence of these pre-specified patterns during cardiac surgery. Methods: Two-channel bihemispheric frontal EEG was recorded in 1072 patients undergoing cardiac surgery as part of a prospective observational study. Spectrograms were created, and mean theta (4-7 Hz) power and peak alpha (7-17 Hz) frequency were measured in patients under general anaesthesia with isoflurane. Emergence-like EEG activity in the spectrogram during surgery was classified as an alpha peak frequency increase by 2 Hz or more, and a theta power decrease by 5 dB or more in comparison with the median pre-bypass values. Results: Data from 1002 patients were available for analysis. Fifty-five of those patients (5.5%) showed emergence-like EEG activity at least once during surgery with a median duration of 13.2 min. These patients were younger (median age, 59 vs 67 yr; P<0.001) and the median end-tidal isoflurane concentration before cardiopulmonary bypass was higher (0.82 vs 0.75 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]; P= 0.013). There was no significant difference between those with or without emergence-like EEG activity in sex, lowest core temperature, or duration of surgery. Forty-six of these EEG changes (84%) occurred within a 1 h time window centred on separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that approximately one in 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a volatile anaesthetic agent have a sustained EEG pattern while surgery is ongoing that is often seen with emergence from general anaesthesia. Monitoring the frontal EEG during cardiopulmonary bypass may identify these events and potentially reduce the incidence of unintended awareness.

Quantile graphs for EEG-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease	PLOS ONE			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE EEG; BIOMARKERS	Known as a degenerative and progressive dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects about 25 million elderly people around the world. This illness results in a decrease in the productivity of people and places limits on their daily lives. Electroencephalography (EEG), in which the electrical brain activity is recorded in the form of time series and analyzed using signal processing techniques, is a well-known neurophysiological AD biomarker. EEG is noninvasive, low-cost, has a high temporal resolution, and provides valuable information about brain dynamics in AD. Here, we present an original approach based on the use of quantile graphs (QGs) for classifying EEG data. QGs map frequency, amplitude, and correlation characteristics of a time series (such as the EEG data of an AD patient) into the topological features of a network. The five topological network metrics used here-clustering coefficient, mean jump length, betweenness centrality, modularity, and Laplacian Estrada index-showed that the QG model can distinguish healthy subjects from AD patients, with open or closed eyes. The QG method also indicates which channels (corresponding to 19 different locations on the patients' scalp) provide the best discriminating power. Furthermore, the joint analysis of delta, theta, alpha, and beta wave results indicate that all AD patients under study display clear symptoms of the disease and may have it in its late stage, a diagnosis known a priori and supported by our study. Results presented here attest to the usefulness of the QG method in analyzing complex, nonlinear signals such as those generated from AD patients by EEGs.	[Pineda, Aruane M.; Campanharo, Andriana S.

However, such functional interactions are likely to involve nonlinear dynamics associated with the two systems. To this extent, in this preliminary study we investigate the functional coupling between multifractal properties of Electroencephalography (EEG) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) series using a channel- and time scale-wise maximal information coefficient analysis. Experimental results were gathered from 24 healthy volunteers undergoing a resting state and a cold-pressure test, and suggest that significant changes between the two experimental conditions might be associated with nonlinear quantifiers of the multifractal spectrum. Particularly, major brain-heart functional coupling was associated with the second-order cumulant of the multifractal spectrum. We conclude that a functional nonlinear relationship between brain- and heartbeat-related multifractal sprectra exist, with higher values associated with the resting state.

However, most of the existing experiments have been concentrated on the coupling strength within frequency bands, while the coupling strength between different bands is ignored. In this work, we apply phase synchronization index (PSI) to investigate the cross-frequency coupling (CFC) of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The PSI matrixes for the multi-channel EEG signals are calculated from interictal to ictal period in each sliding time window. The results show that CFC changes obviously once seizure occurs between the different bands, and such alteration is earlier than the appearance of clinical symptoms in seizure. Considering the similar role of the within-frequency coupling (WFC), we further reconstruct multi-layered brain networks, including CFC networks and WFC networks. The graph metrics are applied to investigate the variation of network structure of the epileptic brain. Significant decreases/increases of the local/global efficiency are found in delta-beta, delta-alpha, theta-alpha and delta-theta bands from the CFC network, while WFC network shows a significant decline in the local efficiency in theta and alpha bands. These findings suggest that CFC may provide a new perspective to observe the alteration of brain structure when seizure occurs, and the investigation of functional connectivity across the full frequency spectrum can give us a deeper understanding of epileptic brains.

As there is no cure for AD, an early diagnosis is essential to slow down the progression of the disease with a proper pharmacological treatment. Electroencephalography (EEG) represents a valid tool for studying AD. EEG signals of AD patients are characterized by a "slowing", meaning the power increases in low frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequency (alpha and beta), compared to normal elderly. The purpose of our study is the computation of the power current density in eight patients, who were diagnosed with MCI at time T0 and mild AD at time T1 (four months later), starting from the brain active source reconstruction. The novelty is that we employed the eLORETA algorithm, unlike the previous studies which used the old version of the algorithm named LORETA. It is also the first longitudinal study which considers such a short time period to explore the evolution of the disease. Five patients out of eight showed an increasing power in delta and theta bands. Seven patients exhibited a lower activation in alpha 1 and beta 2 bands. Finally, six patients revealed a decreased power in alpha 2 and beta 1 bands. These findings are consistent with those reported in literature. On the other hand, the discrepancy of some outcome could be related to a not yet severe stage of the disease. In our opinion, this study could represent a good starting point for more detailed future investigation.

Variations in sensory-motor behavior can be caused by several factors, including changes in cognitive status and intrinsic neural variations in the brain. The correct identification of neural sources of behavioral variations is important for understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of sensory-motor behavior and for practical applications (e.g., the development of a precise brain-computer interface). However, studies on humans that investigate the neural sources of the trial-by-trial variation of the sensory-motor behavior are scarce. In this study, we explored the neural correlates of behavioral variations in smooth pursuit eye movements. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) activity from 15 participants while they performed a smooth pursuit eye movement task, wherein they tracked randomly selected visual motion targets that moved radially from the center of the screen. We isolated neural components that are specific to the trial-by-trial variation of smooth pursuit latency, speed, and direction using a novel multivariate pattern-analysis technique. We found that the phase of the spatially distributed multivariate theta oscillation was correlated with the trial-by-trial variation of pursuit latency and direction. This suggests that the changing patterns of the theta phase across EEG sensors can predict upcoming behavioral variations.

According to two-stage accounts, memory traces are gradually translocated from hippocampus to neocortex during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. Mechanistically, this information transfer is thought to rely on interactions between thalamocortical spindles and hippocampal ripples. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed intracranial and scalp Electroencephalography sleep recordings from pre-surgical epilepsy patients. We first observed a concurrent spindle power increase in hippocampus (HIPP) and neocortex (NC) time-locked to individual hippocampal ripple events. Coherence analysis confirmed elevated levels of hippocampal-neocortical spindle coupling around ripples, with directionality analyses indicating an influence from NC to HIPP. Importantly, these hippocampal-neocortical dynamics were particularly pronounced during long-duration compared to short-duration ripples. Together, our findings reveal a potential mechanism underlying active consolidation, comprising a neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical reactivation loop initiated by the neocortex. This hippocampal-cortical dialogue is mediated by sleep spindles and is enhanced during long-duration hippocampal ripples.

Previous studies have typically used very short recording times to avoid a confound with drowsiness that may occur in longer recordings. The effects of a longer recording have not however been systematically examined. Methods Eyes-closed resting-state EEG activity was recorded in 40 older adult participants (20 healthy older adults and 20 people with MCI). The recording period was a relatively long 6 minutes, divided into two equal 3-minute halves to determine if drowsiness will be more apparent as the recording progresses. The participants also completed standardized neuropsychological tasks that assessed global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and memory (California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition). A spectral analysis was performed on both short (2 seconds) and long (8 seconds) segments in both 3-minute halves. Results No differences in power density for any of the EEG frequency bands were found between the 2 halves of the study for either group. There was little evidence of increased drowsiness in the second half of the study even when frequency resolution was increased with the 8-second segmentation. Theta power density was overall larger for people with MCI compared to healthy older adults. A negative correlation was also observed between theta power and global cognition in healthy older adults. Conclusions The present results indicate that longer resting-state EEG recording can be reliably employed without increased risk of drowsiness.

However, EEG signals are prone to distortion by motion. Compared to adults, infants' motion is both more frequent and less stereotypical yet motion effects on the infant EEG signal are largely undocumented. Here, we present a systematic assessment of naturalistic motion effects on the infant EEG signal. EEG recordings were performed with 14 infants (12 analyzed) who passively watched movies whilst spontaneously producing periods of bodily movement and rest. Each infant produced an average of 38.3 s (SD = 14.7 s) of rest and 18.8 s (SD = 17.9 s) of single motion segments for the final analysis. Five types of infant motions were analyzed: Jaw movements, and Limb movements of the Hand, Arm, Foot, and Leg. Significant movement-related distortions of the EEG signal were detected using cluster-based permutation analysis. This analysis revealed that, relative to resting state, infants' Jaw and Arm movements produced significantincreasesin beta (similar to 15 Hz) power, particularly over peripheral sites. Jaw movements produced more anteriorly located effects than Arm movements, which were most pronounced over posterior parietal and occipital sites. The cluster analysis also revealed trends towarddecreasedpower in the theta and alpha bands observed over central topographies for all motion types. However, given the very limited quantity of infant data in this study, caution is recommended in interpreting these findings before subsequent replications are conducted.

Functional connectivity (FC) aims at capturing how disparate regions of the brain dynamically interact, while graph theory provides tools for the topological characterization of the reconstructed functional networks. Although numerous studies investigated how FC is altered in response to increased working memory (WM) demand, current results are still contradictory as few studies confirmed the robustness of these findings in a low-density setting. Methods In this study, we utilized the n-back WM paradigm, in which subjects were presented stimuli (single digits) sequentially, and their task was to decide for each given stimulus if it matched the one presented n-times earlier. Electroencephalography recordings were performed under a control (0-back) and two task conditions of varying difficulty (2- and 3-back). We captured the characteristic connectivity patterns for each difficulty level by performing FC analysis and described the reconstructed functional networks with various graph theoretical measures. Results We found a substantial decrease in FC when transitioning from the 0- to the 2- or 3-back conditions, however, no differences relating to task difficulty were identified. The observed changes in brain network topology could be attributed to the dissociation of two (frontal and occipitotemporal) functional modules that were only present during the control condition. Furthermore, behavioral and performance measures showed both positive and negative correlations to connectivity indices, although only in the higher frequency bands. Conclusion The marked decrease in FC may be due to temporarily abandoned connections that are redundant or irrelevant in solving the specific task. Our results indicate that FC analysis is a robust tool for investigating the response of the brain to increased cognitive workload.

This paper proposes a novel automatic epileptic EEG classification approach based on differential entropy and attention mechanism, aiming at designing a short-term epileptic EEG classification model with high accuracy and good generalization performance. Firstly, the original EEG recordings are decomposed into five sub-frequency bands which approximately obey the Gaussian distribution. Afterward, a improved attention model framework considering both row and column attention with a shallower VGGNet (AttVGGNet-RC) is put forward as the classifier. Finally, non-patient specific method is employed to evaluate the performance with pre-tuned hypermeters. With 8-fold data, the proposed model yielded 77.33 +/- 2.91% sensitivity, 86.67 +/- 3.70% specificity and 82.00 +/- 1.43% accuracy, and accuracy was increased by 5.34%, 8.99%, 26.24% and 4.47% respectively compared with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). With 10-fold shuffled data, the improved attention model yielded 93.84 +/- 0.63% sensitivity, 95.84 +/- 0.74% specificity and 95.12 +/- 0.20% accuracy, and the accuracy was 1.34%, 16.29%, 27.12% and 8.24% higher than MLP, ELM, SVM and LSTM respectively. The experimental result showed that the attention model achieved high classification accuracy with low standard deviation as well as good generalization performance. Furthermore, compared with state-of-art epilepsy analysis system, the proposed approach also show better performance. Therefore, this study has significant clinical application value in epilepsy analysis.

However, this variation in power is frequently obtained through frequency filtering and power estimation using the Fourier analysis. This paper explores the decomposition of the brain rhythms based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition, as an alternative for the analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, due to its adaptive capability to the local oscillations of the data, showcasing it as a viable tool for future BMI algorithms based on motor related events.

Predictive regression modeling with MEG/EEG: from source power to signals and cognitive states	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG/EEG; Neuronal oscillations; Machine learning; Covariance; Spatial filters; Riemannian geometry	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CROSS-VALIDATION; LINEAR-MODELS; EEG; MEG; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION	Predicting biomedical outcomes from Magnetoencephalography and Electroencephalography (M/EEG) is central to applications like decoding, brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) or biomarker development and is facilitated by supervised machine learning. Yet, most of the literature is concerned with classification of outcomes defined at the event-level. Here, we focus on predicting continuous outcomes from M/EEG signal defined at the subjectlevel, and analyze about 600 MEG recordings from Cam-CAN dataset and about 1000 EEG recordings from TUH dataset. Considering different generative mechanisms for M/EEG signals and the biomedical outcome, we propose statistically-consistent predictive models that avoid source-reconstruction based on the covariance as representation. Our mathematical analysis and ground-truth simulations demonstrated that consistent function approximation can be obtained with supervised spatial filtering or by embedding with Riemannian geometry. Additional simulations revealed that Riemannian methods were more robust to model violations, in particular geometric distortions induced by individual anatomy. To estimate the relative contribution of brain dynamics and anatomy to prediction performance, we propose a novel model inspection procedure based on biophysical forward modeling. Applied to prediction of outcomes at the subject-level, the analysis revealed that the Riemannian model better exploited anatomical information while sensitivity to brain dynamics was similar across methods. We then probed the robustness of the models across different data cleaning options. Environmental denoising was globally important but Riemannian models were strikingly robust and continued performing well even without preprocessing. Our results suggest each method has its niche: supervised spatial filtering is practical for eventlevel prediction while the Riemannian model may enable simple end-to-end learning.

Using electroencephalography, we presently measured neural oscillatory rhythms of the human brain in response to various emotional images from the International Affective Picture System. We found that an oscillation frequency in the alpha-to-beta band (8-30 Hz) became higher over the parietal cortex when participants viewed emotionally-arousing than non-arousing pictures. This modulation of neural rhythms was also observed in a valence dimension; emotionally-negative pictures induced faster neural rhythm than emotionally-positive pictures. Those results were consistent with previous studies reporting a speeded perception of high-arousing and negative stimuli (e.g. snakes and spiders) and further provided neural evidence for an adaptive function of emotion to accelerate the processing of potentially-dangerous stimuli.

Many previous studies have used tactile stimulation to conduct psychological and psychophysiological experiments. However, most of these studies used solid material, not water stream, as an experimental stimulus. To investigate water perception, or to easily control the temperature of an experimental stimulus, it is important to be able to control the water stimulus. In this study, we investigated the usability of water as an experimental stimulus for electroencephalography (EEG) experiments and report the basic EEG response to water stimulus. We developed a tactile stimulation device using a water stream to study EEG responses, with the ability to control the stimulus onset timing. As stimuli, we selected two types of water stream, normal and soft, based on a psychological experiment to confirm a difference of subjective feeling induced by these water streams. We conducted a typical oddball task using the two different water streams and recorded EEG waveforms from 64 electrodes while participants touched the water streams. We calculated P300 at the Pz electrode, alpha asymmetry at the frontal electrodes, and alpha suppression at the parietal area. As a result, we observed typical P300 differentiation based on the stimulus proportion (target 20% and standard 80%). We observed a weaker alpha suppression when participants touched the soft water stream compared to the normal shower. These results demonstrate the usability of water stream in psychophysiological studies and suggested that alpha suppression could be a candidate to evaluate comfort of water stream.

To investigate the population-level interactions underlying these changes, we implemented a thalamocortical model (TCM) capable of recapitulating broadband spectral responses. Compared with an existing cortexonly 4-population model, Bayesian Model Selection preferred the TCM. The model was able to accurately and significantly recapitulate ketamine-induced reductions in alpha amplitude and increases in gamma amplitude. Parameter analysis revealed no change in receptor time-constants but significant increases in select synaptic connectivity with ketamine. Significantly increased connections included both AMPA and NMDA mediated connections from layer 2/3 superficial pyramidal cells to inhibitory interneurons and both GABA A and NMDA mediated within-population gain control of layer 5 pyramidal cells.

Aging leads to changes in oscillatory and hemodynamic brain activity and impairments in motor control. However, the relationship between age-related changes in motor control and brain activity is not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate age-related and task-complexity-related changes in grip force control and the underlying oscillatory and hemodynamic activity. Sixteen younger [age (mean +/- SD) = 25.4 +/- 1.9, 20-30 years] and 16 older (age = 56.7 +/- 4.7, 50-70 years) healthy men were asked to use a power grip to perform six trials each of easy and complex force tracking tasks (FTTs) with their right dominant hand in a randomized within-subject design. Grip force control was assessed using a sensor-based device. Brain activity in premotor and primary motor areas of both hemispheres was assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Older adults showed significantly higher inaccuracies and higher hemodynamic activity in both FTTs than did young adults. Correlations between grip force control owing to task complexity and beta activity were different in the contralateral premotor cortex (PMC) between younger and older adults. Collectively, these findings suggest that aging leads to impairment of grip force control and an increase in hemodynamic activity independent of task complexity. EEG beta oscillations may represent a task-specific neurophysiological marker for age-related decline in complex grip force control and its underlying compensation strategies. Further EEG-fNIRS studies are necessary to determine neurophysiological markers of dysfunctions underlying age-related motor disabilities for the improvement of individual diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.

Neurophysiologic Characterization of Resting State Connectivity Abnormalities in Schizophrenia Patients	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						resting-state electroencephalography (EEG); effective connectivity; schizophrenia; source level analysis; biomarker; temporal cortex; frontal cortex	GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BAND CONNECTIVITY; HIGH-RISK; EEG; RELEVANCE; SYNCHRONY; MEMORY	Background: Patients with schizophrenia show abnormal spontaneous oscillatory activity in scalp-level electroencephalographic (EEG) responses across multiple frequency bands. While oscillations play an essential role in the transmission of information across neural networks, few studies have assessed the frequency-specific dynamics across cortical source networks at rest. Identification of the neural sources and their dynamic interactions may improve our understanding of core pathophysiologic abnormalities associated with the neuropsychiatric disorders. Methods: A novel multivector autoregressive modeling approach for assessing effective connectivity among cortical sources was developed and applied to resting-state EEG recordings obtained from n = 139 schizophrenia patients and n = 126 healthy comparison subjects. Results: Two primary abnormalities in resting-state networks were detected in schizophrenia patients. The first network involved the middle frontal and fusiform gyri and a region near the calcarine sulcus. The second network involved the cingulate gyrus and the Rolandic operculum (a region that includes the auditory cortex). Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients show widespread patterns of hyper-connectivity across a distributed network of the frontal, temporal, and occipital brain regions. Results highlight a novel approach for characterizing alterations in connectivity in the neuropsychiatric patient populations. Further mechanistic characterization of network functioning is needed to clarify the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases.

Potential treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have not been exploited, in part because of the variability in behavioral response. This can be overcome with the use of response biomarkers. It has been however shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can the relieve positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). This exploratory work aims to establish a quantitative methodological tool, based on high-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG) data analysis, to assess the effect of rTMS on patients with schizophrenia and AVH. Ten schizophrenia patients with drug-resistant AVH were divided into two groups: the treatment group (TG) received 1 Hz rTMS treatment during 10 daily sessions (900 pulses/session) over the left T3-P3 International 10-20 location. The control group (CG) received rTMS treatment over the Cz (vertex) EEG location. We used the P300 oddball auditory paradigm, known for its reduced amplitude in schizophrenia with AVH, and recorded high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG, 256 channels), twice for each patient: pre-rTMS and 1 week post-rTMS treatment. The use of HD-EEG enabled the analysis of the data in the time domain, but also in the frequency and source-space connectivity domains. The HD-EEG data were linked with the clinical outcome derived from the auditory hallucinations subscale (AHS) of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS), the Quality of Life Scale (QoLS), and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). The general results show a variability between subjects, independent of the group they belong to. The time domain showed a higher N1-P3 amplitude post-rTMS, the frequency domain a higher power spectral density (PSD) in the alpha and beta bands, and the connectivity analysis revealed a higher brain network integration (quantified using the participation coefficient) in the beta band. Despite the small number of subjects and the high variability of the results, this work shows a robust data analysis and an interplay between morphology, spectral, and connectivity data. The identification of a trend post-rTMS for each domain in our results is a first step toward the definition of quantitative neurophysiological parameters to assess rTMS treatment.

Recently physiological signals are used to recognize personality traits in response to emotional videos, but gives good accuracies only for few traits. In this study, personality traits are statistically analyzed and recognized using physiological signals (electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and photoplethysmogram (PPG)) in response to public speaking. The proposed framework consists of data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification stages. The subject is labeled into two classes of each personality trait based on the mean value of big five personality trait questionnaire score. The physiological signals of twenty-eight participants are recorded while performing a public speaking task in front of a real audience. These signals are statistically analyzed to examine the behavior of different personality traits. Time domain features from GSR and PPG data and frequency domain features from EEG data are extracted. A wrapper based method for feature selection is applied to select an optimum set of features from each modality, which are then fused for personality trait recognition. An average F1-score of 0.86, 0.96, 0.64, 0.75, and 0.86 is achieved by the proposed framework for openness to experience, extroversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness traits respectively. It is observed that the personality trait recognition using physiological signals in response to public speaking task outperforms the existing methods.

Early prediction of seizure onsets is of great significance for the safety of intractable epilepsy patients. This work aims to develop a reliable and accurate method for patient-specific seizure prediction based on scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs). Local fractal spectrum, relative band energy, and synchronization modularity features are used to reveal the characteristics of multi-channel EEG in perspectives of time domain, frequency domain, and functional connectivity, respectively. A novel framework, named multi-view convolutional gated recurrent network (Mv-CGRN), is proposed to comprehensively analyze the spatio-temporal sequences of multi-view features and capture the potential variations preceding the impending seizure. Moreover, an attention mechanism is embedded in Mv-CGRN to determine the optimal feature combinations for each patient by adaptively tuning the weight parameters. The proposed system achieves an average sensitivity of 94.50% and an average false positive rate (FPR) of 0.118/h on CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, using the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). Our work shows a promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art works in the same filed.

Characterizing gait-related artifacts in mobile EEG recordings	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						artifact; gait; MoBI; mobile EEG	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN; HEAD; CORTEX; MOTOR; MOVEMENTS; REMOVAL; RHYTHMS; ORIGIN	Brain activity during natural walking outdoors can be captured using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG recorded during gait is confounded with artifacts from various sources, possibly obstructing the interpretation of brain activity patterns. Currently, there is no consensus on how the amount of artifact present in these recordings should be quantified, or is there a systematic description of gait artifact properties. In the current study, we expand several features into a seven-dimensional footprint of gait-related artifacts, combining features of time, time-frequency, spatial, and source domains. EEG ofN = 26 participants was recorded while standing and walking outdoors. Footprints of gait-related artifacts before and after two different artifact attenuation strategies (after artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) and after subsequent independent component analysis [ICA]) were systematically different. We also evaluated topographies, morphologies, and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of button-press event-related potentials (ERP) before and after artifact handling, to confirm gait-artifact reduction specificity. Morphologies and SNR remained unchanged after artifact attenuation, whereas topographies improved in quality. Our results show that the footprint can provide a detailed assessment of gait-related artifacts and can be used to estimate the sensitivity of different artifact reduction strategies. Moreover, the analysis of button-press ERPs demonstrated its specificity, as processing did not only reduce gait-related artifacts but ERPs of interest remained largely unchanged. We conclude that the proposed footprint is well suited to characterize individual differences in gait-related artifact extent. In the future, it could be used to compare and optimize recording setups and processing pipelines comprehensively.

Herein, we assessed high-frequency oscillations in the ripple band in patients with ASE and typical absence seizures. Methods: We enrolled five patients with ASE, 26 patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and 15 patients with juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE). We performed time-frequency analysis of electroencephalogram data for ictal absence seizures at each electrode to assess the high frequency activity (HFA) rate, peak frequency, and peak power. Results: The average HFA rates were 60.7%, 20.8%, and 12.9% in ASE, CAE, and JAE patients, respectively. The average peak frequencies were 126.4 Hz, 120.9 Hz, and 126.1 Hz in ASE, CAE, and JAE patients, respectively. The average peak power values were 2,388.8 mu V-2, 120.9 mu V-2, and 126.1 mu V-2 in ASE, CAE, and JAE patients, respectively, and all epilepsy groups exhibited frontal-dominant ripple distribution. Conclusion: ASE patients presented higher power and frontal dominant ripples of absence seizure, compared to CAE and JAE patients. Significance: Future studies should utilize scalp-recorded ripples as a biomarker of absence epilepsy. This may aid in the development of novel treatment strategies for ASE.

Evidence suggests that the neural mechanism underlying this ability is the phase alignment of endogenous oscillations to the external stimulus, allowing for the prediction of upcoming events (i.e., dynamic attending). Relatedly, individuals with dyslexia may have deficits in the entrainment of neural oscillations to external stimuli, especially at low frequencies. The current experiment investigated rhythmic processing in adults with dyslexia and matched controls. Regular and irregular rhythms were presented to participants while electroencephalography was recorded. Regular rhythms contained the beat at 2 Hz; while acoustic energy was maximal at 4 Hz and 8 Hz. These stimuli allowed us to investigate whether the brain responds non-linearly to the beat-level of a rhythmic stimulus, and whether beat-based processing differs between dyslexic and control participants. Both groups showed enhanced stimulus-brain coherence for regular compared to irregular rhythms at the frequencies of interest, with an overrepresentation of the beat-level in the brain compared to the acoustic signal. In addition, we found evidence that controls extracted subtle temporal regularities from irregular stimuli, whereas dyslexics did not. Findings are discussed in relation to dynamic attending theory and rhythmic processing deficits in dyslexia.

With EEG, sleep depth is measured by appearance and an increase in slow wave activity (scalp-SWA). EEG slow waves (scalp-SW) are the manifestation of underlying synchronous membrane potential transitions between silent (DOWN) and active (UP) states. This bistable periodic rhythm is defined as slow oscillation (SO). During its 'silent state' cortical neurons are hyperpolarized and appear inactive, while during its 'active state' cortical neurons are depolarized, fire spikes and exhibit continuous synaptic activity, excitatory and inhibitory. In adults, data from high-density EEG revealed that scalp-SW propagate across the cortical mantle in complex patterns. However, scalp-SW propagation undergoes modifications across development. We present novel data from children, indicating that scalp-SW originate centro-parietally, and emerge more frontally by adolescence. In accordance with the concept that SO and SW could actively modify neuronal connectivity, we discuss whether they fulfill a key purpose in brain development by actively conveying modifications of the maturing brain.

The degree of prematurity affects functional brain activity in preterm born children at school-age: An EEG study	EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Power spectrum; Functional connectivity; Network analysis; Prematurity; Children	MINIMUM SPANNING TREE; PHASE-LAG INDEX; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; BIRTH; METAANALYSIS; INTEGRATION; FREQUENCY; NETWORKS; OUTCOMES	Prematurely born children are at higher risk for long-term adverse motor and cognitive outcomes. The aim of this paper was to compare quantitative measures derived from electroencephalography (EEG) between extremely (EP) and very prematurely (VP) born children at 9-10 years of age. Fifty-five children born < 32 weeks' of gestation underwent EEG at 9-10 years of age and were assessed for motor development and cognitive outcome. Relative frequency power and functional connectivity, as measured by the Phase Lag Index (PLI), were calculated for all frequency bands. Per subject, power spectrum and functional connectivity results were averaged over all channels and pairwise PLI values to explore differences in global frequency power and functional connectivity between EP and VP children. Brain networks were constructed for the upper alpha frequency band using the Minimum Spanning Tree method and were compared between EP and VP children. In addition, the relationships between upper alpha quantitative EEG results and cognitive and motor outcomes were investigated. Relative power and functional connectivity were significantly higher in VP than EP children in the upper alpha frequency band, and VP children had more integrated networks. A strong positive correlation was found between relative upper alpha power and motor outcome whilst controlling for gestational age, age during EEG recording, and gender (p = 0.493, p = 0.004). These results suggest that 9-10 years after birth, the effects of the degree of prematurity can be observed in terms of alterations in functional brain activity and that motor deficits are associated with decreases in relative upper alpha power.

Characteristic of Mayer Waves in Electrophysiological, Hemodynamic and Vascular Signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Mayer waves; neurovascular coupling; oxygenated and reduced hemoglobin; adaptive approximations; matching pursuit	BLOOD-PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; LOW-FREQUENCY; 0.1 HZ; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; RESTING SUBJECTS; OSCILLATIONS; BAROREFLEX; RATS	We evaluated the properties of oscillations in the Mayer waves (MW) frequency range (similar to 0.1Hz) detected in blood pressure, heart rate variability, cerebral blood oxygenation changes and evolution of electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms to elucidate the mechanisms of MW generation. We examined the persistence of MW in different signals and stability of their oscillations on the level of individual MW waveforms, which was achieved by applying matching pursuit (MP). MP yields adaptive time-frequency approximation of signal's structures in terms of frequency, amplitude, time occurrence, and time-span. The number of waveforms contributing to 95% of the energy of the signals was vastly different for the time series, but the average number of waveforms conforming to the MW criteria was almost the same (3.5 +/- 0.4 per 120 s epoch). In all the investigated signals, MW had the same distributions of frequency and the number of cycles. We show that the MW energy ratios in different signals varied strongly, p < 0.001. The highest percentage of MW energy was observed in blood pressure signals, heart rate variability, and reduced hemoglobin, in contrast to brain signals and oxygenated hemoglobin. The percentage of MW energy was related to the strength of causal influence exerted by them on the other signals. Our results indicate existence of a common mechanism of MW generation and support the hypothesis of MW generation in the baroreflex loop; however, they do not exclude the action of a central pacemaker.

Methods:TFA was performed on IED (spikes, spike waves, and polyspike waves) recorded by high-density-EEG (HD-EEG) in 19 refractory focal epileptic children. Temporal modulations related to IEDs were analyzed in a time window around the IED peaks [-1,000 to 1,000 ms]. Spatial modulations were analyzed by ESL in the time-frequency and time domains. Results:IED were associated with complex power spectral modulations. We observed increases in power spectrum (IPS) patterns specific to IED type. For spikes, the TFA pattern consisted of an IPS (-100 to +100 ms, 4-50 Hz). For spike waves, the IPS was followed by a second IPS (+100 to +400 ms, 4-10 Hz), corresponding to the slow wave. IPS patterns were preceded (-400 to -100 ms, 4-40 Hz), and followed (+100 to +400 ms) by a decrease in the power spectrum (DPS) (n= 8). For 14 out of 19 patients, at least one ESL method was concordant with the epileptogenic area. For the remaining five patients, all of them had temporal epilepsies. ESL in the time-frequency domain (DPS/IPS) provided concordant (n= 6) or complementary (n= 4) information to the ESL in the time domain concerning the epileptogenic zone. ESL in time-frequency domain (DPS/IPS) was the only method to provide concordant information concerning the epileptogenic zone in three patients. Significance:TFA demonstrates complex time-frequency modulations of the neuronal networks around IED, suggesting that the pathological mechanisms are initiated well before onset of the classical hyper-synchronization of the IED. Combining time and time-frequency analysis of the ESL provides complementary information to define the epileptogenic zone in refractory focal epilepsy.

Methods:We used the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) to assess schizotypal traits, and examined the correlation between these traits and resting EEG frontal asymmetry (left-right) in 52 college students, as well as the reliability of this correlation over a three-month interval. Results:A higher total score on the SPQ was correlated with reduced asymmetry in different frequency bands: gamma and beta2 frequency bands at baseline, and delta and alpha frequency bands three months later. Additionally, the reduced left relative to right frontal gamma and beta2 asymmetry was correlated with the participants' verbal fluency ability. However, this correlation was no longer statistically significant after the total SPQ score was controlled. Conclusions:These findings suggest that resting frontal EEG asymmetry is correlated with powers in different frequency bands, and may be an endophenotype for schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

J	Follis, JL; Lai, DJ				Follis, Jack L.; Lai, Dejian			Variability analysis of epileptic EEG using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform	HEALTH INFORMATION SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						EEG; Epilepsy; Kruskal-Wallis test; Wavelet transformation; Whitcher test	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TIME-SERIES; CLASSIFICATION; VARIANCE; SEIZURES	Purpose To determine if there is a difference in the wavelet variances of seizure and non-seizure channels in the EEG of an epileptic subject. Methods A six-level decomposition was applied using the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT). The wavelet variance and 95% CIs were calculated for each level of the decomposition. The number of changes in variance for each level were found using a change-point detection method of Whitcher. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine if there were differences in the median number of change points within channels and across frequency bands (levels). Results No distinctive pattern was found for the wavelet variances to differentiate the seizure and non-seizure channels. The seizure channels tended to have lower variances for each level and overall, but this pattern only held for one of the three seizure channels (RAST4). The median number of change points did not differ between the seizure and non-seizure channels either within each channel or across the frequency bands.

Within this framework, even neuroscience could be a valuable discipline to explore UX. For the first time, in the present work, some distinguishing effects of domotics on users' cognitive and emotional behavior are highlighted by using the neuroscientific approach. In order to define possible effects of a smart home system (SHS) on UX, a neuroscientific multimethodology was adopted with the purpose of recording and confronting the neural activity (electroencephalography, EEG) and autonomic system responses of 19 individuals during a resting state (RS) baseline and the exploration of five different tech-interaction areas in a domotic environment. EEG findings showed a generalized neural activation reflected by alpha band activity while participants were exploring the tech areas confronted with the RS. The delta band was mainly present in temporo-central compared to frontal and parieto-occipital areas and was interpreted as a higher emotional activation related to the whole UX. This effect was found for the sixth tech-interaction area (i.e., bedroom) compared to the RS, and it is supposed to represent an enhanced emotional response and integration processing toward a higher multisensory interactive area. Regarding autonomic activity, an increase in heart rate (HR) was found for the bedroom area compared to the RS, thus showing a specific effect on physiological indices in this engaging tech area. The present research constitutes the first attempt to understand the user responsiveness to SHS, in terms of cognitive and emotional engagement, by adopting a neuroscientific perspective. Some high-value benefits derived from this approach will be described in light of the neurophysiological results.

In this regard, it is important to assess the balance between self-assessment of emotional memories and their reflection in brain activity. The study was aimed at exploring the brain activity using electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis in six frequency ranges from delta to beta2 during the retrieval of positive or negative emotional memory compared with the resting state. According to ANOVA results, the most informative for differentiation of emotions were the alpha2 and beta2 rhythms with greater synchronization effect for positive than for negative emotions. The memory retrieval, regardless of the valence of emotions, was accompanied by alpha1 desynchronization at the posterior cortex. Self-assessment of the memory intensity was not significantly different due to emotion valences. However, the scores of positive emotions were related positively with beta2 oscillations at the left anterior temporal site, whereas for negative emotions, at the right one. Thus, the emotional autobiographical memory is reflected by activation processes in the visual cortex and areas associated with multimodal information processing, whereas differentiation of the valence of emotions is presented by the high-frequency oscillations at the temporal cortex areas.

It is used in everyday activities, such as driving a motorcycle, driving a car and playing a game. The effect of this process can be compared to the red traffic light in the real world. In this study, we investigated brain connectivity under human inhibitory control using the phase lag index and inter-trial coherence (ITC). The human brain connectivity gives a more accurate representation of the functional neural network. Results of electroencephalography (EEG), the data sets were generated from twelve healthy subjects during left and right hand inhibitions using the auditory stop-signal task, showed that the inter-trial coherence in delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) band powers increased over the frontal and temporal lobe of the brain. These EEG delta and theta band activities neural markers have been related to human inhibition in the frontal lobe. In addition, inter-trial coherence in the delta-theta and alpha (8-12 Hz) band powers increased at the occipital lobe through visual stimulation. Moreover, the highest brain connectivity was observed under inhibitory control in the frontal lobe between F3-F4 channels compared to temporal and occipital lobes. The greater EEG coherence and phase lag index in the frontal lobe is associated with the human response inhibition. These findings revealed new insights to understand the neural network of brain connectivity and underlying mechanisms during human response inhibition.

Yet, connections between neurophysiology and cognitive theoretical frameworks have rarely been established. The theory of event coding (TEC) details how perceptions and actions are associated (bound) in a common representational domain (the "event file"), but the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these processes are hardly understood. We used complementary neurophysiological methods to examine the neurophysiology of event file processing (i.e., event-related potentials [ERPs], temporal EEG signal decomposition, EEG source localization, time-frequency decomposition, EEG network analysis). We show that the P3 ERP component and activity modulations in inferior parietal regions (BA40) reflect event file binding processes. The relevance of this parietal region is corroborated by source localization of temporally decomposed EEG data. We also show that temporal EEG signal decomposition reveals a pattern of results suggesting that event file processes can be dissociated from pure stimulus and response-related processes in the EEG signal. Importantly, it is also documented that event file binding processes are reflected by modulations in the network architecture of theta frequency band activity. That is, when stimulus-response bindings in event files hamper response selection this was associated with a less efficient theta network organization. A more efficient organization was evident when stimulus-response binding in event files facilitated response selection. Small-world network measures seem to reflect event file processing. The results show how cognitive-theoretical assumptions of TEC can directly be mapped to the neurophysiology of response selection.

EEG Correlates of Eysenck's Personality Traits in Young Male Athletes	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						EEG; personality traits; prefrontal cortex; psychoticism; extraversion; neuroticism; social desirability; non-invasive method	ANXIETY; BRAIN; CORTEX	The article presents the study of the relationship of oscillations of electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms on the data of personality traits of young athletes (N = 17) aged 17 to 21. EEG recorded by a single-channel wireless EEG system with dry non-contact EEG electrodes designed by NeuroSky with the ThinkGear module and the MindCap XL headband in the prefrontal cortex. Personality traits were determined by the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ): Psychoticism, Extraversion, and Neuroticism. Lie (Social Desirability) were also used. A linear regression model was used to analyze EEG rhythms as predictor for Eysenck's personality traits. The findings of the study highlighted two EEG rhythms that are predictors for personality traits: theta wave for neuroticism with negative slope (t = -2.35, R-2 = 0.269, p <= 0.033), which could be related to inhibition, and gamma wave for social desirability with negative slope (t = -2.46, R-2 = 0.287, p <= 0.027), which could be related to the independence of footballers' decision-making. The revealed EEG patterns could cause the preference of certain behavioral strategies in sport. Furthermore, statistically significant relationship between theta wave with neuroticism indicate that they may be influenced by emotion-generating brain structures. Thus, EEG oscillators in the young footballers' prefrontal cortex are selectively sensitive to the psychological traits by Eysenck. Theta rhythm was the predictor of neuroticism, which could be related to defensive inhibition among young footballers. Gamma rhythm was the predictor of social desirability, which could be related to the independence of decision-making or selective behavior modification among footballers. This research is among the first studies using the NeuroSky Think Gear module with a single-channel EEG system to analyze the features of temperament among athletes. The received data imply further studies to examine the probability of association between the slow and higher frequency rhythms and personality traits among athletes. The data on EEG rhythm oscillations as neurophysiological correlates of footballers' personality traits can be used to create methods for objective behavior diagnosis in sport competitions in both young and high-qualification footballers.

J	Cox, R; Fell, J				Cox, Roy; Fell, Juergen			Analyzing human sleep EEG: A methodological primer with code implementation	SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS			English	Review						Sleep; EEG; Slow oscillations; Sleep spindles; Cross-frequency coupling; Phase synchrony	PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; MEMORY; AMPLITUDE; TOOLBOX	Recent years have witnessed a surge in human sleep electroencephalography (EEG) studies, employing increasingly sophisticated analysis strategies to relate electrophysiological activity to cognition and disease. However, properly calculating and interpreting metrics used in contemporary sleep EEG requires attention to numerous theoretical and practical signal-processing details that are not always obvious. Moreover, the vast number of outcome measures that can be derived from a single dataset inflates the risk of false positives and threatens replicability. We review several methodological issues related to 1) spectral analysis, 2) montage choice, 3) extraction of phase and amplitude information, 4) surrogate construction, and 5) minimizing false positives, illustrating both the impact of methodological choices on downstream results, and the importance of checking processing steps through visualization and simplified examples. By presenting these issues in non-mathematical form, with sleep-specific examples, and with code implementation, this paper aims to instill a deeper appreciation of methodological considerations in novice and non-technical audiences, and thereby help improve the quality of future sleep EEG studies.

Increasing evidence questions the utility of trial-/group averaged power estimates however, as seemingly sustained activity patterns may be brought about by time-varying transient signals in each single trial. Hence, it is crucial to accurately describe the duration and power of rhythmic and arrhythmic neural responses on the single trial-level. However, it is less clear how well this can be achieved in empirical MEG/EEG/LFP recordings. Here, we extend an existing rhythm detection algorithm (extended Better OSCillation detection: "eBOSC"; cf. Whitten et al., 2011) to systematically investigate boundary conditions for estimating neural rhythms at the single-trial level. Using simulations as well as resting and task-based EEG recordings from a micro-longitudinal assessment, we show that alpha rhythms can be successfully captured in single trials with high specificity, but that the quality of single-trial estimates varies greatly between subjects. Despite those signal-to-noise-based limitations, we highlight the utility and potential of rhythm detection with multiple proof-of-concept examples, and discuss implications for single-trial analyses of neural rhythms in electrophysiological recordings. Using an applied example of working memory retention, rhythm detection indicated load-related increases in the duration of frontal theta and posterior alpha rhythms, in addition to a frequency decrease of frontal theta rhythms that was observed exclusively through amplification of rhythmic amplitudes.

Nine neonates of >= 34 weeks' gestational age, who were already undergoing clinical continuous EEG monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit, listened to lullaby-like music and white noise for 1 hour each separated by a 2-hour interval of no intervention. EEG segments during periods of music, white noise, and no intervention were band-pass filtered as delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), lower alpha (8-10 Hz), upper alpha (10-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz). Synchronization likelihood was used as a measure of connectivity between any 2 electrodes. In theta, lower alpha, and upper alpha frequency bands, the synchronization likelihood values yielded statistical significance with sound (music, white noise and no intervention) and with edge (between any 2 electrodes) factors. In theta, lower alpha, and upper alpha frequency bands, statistical significance was obtained between music and white noise (t= 3.12, 3.32, and 3.68, respectively;P< .017), and between white noise and no intervention (t= 4.51, 3.09, and 2.95, respectively,P< .017). However, there was no difference between music and no intervention. Although limited by a small sample size and the 1-time only auditory intervention, these preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of EEG connectivity analyses even at bedside in neonates on continuous EEG monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit. They also point to the possibility of detecting significant changes in functional connectivity related to the theta and alpha bands using auditory interventions.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) represents a special perspective to explore this relationship, being characterized by both these features. The present study employed electroencephalography (EEG) to test whether detail-oriented visual perception, a recognized hallmark of ASD, is associated with altered neural oscillations and functional connectivity in the beta frequency band, considering its role in feedback and top-down reentrant signalling in the typical population. Using a visual crowding task, where participants had to discriminate a peripheral target letter surrounded by flankers at different distances, we found that detail-oriented processing in children with ASD, as compared to typically developing peers, could be attributed to anomalous oscillatory activity in the beta band (15-30 Hz), while no differences emerged in the alpha band (8-12 Hz). Altered beta oscillatory response reflected in turn atypical functional connectivity between occipital areas, where the initial stimulus analysis is accomplished, and infero-temporal regions, where objects identity is extracted. Such atypical beta connectivity predicted both ASD symptomatology and their detail-oriented processing. Overall, these results might be explained by an altered feedback connectivity within the visual system, with potential cascade effects in visual scene parsing and higher order functions.

In the brain of mammals and humans, several widespread neuronal networks are capable of generating spontaneous rhythmic activity. Among them is the thalamo-cortical network, which involves neurons of the thalamus (diencephalon) and in the neocortex and characterized by hierarchical organization. The thalamo-cortical network generates alpha rhythms with a frequency of about 8...14 Hz. Various neurological and psychiatric disorders are known to associate with similar disturbances of thalamo-cortical rhythms, i.e. the thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia. In particular, absence epilepsy, a non-convulsive form of epilepsy caused by disturbances of the thalamo-cortical system. Absence seizures involve brief and sudden lapses of consciousness (i.e., the state of "absence") associated with high-amplitude spike-wave discharges in the encephalogram. The current paper describes morphology of the thalamo-cortical system and diagnostic principles of the thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia. Methods. WAG/Rij rats with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy were used as a model of the thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia. Electrical brain activity was recorded from the surface of neocortex using implanted electrodes (electrocorticogram, ECoG). Time-frequency analysis of rhythmic activity in ECoG was performed using continuous wavelet transform and the fast Fourier transform. Results. The following hallmarks of the thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia were defined. (1) During the slow-wave sleep, the spectral power in ECoG was shifted from slow to fast frequencies. (2) Short-lasting episodes of 3...12 Hz rhythmic activity with the amplitude maximum in delta (3...4 Hz) and theta (5...9 Hz) ranges were present in the frontal ECoG. (3) The so-called "pro-epileptic" 5...9 Hz oscillations were present in the frontal ECoG. Conclusion. The most pronounced manifestation of the thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia was found in ECoG during the slow-wave sleep. The dysrhythmic mechanism mostly affected short-lasting slow-wave oscillations with a frequency of 3...4 Hz and 5...9 Hz in combination with disturbances of the time-frequency structure of ECoG.

Rapid development of strong, persistent, spatiotemporally extensive cortical synchrony and underlying oscillations following acute MCA focal ischemia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONY; EEG COHERENCE; RAT MODEL; OCCLUSION; PHASE; THROMBECTOMY; PROTECTION; DYNAMICS	Stroke is a leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term disability, but its electrophysiological basis is poorly understood. Characterizing acute ischemic neuronal activity dynamics is important for understanding the temporal and spatial development of ischemic pathophysiology and determining neuronal activity signatures of ischemia. Using a 32-microelectrode array spanning the depth of cortex, electrophysiological recordings generated for the first time a continuous spatiotemporal profile of local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) before (baseline) and directly after (0-5 h) distal, permanent MCA occlusion (pMCAo) in a rat model. Although evoked activity persisted for hours after pMCAo with minor differences from baseline, spatiotemporal analyses of spontaneous activity revealed that LFP became spatially and temporally synchronized regardless of cortical depth within minutes after pMCAo and extended over large parts of cortex. Such enhanced post-ischemic synchrony was found to be driven by increased bursts of low multi-frequency oscillations and continued throughout the acute ischemic period whereas synchrony measures minimally changed over the same recording period in surgical sham controls. EEG recordings of a similar frequency range have been applied to successfully predict stroke damage and recovery, suggesting clear clinical relevance for our rat model.

The 10-20 system is the standard electrode location method used to acquire EEG data, which uses 21 electrodes to record the electrical activity of the brain. Patient preparation and correct electrode placement are important to obtain reliable outputs. The current 10-20 system consumes greater time for patient preparation and also causes discomfort due to a higher number of electrodes being used or wearing an uncomfortable cap. This paper focuses on reducing the number of electrodes, thus reducing patient discomfort as well as preparation time. Advancement in the field of hardware and software processing has led to the utilization of brain waves for communication between human and the computer. This work deals with EEG-based Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) intended for designing a portable single-channel EEG signal acquisition system. EEG signal was acquired using the data acquisition module [National Instruments (NI) myDAQ] and the signal was viewed in the NI Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) environment. It was observed that the peakto-peak amplitude of alpha, beta and theta waves changes in accordance with the activity the subjects performed. Thus, the developed instrument was tested on 10 different subjects to acquire the alpha, beta and theta waves by performing different activities. From the results, it can be concluded that the developed system can be used for studying a person's brain waves (alpha, beta and theta) based on the activity performed by the subject with a limited number of electrodes.

Brain activity while sleeping during respiratory events is related to these dysfunctions. In this study, we analyzed variations in electroencephalography (EEG) signals before, during, and after such events. Absolute and relative powers, as well as symbolic transfer entropy (STE) of scalp EEG signals, were calculated to unveil the activity of brain regions and information interactions between them, respectively. During the respiratory events, only low-frequency power increased during rapid eye movement (REM) stage (delta-band absolute and relative power) and N1 (delta- and theta-band absolute power, delta-band relative power) sleep. But absolute power increased in low- and medium-frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and sigma bands), and relative power increased mainly in the medium-frequency band (alpha and sigma bands) during stage N2 sleep. After the respiratory events, absolute power increased in all frequency bands and sleep stages, but relative power increased in medium and high frequencies. Regarding information interactions, the beta-band STE decreased during and after events. In the gamma band, the intrahemispheric STE increased during events and decreased afterward. Moreover, the interhemisphere STE increased after events during REM and stage N1 sleep. The EEG changes throughout respiratory events are supporting evidence for previous EEG knowledge of the impact of sleep apnea on the brain. These findings may provide insights into the influence of the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome on cognitive function and neuropsychiatric defects.

Visual feedback of EEG-oscillations may promote sensorimotor cortical activation, but its spatial specificity is not truly guaranteed due to signal interaction among interhemispheric brain regions. Guiding spatially specific activation is important for facilitating neural rehabilitation processes. Here, we tested whether users could explicitly guide sensorimotor cortical activity to the contralateral or ipsilateral hemisphere using a spatially bivariate EEG-based neurofeedback that monitors bi-hemispheric sensorimotor cortical activities for healthy participants. Two different motor imageries (shoulder and hand MIs) were selected to see how differences in intrinsic cortico-muscular projection patterns might influence activity lateralization. We showed sensorimotor cortical activities during shoulder, but not hand MI, can be brought under ipsilateral control with guided EEG-based neurofeedback. These results are compatible with neuroanatomy; shoulder muscles are innervated bihemispherically, whereas hand muscles are mostly innervated contralaterally. We demonstrate the neuroanatomically-inspired approach enables us to investigate potent neural remodeling functions that underlie EEG-based neurofeedback via a BCI.

Also, the associations of visual memory, evaluated by the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT), and neural oscillation with FC during the resting state were investigated. The BD (n = 35) and non-BD (n = 35) groups were selected based on scores of the Korean version of the Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) Identification Test and the Alcohol Use Questionnaire. EEG was performed for 6 min while the participants rested with eyes closed. The theta, lower-alpha, and upper alpha powers did not differ between the BD and non-BD groups. Concerning FC, the BD group exhibited stronger theta coherence than that of the non-BD group, and in the lower and upper alpha bands, the BD group showed stronger coherence in some areas but weaker coherence in others compared with the non-BD group. However, these significant results were not observed after Bonferroni correction. The BD group showed significantly lower delayed recall scores on the RCFT than did the non-BD group. A positive correlation between the left prefrontal-parietal-occipital midline connection and performance on the delayed recall of the RCFT was observed in the BD group. The present results could suggest that binge drinkers have alterations in brain FC, which may be related to their visual memory deficits.

However, less is known about how RVS influences the functional connectivity across the whole brain. Here, we applied a graph theoretical approach to analyze the electroencephalography (EEG) connections of 60 nodes when subjects deployed their attention on visual task with different background stimulation, i.e. no background flicker, jittered flicker, and RVS of 6, 10, 15 and 40 Hz, respectively. Thirty-three subjects participated in this study. As a result, the 40-Hz rhythm led to the significantly fastest reaction among all conditions. Furthermore, significantly higher clustering coefficient (C) and small worldness (sigma) of theta-band brain network were observed for higher-frequency RVS, which were significantly negatively correlated with reaction time (RT) (C-RT: r =-0.917, p =0.010; sigma-RT: r =-0.894, p =0.016). In addition, we found an increase in the connections between dorsolateral prefrontal and visual cortices under RVS compared to no flicker. Our results indicate that RVS can improve the efficiency of brain cortical functional network to facilitate attention.

In this work, we present the first comparative assessment of brain activity in subjects viewing stereoscopic images and volumetric images. Electroencephalography was employed to assess the short-term changes in event related potentials and neural oscillations which were further interpreted in terms of cognitive requirements for relative depth judgments. As a result, considerably higher activity have been registered in the beta band and gamma band in case of judging relative depth of stereoscopic images in comparison to performing a similar task on the volumetric display. In addition, the higher neural activity in the parietal area and occipital area has been observed in the case of stereoscopic images in the moments which reflect cognitive responses on the depth component of the visual stimulus. We suggest that the greater demands on cognitive load may lead to a faster onset of fatigue in a long-term perspective. Overall, EEG-based assessment of brain activity indicates that the depth extraction from volumetric images requires less cognitive effort in comparison to stereoscopic images.

However, the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal provides an indirect measure of neuronal firing and reflects slow-evolving hemodynamic activity that fails to capture the faster timescale of normal physiological function. Here we used fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) to characterize individual brain dynamics within discrete brain networks at high temporal resolution. TMS was used to induce controlled perturbations to individually defined nodes of the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN). Source-level EEG propagation patterns were network-specific and highly reproducible across sessions 1 month apart. Additionally, individual differences in high-order cognitive abilities were significantly correlated with the specificity of TMS propagation patterns across DAN and DMN, but not with resting-state EEG dynamics. Findings illustrate the potential of TMS-EEG perturbation-based biomarkers to characterize network-level individual brain dynamics at high temporal resolution, and potentially provide further insight on their behavioral significance.

To date, relatively few studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have yielded consistent relations between personality trait measures and spectral power. Thus, new exploratory research may help develop targeted hypotheses about how neural processes associated with EEG activity may relate to personality differences. We used multivariate pattern analysis to decode personality scores (i.e., Big Five traits) from resting EEG frequency power spectra. Up to 8 minutes of EEG data was recorded per participant prior to completing an unrelated task (N = 168, M-age = 23.51, 57% female) and, in a subset of participants, after task completion (N = 96, M-age = 23.22, 52% female). In each recording, participants alternated between open and closed eyes. Linear support vector regression with 10-fold cross vali- dation was performed using the power from 62 scalp electrodes within 1 Hz frequency bins from 1 to 30 Hz. One Big Five trait, agreeableness, could be decoded from EEG power ranging from 8 to 19 Hz, and this was consistent across all four recording periods. Neuroticism was decodable using data within the 3-6 Hz range, albeit less consistently. Posterior alpha power negatively correlated with agreeableness, whereas parietal beta power positively correlated with agreeableness. We suggest methods to draw from our results and develop targeted future hypotheses, such as linking to individual alpha frequency and incorporating self-reported emotional states. Our open dataset can be harnessed to reproduce results or investigate new research questions concerning the biological basis of personality. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brain imaging studies have shown that the inhibition of implicit stereotypes was dependent on this domain-general cognitive control mechanism. Based on this knowledge, the present study investigated the neural oscillatory correlates of implicit gender stereotype control in an extrinsic affective Simon task (EAST) using electrophysiological methods. Participants in this task conducted verification to white gender names and colored gender traits, and their behavioral response and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded during their performances. As predicted, stereotype-inconsistent trials resulted in reduced response accuracies and slower response times than stereotype-consistent trials. For the event-related potential (ERP) results, the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was accompanied by an enhanced N400 amplitude but an attenuated late positive potential amplitude. In contrast, early attentional components such as P2 and N2 as well as their amplitudes were impacted by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. In addition, based on time-frequency (TF) analysis, we found that the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was also accompanied by an event-related synchronization on the frontal theta oscillation. This frontal theta appeared at a late processing stage and persisted across a time window from N400 to late positive potential. Additionally, this enhanced frontal theta effect was not modulated by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. Based on these findings, the feature of frontal theta oscillation in the implicit gender stereotype control process was discussed.

However, little is known about the neural correlates of STIs when they first develop. In the present study, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) using an N400 paradigm. Seventeen 9-year-old Chinese children were first instructed to remember facial photos and paired trait-implying behaviors. Subsequently, they performed a lexical decision task in which faces were used to prime the inferred traits or their antonyms. Compared to the inferred traits, the antonyms exhibited a stronger amplitude on both N400 (370-500 ms) and negative slow wave (NSW; 550-800 ms). However, only N400 showed a right hemispheric dominance of STIs. In addition, ERSP results revealed stronger lower alpha band (7-10 Hz) activity for antonyms than inferred traits over the right parieto-occipital area from 420 ms to 800 ms. These findings, coupled with the electroencephalography (EEG) source localization (standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [sLORETA]), provide evidence for a "monitoring-control" two-stage neural network.

Indirect measures of configural processing in visual cognition are the face and body inversion effects (FIE and BIE), which refer to the drop in performance when these stimuli are perceived upside-down. Albeit FIE and BIE have been well characterized at the behavioral level, much still needs to be understood in terms of the neurophysiological correlates of these effects. Thus, in the current study, the brain's electrical activity has been recorded by a 128 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 24 healthy participants while perceiving (upright and inverted) faces, bodies and houses. EEG data were analyzed in both the time domain (i.e., event-related potentials-ERPs) and the frequency domain [i.e., induced theta (5-7 Hz) and gamma (28-45 Hz) oscillations]. ERPs amplitude results showed increased N170 amplitude for inverted faces and bodies (compared to the same stimuli presented in canonical position) but not for houses. ERPs latency results showed delayed N170 components for inverted (vs. upright) faces, houses, but not bodies. Spectral analysis of induced oscillations indicated physiological FIE and BIE; that is decreased gamma-band synchronization over right occipito-temporal electrodes for inverted (vs. upright) faces, and increased bilateral frontoparietal theta-band synchronization for inverted (vs. upright) faces. Furthermore, increased left occipito-temporal and right frontal theta-band synchronization for upright (vs. inverted) bodies was found. Our findings, thus, demonstrate clear differences in the neurophysiological correlates of face and body perception. The neurophysiological FIE suggests disruption of feature binding processes (decrease in occipital gamma oscillations for inverted faces), together with enhanced feature-based attention (increase in frontoparietal theta oscillations for inverted faces). In contrast, the BIE may suggest that structural encoding for bodies is mediated by the first stages of configural processing (decrease in occipital theta oscillations for inverted bodies).

Reactivated Spatial Context Guides Episodic Recall	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						episodic memory; hippocampus; intracranial EEG; MTL; reinstatement; theta	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL; NEURAL ACTIVITY; THETA RHYTHM; GRID CELLS; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; NAVIGATION; RECOLLECTION	The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is known as the locus of spatial coding and episodic memory, but the interaction between these cognitive domains as well as the extent to which they rely on common neurophysiological mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we use intracranial electroencephalography and a hybrid spatial-episodic memory task (29 subjects, 15 female) to determine how spatial information is dynamically reactivated in subregions of the human MTL and how this reactivation guides recall of episodic information. Our results implicate theta oscillations across the MTL as a common neurophysiological substrate for spatial coding in navigation and episodic recall. We further show that our index of retrieved spatial context is high in the hippocampus (HC) in an early time window preceding recall. Closer to recall, it decreases in the HC and increases in the parahippocampal gyrus. Finally, we demonstrate that hippocampal theta phase modulates parahippocampal gamma amplitude during retrieval of spatial context, suggesting a role for cross-frequency coupling in coding and transmitting retrieved spatial information.

Recent works have shown that flexible information processing is closely related to the reconfiguration of human brain networks underlying brain functions. However, the role of network switching for consciousness is poorly explored and whether such transition can indicate the behavioral performance of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) remains unknown. Here, we investigate the relationship between the switching of brain networks (states) over time and the consciousness levels. Approach. By applying multilayer network methods, we calculated time-resolved functional connectivity from source-level EEG data in different frequency bands. At various time scales, we explored how the human brain changes its community structure and traverses across defined network states (integrated and segregated states) in subjects with different consciousness levels. Main results. Network switching in the human brain is decreased with increasing time scale opposite to that in random systems. Transitions of community assignment (denoted by flexibility) are negatively correlated with the consciousness levels (particularly in the alpha band) at short time scales. At long time scales, the opposite trend is found. Compared to healthy controls, patients show a new balance between dynamic segregation and integration, with decreased proportion and mean duration of segregated state (contrary to those of integrated state) at small scales. Significance. These findings may contribute to the development of EEG-based network analysis and shed new light on the pathological mechanisms of neurological disorders like DOC.

Novel personalized medicine approaches are particularly important for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as symptom presentation of the disorder, as well as responses to treatment, are highly heterogeneous. Learning to achieve control of specific neural substrates through neurofeedback has been shown to display therapeutic evidence in patients with a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. This article outlines the neural mechanisms underlying neurofeedback and examines converging evidence for the efficacy of neurofeedback as an adjunctive treatment for PTSD via both electroencephalography (EEG) and real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) modalities. Further, implications for the treatment of PTSD via neurofeedback in the military member and Veteran population is examined.

The Maryland analysis of developmental EEG (MADE) pipeline	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						automated; EEG; pediatric; pipeline; preprocessing		Compared to adult EEG, EEG signals recorded from pediatric populations have shorter recording periods and contain more artifact contamination. Therefore, pediatric EEG data necessitate specific preprocessing approaches in order to remove environmental noise and physiological artifacts without losing large amounts of data. However, there is presently a scarcity of standard automated preprocessing pipelines suitable for pediatric EEG. In an effort to achieve greater standardization of EEG preprocessing, and in particular, for the analysis of pediatric data, we developed the Maryland analysis of developmental EEG (MADE) pipeline as an automated preprocessing pipeline compatible with EEG data recorded with different hardware systems, different populations, levels of artifact contamination, and length of recordings. MADE uses EEGLAB and functions from some EEGLAB plugins and includes additional customized features particularly useful for EEG data collected from pediatric populations. MADE processes event-related and resting state EEG from raw data files through a series of preprocessing steps and outputs processed clean data ready to be analyzed in time, frequency, or time-frequency domain. MADE provides a report file at the end of the preprocessing that describes a variety of features of the processed data to facilitate the assessment of the quality of processed data. In this article, we discuss some practical issues, which are specifically relevant to pediatric EEG preprocessing. We also provide custom-written scripts to address these practical issues.

Dopaminergic neuromodulation of high gamma stimulus phase-locking in gerbil primary auditory cortex mediated by D1/D5-receptors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						oscillation; spectral analysis; time-frequency analysis; current source density; Mongolian gerbil	MERIONES-UNGUICULATUS; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS; KETAMINE; MODULATION; REFLECT; MATCHES	Cortical release of the neurotransmitter dopamine has been implied in adapting cortical processing with respect to various functions including coding of stimulus salience, expectancy, error prediction, behavioral relevance and learning. Dopamine agonists have been shown to modulate recurrent cortico-thalamic feedback, and should therefore also affect synchronization and amplitude of thalamo-cortical oscillations. In this study, we have used multitaper spectral and time-frequency analysis of stimulus-evoked and spontaneous current source density patterns in primary auditory cortex of Mongolian gerbils to characterize dopaminergic neuromodulation of the oscillatory structure of current sources and sinks. We systemically applied D1/D5-receptor agonist SKF-38393 followed by competitive D1/D5-receptor antagonist SCH-23390. Our results reveal an increase in stimulus phase-locking in the high gamma-band (88-97 Hz) by SKF-38393, specifically in layers III/IV at the best frequency, which occurred at 20 ms after tone onset, and was reversed by SCH-23390. However, changes in induced oscillatory power after SKF-38393 treatment occurred stimulus-independently in the background activity in different layers than phase-locking effects and were not reversed by SCH-23390. These effects might either reflect longer-lasting changes in neural background noise, non-specific changes due to ketamine anesthesia, or an interaction of both. Without concomitant stimulus-induced power increase, increased stimulus phase-locking in layers III/IV indicates enhanced phase-resetting of neural oscillations by the stimulus after D1/D5-receptor activation. The frequency characteristics, together with the demonstrated stimulus specificity and layer specificity, suggest that changes in phase-resetting originate from dopaminergic neuromodulation of thalamo-cortical interactions. Enhanced phase-resetting might be a key step in the recruitment of cortical activity modes interpreting sensory input.	[Deliano, Matthias; Brunk, Michael G.

The HERA model was previously validated for episodic memory in subjects with brain traumas or injuries. In this study, a revised HERA model is used to investigate long-term memory retrieval from newly learned video-based content for healthy individuals using electroencephalography. The model was tested for long-term memory retrieval in two retrieval sessions: (1) recent long-term memory (recorded 30 min after learning) and (2) remote long-term memory (recorded two months after learning). The results show that long-term memory retrieval in healthy individuals for the frontal region (theta and delta band) satisfies the revised HERA asymmetry model.

Does alpha phase modulate visual target detection? Three experiments with tACS-phase-based stimulus presentation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alignment; alpha; entrainment; null results; oscillations; phase	EEG ALPHA; REACTION-TIME; OSCILLATIONS; POWER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; EXCITABILITY; PERCEPTION; TMS; FLUCTUATIONS; ENTRAINMENT	In recent years, the influence of alpha (7-13 Hz) phase on visual processing has received a lot of attention. Magneto-/encephalography (M/EEG) studies showed that alpha phase indexes visual excitability and task performance. Studies with transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) aim to modulate oscillations and causally impact task performance. Here, we applied right occipital tACS (O2 location) to assess the functional role of alpha phase in a series of experiments. We presented visual stimuli at different pre-determined, experimentally controlled, phases of the entraining tACS signal, hypothesizing that this should result in an oscillatory pattern of visual performance in specifically left hemifield detection tasks. In experiment 1, we applied 10 Hz tACS and used separate psychophysical staircases for six equidistant tACS-phase conditions, obtaining contrast thresholds for detection of visual gratings in left or right hemifield. In experiments 2 and 3, tACS was at EEG-based individual peak alpha frequency. In experiment 2, we measured detection rates for gratings with (pseudo-)fixed contrast. In experiment 3, participants detected brief luminance changes in a custom-built LED device, at eight equidistant alpha phases. In none of the experiments did the primary outcome measure over phase conditions consistently reflect a one-cycle sinusoid. However, post hoc analyses of reaction times (RT) suggested that tACS alpha phase did modulate RT for specifically left hemifield targets in both experiments 1 and 2 (not measured in experiment 3). This observation requires future confirmation, but is in line with the idea that alpha phase causally gates visual inputs through cortical excitability modulation.

Load-dependent modulation of alpha oscillations during working memory encoding and retention in young and older adults	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha oscillations; cognitive aging; EEG; working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EEG-ALPHA; HEALTHY YOUNGER; DYNAMICS; SPEED; AGE; FREQUENCY; RHYTHMS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMPENSATION	Working memory (WM) is vulnerable to age-related decline, particularly under high loads. Visual alpha oscillations contribute to WM performance in younger adults, and although alpha decreases in power and frequency with age, it is unclear if alpha activity supports WM in older adults. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while 24 younger (aged 18-35 years) and 30 older (aged 50-86) adults performed a modified Sternberg task with varying load conditions. Older adults demonstrated slower reaction times at all loads, but there were no significant age differences in WM capacity. Regardless of age, alpha power decreased and alpha frequency increased with load during encoding, and the magnitude of alpha suppression during retention was larger at higher loads. While alpha power during retention was lower than fixation in older, but not younger adults, the relative change from fixation was not significantly different between age groups. Individual differences in alpha power did not predict performance for either age groups or at any WM loads. We demonstrate that alpha power and frequency are modulated in a similar task- and load-dependent manner during WM in both older and younger adults when WM performance is comparable across age groups. Impact statement Aging is associated with a marked decrease in the power and frequency of alpha oscillations. Here, we demonstrate that when verbal working memory performance is matched across age groups, alpha power and frequency are modulated in a similar task- and load-dependent manner in both young and older adults.

The framework is based on inhomogeneous point-process models for human heartbeat dynamics and employs inverse-Gaussian probability density functions characterizing the timing of R-peak events. The instantaneous estimation of the functional directional coupling is based on the definition of point-process transfer entropy, which is here retrieved from heart rate variability (HRV) and Electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral series gathered from 12 healthy subjects undergoing significant sympathovagal changes induced by a cold-pressor test. Results suggest that EEG oscillations dynamically influence heartbeat dynamics with specific time delays in the 30-60s and 90-120s ranges, and through a functional activity over specific cortical regions.

Mindfulness Meditators Show Enhanced Accuracy and Different Neural Activity During Working Memory	MINDFULNESS			English	Article						Attention; Mindfulness meditation; EEG; Working memory; Alpha; Theta; P3; FN400; Parietal old; new effect; 1; f aperiodic activity	COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; FRONTAL THETA; EEG; ATTENTION; ERP; ALPHA; RECOLLECTION; RETRIEVAL; CAPACITY; LOAD	Objectives Mindfulness meditation has been shown to improve working memory (WM). However, brain activity underpinning these improvements is underexplored. In meditation-naive individuals, increased fronto-midline theta and parieto-occipital alpha oscillations, and steeper 1/f aperiodic activity during WM correlate with better WM performance. Resting theta and alpha oscillations have been found to differ in meditators, but WM-related oscillations and 1/f aperiodic activity have not been examined. Additionally, WM-related event-related-potentials (ERPs) are modulated by attention, which is enhanced by mindfulness meditation, so these neural measures are candidate explanations for WM improvement in mindfulness meditators. Methods We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 29 meditation-naive controls and 29 experienced mindfulness meditators during a Sternberg WM task and compared theta, alpha and 1/f aperiodic activity during the WM delay, and ERPs time-locked to the WM probe. Results Compared to controls, meditators demonstrated greater WM accuracy (p = 0.008, Cohen'sd = 0.688), earlier left-temporal ERP responses and a more frontal distribution of activity (FDR-p = 0.0186, eta(2) = 0.0903), as well as a reduction in overall neural response strength (FDR-p = 0.0098, eta(2) = 0.1251). A higher proportion of meditators showed theta oscillations during the WM delay, but no other differences in theta, alpha or 1/f aperiodic activity were present. Conclusions Results suggest that increased WM performance in mindfulness meditators might not result from higher amplitudes of typical WM activity, but instead from an alternative pattern of brain region engagement during WM decision making, allowing more accurate responses with less neural activation (perhaps reflecting increased neural efficiency).

However, despite decades of research, the exact nature of these differences between typically developing (TD) individuals and those with ASDs remains unclear. ASDs have been widely studied using resting-state neuroimaging methods, including both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, little is known about how fMRI and EEG measures of spontaneous brain activity are related in ASDs. In the present study, two cohorts of children and adolescents underwent resting-state EEG (n = 38 per group) or fMRI (n = 66 ASD, 57 TD), with a subset of individuals in both the EEG and fMRI cohorts (n = 17 per group). In the EEG cohort, parieto-occipital EEG alpha power was found to be reduced in ASDs. In the fMRI cohort, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) power was regionally increased in right temporal regions and there was widespread overconnectivity between the thalamus and cortical regions in the ASD group relative to the TD group. Finally, multimodal analyses indicated that while TD children showed consistently positive relationships between EEG alpha power and regional BOLD power, these associations were weak or negative in ASDs. These findings suggest atypical links between alpha rhythms and regional BOLD activity in ASDs, possibly implicating neural substrates and processes that coordinate thalamocortical regulation of the alpha rhythm.

Modafinil, a wake-promoting and cognitive-enhancing drug, has been considered as a treatment for HD. We used HD (R6/2) mice to investigate the potential for using modafinil to treat sleep-wake disturbance in HD. R6/2 mice show sleep-wake and EEG changes similar to those seen in HD patients, with increased rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), decreased wakefulness/increased non-REMS (NREMS), and pathological changes in EEG spectra, particularly an increase in gamma power. We recorded EEG from R6/2 and wild-type mice treated with modafinil acutely (with single doses between 25 and 100 mg/kg; at 12 and 16 weeks of age), or chronically (64 mg/kg modafinil/day from 6 to 15 weeks). Acutely, modafinil increased wakefulness in R6/2 mice and restored NREMS to wild-type levels at 12 weeks. It also suppressed the pathologically increased REMS. This was accompanied by decreased delta power, increased peak frequency of theta, and increased gamma power. At 16 weeks, acute modafinil also restored wakefulness and NREMS to wild-type levels. However, whilst REMS decreased, it did not return to normal levels. By contrast, in the chronic treatment group, modafinil-induced wakefulness was maintained at 15 weeks (after 9 weeks of treatment). Interestingly, chronic modafinil also caused widespread suppression of power across the EEG spectra, including a reduction in gamma that increases pathologically in R6/2 mice. The complex EEG effects of modafinil in R6/2 mice should provide a baseline for further studies to investigate the translatability of these result to clinical practice.

Machine learning validation of EEG plus tACS artefact removal	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; tACS; artefact removal	CURRENT STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SIGNALS	Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during transcranial alternating current simulation (tACS) is highly desirable in order to investigate brain dynamics during stimulation, but is corrupted by large amplitude stimulation artefacts. Artefact removal algorithms have been presented previously, but with substantial debates on their performance, utility, and the presence of any residual artefacts. This paper investigates whether machine learning can be used to validate artefact removal algorithms. The postulation is that residual artefacts in the EEG after cleaning would be independent of the experiment performed, making it impossible to differentiate between different parts of an EEG+tACS experiment, or between different behavioural tasks performed. Approach. Ten participates undertook two tasks (nBack and backwards digital recall) during simultaneous EEG+tACS, exercising different aspects of working memory. Stimulations during no task and sham conditions were also performed. A previously reported tACS artefact removal algorithm from our group was used to clean the EEG and a linear discriminant analysis was trained on the cleaned EEG to differentiate different parts of the experiment. Main results. Baseline, baseline during tACS, working memory task without tACS, and working memory task with tACS data segments could be differentiated with accuracies ranging from 65%-94%, far exceeding chance levels. EEG from the nBack and backwards digital recall tasks could be separated during stimulation, with an accuracy exceeding 72%. If residual tACS artefacts remained after the EEG cleaning these did not dominate the classification process. Significance. This helps in building confidence that true EEG information is present after artefact removal. Our methodology presents a new approach to validating tACS artefact removal approaches.

The key to the realization of the BCI system is reasonable extraction and analysis of the characteristics for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Although deep learning has made initial progress in this field, only a few works have discussed the characteristics of EEG signals learned by deep learning. In this paper, an end-to-end network model for deep learning is designed to extract the time domain information of MI EEG signals. The model uses a one-dimensional convolution kernel to learn the time-domain information in the MI-EEG signal. Furthermore, we analyzed the frequency-dependent characteristics of the convolution kernel. We use the BCI competition dataset as a standard to measure the performance of this method. The experimental results show that the neural network tends to learn information in a specific frequency band, each person's specific frequency band is different. The classification result of the motor imagery obtained by the network is better than the competition's winner.

In general, independent component analysis (ICA) is used for removing blinks. However, that requires expert intervention. This paper aims at cleaning the eye blink related artifacts automatically without any manual interventions. We propose a novel approach based on multivariate extension of variational mode decomposition (VMD), called MVMD, for the said purpose. The mode-alignment property of MVMD has been utilized to align the joint/common oscillations across multiple channels of a given single mode. The detection of blinks is found to be better in the components of MVMD over the raw EEG signal. The proposed approach is first validated on synthetically generated EEG data and then it is tested on two publicly available real EEG datasets. Results confirm usability of the proposed approach over ICA technique. An average correlation of 0.938 (similar to 0.0221) and 0.9869 (similar to 0.0094) are obtained for the synthetically generated and high end EEG data, respectively, in the non-blink regions. We obtained approximately 90% classification accuracy in detecting fatigue on CogBeacon dataset. This accuracy is comparable with that obtained using state of the art approach, with the added advantage of not requiring manual interventions of experts.

The analysis corpus represents 1,155 recordings containing approximately 7.8 million event instances acquired under several different experimental paradigms. Such large-scale analysis is predicated on consistent data organization and event annotation as well as an effective automated preprocessing pipeline to transform raw EEG into a form suitable for comparative analysis. A key component of this analysis is the annotation of study-specific event codes using a common vocabulary to describe relevant event features. We demonstrate that Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED tags) capture statistically significant cognitive aspects of EEG events common across multiple recordings, subjects, studies, paradigms, headset configurations, and experimental sites. We use representational similarity analysis (RSA) to show that EEG responses annotated with the same cognitive aspect are significantly more similar than those that do not share that cognitive aspect. These RSA similarity results are supported by visualizations that exploit the non-linear similarities of these associations. We apply temporal overlap regression, reducing confounds caused by adjacent event instances, to extract time and time-frequency EEG features (regressed ERPs and ERSPs) that are comparable across studies and replicate findings from prior, individual studies. Likewise, we use second-level linear regression to separate effects of different cognitive aspects on these features across all studies. This work demonstrates that EEG mega-analysis (pooling of raw data across studies) can enable investigations of brain dynamics in a more generalized fashion than single studies afford. A companion paper complements this event-based analysis by addressing commonality of the time and frequency statistical properties of EEG across studies at the channel and dipole level.

Methods This systematic review was prepared according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase from inception to August 15, 2020 were systematically searched. These key words were used: "COVID" AND "seizure" OR "epilepsy" OR "EEG" OR "status epilepticus" OR "electroencephalography". Results We could identify 62 related manuscripts. Many studies were case reports or case series of patients with COVID-19 and seizures. PWE showed more psychological distress than healthy controls. Many cases with new-onset focal seizures, serial seizures, and status epilepticus have been reported in the literature. EEG studies have been significantly ignored and underused globally. Conclusion Many PWE perceived significant disruption in the quality of care to them, and some people reported increase in their seizure frequency since the onset of the pandemic. Telemedicine is a helpful technology that may improve access to the needed care for PWE in these difficult times. De novo seizures may occur in people with COVID-19 and they may happen in a variety of forms. In addition to prolonged EEG monitoring, performing a through metabolic investigation, electrocardiogram, brain imaging, and a careful review of all medications are necessary steps. The susceptibility of PWE to contracting COVID-19 should be investigated further.

Cerebellar deep nuclei with its extensive projections to cortical regions could be a prospective target for stimulation to restore inter-hemispheric balance and enhance neural plasticity after stroke. In our study, we repeatedly stimulated the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) by low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) for 3 days to enhance rehabilitation after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in a mouse stroke model. The neural activity of the mice sensorimotor cortex was measured using epidural electrodes and analyzed with quantified electroencephalography (qEEG). Pairwise derived Brain Symmetry Index (pdBSI) and delta power were used to assess the neurorehabilitative effect of LIFU stimulation. Compared to the Stroke (non-treated) group, the LIFU group exhibited a decrease in cortical pathological delta activity, significant recovery in pdBSI and enhanced performance on the balance beam walking test. These results suggest that cerebellar LIFU stimulation could be a non-invasive method for stroke rehabilitation through the restoration of interhemispheric balance.

An empirical comparison of neural networks and machine learning algorithms for EEG gait decoding	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TREADMILL WALKING; INTERFACE; SIGNALS; LIMB	Previous studies of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have demonstrated the feasibility of decoding kinematics for lower limb movements during walking. In this computational study, we investigated offline decoding analysis with different models and conditions to assess how they influence the performance and stability of the decoder. Specifically, we conducted three computational decoding experiments that investigated decoding accuracy: (1) based on delta band time-domain features, (2) when downsampling data, (3) of different frequency band features. In each experiment, eight different decoder algorithms were compared including the current state-of-the-art. Different tap sizes (sample window sizes) were also evaluated for a real-time applicability assessment. A feature of importance analysis was conducted to ascertain which features were most relevant for decoding; moreover, the stability to perturbations was assessed to quantify the robustness of the methods. Results indicated that generally the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Quasi Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) outperformed other methods in terms of decoding accuracy and stability. Previous state-of-the-art Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) still outperformed other decoders when using smaller tap sizes, with fast convergence in performance, but occurred at a cost to noise vulnerability. Downsampling and the inclusion of other frequency band features yielded overall improvement in performance. The results suggest that neural network-based decoders with downsampling or a wide range of frequency band features could not only improve decoder performance but also robustness with applications for stable use of BCIs.

The present study investigated whether these theta modulations existed in children and whether they were associated with attentional problems in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Electroencephalography signals were recorded from typically developing (TD) children and children with ADHD (TD: n = 24; ADHD: n = 22) while they performed a cued covert visual attention task. The participants responded to a target following a cue designed as human eyes that gazed to the left or right visual field (70% validity). Compared with the TD children, the children with ADHD showed increased midfrontal theta ERS and significant posterior theta lateralization in response to the cues. More importantly, we found that the stronger posterior theta lateralization in the right hemisphere exhibited a positive trial-based correlation with the larger midfrontal theta ERS and predicted lower RT variability at the trial level in the children with ADHD. We suggest that ADHD may be associated with some enhanced systems in the frontal and posterior areas via theta oscillations, which may be involved in the compensatory maturation for their attention deficits in childhood, thereby promoting the stability of behavioral responses.

Often these factors result in long-term issues with daytime sleepiness, emotional instability, and mental exhaustion, which may lead to difficulties in the educational process. This study introduces the Daily Sampling System (DSS) implemented as a smartphone application, which combines a set of self-assessment scales for evaluating variations in the emotional state and sleep quality throughout a full academic term. In addition to submitting the daily sampling scores, the participants regularly filled in the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS) reports and took part in resting-state EEG data recording immediately after report completion. In total, this study collected 1835 daily samples and 94 combined DASS with EEG datasets from 18 university students (aged 23-27 years), with 79.3 +/- 15.3% response ratio in submitting the daily reports during an academic semester. The results of pairwise testing and multiple regression analysis demonstrate that the daily level of self-perceived fatigue correlates positively with stress, daytime sleepiness, and negatively with alertness on awakening, self-evaluated sleep quality, and sleep duration. The spectral analysis of the EEG data reveals a significant increase in the resting-state spectral power density across the theta and low-alpha frequency bands associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress. Additionally, the state of depression was accompanied by an intensification of high-frequency EEG activity over the temporal regions. No significant differences in prefrontal alpha power asymmetry were observed under the described experimental conditions while comparing the states of calmness and emotional arousal of the participants for the three conditions of depression, anxiety, and stress.

J	Mamoojee, A				Mamoojee, Al			Fourier analysis: the simplification of a complex waveform into simple component sine waves of different amplitudes and frequencies	SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article						Fourier analysis; complex waveform; simple component sine waves; amplitudes; frequencies		Fourier analysis is the simplification of a complex waveform into simple component sine waves of different amplitudes and frequencies.(1) A discussion on Fourier analysis necessitates reiteration of the physics of waves. A wave is a series of repeating disturbances that propagate in space and time.(2) Frequency: the number of oscillations,2 or cycles per second. It is measured in Hertz and denoted as 1/time or s(-1). Fundamental frequency: the lowest frequency wave in a series. It is also known as the first harmonic. Every other wave in the series is an exact multiple of the fundamental frequency.(2) Harmonic: whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency.(1) Amplitude: the maximum disturbance or displacement from zero caused by the wave. This is the height of the wave.(2) Period: time to complete one oscillation.(2) Wavelength: physical length of one complete cycle.(2) This can be between two crests or two troughs. The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. Velocity: frequency x wavelength. Phase: displacement of one wave compared to another, described as 0 degrees-360 degrees.(3) A sine wave is a simple wave. It can be depicted as the path of a point travelling round a circle at a constant speed, defined by the equation 'y = sinx'.(3) Combining sine waves of different frequency, amplitude and phase can yield any waveform,(3) and, conversely, any wave can be simplified into its component sine waves. Fourier analysis is a mathematical method of analysing a complex periodic waveform to find its constituent frequencies (as sine waves). Complex waveforms can be analysed, with very simple results. Usually, few sine and cosine waves combine to create reasonably accurate representations of most waves. Fourier analysis finds its anaesthetic applications in invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are all periodic waveforms.(2) It enables monitors to display accurate representations of these biological waveforms. Fourier analysis was developed by Joseph Fourier, a mathematician who analysed and altered periodic waveforms.(2) It is done by computer programmes that plot the results of the analysis as a spectrum of frequencies with amplitude on the y-axis and frequency on the x-axis.

Cognitive deficits are common features of psychiatric disorders that complicate treatment of the motivational, affective and emotional symptoms. Objective: Electrophysiological correlates of cognitive functions will contribute to understanding of neural circuits controlling cognition, the causes of their perturbation in psychiatric disorders and developing novel targets for the treatment of cognitive impairments. Methods: This review includes a description of brain oscillations in Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and autism. Results: The review clearly shows that the reviewed neuropsychiatric diseases are associated with fundamental changes in both spectral power and coherence of EEG oscillations. Conclusion: In this article, we examined the nature of brain oscillations, the association of brain rhythms with cognitive functions and the relationship between EEG oscillations and neuropsychiatric diseases. Accordingly, EEG oscillations can most likely be used as biomarkers in psychiatric disorders.

Nowadays, technology, as well as innovation, has become an essential and analytical part of the world. Detection of sleep disorders by brain waves has become a dynamic study. From this point of view, this paper proposed a model for detecting sleep disorders using time-frequency analysis based feature extraction model based on EEG (Electroencephalogram) signal. In this proposed method, Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet packet transform (WPT) time-frequency analysis techniques are used for extracting effective features, because those techniques are very effective for analyzing the non-stationary signal like EEG. In this research, the EMD and WPT are used to decompose the input signal. In EMD decomposition, up to 9th IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions) are decomposed. In WPT decomposition, the EEG signal is decomposed up to third level wavelet coefficient. After the decomposition process, different statistical features are extracted, i.e., Shannon entropy, energy, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. However, identifying the optimal sub-band of time-frequency analysis is very challenging. Thus, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select the effective subset of the feature. In the detection process, SVM classifier is used and sleep disorders are classified based on trained knowledge. As a result, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated for various statistical features and to find the optimal features for detecting sleep disorder. According to the experimental results, the proposed model shows improved performance by 4.88% improved classification accuracy.

Since cross-frequency phase synchronization is only strictly possible when two oscillators form a harmonic frequency ratio (e.g., 2:1, 3:1), a recent theory posited that interactions between brain oscillations at different frequencies are facilitated/hindered by the transient occurrence of harmonic/non-harmonic cross-frequency arrangements. In this line, recent evidence has shown that 2:1 harmonic relationships between alpha (8-14 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) rhythms are reduced during meditative states in experienced practitioners. In the present study, we investigated whether mindfulness training in novices is associated with longitudinal changes in alpha-theta cross-frequency dynamics during meditation practice. Methods Thirty-six participants (mean age = 30.3; 2 men) underwent an 8-week mindfulness training program based on the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) syllabus and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (64 electrodes) were performed during a guided meditation before and after the training. Results Mindfulness training compliance (quantified by minutes of attendance and practice at home) was significantly correlated to decreased 3:1 harmonicity and cross-frequency phase synchrony between alpha and theta rhythms during meditation. Conclusions Mindfulness training in novices was shown to be associated with a reduction in alpha-theta cross-frequency coupling during meditation. EEG parameters based on alpha-theta cross-frequency dynamics may be adequate for quantifying and/or facilitating mindfulness meditation training.

In contrast to most existing multivariate time-frequency decomposition approaches, the proposed MNCMD is capable of handling time varying signal efficiently in an elegant variational optimization framework. The multivariate nonlinear chirp mode is defined based on the presence of a joint or common instantaneous frequency component among all channels of input signal. Then the objective function of MNCMD is defined as the sum of mode bandwidths across all signal channels. The alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to optimize the MNCMD problem. MNCMD can extract an optimal set of multivariate modes and their corresponding instantaneous frequencies without requiring more user-defined parameters than the original NCMD. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed MNCMD are demonstrated by studying its mode-alignment, filter bank structure, quasi-orthogonality, the influence of channel number, noise robustness, and convergence. Specifically, we highlight the utility and superiority of the proposed method in three real-world applications, including the analysis of an oceanographic float position record (two-channel), the separation of alpha-rhythms in electroencephalogram (EEG) data (four-channel), and the detection of plant-wide oscillations in industrial control systems (nine-channel).

This study modifies the conventional CSP algorithm to improve the multi-class MI classification accuracy and ensure the computation process is efficient. The EEG MI data is gathered from the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Competition IV. At first, a bandpass filter and a time-frequency analysis are performed for each experiment trial. Then, the optimal EEG signals for every experiment trials are selected based on the signal energy for CSP feature extraction. In the end, the extracted features are classified by three classifiers, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), naive Bayes (NVB), and support vector machine (SVM), in parallel for classification accuracy comparison. The experiment results show the proposed algorithm average computation time is 37.22% less than the FBCSP (1st winner in the BCI Competition IV) and 4.98% longer than the conventional CSP method. For the classification rate, the proposed algorithm kappa value achieved 2nd highest compared with the top 3 winners in BCI Competition IV.

For that purpose, Pearson correlation was calculated between FC and small-worldness (SW). Three undirected FC measures were used: magnitude-squared coherence (MSC), imaginary part of coherency (ICOH), and synchronization likelihood (SL). As a result, statistically significant negative correlation occurred between FC and SW for all three FC measures. Small-worldness of MSC and SL were mostly above 1, but lower than 1 for ICOH, suggesting that functional EEG networks did not have small-world properties. Based on the results of the current study, we suggest that decreased alpha small-world organization is compensated with increased connectivity of alpha oscillations in a healthy brain.

Electrical Brain Activity and Its Functional Connectivity in the Physical Execution of Modern Jazz Dance	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; dance; physical activity; rhythm; coherence; connectivity; brain activity; power spectrum	EEG COHERENCE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT THERAPY; MOTOR CORTEX; EXERCISE; MUSIC; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; AREAS	Besides the pure pleasure of watching a dance performance, dance as a whole-body movement is becoming increasingly popular for health-related interventions. However, the science-based evidence for improvements in health or well-being through dance is still ambiguous and little is known about the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. This may be partly related to the fact that previous studies mostly examined the neurophysiological effects of imagination and observation of dance rather than the physical execution itself. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate acute effects of a physically executed dance with its different components (recalling the choreography and physical activity to music) on the electrical brain activity and its functional connectivity using electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis. Eleven dance-inexperienced female participants first learned a Modern Jazz Dance (MJD) choreography over three weeks (1 h sessions per week). Afterwards, the acute effects on the EEG brain activity were compared between four different test conditions: physically executing the MJD choreography with music, physically executing the choreography without music, imaging the choreography with music, and imaging the choreography without music. Every participant passed each test condition in a randomized order within a single day. EEG rest-measurements were conducted before and after each test condition. Considering time effects the physically executed dance without music revealed in brain activity analysis most increases in alpha frequency and in functional connectivity analysis in all frequency bands. In comparison, physically executed dance with music as well as imagined dance with music led to fewer increases and imagined dance without music provoked noteworthy brain activity and connectivity decreases at all frequency bands. Differences between the test conditions were found in alpha and beta frequency between the physically executed dance and the imagined dance without music as well as between the physically executed dance with and without music in the alpha frequency. The study highlights different effects of a physically executed dance compared to an imagined dance on many brain areas for all measured frequency bands. These findings provide first insights into the still widely unexplored field of neurological effects of dance and encourages further research in this direction.

However, little is known about whether there is a deficit in the relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and RT in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Method: We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 28 older adults with MCI and 28 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) when they were performing an Eriksen flanker task. For each participant, single-trial prestimulus alpha power was calculated for combinations of congruency (congruent vs. incongruent) and response speed (fast vs. slow). Result: Statistical analysis indicated that prestimulus alpha power was significantly lower for fast trials than slow trials in HCs but not in older adults with MCI. The Fisher's z scores of the within-subject correlation coefficients between single-trial prestimulus alpha power and RT were significantly larger in HCs than in older adults with MCI. In addition, machine learning analyses indicated that prestimulus alpha power and its correlation with RT could serve as features to distinguish older adults with MCI from HCs and to predict performance on some neuropsychological tests. Conclusion: The reduced correlation between prestimulus alpha activity and RT suggests that older adults with MCI experience impaired preparatory attention.

Yet, response-locked ERPs raise a methodological issue: on which event should the point of alignment be placed? Response-locked ERPs are usually aligned to the vocal (acoustic) onset, although it is well known that articulatory movements may start up to a hundred milliseconds prior to the acoustic onset and that this "articulatory onset to acoustic onset interval" (AAI) depends on the phoneme properties. Given the previously reported difficulties to measure the AAI, the purpose of this study was to determine if the AAI could be reliably detected with EEG-microstates. High-density EEG was recorded during delayed speech production of monosyllabic pseudowords with four different onset consonants. Whereas the acoustic response onsets varied depending on the onset consonant, the response-locked spatiotemporal EEG analysis revealed a clear asynchrony of the same sequence of microstates across onset consonants. A specific microstate, the latest observed in the ERPs locked to the vocal onset, presented longer duration for phonemes with longer acoustic response onsets. Converging evidences seemed to confirm that this microstate may be related to the articulatory onset of motor execution: its scalp topography corresponded to those previously associated with muscle activity and source localization highlighted the involvement of motor areas. Finally, the analyses on the duration of such microstate in single trials further fit with the AAI intervals for specific phonemes reported in previous studies. These results thus suggest that a particular ERP-microstate is a reliable index of articulation onset and of the AAI.

This paper adopts the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Hurst exponent (H) and fractal dimension (D) to analyze the dynamics of the EEG signals of normal and epileptic patients using a set of physiological time series. Furthermore, a new measure, namely the Combined Index, is proposed. The results indicate that the indices H and D are useful for building a combined measure of the EEG both for healthy and epileptic cerebral activity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Conventional methods utilize waveforms template matching or machine learning for detecting spindles. In the former approach, it is necessary to tune thresholds for individual adaptation, while the latter approach has the problem of imbalanced data because the amount of sleep spindles is small compared with the entire EEG data. The present work proposes a sleep spindle detection method that combines wavelet synchrosqueezed transform (SST) and random under-sampling boosting (RUSBoost). SST is a time-frequency analysis method suitable for extracting features of spindle waveforms. RUSBoost is a framework for coping with the imbalanced data problem. The proposed SST-RUS can deal with the imbalanced data in spindle detection and does not require threshold tuning because RUSBoost uses majority voting of weak classifiers for discrimination. The performance of SST-RUS was validated using an open-access database called the Montreal archives of sleep studies cohort 1 (MASS-C1), which showed an F-measure of 0.70 with a sensitivity of 76.9% and a positive predictive value of 61.2%. The proposed method can reduce the burden of PSG scoring.

In this study, we investigated resting-state Electmencephalography (EEG) data of children with autism and healthy children. The direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF) method was used to estimate the effective connectivity. We introduced and applied the directed temporal network measures for quantifying the effective brain connections in frequency bands of Alpha, Beta1, Beta2, Delta, Theta, and Gamma. Our results showed that each of the global measures was able to demonstrate a significant distinction at least in one frequency band, between the healthy and Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) groups. The burstiness properties of edges and the directed temporal centrality properties of nodes were different in all the frequency bands in both groups. Also, the significant edges and nodes were determined in each group. The number of significant bursty edges in ASD was less than the healthy group, in Alpha, Delta, Betal, and Theta bands. Finally, we could show how autism changes the pattern of the brain network across time.

The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using synthetic nonstationary signals, synthesized signals mimicking electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, manually selected segments of speech signals, and manually selected segments of real EEG signals. The statistical measures, such as hit rate and precision, are used to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than other widely used algorithms, such as the smoothed nonlinear energy detector.

Nonlinear Analysis of Visually Normal EEGs to Differentiate Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; CHILDREN; SEIZURES; SPECTRUM; ENTROPY; COMPLEXITY; PREDICTOR; DYNAMICS; SIGNALS	Childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, previously known as Benign Epilepsy with Centro-temporal Spikes (BECTS) or Rolandic Epilepsy, is one of the most common forms of focal childhood epilepsy. Despite its prevalence, BECTS is often misdiagnosed or missed entirely. This is in part due to the nocturnal and brief nature of the seizures, making it difficult to identify during a routine electroencephalogram (EEG). Detecting brain activity that is highly associated with BECTS on a brief, awake EEG has the potential to improve diagnostic screening for BECTS and predict clinical outcomes. For this study, 31 patients with BECTS were retrospectively selected from the BCH Epilepsy Center database along with a contrast group of 31 patients in the database who had no form of epilepsy and a normal EEG based on a clinical chart review. Nonlinear features, including multiscale entropy and recurrence quantitative analysis, were computed from 30-second segments of awake EEG signals. Differences were found between these multiscale nonlinear measures in the two groups at all sensor locations, while visual EEG inspection by a board-certified child neurologist did not reveal any distinguishing features. Moreover, a quantitative difference in the nonlinear measures (sample entropy, trapping time and the Lyapunov exponents) was found in the centrotemporal region of the brain, the area associated with a greater tendency to have unprovoked seizures, versus the rest of the brain in the BECTS patients. This difference was not present in the contrast group. As a result, the epileptic zone in the BECTS patients appears to exhibit lower complexity, and these nonlinear measures may potentially serve as a clinical screening tool for BECTS, if replicated in a larger study population.

However, to our knowledge no study so far has examined neuronal correlates of performance monitoring using an ecologically valid task outside a typical laboratory setting. Therefore, we examined midfrontal theta and the feedback-related negativity (FRN) using mobile EEG in a physical shooting task within an ecologically valid environment with highly dynamical visual feedback. Participants shot a target using a toy gun while moving and looking around freely. Shots that missed the target evoked stronger midfrontal theta activity than hits and this response was rather phase-unlocked. There was no difference between misses and hits in the FRN. The results raise the question whether the absence of certain ERP components like the FRN could be due to methodological reasons or to the fact that partially different neuronal processes may be activated in the laboratory as compared to more ecologically valid tasks. Overall, our results indicate that crucial neurocognitive processes of performance monitoring can be assessed in highly dynamic and ecologically valid settings by mobile EEG.

Interictal intracranial electroencephalography for predicting surgical success: The importance of space and time	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						cortical localization; EEG; epilepsy surgery; epileptogenic zone; intracranial electrodes	EPILEPTOGENIC NETWORKS; EPILEPSY SURGERY; STRUCTURAL CONNECTOME; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; BRAIN	Objective Predicting postoperative seizure freedom using functional correlation networks derived from interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) has shown some success. However, there are important challenges to consider: (1) electrodes physically closer to each other naturally tend to be more correlated, causing a spatial bias; (2) implantation location and number of electrodes differ between patients, making cross-subject comparisons difficult; and (3) functional correlation networks can vary over time but are currently assumed to be static. Methods In this study, we address these three challenges using intracranial EEG data from 55 patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Patients additionally underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intraoperative computed tomography, and postoperative MRI, allowing accurate localization of electrodes and delineation of the removed tissue. Results We show that normalizing for spatial proximity between nearby electrodes improves prediction of postsurgery seizure outcomes. Moreover, patients with more extensive electrode coverage were more likely to have their outcome predicted correctly (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve > 0.9,P << 0.05) but not necessarily more likely to have a better outcome. Finally, our predictions are robust regardless of the time segment analyzed. Significance Future studies should account for the spatial proximity of electrodes in functional network construction to improve prediction of postsurgical seizure outcomes. Greater coverage of both removed and spared tissue allows for predictions with higher accuracy.

Slow-oscillation activity is reduced and high frequency activity is elevated in older adults with insomnia	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						insomnia; older adults; slow-wave activity; slow-oscillation; hyperarousal	EEG POWER SPECTRA; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; SLEEP EEG; NREM SLEEP; SECONDARY INSOMNIA; THETA ACTIVITY; WAVE ACTIVITY; AGE; HZ; HYPERAROUSAL	Study Objectives: High-frequency electroencephalographic activity (> 16 Hz activity) is often elevated during nonrapid eye movement sleep among individuals with insomnia, in line with the hyperarousal theory of insomnia. Evidence regarding sleep depth marked by slow-wave activity (<4 Hz) is more mixed. Distinguishing subcomponents of slow-wave activity (slow-oscillation [< 1 Hz] or delta activity [1-4 Hz)]) may be critical in understanding these discrepancies, given that these oscillations have different neural generators and are functionally distinct. Here we tested the effects of insomnia diagnosis and insomnia treatment on nonrapid eye movement electroencephalography in older adults, distinguishing slow-oscillation and delta power. Methods: In 93 older adults with insomnia and 71 good sleeper control participants (mean ages 68 years), effects of insomnia and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (insomnia group only) on electroencephalographic spectral power were analyzed. Main effects and interactions with nonrapid eye movement period were assessed for the following frequency bands: slow-oscillation (0.5-1 Hz), delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), sigma (12-16 Hz), and beta (16-32 Hz). Results: Slow-oscillation absolute and relative power were lower in the insomnia group compared with controls. There were no group differences in delta power. Insomnia was also associated with elevated 4-32 Hz absolute and relative power. After cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, absolute sigma and beta activity decreased. Conclusions: Deficits in slow-wave activity in insomnia are specific to the slow-oscillation. Elevated high frequency activity is reduced for sigma and beta power following cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia . These findings inform the pathophysiology of insomnia, including the mechanisms underlying cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in older adults.

The objective of this study is to assess the effects of tVNS on cerebral cortex activity in healthy volunteers using resting-state microstates and power spectrum electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. Eight male subjects aged 25-45 years were recruited in this randomized sham-controlled double-blind study with cross-over design. Real tVNS was administered at the left external acoustic meatus, while sham stimulation was performed at the left ear lobe, both of them for 60 min. The EEG recording lasted 5 min and was performed before and 60 min following the tVNS experimental session. We observed that real tVNS induced an increase in the metrics of microstate A mean duration (p = 0.039) and an increase in EEG power spectrum activity in the delta frequency band (p < 0.01). This study confirms that tVNS is an effective way to stimulate the vagus nerve, and the mechanisms of action of this activation can be successfully studied using scalp EEG quantitative metrics. Future studies are warranted to explore the clinical implications of these findings and to focus the research of the prognostic biomarkers of tVNS therapy for neuropsychiatric diseases.

The capability of such a complex system emerges from specific interactions among smaller entities, a set of events that can be described by the activation of interconnections between brain areas. Studies that focus on brain connectivity have the aim of understanding and modeling brain function, taking into account the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural communication between brain regions. Much of the current knowledge regarding brain connectivity has been obtained from stand-alone neuroimaging methods. Nevertheless, the use of a multimodal approach seems to be a powerful way to investigate effective brain connectivity, overcoming the limitations of unimodal approaches. In this review, we will present the advantages of an integrative approach in which transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography coregistration is combined with magnetic resonance imaging methods to explore effective neural interactions. Moreover, we will describe possible implementations of the integrative approach in open- and closed-loop frameworks where real-time brain activity becomes a contributor to the study of cognitive brain networks.

Previous measures of cognitive load have largely relied on subjective scales but few have explored more objective measures. This paper aims to address this issue by examining the validity of electroencephalography (or EEG) as an objective measure of cognitive load in the context of educational video. EEG is an online brain measure of the electrical activity that a population of neurons elicits when they are activated. Theta power is a brain oscillation ranging from 4 to 7 Hz that has been linked to cognitive and memory performance. We manipulated the linguistic complexity of three texts delivered by a speaker on video to induce a simple, a moderate and a complex level of cognitive load amongst a sample of students pursuing postgraduate studies through the medium of English as a second language (n = 35). We specifically measured intrinsic cognitive load via a subjective scale, a recall test, and theta power as an objective measure (average cognitive load). Our results show that the subjective scale was significantly different across the three levels of linguistic complexity. However, theta power and recall were only significantly different between the two most distinct levels of linguistic complexity. Although, this finding suggests theta power may not be as sensitive for average cognitive load as the subjective scale for intrinsic cognitive load, a correlation analysis shows that theta power was correlated with self-reported cognitive load. However, it may need more power compared to the subjective scale. These findings suggest that theta power may be developed into a valid objective measure of average cognitive load although its true potential lies in the possibility to measure online fluctuations in cognitive load or instantaneous cognitive load.

Small-world EEG network analysis of functional connectivity in developmental dyslexia after visual training intervention	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; functional connectivity; developmental dyslexia; frequency oscillations; connectome; graph theory; neural computation	CENTRAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; BRAIN NETWORK; THETA; INTEGRATION; ATTENTION; MOTION; ALPHA; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS; DEFICITS	Aberrations in functional connectivity in children with developmental dyslexia have been found in electroencephalographic studies using graph analysis. How training with visual tasks can modify the functional semantic network in developmental dyslexia remains unclear. We investigate local and global topological properties of functional networks in multiple EEG frequency ranges based on a small-world propensity method in controls, pre- and post-training dyslexic children during visual word/pseudoword processing. Results indicated that the EEG network topology in dyslexics before the training was more integrated than controls, and after training - more segregated and similar to that of the controls in the theta (theta: 4-8), alpha (alpha: 8-13), beta (beta 1: 13-20; beta 2: 20-30), and gamma (gamma 2 : 30-48; -gamma 2: 52-70 Hz) bands for three graph measures. The pre-training dyslexics exhibited a reduced strength and betweenness centrality of the left anterior temporal and parietal regions in the theta, alpha, beta 1 and -gamma 1-frequency bands, compared to the controls. The simultaneous appearance of hubs in the left hemisphere (or both hemispheres) at temporal and parietal (theta-word/-gamma-pseudoword discrimination), temporal and middle frontal cortex (theta, alpha-word), parietal and middle frontal cortex (beta 1-word), parietal and occipitotemporal cortices (theta-pseudoword), identified in the EEG-based functional networks of normally developing children were not present in the networks of dyslexics. The hub distribution for dyslexics in the theta, alpha, and beta 1 bands became similar to that of the controls. The topological organization of functional networks and the less efficient network configuration (long characteristic path length) in dyslexics compared to the more optimal global organization in the controls was studied for the first time after remediation training.

Five common frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) were extracted from the signals as linear features, as well as, wavelet packet decomposition to break down signals into certain frequency bands. Afterwards, two entropy measures, namely sample entropy and approximate entropy were applied on the wavelet packet coefficients as nonlinear features, and significant features were selected via genetic algorithm (GA). Three machine-learning algorithms were used for classification; including support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP) a novel enhanced K-nearest neighbors (E-KNN), which uses GA to optimize the feature-space distances and provides a feature importance index. The highest accuracy obtained by using frequency-based features was from gamma oscillations which resulted in 91.38%. Performance of nonlinear features were better compared to the frequency-based features and the results showed 94.28% accuracy. The combination of the features showed 98.44% accuracy with the new proposed E-KNN classifier.

Graph-theoretical measures provide a powerful tool for investigating the efficiency of brain network communication in separating and integrating information. Albeit, it has been demonstrated that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) can boost auditory attention in situations with high control demands. its effect on neurophysiological mechanisms of functional brain network communication in situations when attentional focus conflicts with perceptual saliency remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of atDCS on network connectivity and theta-oscillatory power under different levels of attentional-perceptual conflict. We hypothesized that the benefit of atDCS on network communication efficiency would be particularly apparent in conditions requiring high attentional control. Thirty young adults participated in a dichotic listening task with intensity manipulation, while EEG activity was recorded. In a cross-over design. participants underwent right frontal atDCS and sham stimulations in two separate sessions. Time-frequency decomposition and graph-theoretical analyses of network efficiency (using "small-world" properties) were used to quantify theta-oscillatory power and brain network efficiency, respectively. The atDCS-induced effect on task efficiency in the most demanding condition was mirrored only by an increase in network efficiency during atDCS compared with the sham stimulation. These findings are corroborated by Bayesian analyses. AtDCS-induced performance enhancement under high levels of attentional-perceptual conflicts is accompanied by an increase in network efficiency. Graph-theoretical measures can serve as a metric to quantify the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on the separation and integration of information in the brain. NEW & NOTEWORTHY As compared with sham stimulation, application of atDCS enhances theta-oscillation-based network efficiency, but it has no impact on theta-oscillation power. Individual differences in theta-oscillation-based network efficiency correlated with performance efficiency under the sham stimulation.

In visual perception, a considerable portion of trial-to-trial variability can be accounted for by prestimulus magneto/electroencephalographic (M/EEG) alpha oscillations, which play an inhibitory function by means of cross-frequency interactions with gamma-band oscillations. Despite the fundamental theories on the role of oscillations in perception and cognition, the current literature lacks a clear theorization of the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of prestimulus activity, including electrophysiological phenomena at different scales (e.g., local field potentials and macro-scale M/EEG). Here, we present a model called the oscillation-based probability of response (OPR), which directly assesses the link between meso-scale neural mechanisms, macro-scale M/EEG, and behavioural outcome. The OPR includes distinct meso-scale mechanisms through which alpha oscillations modulate M/EEG gamma activity, namely, by decreasing a) the amplitude and/or b) neural synchronization of gamma oscillations. Crucially, the OPR makes specific predictions on the effects of these mechanisms on visual perception, as assessed through the psychometric function. significance statement: The oscillation-based probability of response (OPR) is grounded on a psychophysical approach focusing on the psychometric function estimation and may be highly informative in the study of ongoing brain activity, because it provides a tool for distinguishing different neural mechanisms of alpha-driven modulation of sensory processing.

In order to obtain high performance, the algorithms need to enhance robustness or find class-discriminative bands for the spatial filter. However, the existing methods either cannot derive the spatial and spectral filters with a unique objective function for guaranteeing convergence or rarely consider the combined optimization of spatial-spectral filters and other patterns for enhancing the discrimination. In this study, we present a novel feature extraction method termed Spectrum-weighted Tensor Discriminant Analysis (SwTDA), which optimizes spectral filters along with spatial filters and other associated patterns by tensor-based discriminant analysis. The proposed method considers intrinsic spatial-spectral-temporal information contained by the physiological signal and hence can identify discriminative characteristics robustly. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods on two datasets involving 15 different subjects. Results indicate that the SwTDA method yields higher classification accuracies than the competing methods. Furthermore, interpretable spatial-spectral patterns that are determined by the algorithm can be used for further analysis of the MI-based EEG signal.

Sleep microstructure plays a crucial role in cognitive functioning and brain maturation. In this view, modifications in sleep EEG oscillations in NDDs could further impair the cognitive maturation process in these patients. We provide an overview of sleep microstructure alterations observed in three NDDs without intellectual disabilities (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, high-functioning autism/Asperger syndrome and developmental dyslexia) and their relationships with the disorders' phenomenology. For each NDD, we discuss empirical evidence of altered EEG oscillations, and we consider their interaction with patients' cognitive and behavioural functioning, with the aim to elucidate their functional meaning. We highlight the limits of the present literature and propose possible future directions while underlining the clinical relevance of the research in this field. Beyond confirming the importance of sleep management in atypically developing children, the review findings suggest that sleep EEG oscillations in NDDs could become a target for specific clinical intervention.

However, optimal approaches to reliably extract the EEG phase in a frequency band of interest to inform TMS are still to be identified. Here, we implement a new real-time phase detection method for closed-loop EEG-TMS for robust phase extraction. We compare this algorithm with state-of-the-art methods and evaluate its performance bothin silicoand experimentally.Approach.We propose a new robust algorithm (Educated Temporal Prediction) for delivering real-time EEG phase-specific stimulation based on short prerecorded EEG training data. This method estimates the interpeak period from a training period and applies a bias correction to predict future peaks. We compare the accuracy and computation speed of the ETP algorithm with two existing methods (Fourier based, Autoregressive Prediction) using prerecorded resting EEG data and real-time experiments.Main results. We found that Educated Temporal Prediction performs with higher accuracy than Fourier-based or Autoregressive methods bothin silicoandin vivowhile being computationally more efficient. Further, we document the dependency of the EEG signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on algorithm accuracy across all algorithms.Significance. Our results give important insights for real-time EEG-TMS technical development as well as experimental design. Due to its robustness and computational efficiency, our method can find broad use in experimental research or clinical applications. Through open sharing of code for all three methods, we enable broad access of TMS-EEG real-time algorithms to the community.

NMDARs are composed of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits. The type of NR2 subunit determines electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the receptor. As the precise role of NR2C/D subunit-containing NMDARs is poorly understood in vivo, we have performed behavioural, quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) and polysomnographic analysis following acute pharmacological blockade of these receptor subtypes in adult male CD1 mice. We found that NR2C/D blockade impaired motor coordination and decreased the amount of gross movement. Moreover, EEG power in multiple frequency bands including theta and sigma were found to decrease significantly together with a decrease of theta oscillation frequency. Changes of these qEEG measures were accompanied by a decrease in time spent in slow-wave and rapid eye movement sleep, but an increase of time spent in quiet wakefulness. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease of sleep spindle oscillation density. These findings highlight the importance of NR2C/D-containing NMDARs and take a step towards establishing a link between electrophysiological correlates of psychiatric disorders and underlying synaptic dysfunctions.

However, the neural correlation of this proposed difference in neural representations of familiar and unfamiliar identities remains unclear. New methods of EEG data analysis, functional networks and time frequency analyses, are highly recommended to advance the knowledge of those brain mechanisms. Developing an EEG based pattern recognition system could potentially be used to improve the current person recognition strategies. In this study, we designed a multi-channel EEG based pattern recognition system for person recognition. To do this, a new feature extraction method combining directed functional network analysis and signal complexity of EEGs from different brain regions was proposed, which is the main contribution of this paper. The proposed method was tested in an experiment of 20 subjects underlying visual and auditory stimuli simultaneously. The features were calculated in delta, theta, alpha and beta band respectively, then SVM and KNN classifiers were applied to these feature sets and the results showed the recognition accuracies of these four bands are relatively stable with the best accuracy of 90.58% in delta band for SVM. In addition, theta and alpha band also showed good performance for the two classifiers. It indicated delta wave is the best sub band for person perception and SVM is better than KNN in this system. This work is the first time to construct the directed functional network in person recognition study, and it demonstrated the combination of non-linear complexities and network features are efficient for EEG based expert and intelligent system for person recognition.

An Exploratory Study Using Electroencephalography (EEG) to Measure the Smartphone User Experience in the Short Term	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FLOW EXPERIENCE; TOP-DOWN; OSCILLATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; NEUROSCIENCE; ATTITUDES; EMOTIONS; GENDER; MEMORY	UX (User experience) can influence important user behaviors, including user preference, purchasing decisions, and customer loyalty. The ability to assess UX during the product trial has practical significance for design and improvement of products. In this article, two smartphones with different UX were selected through a focus group. In the EEG (electroencephalography) experiment, we explored the brain signal of users when using two smartphones to complete three tasks. The brain signal of each participant was recorded through Curry Neuroimaging Suite software (Version 7.0, Compumedics Limited, Abbotsford, Australia) when they were using the smartphones. Then results from behavioral, subjective and neural responses were analyzed. The behavioral results showed that participants completed the three tasks faster by using a smartphone with a higher score of UX. The subjective results showed a significant difference between the two smartphones. The patterns of cortical activity were obtained in the five principal frequency bands, Delta (1-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-13 Hz), Beta (13-30 Hz) and Gamma (30-45 Hz). The results indicated that a smartphone with higher scores of UX could evoke stronger relative power of Alpha (fronto-central, parietal and partieto-occipital regions), Delta (frontal region) and Gamma rhythms (C3 site), but weaker relative power of Beta (left central region) and Theta rhythms (frontal and parieto-occipital regions). Also, the correlation analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between EEG and behavioral results. User's subjective experience had a significant positive correlation with the relative power of Gamma band, but a negative correlation with Beta and Theta bands (approximately significant with p = .078 and p = .071). There were also significant correlations between EEG results and sub-items of UX. Our ?ndings suggest that the difference in EEG may be taken as an evaluating indicator of user perception when using products without interruption.

However, our knowledge thus far of the cognitive mechanisms involved in processing different interruption types is limited. In response to this research gap, the present research-in-progress paper proposes that IT intrusions (unnecessary interruptions) and IT interventions (relevant interruptions) impose different types of load on users' cognitive resources. The study employs a self-regulation framework and borrows from the literature on executive functions (EFs), which are a set of general-purpose cognitive processes that control thought and actions. The moderating role of individuals' differences in terms of three EF capabilities as well as the effect of EF loads on task performance are hypothesized. A three-factor (Interruption Frequency x Interruption Type x Executive Function Capability) mixed-design experiment using electroencephalography is proposed to test the generated hypotheses.

For 3D visual fatigue evaluation, previous studies focused on exploring the changes of frequency-domain features in EEG for various fatigue degrees. However, their time-domain features were scarcely investigated. In this study, a modified paradigm with a random disparities order is adopted to evoke the depth-related visual evoked potentials (DVEPs). Then the characteristics of the DVEPs components for various fatigue degrees are compared using one-way repeated-measurement ANOVA. Point-by-point permutation statistics revealed sample points from 100ms to 170ms - including P1 and N1 - in sensors Pz and P4 changed significantly with visual fatigue. More specifically, we find that the amplitudes of P1 and N1 change significantly when visual fatigue increases. Additionally, independent component analysis identify P1 and N1 which originate from posterior cingulate cortex are associated statistically with 3D visual fatigue. Our results indicate there is a significant correlation between 3D visual fatigue and P1 amplitude, as well as N1, of DVEPs on right parietal areas. We believe the characteristics (e.g., amplitude and latency) of identified components may be the indicators of 3D visual fatigue evaluation. Furthermore, we argue that 3D visual fatigue may be associated with the activities decrease of the attention and the processing capacity of disparity.

Because the resting state is crucial for cognitive functioning and electroencephalography (EEG) can reflect instantaneous neural activity, we investigated theta phase-gamma amplitude coupling (TGC) of resting-state EEG and its relationship with cognitive function in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) to reveal the neural correlates of cognitive dysfunction. Methods: A total of 59 FEP patients and 50 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state, eyes-closed EEG recordings and performed the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A) and Part B (TMT-B) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). TGC from the source signal of the resting-state EEG in default mode network (DMN)-related brain regions was compared between groups. Correlation analyses were performed between TGC and cognitive function test performance in FEP patients. Results: Mean resting-state TGC was larger for the FEP patients than for the HCs. Patients with FEP showed in-creased TGC in the left posterior cingulate cortex, which was correlated with better performance on the TMT-A and TMT-B and on immediate and delayed recall in the MT. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with FEP show compensatory hyperactivation of resting-state TGC in DMN-related brain regions, which may be related to the reallocation of cognitive resources to prepare for successful cognitive execution. This study not only highlights the neural underpinnings of cognitive dysfunction in FEP patients but also provides useful background to support the development of treatments for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Under the background of artificial intelligence, medical and nonmedical robots have rapidly developed and have gradually been applied to enhance the quality of people's lives. We focus on connecting the brain with a mobile home robot by translating brain signals to computer commands to build a brain-computer interface that may offer the promise of greatly enhancing the quality of life of disabled and able-bodied people by considerably improving their autonomy, mobility, and abilities. Several types of robots have been controlled using BCI systems to complete real-time simple and/or complicated tasks with high performances. In this paper, a new EEG-based intelligent teleoperation system was designed for a mobile wall-crawling cleaning robot. This robot uses crawler type instead of the traditional wheel type to be used for window or floor cleaning. For EEG-based system controlling the robot position to climb the wall and complete the tasks of cleaning, we extracted steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) from the collected electroencephalography (EEG) signal. The visual stimulation interface in the proposed SSVEP-based BCI was composed of four flicker pieces with different frequencies (e.g., 6 Hz, 7.5 Hz, 8.57 Hz, and 10 Hz). Seven subjects were able to smoothly control the movement directions of the cleaning robot by looking at the corresponding flicker using their brain activity. To solve the multiclass problem, thereby achieving the purpose of cleaning the wall within a short period, the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) classification algorithm had been used. Offline and online experiments were held to analyze/classify EEG signals and use them as real-time commands. The proposed system was efficient in the classification and control phases with an obtained accuracy of 89.92% and had an efficient response speed and timing with a bit rate of 22.23 bits/min.

J	Upadhyay, PK; Nagpal, C				Upadhyay, Prabhat Kumar; Nagpal, Chetna			Time-frequency analysis and fuzzy-based detection of heat-stressed sleep EEG spectra	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Sleep stages; Neuro-fuzzy system; EEG; Awake; SWS; REM	SINGLE-CHANNEL EEG; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; STAGE CLASSIFICATION; SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; INFERENCE SYSTEM; EMPLOYING EEG; EPILEPSY; APNEA; EMG	Nowadays, sleep disorders are contemplated as the major issue in the human lives. The current work aims at extraction of time-frequency information from recorded dataset and provides an efficient sleep stage detection method. Recordings of brain signal namely electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram (EMG) were carried out under defined clinical condition for the classification of sleep EEG. Subsequent upon the extraction of various features from the raw EEG data, neuro-fuzzy system is trained to classify the sleep stages into three major classes namely awake, slow wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement sleep (REM). This classification would enable medical professionals to diagnose sleep related disorders accurately. The results obtained clearly indicate that the mean performance for SWS stage is profound as compared to REM and awake stage. Specificity and sensitivity of the proposed method are obtained as 95.4% and 80%, respectively. The average accuracy of the system employing neuro-fuzzy approach is found to be 90.6% in which SWS stage was best detected among the other stages of sleep EEG.

Not only has their occurrence been linked to epileptogenesis, but also to physiologic processes, such as memory consolidation. There are at least two big challenges for HFO research. First, detection, when performed manually, is time consuming and prone to rater biases, but when performed automatically, it is biased by artifacts mimicking HFOs. Second, distinguishing physiologic from pathologic HFOs in patients with epilepsy is problematic. Here we automatically and manually detected HFOs in intracranial EEGs (iEEG) of patients with epilepsy, recorded during a visual memory task in order to assess the feasibility of the different detection approaches to identify task-related ripples, supporting the physiologic nature of HFOs in the temporal lobe. Methods: Ten patients with unclear seizure origin and bilaterally implanted macroelectrodes took part in a visual memory consolidation task. In addition to iEEG, scalp EEG, electrooculography (EOG), and facial electromyography (EMG) were recorded. iEEG channels contralateral to the suspected epileptogenic zone were inspected visually for HFOs. Furthermore, HFOs were marked automatically using an RMS detector and a Stockwell classifier. We compared the two detection approaches and assessed a possible link between task performance and HFO occurrence during encoding and retrieval trials. Results: HFO occurrence rates were significantly lower when events were marked manually. The automatic detection algorithm was greatly biased by filter-artifacts. Surprisingly, EOG artifacts as seen on scalp electrodes appeared to be linked to many HFOs in the iEEG. Occurrence rates could not be associated to memory performance, and we were not able to detect strictly defined "clear" ripples. Conclusion: Filtered graphoelements in the EEG are known to mimic HFOs and thus constitute a problem. So far, in invasive EEG recordings mostly technical artifacts and filtered epileptiform discharges have been considered as sources for these "false" HFOs. The data at hand suggests that even ocular artifacts might bias automatic detection in invasive recordings. Strict guidelines and standards for HFO detection are necessary in order to identify artifact-derived HFOs, especially in conditions when cognitive tasks might produce a high amount of artifacts.

In recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on electroencephalography (EEG) have developed rapidly. However, the decoding of voluntary finger pre-movements from EEG is still a challenge for BCIs. This study aimed to analyze the pre-movement EEG features in time and frequency domains and design an efficient method to decode the movement-related patterns. Approach. In this study, we first investigated the EEG features induced by the intention of left and right finger movements. Specifically, the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) features were extracted using discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM) and common spatial patterns (CSP), respectively. Then, the two types of features were classified by two fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) classifiers, respectively. Their decision values were further assembled to facilitate the classification. To verify the validity of the proposed method, a private dataset containing 12 subjects and a public dataset from BCI competition II were used for estimating the classification accuracy. Main results. As a result, for the private dataset, the combination of DCPM and CSP achieved an average accuracy of 80.96%, which was 5.08% higher than the single DCPM method (p < 0.01) and 10.23% higher than the single CSP method (p < 0.01). Notably, the highest accuracy could achieve 91.5% for the combination method. The test accuracy of dataset IV of BCI competition II was 90%, which was equal to the best result in the existing literature. Significance. The results demonstrate the MRCP and ERD features of pre-movements contain significantly discriminative information, which are complementary to each other, and thereby could be well recognized by the proposed combination method of DCPM and CSP. Therefore, this study provides a promising approach for the decoding of pre-movement EEG patterns, which is significant for the development of BCIs.

However, the use of neuroimaging techniques and tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) in school-based interventions and research is limited, largely due to the high costs and physical constraints of conventional research- or medical-grade equipment. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological data can provide useful evidence to validate the efficacy of interventions. The present study explores the utility of lightweight, affordable, and easy-to-set-up EEG systems for use in school-based research with children. Specifically, we examine the effects of a deep-breathing-for-test-anxiety intervention on brain electrical activity during a flanker distractor interference task in eleven-year olds, comparing the pattern of results observed using a consumer-grade EEG system (Emotiv EPOC +) against that obtained using a medical-grade EEG system (Neurostyle). Behavioral, EEG, and respiratory data was obtained from Primary 5 students (N = 45; M-age = 10.88, SD = 0.33), split into Emotiv and Neurostyle groups. The aim of the study was two-fold: to examine the effects of deep breathing on neurophysiological and behavioral correlates of inhibitory control of attention in children, and to understand the affordances and limitations of the Emotiv EPOC + system for school-based research with children. Results from power spectral analyses suggest that deep breathing may enhance attentional control on a neural level by modulating brain electrical activity on several frequencies. Despite limitations, the consumer-grade EEG system appears to be capable of detecting some degree of power spectral differences associated with intervention effects.

J	Shen, LL; Dong, XX; Li, YP				Shen, Lili; Dong, Xinxin; Li, Yueping			Analysis and classification of hybrid EEG features based on the depth DRDS videos	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Vision cognition; DRDS; Common spatial group; EEG; Hybrid features	IMAGERY; PATTERNS	Background: Stereo vision cognition is a crucial advanced function of human beings, and stereoscopic acuity is an important index to detect stereo vision. Electroencephalograph (EEG) is an effective method of detection. Therefore, it has great significance to research the relationship between stereoscopic acuity and EEG signals for the development of 3D technology. New method: This paper proposes a multi-channel selection sparse time window common spatial group (MCS-STWCSG) multi-classification method. Firstly, a channel selection method based on improved common spatial pattern- (CSP-) rank is applied to select optimal channels to reduce redundant signal. Secondly, based on the one vs. one (OVO) computational model, we extend traditional CSP to the common spatial group (CSG) to implement three-classification. Finally, this paper optimizes time-frequency characteristics and hybrid signal features by sparse regression and utilizes a support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel to identify depth dynamic random dot stereogram (DRDS) video tasks. Results: The selected channels are all located in and near the occipital region and time-frequency characteristics can acquire better classification results compared with frequency characteristics. The highest classification result can reach 94.67%. Comparison with existing methods: The MCS-STWCSG multi-classification method optimizes features from multiple aspects and its performance is obviously better than other methods for hybrid EEG signals of depth DRDS. Conclusions: Channel selection and time-frequency segmentation for feature extraction and classification algorithm of EEG signals can increase the classification accuracy. It proves the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method.

Clinical and EEG datasets in 100 ADD and 100 Nold individuals matched as demography, education, and gender were taken from an international archive. Standard delta (< 4 Hz) and alpha1 (8-10.5 Hz) bands were used for the main analysis, while alpha2 (10.5-13 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), beta1 (13-20 Hz), beta2 (20-35 Hz), and gamma (35-40 Hz) served as controls. In the interpretation, the higher the alpha1 power (density), the lower that arousal. As expected, when compared to the Nold group, the ADD group showed higher global (scalp) power density at the delta-theta band and lower global power density at the alpha-beta bands. As novel findings, we observed that: (1) in the Nold group, the global delta and alpha1-2 power were negatively and linearly correlated; (2) in the ADD group, this correlation was just marginal; and (3) in both Nold and AD groups, the EEG epochs with the highest delta power (median value for stratification) were associated with the lowest global alpha1 power. This effect was related to eLORETA freeware solutions showing maximum alpha1 source activations in posterior cortical regions. These results suggest that even in quiet wakefulness, delta and alpha rhythms are related to each other, and ADD partially affects this cross-band neurophysiological mechanism.

Differential neural processing of spontaneous blinking under visual and auditory sensory environments: An EEG investigation of blink-related oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Blink-related oscillations; Sensory modulation; Spontaneous blinking; EEG; Visual; Auditory	VEGETATIVE STATE; DEFAULT MODE; ACTIVATION; PRECUNEUS; RECOVERY; NETWORK	Blink-related oscillations (BROs) are a recently discovered neurophysiological response associated with sponta-neous blinking, distinct from the well-known oculomotor and visual suppression effects. BROs strongly activate the bilateral precuneus along with other cortical regions involved in visuospatial processing and associative episodic memory, and are believed to represent environmental monitoring processes that occur following blink -induced visual interruptions. Although these responses have been reported across multiple imaging modalities under both resting and cognitive loading conditions, it is yet unknown whether these responses also exist under external sensory stimulation conditions. To address this, we investigated BRO responses in healthy adults using 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG), while participants underwent passive external auditory and visual stimulation. Our results showed that BRO responses are present under both auditory and visual stimulation conditions (p < 0.05), with similar temporal and spectral features compared to rest. However, visual stimulation did result in decreased BRO amplitude compared to auditory and resting conditions (p < 0.05), suggesting decreased neuronal resources for processing blink-related information in the visual but not auditory environment. There were also additional pre-blink spectral changes in the visual condition compared to rest (p < 0.05), which suggest that passive visual stimulation induces neural preparatory processes occurring in anticipation of the upcoming blink event. Together, these findings provide new and compelling evidence that blink-related neural processes are modulated not only by the internal cognitive loading due to simultaneous task demands, but also by competing external sensory requirements. This highlights the link between blinking and cognition, and further demonstrates the importance of BROs as a new window into brain function.

Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks Discriminate Adult ADHD From Healthy Individuals on the Basis of Event-Related Spectral EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deep learning; EEG; ERP; ADHD; neuroimaging; brain disease diagnosis	CLASSIFICATION; PREVALENCE; POTENTIALS; COMORBIDITY; INHIBITION; MODULATION; DIAGNOSIS; CHILDREN; BMD	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a four-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG time-frequency decompositions (spectrograms) of electroencephalography data (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) from ADHD patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) collected during the Flanker Task, with 2800 samples for each group. We treat the data as in audio or image classification approaches, where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. The model reaches a classification accuracy of 88% +/- 1.12%, outperforming the Recurrent Neural Network and the Shallow Neural Network used for comparison, and with the key advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. The event-related spectrograms also provide greater accuracy compared to resting state EEG spectrograms. Finally, through the use of feature visualization techniques such as DeepDream, we show that the main features exciting the CNN nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the delta-theta band around 100 ms for ADHD patients compared to healthy controls, suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with larger clinical samples is necessary, these results suggest that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, highlighting the potential of this methodology to develop biomarkers of practical clinical utility.

Pilot Study of An Intracranial Electroencephalography Biomarker of Depressive Symptoms in Epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; THETA CORDANCE; EEG POWER; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; DYSFUNCTION; PREDICTION; FREQUENCY; ASYMMETRY	Objectives: Adult patients with epilepsy have an increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD). Intracranial EEG (iEEG) captured during extended inpatient monitoring of patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy offers a particularly promising method to study MDD networks in epilepsy. Methods: The authors used 24 hours of resting-state iEEG to examine the neural activity patterns within corticolimbic structures that reflected the presence of depressive symptoms in 13 adults with medication-refractory epilepsy. Principal component analysis was performed on the z-scored mean relative power in five standard frequency bands averaged across electrodes within a region. Results: Principal component 3 was a statistically significant predictor of the presence of depressive symptoms (R-2 =0.35, p=0.014). A balanced logistic classifier model using principal component 3 alone correctly classified 78% of patients as belonging to the group with a high burden of depressive symptoms or a control group with minimal depressive symptoms (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 80%; area under the curve = 0.8. leave-one-out cross validation). Classification was dependent on beta power throughout the corticolimbic network and low-frequency cingulate power. Conclusions: These finding suggest, for the first time, that neural features across circuits involved in epilepsy may distinguish patients who have depressive symptoms from those who do not. Larger studies are required to validate these findings and to assess their diagnostic utility in MDD.

Effectiveness of Visual vs. Acoustic Closed-Loop Stimulation on EEG Power Density during NREM Sleep in Humans	CLOCKS & SLEEP			English	Article						healthy subjects; NREM sleep; delta wave power density; acoustic stimulation; visual stimulation	SLOW OSCILLATIONS; LIGHT; WAVE	The aim of the study was to investigate whether visual stimuli have the same potency to increase electroencephalography (EEG) delta wave power density during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep as do auditory stimuli that may be practical in the treatment of some sleep disturbances. Nine healthy subjects underwent two polysomnography sessions-adaptation and experimental-with EEG electrodes positioned at Fz-Cz. Individually adjusted auditory (pink noise) and visual (light-emitting diode (LED) red light) paired 50-ms signals were automatically presented via headphones/eye mask during NREM sleep, shortly (0.75-0.90 s) after the EEG wave descended below a preset amplitude threshold (closed-loop in-phase stimulation). The alternately repeated 30-s epochs with stimuli of a given modality (light, sound, or light and sound simultaneously) were preceded and followed by 30-s epochs without stimulation. The number of artifact-free 1.5-min cycles taken in the analysis was such that the cycles with stimuli of different modalities were matched by number of stimuli presented. Acoustic stimuli caused an increase (p < 0.01) of EEG power density in the frequency band 0.5-3.0 Hz (slow waves); the values reverted to baseline at post-stimuli epochs. Light stimuli did not influence EEG slow wave power density (p > 0.01) and did not add to the acoustic stimuli effects. Thus, dim red light presented in a closed-loop in-phase fashion did not influence EEG power density during nocturnal sleep.

In this paper, we propose a novel regional attention convolutional neural network (RACNN) to take full advantage of spectral-spatial-temporal features for EEG motion intention recognition. Time-frequency based analysis is adopted to reveal spectral-temporal features in terms of neural oscillations of primary sensorimotor. The basic idea of RACNN is to identify the activated area of the primary sensorimotor adaptively. The RACNN aggregates a varied number of spectral-temporal features produced by a backbone convolutional neural network into a compact fixed-length representation. Inspired by the neuroscience findings that functional asymmetry of the cerebral hemisphere, we propose a region biased loss to encourage high attention weights for the most critical regions. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets and real-world BCI dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods.

However, neural mechanisms underlying the response outcome in working memory is still unclear. High temporal resolution and improved spatial resolution of dense array electroencephalogram (EEG) make it an ideal tool to investigate the dynamics of brain networks. In the present study, the brain activity of twenty healthy male volunteers was investigated during correct and error trials of visuospatial working memory task using dense array EEG. Independent brain components were identified using independent component analysis (ICA). Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) were computed for each independent component using Morlet wavelet transform for the frequency range of 3-70 Hz. ERSP of independent component clusters identified using K-means algorithm were statistically compared between correct and error trials. Delta and theta power increased in the component cluster located at cingulate gyrus before the error response of visuospatial working memory task. The current study findings suggest that cingulate oscillatory activity might reflect the quality of memory representation and intensity of target uncertainty during the visuospatial search.

Gaming disorder and internet addiction: A systematic review of resting-state EEG studies	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Review						EEG; Videogames; Gaming disorder; Gaming addiction; Internet addiction; Resting-state; Neuroimaging	GAMMA ACTIVITY; DEPRESSION; CORTEX; BETA; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; COMORBIDITY; RESILIENCE; COHERENCE; CRITERIA	Neurophysiological studies of Gaming Disorder (GD) and internet addiction (IA) are providing important insight into neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning these disorders, which will enable more accurate diagnostic classification. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used to investigate addictive behaviours, and offers advantages of accessibility, low cost, and excellent temporal resolution. The present systematic review evaluates resting-state EEG studies in GD and IA. Papers (n = 7293) were identified in the PsychARTICLES, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Pubmed databases. Following inclusion/exclusion criteria, ten studies remained for evaluation. Results suggest individuals with GD have raised delta and theta activity and reduced beta activity, with coherence analysis suggesting altered brain activity in the mid-to-high frequency range. IA individuals demonstrate raised gamma activity and reduced beta and delta activity. Results suggest that the altered brain activity found in GD/IA may represent distinct underlying neurophysiological markers or traits, lending further support to their unique constructs. Results are also discussed in relation to relevant psychometric measurements and similar (higher frequency) activity found in substance addiction. Future research should focus on replicating the findings in a wider variety of cultural contexts to support the neurophysiological basis of classifying GD and IA.

Nevertheless, performance depends on the feature extraction phase, where the aim is to find relevant patterns related to different mental activities. Thus, in this work, an approach to extract features from EEG signals is proposed based on spectrograms: Firstly, STFT is applied to EEG to obtain time-frequency representations, where parameters such as window length and type are experimented based on the EEG signal frequency. After that, spectral peaks are found to be used as reference in order to obtain descriptors per spectrogram. Three ways for extracting features from EEG are presented, the first based on frequency and surfaces, the second using K-means to extract features and the adaptation of local ternary pattern, and finally, a third using maximum peaks. The extracted descriptors are evaluated by means of a multilayer perceptron, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. The proposed approach was evaluated using the dataset from Bonn University, identifying a healthy person and an epileptic attack classes as main task. According to the experimental results, the proposed method obtains acceptable accuracy (100%) in several cases by considering fewer features than those extracted by other related works.

The aim of the present research is to examine the changes in synergy patterns in different brain regions while learning the dart throwing skill with the dominant and non-dominant hand. The sample population consisted of 10 students aged 23 +/- 2.5 divided into two groups of dominant and non-dominant hand. To record brain activities, a 32-channel wireless Electroencephalography (EEG) system was used. Data were recorded through three stages of pre-test (pre-training), acquisition (after 4 weeks of training) and retention (after one week of non-training). EEG signals were analysed in alpha, beta and gamma bands. EEG analysis showed that the synergy patterns during acquisition and retention stages were significantly similar to each other and largely different from the pre-training stage in all three bands. Increasing activity levels of the contralateral cortical areas and formation of a different activity pattern after learning in the two groups, were other results obtained. Learning a new motor skill requires relatively lasting changes in the brain map and synergy patterns of brain activities are different for motor learning when the dominant or non-dominant hand is used.

In this context, we present a spatial memory experiment consisting of a large number of stimuli to study the effect of task difficulty on map users' behavior through cognitive load measurements. Next to the reaction time and success rate, we used fixation and saccade related eye tracking metrics (i.e., average fixation duration, the number of fixations per second, saccade amplitude and saccade velocity), and EEG power spectrum (i.e., event-related changes in alpha and theta frequency bands) to identify the cognitive load. While fixation metrics indicated no statistically significant difference between experts and novices, saccade metrics proved the otherwise. EEG power spectral density analysis, on the other side, suggested an increase in theta (i.e., event-related synchronization) and a decrease in alpha (except moderate tasks) (i.e., event-related desynchronization) at all difficulty levels of the task for both experts and novices, which is an indicator of cognitive load. Although no significant difference emerged between two groups, we found a significant difference in their overall performances when the participants were classified as good and relatively bad learners. Triangulating EEG results with the recorded eye tracking data and the qualitative analysis of focus maps indeed provided a detailed insight on the differences of the individuals' cognitive processes during this spatial memory task.

J	Pascucci, D; Rubega, M; Plomp, G				Pascucci, D.; Rubega, M.; Plomp, G.			Modeling time-varying brain networks with a self-tuning optimized Kalman filter	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; GRANGER CAUSALITY ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUAL-MOTION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AR MODELS; EEG	Brain networks are complex dynamical systems in which directed interactions between different areas evolve at the sub-second scale of sensory, cognitive and motor processes. Due to the highly non-stationary nature of neural signals and their unknown noise components, however, modeling dynamic brain networks has remained one of the major challenges in contemporary neuroscience. Here, we present a new algorithm based on an innovative formulation of the Kalman filter that is optimized for tracking rapidly evolving patterns of directed functional connectivity under unknown noise conditions. The Self-Tuning Optimized Kalman filter (STOK) is a novel adaptive filter that embeds a self-tuning memory decay and a recursive regularization to guarantee high network tracking accuracy, temporal precision and robustness to noise. To validate the proposed algorithm, we performed an extensive comparison against the classical Kalman filter, in both realistic surrogate networks and real electroencephalography (EEG) data. In both simulations and real data, we show that the STOK filter estimates time-frequency patterns of directed connectivity with significantly superior performance. The advantages of the STOK filter were even clearer in real EEG data, where the algorithm recovered latent structures of dynamic connectivity from epicranial EEG recordings in rats and human visual evoked potentials, in excellent agreement with known physiology. These results establish the STOK filter as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic network structures in biological systems, with the potential to yield new insights into the rapid evolution of network states from which brain functions emerge. Author summary During normal behavior, brains transition between functional network states several times per second. This allows humans to quickly read a sentence, and a frog to catch a fly. Understanding these fast network dynamics is fundamental to understanding how brains work, but up to now it has proven very difficult to model fast brain dynamics for various methodological reasons. To overcome these difficulties, we designed a new Kalman filter (STOK) by innovating on previous solutions from control theory and state-space modelling. We show that STOK accurately models fast network changes in simulations and real neural data, making it an essential new tool for modelling fast brain networks in the time and frequency domain.

An analysis on consumer behaviour and brain activity during a wine tasting experience	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Wine tasting; EEG; Neuromarketing; Consumer neuroscience; Beta band; Wine preferences	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; BAND	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess whether or not electroencephalography (EEG) provides a valuable and substantial contribution to the prediction of consumer behaviour and their preferences during product consumption. In this study, the authors especially focus on individual preferences during a wine tasting experience. Design/methodology/approach A consumer neuroscience experiment was carried out with 26 participants that evaluated different red wines while their brain activity was recorded with EEG. A within-subjects design was employed and the experiment was carried out in two sessions. All participants took part in a blind taste session (no label session), in which information about the wine was not disclosed, and a normal taste session (label session), during which the bottle and its label were visible. Findings The findings suggest that EEG is a useful tool to study brain activity during product experience. EEG has high temporal resolution, low costs, small dimensions and superior manoeuvrability compared to other consumer neuroscience tools. However, it is noticed that there is a lack of solid theoretical background regarding brain areas (e.g. frontal cortex) and brain activity (e.g. brain waves) related to consumer preferences during product experience. This lack of knowledge causes several difficulties in replicating and validating the findings of other consumer neuroscience experiments for studying consumer behaviour. Originality/value The experiment presented in this paper is an exploratory study. It provides insights into the possible contribution of EEG data to the prediction of consumer behaviour during product experience.

False alarms reduction in non-convulsive status epilepticus detection via continuous EEG analysis	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						EEG analysis; seizure detection; false alarms; non-convulsive status epilepticus	SEIZURE DETECTION; VISIBILITY GRAPHS; CARE; PATTERNS	Objective: Frequent false alarms from computer-assisted monitoring systems may harm the safety of patients with non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). In this study, we aimed at reducing false alarms in the NCSE detection based on preventing from three common errors: over-interpretation of abnormal background activity, dense short ictal discharges and continuous interictal discharges as ictal discharges.Approach: We analyzed 10 participants' hospital-archived 127-hour electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with 310 ictal discharges. To reduce the false alarms caused by abnormal background activity, we used morphological features extracted by visibility graph methods in addition to time-frequency features. To reduce the false alarms caused by over-interpreting short ictal discharges and interictal discharges, we created two synthetic classes-'Suspected Non-ictal' and 'Suspected Ictal'-based on the misclassified categories and constructed a synthetic 4-class dataset combining the standard two classes-'Non-ictal' and 'Ictal'-to train a 4-class classifier. Precision-recall curves were used to compare our proposed 4-class classification model and the standard 2-class classification model with or without the morphological features in the leave-one-out cross validation stage. The sensitivity and precision were primarily used as performance metrics for the detection of a seizure event.Main results: The 4-class classification model improved the performance of the standard 2-class model, in particular increasing the precision by 15% at an 80% sensitivity level when only time-frequency features were used. Using the morphological features, the 4-class classification model achieved the best performances: a sensitivity of 93% +/- 12% and a precision of 55% +/- 30% in the group level. 100% accuracy was reached in a participant's 4.3-hour recording with 5 ictal discharges.Significance: False alarms in the NCSE detection were remarkably reduced using the morphological features and the proposed 4-class classification model.

Hippocampal Theta Oscillations Support Successful Associative Memory Formation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						associative recognition; episodic memory; hippocampus; intracranial electroencephalography	HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; WORKING-MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; REINSTATEMENT; RETRIEVAL; RESET; AGE	Models of memory formation posit that episodic memory formation depends critically on the hippocampus, which binds features of an event to its context. For this reason, the contrast between study items that are later recollected with their associative pair versus those for which no association is made fails should reveal electrophysiological patterns in the hippocampus selectively involved in associative memory encoding. Extensive data from studies in rodents support a model in which theta oscillations fulfill this role, but results in humans have not been as clear. Here, we used an associative recognition memory procedure to identify hippocampal correlates of successful associative memory encoding and retrieval in patients (10 females and 9 males) undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring. We identified a dissociation between 2-5 Hz and 5-9 Hz theta oscillations, by which power increases in 2-5Hz oscillations were uniquely linked with successful associative memory in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus. These oscillations exhibited a significant phase reset that also predicted successful associative encoding and distinguished recollected from nonrecollected items at retrieval, as well as contributing to relatively greater reinstatement of encoding-related patterns for recollected versus nonrecollected items. Our results provide direct electrophysiological evidence that 2-5Hz hippocampal theta oscillations preferentially support the formation of associative memories, although we also observed memory-related effects in the 5-9Hz frequency range using measures such as phase reset and reinstatement of oscillatory activity.

J	Li, Y; Xiang, JY; Kesavadas, T				Li, Yao; Xiang, Jiayi; Kesavadas, Thenkurussi			Convolutional Correlation Analysis for Enhancing the Performance of SSVEP-Based Brain-Computer Interface	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain modeling; Electroencephalography; Correlation; Deep learning; Training; Benchmark testing; Task analysis; Brain-computer interface (BCI); convolutional correlation analysis (Conv-CA); deep learning; electroencephalo-gram (EEG); steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)		Currently, most of the high-performance models for frequency recognition of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are linear. However, SSVEPs collected from different channels can have non-linear relationship among each other. Linearly combining electroencephalogram (EEG) from multiple channels is not the most accurate solution in SSVEPs classification. To further improve the performance of SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI), we propose a convolutional neural network-based non-linear model, i.e. convolutional correlation analysis (Conv-CA). Different from pure deep learning models, Conv-CA use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the top of a self-defined correlation layer. The CNNs function on how to transform multiple channel EEGs into a single EEG signal. The correlation layer calculates the correlation coefficients between the transformed single EEG signal and reference signals. The CNNs provide non-linear operations to combine EEGs in different channels and different time. And the correlation layer constrains the fitting space of the deep learning model. A comparison study between the proposed Conv-CA method and the task-related component analysis (TRCA) based methods is conducted. Both methods are validated on a 40-class SSVEP benchmark dataset recorded from 35 subjects. The study verifies that the Conv-CA method significantly outperforms the TRCA-based methods. Moreover, Conv-CA has good explainability since its inputs of the correlation layer can be analyzed for visualizing what the model learnt from the data. Conv-CA is a non-linear extension of spatial filters. Its CNN structures can be further explored and tuned for reaching a better performance. The structure of combining neural networks and unsupervised features has the potential to be applied to the classification of other signals.

J	Wang, QH; Wei, HL; Wang, LN; Xu, S				Wang, Qinghua; Wei, Hua-Liang; Wang, Lina; Xu, Song			A novel time-varying modeling and signal processing approach for epileptic seizure detection and classification	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epileptic seizure detection; Time-varying process; Ultra-regularized orthogonal forward regression (UROFR); Time-frequency analysis; Bayesian optimization	WAVELET TRANSFORM; FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTION; NETWORKS; TERM	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays an essential role in detecting and understanding epileptic seizures. It is known that seizure processes are nonlinear and non-stationary, discriminating between rhythmic discharges and dynamic change is a challenging task in EEG-based seizure detection. In this paper, a new time-varying (TV) modeling framework, based on an autoregressive (AR) model structure, is proposed to characterize and analyze EEG signals. The TV parameters of the AR model are approximated through a multi-wavelet basis function expansion (MWBF) approach. An effective ultra-regularized orthogonal forward regression (UROFR) algorithm is employed to significantly reduce and refine the resulting expanded model. Given a time-varying process, the proposed TVAR-MWBF-UROFR method can generate a parsimonious TVAR model, based on which a high-resolution power spectrum density (PSD) estimation can be obtained. Informative features are then defined and extracted from the PSD estimation. The TVAR-MWBF-UROFR method is applied to a number of real EEG datasets; features obtained from these datasets are then used for seizure detection and classification. To make the results more accurate and reliable, a PCA algorithm is adopted to select the optimal feature subset, and a Bayesian optimization technique based on the Gaussian process is performed to determine the coefficients associated with each of the classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two benchmark datasets, and the experimental results indicate that TVAR-MWBF-UROFR outperforms the compared state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and robustness.

We and others recently demonstrated that it also serves as an important node in sleep/wake regulation. Specifically, VTA-dopaminergic neuron activation is sufficient to drive wakefulness and necessary for the maintenance of wakefulness. However, the role of VTA-GABAergic neurons in arousal regulation is not fully understood. It is still unclear whether VTA-GABAergic neurons predictably alter their activity across arousal states, what is the nature of interactions between VTA-GABAergic activity and cortical oscillations, and how activity in VTA-GABAergic neurons relates to VTA-dopaminergic neurons in the context of sleep/wake regulation. To address these, we simultaneously recorded population activity from VTA subpopulations and electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG) signals during spontaneous sleep/wake states and in the presence of salient stimuli in freely-behaving mice. We found that VTA-GABAergic neurons exhibit robust arousal-state-dependent alterations in population activity, with high activity and transients during wakefulness and REM sleep. During wakefulness, population activity of VTA-GABAergic neurons, but not VTA-dopaminergic neurons, was positively correlated with EEG gamma power and negatively correlated with theta power. During NREM sleep, population activity in both VTA-GABAergic and VTA-dopaminergic neurons negatively correlated with delta, theta, and sigma power bands. Salient stimuli, with both positive and negative valence, activated VTA-GABAergic neurons. Together, our data indicate that VTA-GABAergic neurons, like their dopaminergic counterparts, drastically alter their activity across sleep-wake states. Changes in their activity predicts cortical oscillatory patterns reflected in the EEG, which are distinct from EEG spectra associated with dopaminergic neural activity.

To characterize the functional role of the occipito-temporal theta-band increase during the processing of body-part stimuli, we recorded EEG from healthy participants while they were engaged in an identification task (match-to-sample) of images of hands and nonbody control images (leaves). In addition to confirming that occipito-temporal electrodes show a larger N1 for hand images compared with control stimuli, cluster-based analysis revealed an occipito-temporal cluster showing an increased theta power when hands are presented (compared with leaves) and show that this theta increase is higher for identified hands compared with nonidentified ones while not being significantly different between not identified nonhand stimuli. Finally, single trial multivariate pattern analysis revealed that time-frequency modulation in the theta band is a better marker for classifying the identification of hand images than the ERP modulation. The present results support the notion that theta activity over the occipito-temporal cortex is an informative marker of hand visual processing and may reflect the activity of a network coding for stimulus identity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Hands provide crucial information regarding the identity of others, which is a key information for social processes. We recorded EEG activity of healthy participants during the visual identification of hand images. The combination of univariate and multivariate pattern analysis in time- and time-frequency domain highlights the functional role of theta (4-7 Hz) activity over visual areas during hand identification and emphasizes the robustness of this neuromarker in occipito-temporal visual processing dynamics.

This study aims to develop and validate an integrated automatic detection, classification and imaging pipeline of HFOs with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) to narrow the gap between HFOs quantitative analysis and clinical application. Methods The proposed pipeline includes stages of channel inclusion, candidate HFOs detection and automatic labeling with four trained convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers and HFOs sorting based on occurrence rate and imaging. We first evaluated the initial detector using an open simulated dataset. After that, we validated our full algorithm in a 20-patient cohort against three assumptions based on previous studies. Classified HFOs results were compared with seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels for their concordance. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) were calculated representing the prediction ability of the labeled HFOs outputs for SOZ. Results The initial detector demonstrated satisfactory performance on the simulated dataset. The four CNN classifiers converged quickly during training, and the accuracies on the validation dataset were above 95%. The localization value of HFOs was significantly improved by HFOs classification. The AUC values of the 20 testing patients increased after HFO classification, indicating a satisfactory prediction value of the proposed algorithm for EZ identification. Conclusion Our detector can provide robust HFOs analysis results revealing EZ at the individual level, which may ultimately push forward the transitioning of HFOs analysis into a meaningful part of the presurgical evaluation and surgical planning.

Overall, 43% of channels showed gamma, and 24% had ripples. Group 2 showed the highest proportion of channels with gamma (47%), followed by group 1 (38%) and group 3 (36%). Mean gamma rates were higher in group 2 (4.65 gamma/min/channel) than in group 1 (1.52) and group 3 (1.44) (P < 0.001). Group 2 showed the highest proportion of channels with ripples (29.2%), followed by group 1 (15%) and group 3 (24.2%). Mean ripple rates were higher in group 2 (5.09 ripple/min/channel) than in group 1 (0.96) and group 3 (0.83) (P < 0.001).Conclusions:Fast oscillations, including high-frequency oscillations, can be detected in scalp EEG of patients with altered consciousness. High rates of fast activity may suggest an underlying structural brain lesion. Future studies are needed to determine whether fast oscillations in the setting of acute/subacute brain lesions are a biomarker of subsequent development of human epilepsy.

For instance, infants from racially diverse environments show less preference for their own-race (ingroup) over other-race (outgroup) faces than infants from racially homogeneous environments. Yet how social environment changes ingroup versus outgroup demarcation in infancy remains unclear. A commonly held assumption is that early emerging ingroup preference is based on an affective process: feeling more comfortable with familiar ingroup than unfamiliar outgroup members. However, other processes may also underlie ingroup preference: Infants may attend more to ingroup than outgroup members and/or mirror the actions of ingroup over outgroup individuals. By aggregating 7- to 12-month-old infants' electroencephalography (EEG) activity across three studies, we disambiguate these different processes in the EEG oscillations of preverbal infants according to social environment. White infants from more racially diverse neighborhoods exhibited greater frontal theta oscillation (an index of top-down attention) and more mu rhythm desynchronization (an index of motor system activation and potentially neural mirroring) to racial outgroup individuals than White infants from less racially diverse neighborhoods. Neighborhood racial demographics did not relate to White infants' frontal alpha asymmetry (a measure of approach-withdrawal motivation) toward racial outgroup individuals. Racial minority infants showed no effects of neighborhood racial demographics in their neural responses to racial outgroup individuals. These results indicate that neural mechanisms that may underlie social bias and prejudices are related to neighborhood racial demographics in the first year of life.

P300 amplitude has been related to attention-driven context comparison and resource allocation processes. Altered P300 amplitude in ADHD can be reasonably assumed to be related to ADHD typical cognitive performance deficits. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can increase the amplitude of endogenous brain oscillations. Because ERP components can be viewed as event-related oscillations (EROs), with P300 translating into the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range, an increase of delta and theta ERO amplitudes by tACS should result in an increase of P300 amplitudes in ADHD patients. In this pilot study, 18 adult ADHD patients (7 female) performed three consecutive blocks of a visual oddball task while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Patients received either 20 min of tACS or sham stimulation at a stimulation intensity of 1 mA. Individual stimulation frequency was determined using a time-frequency decomposition of the P300. Our preliminary results demonstrate a significant increase in P300 amplitude in the stimulation group which was accompanied by a decrease in omission errors pre-to-post tACS. However, studies including larger sample sizes are advised.

They characterize the oscillations exhibiting interregional coordination and identify an important orchestrating role for hippocampal slow oscillations. During sleep, new memories undergo a gradual transfer from hippocampal (HPC) to neocortical (NC) sites. Precisely timed neural oscillations are thought to mediate this sleep-dependent memory consolidation, but exactly how sleep oscillations instantiate the HPC-NC dialog remains elusive. Employing overnight invasive electroencephalography in ten neurosurgical patients, we identified three broad classes of phase-based communication between HPC and lateral temporal NC. First, we observed interregional phase synchrony for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) spindles, and N2 and rapid eye movement (REM) theta activity. Second, we found asymmetrical N3 cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling between HPC slow oscillations (SOs) and NC activity spanning the delta to high-gamma/ripple bands, but not in the opposite direction. Lastly, N2 theta and NREM spindle synchrony were themselves modulated by HPC SOs. These forms of interregional communication emphasize the role of HPC SOs in the HPC-NC dialog, and may offer a physiological basis for the sleep-dependent reorganization of mnemonic content.

Conflict monitoring processes are required to cope with situations where one or multiple conflicts occur. It has been suggested, that medial-frontal theta oscillations are associated with the implementation of cognitive control and that conflicts increase theta band activity. Still, a causal mechanistic understanding of theta oscillations during the resolution of combined subliminal and conscious conflicts is missing. To investigate this, we combined EEG signal decomposition methods with EEG beamforming approaches and used the obtained information to modulate theta oscillations with tACS in a second experiment. This showed that theta oscillations in the superior frontal cortex (BA6) and the left paracentral lobule encoded stimulus-related processes during the resolution of conflicts arising from both conscious and subliminal information processing. Response selection and motor-related processes encoded by theta oscillations were not similarly modulated. Thus, the joint modulation of conflicts by conscious and subliminal information affects very specific aspects of the information coded in theta oscillations. Results indicate, that entraining theta-oscillations using tACS modulates conflict resolution depending on the already existing theta activity level. In summary, the study provides further evidence that frontal theta oscillations play a crucial role in conflict monitoring and control. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the basic RIT, subjects are presented with an image of an object (e.g., CAT) and instructed to not think of the name of the object. Involuntary subvocalizations of the name (the RIT effect) arise on roughly 80% of the trials. We conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) study to explore the neural correlates of the RIT effect. Subjects were presented with one object at a time in one condition and two objects simultaneously in another condition. Five regions were defined by electrode sites: frontal (F3-F4), parietal (P3-P4), temporal (T3-T4), right hemisphere (F4-P4), and left hemisphere (F3-P3). We focused on the alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), delta (0.01-4 Hz), and theta (4-8 Hz) frequencies.

However, still little is known about how driving is supported by the brain. We used electroencephalography to study the changes in brain activity and its functional connectivity in a simulated driving task. We focused on overtaking and studied this activity in three phases: before overtake, during overtake, and after overtake. Our results showed that mu power in motor and sensorimotor areas decreased during overtake and again increased after overtake. On the other hand, beta oscillations in frontal areas were at their highest level in the "before overtake" phase. It can be interpreted that the "before overtake" was the most attention-demanding phase. In addition, we found that the connectivity between right and left prefrontal regions and right and left occipital regions in alpha (and mu) band power was significantly stronger in the "during overtake" compared to the other two conditions.

The existing studies mainly concentrated in tDCS effects on motor cortex. The number of tDCS studies targeting visual area is sparse. And parameters of tDCS on the visual cortex are not well optimized yet. Therefore, this study explored the effect of anodal occipital tDCS in eyes-open resting state to disclose possible modulation to spontaneous brain activity by electroencephalography (EEG). Fifteen healthy subjects were involved in this study. Each subject endured sham and anodal tDCS in turn. 2 mA tDCS was applied over 21 min with Oz-Cz montage. Amplitudes of spontaneous brain activities were evaluated for each experimental condition. Compared with pre-stimulation and sham tDCS, anodal tDCS caused an obvious increment in parieto-occipital alpha activity. These results demonstrated electrophysiological changes in EEG oscillations induced by anodal occipital tDCS, and would help to improve the understanding of modulation of tDCS-induced visual cortex excitability changes in humans.

In this study, we used high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) coupled to source localization to obtain information on spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of neural oscillations associated with WM update, maintenance and readout. Specifically, we a priori selected regions from a large fronto-parietal network, including also the insula and the cerebellum, and we analyzed modulation of neural oscillations by event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS). During update and readout, we found larger theta ERS and smaller beta ERS respect to maintenance in all the selected areas. gamma(LOW) and gamma(HIGH) bands oscillations decreased in the frontal and insular cortices of the left hemisphere. In the maintenance phase we observed decreased theta oscillations and increased beta oscillations (ERS) in most of the selected posterior areas and focally increased oscillations in gamma(LOW) and gamma(HIGH) bands in the frontal and insular cortices of the left hemisphere. Finally, during WM readout, we also found a focal modulation of the gamma(LOW) band in the left fusiform cortex and cerebellum, depending on the response trial type (true positive vs. true negative). Overall, our study demonstrated specific spectral signatures associated with updating of memory information, WM maintenance, and readout, with relatively high spatial resolution.

Seizure Activity Across Scales From Neuronal Population Firing to Clonic Motor Semiology	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Focal seizures; Epilepsy semiology; Intracranial EEG; High-frequency oscillations; Microelectrode	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS	The correlation of clinical semiology with neuronal firing in human seizures has not been well described. Similarly, the neuronal firing patterns underlying high-frequency oscillations during seizures remain controversial. Using implanted subdural electrodes and a microelectrode array in a patient with focal status epilepticus, in which 40 habitual focal motor seizures and 101 subclinical seizures were captured, the authors analyzed the association of EEG, high-frequency oscillations, and multiunit activity to facial motor semiology. The development of ictal high-frequency oscillations in subdural electrodes overlying face motor cortex was temporally associated with clonic facial movements. In representative seizures selected for multiunit analysis, synchronization of neuronal firing in the adjacent microelectrode array aligned with clinical onset and was greater in clinical seizures compared with subclinical seizures. This report demonstrates the electrophysiologic signatures of focal seizures at the level of neuronal firing, high-frequency oscillations, and EEG as they organize from microscale to macroscale, with clinical correlation.

In order to design electronic devices to improve car safety in the future, we aimed to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) activities to disentangle left from right steering actions in car driving simulation. For this purpose, we performed 128-channels EEG recordings during the driving of a car simulator. EEG scalp topographies resulting from and Independent Component Analysis were clustered across subjects. The corresponding time-frequency patterns of power activity were compared, revealing two distinct EEG clusters reacting with a coupled alpha and beta desynchronization in the preparation of the left and right steering onset, respectively. Topographic maps and dipole localization showed that these EEG components are originated from motor regions of the two hemispheres. Overall, these results illustrate that alpha and beta EEG rhythms could be exploited to predict the driver's intention in steering actions.

Adapted cabling of an EEG cap improves simultaneous measurement of EEG and fMRI at 7T	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; 7T; EEG cap; ERP; Oscillations	RESTING STATE NETWORKS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; GAMMA; BOLD; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	Background: The combination of EEG and ultra-high-field (7T and above) fMRI holds the promise to relate electrophysiology and hemodynamics with greater signal to noise level and at higher spatial resolutions than conventional field strengths. Technical and safety restrictions have so far resulted in compromises in terms of MRI coil selection, resulting in reduced, signal quality, spatial coverage and resolution in EEG-fMRI studies at 7 T. New method: We adapted a 64-channel MRI-compatible EEG cap so that it could be used with a closed 32-channel MRI head coil thus avoiding several of these compromises. We compare functional and anatomical as well as the EEG quality recorded with this adapted setup with those recorded with a setup that uses an open-ended 8-channel head-coil. Results: Our set-up with the adapted EEG cap inside the closed 32 channel coil resulted in the recording of good quality EEG and (f)MRI data. Both functional and anatomical MRI images show no major effects of the adapted EEG cap on MR signal quality. We demonstrate the ability to compute ERPs and changes in alpha and gamma oscillations from the recorded EEG data. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to MRI recordings with an 8-channel open-ended head-coil, the loss in signal quality of the MRI images related to the adapted EEG cap is considerably reduced. Conclusions: The adaptation of the EEG cap permits the simultaneous recording of good quality whole brain (f) MRI data using a 32 channel receiver coil, while maintaining the quality of the EEG data.

This scenario would be desirable for potential users such as patients with motor disabilities, however, there are still several limitations such as long calibration times and overall performance. Different approaches to improve these systems explore diverse linear electroencephalography (EEG) features in order to describe cognitive states. Alternatively, the present study proposes the use of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), which provides indices about the dynamical behaviour of non-linear systems. We evaluated the accuracy of continuous detection of mental calculation and idle state using RQA features from EEG recordings. Among the different classification methods that were tested, random forest (RF) classifier resulted in the best performance. From 35 selected RQA features, 12 healthy subjects achieved mean accuracy of 0.924 +/- 0.048, whereas with 150 selected features mean accuracy was 0.977 +/- 0.020. These results suggest that RQA features are adequate for continuous task episode detection in asynchronous BCI. However, a restriction in the number of these features, conceived for improving computational costs and time, does impact detection performance.

Electrical brain activity, as revealed by electroencephalography (EEG), can be represented by a sequence of microstates of about 40-120 ms duration, in which distributed neural pools are synchronously active and generate stable spatial potential topographies on the scalp. Microstate dynamics may reflect transitions between global states characterized by selective inhibition of specific intra-cortical regions, mediated by alpha activity. We investigated the intra-subject and inter-subject relationship between microstate features and alpha band. High-density EEG signals were acquired in 29 healthy subjects during ten minutes of eyes closed rest. Individual EEG signal epochs were classified into four groups depending on the amount of occipital alpha power, and microstate metrics (duration, coverage and frequency of occurrence) were calculated and compared across groups. Correlations between alpha power and microstate metrics between individuals were also performed. To assess if microstate parameter variations are specific for the alpha band, the same analysis was also performed for theta and beta bands, as well as for global field power. We observed an increase in the metrics of microstate, previously associated to the visual system, with the level of intra-subject amplitude alpha oscillations, together with lower coverage of microstate associated with executive attention network and a higher frequency of microstate associated with task negative network. Other modulation effects of broad-band EEG power level on microstate metrics were observed. These effects are not specific for the alpha band, since they can equally be attributed to fluctuations in other frequency bands. We can interpret our results as a regulation mechanism mediated by posterior alpha level, dynamically interacting with other frequency bands, responsible for the switching between active areas.

Methods: A total of 78 combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive laboratory nights of high-density EEG recordings. We computed a measure of synchrony for each EEG channel-pair across three sleep stages (rapid eye movement [REM] and non-REM stages 2 and 3) and six frequency bands. We examined the median synchrony in 9 region-of-interest (ROI) pairs consisting of 6 bilateral brain regions (left and right frontal, central, and parietal regions) for 10 frequency-band and sleep-stage combinations. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive subjects (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 subjects (13 with PTSD) for replication. Results: In the discovery analysis, five alpha-band synchrony pairs during non-REM sleep were consistently larger in PTSD subjects compared with controls (effect sizes ranging from 0.52 to 1.44) across consecutive nights: two between the left-frontal and left-parietal ROIs, one between the left-central and left-parietal ROIs, and two across central and parietal bilateral ROIs. These trends were preserved in the replication set. Conclusion: PTSD subjects showed increased alpha-band synchrony during non-REM sleep in the left frontoparietal, left centro-parietal, and inter-parietal brain regions. Importantly, these trends were reproducible across consecutive nights and subpopulations. Thus, these alterations in alpha synchrony may be discriminatory of PTSD. Statement of Significance Sleep disturbances are a hallmark of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, previous research to identify objective markers of sleep disturbances, which could potentially help guide sleep-focused clinical interventions, have yielded inconsistent results. To address this issue, the authors compared the synchrony of activity between different brain regions in subjects with and without PTSD to identify reliable and reproducible differences. They found increased synchrony in PTSD subjects during dreamless sleep between the frontal and posterior brain regions. Importantly, these trends were reproducible across consecutive nights and subpopulations of the study.

Moreover, STN-DBS selectively suppresses spatially and spectrally distinct patterns of synchronous oscillatory activity within cortical-subcortical loops. These STN-cortical circuits have been described in PD patients using magnetoencephalography after surgery. This network information, however, is currently not available during surgery to inform the implantation strategy. The authors recorded spontaneous brain activity in 3 awake patients with PD (mean age 67 +/- 14 years; mean disease duration 13 +/- 7 years) during implantation of DBS electrodes into the STN after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication. Intraoperative propofol was discontinued at least 30 minutes prior to the electrophysiological recordings. The authors used a novel approach for performing simultaneous recordings of STN local field potentials (LFPs) and multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) at rest. Coherent oscillations between LFP and EEG sensors were computed, and subsequent dynamic imaging of coherent sources was performed. The authors identified coherent activity in the upper beta range (21-35 Hz) between the STN and the ipsilateral mesial (pre)motor area. Coherence in the theta range (4-6 Hz) was detected in the ipsilateral prefrontal area. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of detecting frequency-specific and spatially distinct synchronization between the STN and cortex during DBS surgery. Mapping the STN with this technique may disentangle different functional loops relevant for refined targeting during DBS implantation.

The exact nature of this differentiation is unclear. To this end, EEG (electrophysiological) responses to prepulse inhibition (PPI: reflecting attentional modulation) and prepulse facilitation (PPF: indicating orienting activation) were recorded and analysed. The aim of this study was to compare the respective neural oscillations associated with PPI and PPF in BDD vs healthy controls. Materials and Methods Event-related EEG oscillations elicited by PPI and PPF (26 and 25 trials, respectively, randomly presented) were explored in a sample of patients with BDD (N = 30) vs healthy controls (N = 25). The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale for BDD (BDD-YBOCS), the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination, the Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) and the Brown Assessment of Belief Scale (BABS) were also administered. Results Analysis of the power spectrum in response to PPI and PPF revealed that the BDD patient group compared to healthy controls exhibited higher theta-1 oscillations (potentially indicative of disrupted thalamo-cortical activation) and reduced beta-1 oscillations (potentially indicative of reduced top-down-controlled processing during attentional orienting). Conclusion These findings offer novel contributions with regards to the neural mechanisms underlying attention processes in BDD patients, and demonstrate the potential of event-related EEG oscillations as a tool to better understand body dysmorphic disorder.

Sexually dimorphic patterns in electroencephalography power spectrum and autism-related behaviors in a rat model of fragile X syndrome	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Anxiety; Audiogenic seizures; Autism; Gamma oscillations; Gamma power; Gender; Locomotor activity; Sex differences	SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; FMRP EXPRESSION; EEG; SLEEP; SUSCEPTIBILITY; DEFICITS; GENE; MICE	Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder with autistic features, is caused by the loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein. Sex-specific differences in the clinical profile have been observed in FXS patients, but few studies have directly compared males and females in rodent models of FXS. To address this, we performed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and a battery of autism-related behavioral tasks on juvenile and young adult Fmr1 knockout (KO) rats. EEG analysis demonstrated that compared to wild-type, male Fmr1 KO rats showed an increase in gamma frequency band power in the frontal cortex during the sleep-like immobile state, and both male and female KO rats failed to show an increase in delta frequency power in the sleep-like state, as observed in wild-type rats. Previous studies of EEG profiles in FXS subjects also reported abnormally increased gamma frequency band power, highlighting this parameter as a potential translatable biomarker. Both male and female Fmr1 KO rats displayed reduced exploratory behaviors in the center zone of the open field test, and increased distance travelled in an analysis of 24-h home cage activity, an effect that was more prominent during the nocturnal phase. Reduced wins against wild-type opponents in the tube test of social dominance was seen in both sexes. In contrast, increased repetitive behaviors in the wood chew test was observed in male but not female KO rats, while increased freezing in a fear conditioning test was observed only in the female KO rats. Our findings highlight sex differences between male and female Fmr1 KO rats, and indicate that the rat model of FXS could be a useful tool for the development of new therapeutics for treating this debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder.

More recently, fMRI standardization efforts have focused on enabling the joint analysis of raw fMRI data across studies (mega-analysis), with the hope of achieving more detailed insights. However, it has not been clear if such analyses in the EEG field are possible or equally fruitful. Here we present the results of a large-scale EEG mega-analysis using 18 studies from six sites representing several different experimental paradigms. We demonstrate that when meta-data are consistent across studies, both channel-level and source-level EEG mega-analysis are possible and can provide insights unavailable in single studies. The analysis uses a fully-automated processing pipeline to reduce line noise, interpolate noisy channels, perform robust referencing, remove eye-activity, and further identify outlier signals. We define several robust measures based on channel amplitude and dispersion to assess the comparability of data across studies and observe the effect of various processing steps on these measures. Using ICA-based dipolar sources, we also observe consistent differences in overall frequency baseline amplitudes across brain areas. For example, we observe higher alpha in posterior vs anterior regions and higher beta in temporal regions. We also detect consistent differences in the slope of the aperiodic portion of the EEG spectrum across brain areas. In a companion paper, we apply mega-analysis to assess commonalities in event-related EEG features across studies. The continuous raw and preprocessed data used in this analysis are available through the DataCatalog at hops://cancta.net.

However, the effect of stimulus modality on EEG patterns within this process is less understood. To fill this research gap, the present study re-analyzed EEG datasets recorded during visual and audiovisual equivalence learning tasks from earlier studies. The number of associations required to be maintained (WM load) in WM was increased using the staircase method during the acquisition phase of the tasks. The support vector machine algorithm was employed to predict WM load and stimulus modality using the power, phase connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) values obtained during time segments with different WM loads in the visual and audiovisual tasks. A high accuracy (>90%) in predicting stimulus modality based on power spectral density and from the theta-beta CFC was observed. However, accuracy in predicting WM load was higher (>= 75% accuracy) than that in predicting stimulus modality (which was at chance level) using theta and alpha phase connectivity. Under low WM load conditions, this connectivity was highest between the frontal and parieto-occipital channels. The results validated our findings from earlier studies that dissociated stimulus modality based on power-spectra and CFC during equivalence learning. Furthermore, the results emphasized the importance of alpha and theta frontoparietal connectivity in WM load.

It provides a time lead compared to traditional seizure detection. In this paper, a spectral feature extraction is developed and the seizure prediction is performed based on uncorrelated multilinear discriminant analysis (UMLDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To make best use of information in different dimension, we construct a three-order tensor in temporal, spectral and spatial domain by wavelet transform. And UMLDA implements the tensor-to-vector projection (TVP) with the minimum redundancy. The proposed solution employed 23 subjects' Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG dataset, each subject contains 40 minutes EEG signal. For the classification task of ictal state and preictal state, it exhibits an overall accuracy of 95%.

It can occur while delivering high-dose anesthesia. Current research suggests an association between BSUPP and the occurrence of postoperative delirium in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and beyond. We investigated burst micro-architecture to further understand how age influences the neurophysiology of this pharmacologically-induced state. We analyzed a subset of EEG recordings (n = 102) taken from a larger data set previously published. We selected the initial burst that followed a visually identified "silent second," i.e., at least 1 s of iso-electricity of the EEG during propofol induction. We derived the (normalized) power spectral density [(n)PSD], the alpha band power, the maximum amplitude, the maximum slope of the EEG as well as the permutation entropy (PeEn) for the first 1.5 s of the initial burst of each patient. In the old patients >65 years, we observed significantly lower (p < 0.001) EEG power in the 1-15 Hz range. In general, their EEG contained a significantly higher amount of faster oscillations (>15 Hz). Alpha band power (p < 0.001), EEG amplitude (p = 0.001), and maximum EEG slope (p = 0.045) all significantly decreased with age, whereas PeEn increased (p = 0.008). Hence, we can describe an age-related change in features during EEG burst suppression. Sub-group analysis revealed no change in results based on pre-medication. These EEG changes add knowledge to the impact of age on cortical synaptic activity. In addition to a reduction in EEG amplitude, age-associated burst features can complicate the identification of excessive anesthetic administration in patients under general anesthesia. Knowledge of these neurophysiologic changes may not only improve anesthesia care through improved detection of burst suppression but might also provide insight into changes in neuronal network organization in patients at risk for age-related neurocognitive problems.

Neural oscillations reportedly comprise different functions depending on their own properties. Therefore, in this study, we investigated details of the complexity of neural oscillations by decomposing the oscillations into frequency, amplitude, and phase for AD patients. We applied resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) to 17 AD patients and 21 healthy control subjects. We first decomposed the source time series of the MEG signal into five intrinsic mode functions using ensemble empirical mode decomposition. We then analyzed the temporal complexities of these time series using multiscale entropy. Results demonstrated that AD patients had lower complexity on short time scales and higher complexity on long time scales in the alpha band in temporal regions of the brain. We evaluated the alpha band complexity further by decomposing it into amplitude and phase using Hilbert spectral analysis. Consequently, we found lower amplitude complexity and higher phase complexity in AD patients. Correlation analyses between spectral complexity and decomposed complexities revealed scale-dependency. Specifically, amplitude complexity was positively correlated with spectral complexity on short time scales, whereas phase complexity was positively correlated with spectral complexity on long time scales. Regarding the relevance of cognitive function to the complexity measures, the phase complexity on the long time scale was found to be correlated significantly with the Mini-Mental State Examination score. Additionally, we examined the diagnostic utility of the complexity characteristics using machine learning (ML) methods. We prepared a feature pool using multiple sparse autoencoders (SAEs), chose some discriminating features, and applied them to a support vector machine (SVM). Compared to the simple SVM and the SVM after feature selection (FS + SVM), the SVM with multiple SAEs (SAE + FS + SVM) had improved diagnostic accuracy. Through this study, we 1) advanced the understanding of neuronal complexity in AD patients using decomposed temporal complexity analysis and 2) demonstrated the effectiveness of combining ML methods with information about signal complexity for the diagnosis of AD.

Power spectrum analysis of EEG in a translational nonhuman primate model after chronic exposure to low levels of the common marine neurotoxin, domoic acid	NEUROTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Domoic acid; Electroencephalography; Nonhuman primate; Chronic exposure; Power spectrum density	LIONS ZALOPHUS-CALIFORNIANUS; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; TOXIN; CONNECTIVITY; INTOXICATION; SEIZURES; BEHAVIOR; ALPHA	Domoic acid (DA), the focus of this research, is a marine algal neurotoxin and epileptogen produced by species in the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. DA is found in finfish and shellfish across the globe. The current regulatory limit for DA consumption (20 ppm in shellfish) was set to protect humans from acute toxic effects, but there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that regular consumption of DA contaminated seafood at or below the regulatory limit may lead to subtle neurological effects in adults. The present research uses a translational nonhuman primate model to assess neurophysiological changes after chronic exposure to DA near the regulatory limit. Sedated electroencephalography (EEG) was used in 20 healthy adult female Macaca fascicularis, orally administered 0.075 and 0.15 mg DA/kg/day for at least 10 months. Paired video and EEG recordings were cleaned and a Fast Fourier Transformation was applied to EEG recordings to assess power differences in frequency bands from 1-20 Hz. When DA exposed animals were compared to controls, power was significantly decreased in the delta band (1-4 Hz, p<0.005) and significantly increased in the alpha band (5-8 Hz, p<0.005), theta band (9-12 Hz, p<0.01), and beta band (13-20 Hz, p<0.05). The power differences were not dose dependent or related to the duration of DA exposure, or subtle clinical symptoms of DA exposure (intentional tremors). Alterations of power in these bands have been associated with a host of clinical symptoms, such as deficits in memory and neurodegenerative diseases, and ultimately provide new insight into the subclinical toxicity of chronic, low-dose DA exposure on the adult primate brain.

Mental fatigue has become a widespread sub-health condition, and has a serious impact on the cognitive function of the brain. However, seldom studies investigate the differences of mental fatigue on electrophysiological activity both in resting state and task state at the same time. Here, twenty healthy male participants were recruited to do a consecutive mental arithmetic tasks for mental fatigue induction, and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected before and after each tasks. The power and relative power of five EEG rhythms both in resting state and task state were analyzed statistically. Results The results of brain topographies and statistical analysis indicated that mental arithmetic task can successfully induce mental fatigue in the enrolled subjects. The relative power index was more sensitive than the power index in response to mental fatigue, and the relative power for assessing mental fatigue was better in resting state than in task state. Furthermore, we found that it is of great physiological significance to divide alpha frequency band into alpha1 band and alpha2 band in fatigue related studies, and at the same time improve the statistical differences of sub-bands. Conclusions Our current results suggested that the brain activity in mental fatigue state has great differences in resting state and task state, and it is imperative to select the appropriate state in EEG data acquisition and divide alpha band into alpha1 and alpha2 bands in mental fatigue related researches.

We aimed to identify sleep EEG markers of PTSD that were reproducible across nights and subsamples of our study population. Methods: Seventy-eight combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive nights of high-density EEG recordings in a laboratory. We performed spectral-topographical EEG analyses on data from both nights. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication. Results: In the discovery analysis, compared with non-PTSD participants, PTSD participants exhibited (1) reduced delta power (1-4 Hz) in the centro-parietal regions during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and (2) elevated high-frequency power, most prominent in the gamma band (30-40 Hz), in the antero-frontal regions during both NREM and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These findings were consistent across the two study nights, with reproducible trends in the replication analysis. We found no significant group differences in theta power (4-8 Hz) during REM sleep and sigma power (12-15 Hz) during N2 sleep. Conclusions: The reduced centro-parietal NREM delta power, indicating reduced sleep depth, and the elevated antero-frontal NREM and REM gamma powers, indicating heightened central arousal, are potential objective sleep markers of PTSD. If independently validated, these putative EEG markers may offer new targets for the development of sleep-specific PTSD diagnostics and interventions.

Low-frequency rTMS (stimulation frequency <= 1Hz) can induce inhibitory effects on cortical excitability. In order to investigate dynamic changes in neuronal activity after low-frequency rTMS, 20 healthy subjects received 1-Hz rTMS over the right motor area, and electroencephalography (EEG) in resting condition with eyes open was recorded before rTMS and at 0 min, 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min after rTMS. Power values, functional connectivity based on a weighted phase lag index (wPLI), and network characteristics were assessed and compared to study the aftereffects of rTMS. Our results show that low-frequency rTMS produced a delayed long-lasting increase in alpha-band power values in frontoparietal brain areas and an immediate long-lasting increase in theta-band power values in the ipsilateral frontal and contralateral centroparietal areas. In the alpha band, functional connectivity decreased immediately after rTMS but significantly increased at 20 min after rTMS. Moreover, an analysis of undirected graphs revealed that the number of connections significantly changed in the anterior and posterior regions in the alpha band. In addition, there were significant decreases in clustering coefficients of the channels near the site of stimulation in the alpha and theta bands after rTMS. In conclusion, low-frequency rTMS produces widespread and long-lasting alterations in neural oscillation and functional connectivity. This work implies that low-frequency rTMS can induce inhibitory effects on motor cortical excitability ipsilateral to the stimulation site.

Specifically, in this work, we analyzed the EEG signals recorded while subjects were playing NP decision-making tasks. Two groups of subjects were assigned to take NP with distinctive difficulty levels for examining the difference in neural responses to the task challenge. The Correlated Components Analysis (CorrCA) method was then utilized to identify the EEG channels that maximized the correlations among multiple subjects or trials. Both Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) and Inter-Trial Correlation (ITC) results revealed an apparent modulation of the attentional state of subjects across three test phases (decision-making, feedback, and recovery) and two distinct task challenges. The neural correlation across multiple subjects or multiple trials increased significantly during the decision-making phase for more challenging tasks, in which subjects needed to be more attentive. Such observations confirm the modulation of the engagement state on the correlations of the neural activity across multiple subjects or repeated trials. Moreover, the alpha-band power results for different decision-making phases affirmed that the difficulty of different test phases modulates subjects' engagement.

Inferring a simple mechanism for alpha-blocking by fitting a neural population model to EEG spectra	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							THALAMOCORTICAL MECHANISMS; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS	Author summary One of the most striking features of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) is the presence of neural oscillations in the range of 8-13 Hz. It is well known that attenuation of these alpha oscillations, a process known as alpha blocking, arises from opening of the eyes, though the cause has remained obscure. In this study we infer the mechanism underlying alpha blocking by fitting a neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 different individuals. Although such models have long held the promise of being able to relate macroscopic recordings of brain activity to microscopic neural parameters, their utility has been limited by the difficulty of inferring these parameters from fits to data. Our approach involves fitting eyes-open and eyes-closed EEG spectra in a way that minimizes unnecessary differences in model parameters between the two states. Surprisingly, we find that changes in just one parameter, the level of external input to the inhibitory neurons in cortex, is sufficient to explain the attenuation of alpha oscillations. This indicates that opening of the eyes reduces alpha activity simply by increasing external inputs to the inhibitory neurons in the cortex. Alpha blocking, a phenomenon where the alpha rhythm is reduced by attention to a visual, auditory, tactile or cognitive stimulus, is one of the most prominent features of human electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Here we identify a simple physiological mechanism by which opening of the eyes causes attenuation of the alpha rhythm. We fit a neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 subjects, each showing a different degree of alpha blocking upon opening of their eyes. Though it has been notoriously difficult to estimate parameters by fitting such models, we show how, by regularizing the differences in parameter estimates between eyes-closed and eyes-open states, we can reduce the uncertainties in these differences without significantly compromising fit quality. From this emerges a parsimonious explanation for the spectral differences between states: Changes to just a single parameter, p(ei), corresponding to the strength of a tonic excitatory input to the inhibitory cortical population, are sufficient to explain the reduction in alpha rhythm upon opening of the eyes. We detect this by comparing the shift in each model parameter between eyes-closed and eyes-open states. Whereas changes in most parameters are weak or negligible and do not scale with the degree of alpha attenuation across subjects, the change in p(ei) increases monotonically with the degree of alpha blocking observed. These results indicate that opening of the eyes reduces alpha activity by increasing external input to the inhibitory cortical population.

Endogenous theta stimulation during meditation predicts reduced opioid dosing following treatment with Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							CHRONIC PAIN; UNITED-STATES; MECHANISMS; EEG; ADDICTION; MISUSE; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION	Veterans experience chronic pain at greater rates than the rest of society and are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy (LTOT), which, at high doses, is theorized to induce maladaptive neuroplastic changes that attenuate self-regulatory capacity and exacerbate opioid dose escalation. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to modulate frontal midline theta (FMT) and alpha oscillations that are linked with marked alterations in self-referential processing. These adaptive neural oscillatory changes may promote reduced opioid use and remediate the neural dysfunction occasioned by LTOT. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess the effects of a mindfulness-based, cognitive training intervention for opioid misuse, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), on alpha and theta power and FMT coherence during meditation. We then examined whether these neural effects were associated with reduced opioid dosing and changes in self-referential processing. Before and after 8 weeks of MORE or a supportive psychotherapy control, veterans receiving LTOT (N = 62) practiced mindfulness meditation while EEG was recorded. Participants treated with MORE demonstrated significantly increased alpha and theta power (with larger theta power effect sizes) as well as increased FMT coherence relative to those in the control condition-neural changes that were associated with altered self-referential processing. Crucially, MORE significantly reduced opioid dose over time, and this dose reduction was partially statistically mediated by changes in frontal theta power. Study results suggest that mindfulness meditation practice may produce endogenous theta stimulation in the prefrontal cortex, thereby enhancing inhibitory control over opioid dose escalation behaviors.

Multicomponent interventions like golf may have a positive influence on functional network integrity. Methods This pilot study investigated the influence of learning to play golf on the DMN in 7 elderly people (> 60 years) with subjective memory complaints. The participants exercised under the supervision of a professional golf trainer three times a week a' 60 min. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) measurements were conducted before and after the study. The EEG data were co-registered with a template magnetic resonance image (MRI) and 15 regions of the DMN were selected for connectivity analysis, focusing on the beta (14-29 Hz) and theta (5-7 Hz) frequency band. Results Functional connectivity of the entire DMN was higher in 5 / 7 participants in the beta frequency band and in 6 / 7 participants in the theta frequency band, respectively. In the anterior DMN, the functional connectivity in the beta frequency band was higher in all participants at t1, while it was lower in the theta (6 / 7) frequency band. In the posterior DMN, beta functional connectivity was higher at t1 in 6 / 7 participants as well as in 5 / 7 participants in the theta band. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a relation between percentage change of functional connectivity within the whole DMN for beta (r = 0,786, p = 0,036), and within the anterior DMN for theta (r = -0,821, p = 0,023). Conclusion Based on the presented data, learning to play golf might has an influence on the DMN. The findings should be replicated in a study including a larger sample and a randomized controlled design.

However, the decoding of gait patterns from brain signals remains an open challenge. The aim of this work is to propose and validate a deep learning model to decode gait phases from Electroenchephalography (EEG).Approach.A Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network has been trained to deal with time-dependent information within brain signals during locomotion. The EEG signals have been preprocessed by means of Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Reliable Independent Component Analysis (RELICA) to ensure that classification performance was not affected by movement-related artifacts.Main results.The network was evaluated on the dataset of 11 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. The proposed decoding approach shows a robust reconstruction (AUC > 90%) of gait patterns (i.e. swing and stance states) of both legs together, or of each leg independently.Significance.Our results support for the first time the use of a memory-based deep learning classifier to decode walking activity from non-invasive brain recordings. We suggest that this classifier, exploited in real time, can be a more effective input for devices restoring locomotion in impaired people.

In many patients, iEEG has been the basis for resective epilepsy surgery, to date still the most successful treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. Intracranial EEG determines the location and resectability of the SOZ. Advances in recording and implantation of iEEG provide multiple options in the 21st century. This not only includes the choice between subdural electrodes (SDE) and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) but also includes the implantation and recordings from microelectrodes. Before iEEG implantation, especially in magnetic resonance imaging -negative epilepsy, a clear hypothesis for seizure generation and propagation should be based on noninvasive methods. Intracranial EEG implantation should be planned by a multidisciplinary team considering epileptic networks. Recordings from SDE and SEEG have both their advantages and disadvantages. Stereo-EEG seems to have a lower rate of complications that are clinically significant, but has limitations in spatial sampling of the cortical surface. Stereo-EEG can sample deeper areas of the brain including deep sulci and hard to reach areas such as the insula. To determine the epileptogenic zone, interictal and ictal information should be taken into consideration. Interictal spiking, low frequency slowing, as well as high frequency oscillations may inform about the epileptogenic zone. Ictally, high frequency onsets in the beta/gamma range are usually associated with the SOZ, but specialized recordings with combined macro and microelectrodes may in the future educate us about onset in higher frequency bands. Stimulation of intracranial electrodes triggering habitual seizures can assist in identifying the SOZ. Advanced computational methods such as determining the epileptogenicity index and similar measures may enhance standard clinical interpretation. Improved techniques to record and interpret iEEG may in the future lead to a greater proportion of patients being seizure free after epilepsy surgery.

However, current evidence supporting the benefits of backward walking over forward walking remains inconclusive. Considering the proven association between gait and the cerebral cortex, we used electroencephalograms (EEG) to differentiate the effects of backward walking and forward walking on cortical activities, by comparing the sensorimotor rhythm (8-12 Hz, also called mu rhythm) of EEG signals. A systematic signal procedure was used to eliminate the motion artifacts induced by walking to safeguard EEG signal fidelity. Statistical test results of our experimental data demonstrated that walking motions significantly suppressed mu rhythm. Moreover, backward walking exhibited significantly larger upper mu rhythm (10-12 Hz) suppression effects than forward walking did. This finding implies that backward walking induces more sensorimotor cortex activity than forward walking does, and provides a basis to support the potential benefits of backward walking over forward walking. By monitoring the upper mu rhythm throughout the rehabilitation process, medical experts can adaptively adjust the intensity and duration of each walking training session to improve the efficacy of a walking ability recovery program.

Objective: In this study we aimed at improving long-term memory by modulating posterior parietal brain activity during the encoding process. If this area is causally involved in memory encoding, its facilitation should lead to behavioral improvement. Based on the dual-process memory framework, we also expected that the neuromodulation would dissociate subsequent familiarity-based and recollection-based recognition. Methods: We investigated the role of the posterior parietal brain oscillations in facial memory formation in three separate experiments using electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and model-driven, multi-electrode transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Results: Using fMRI and EEG, we confirmed that the right posterior parietal cortex is an essential node that promotes the encoding of long-term memories. We found that single-trial low theta power in this region predicts subsequent long-term recognition. On this basis, we fine-tuned the spatial and frequency settings of tACS during memory encoding. Model-driven tACS over the right posterior brain area augmented subsequent long-term recognition memory and particularly the familiarity of the observed stimuli. The recollection process, and short-term task performance as control remained unchanged. Control stimulation over the left hemisphere had no behavioral effect. Conclusion: We conclude that the right posterior brain area is crucial in long-term memory encoding. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Luque-Casado, A; Ciria, LF; Sanabria, D; Perakakis, P				Luque-Casado, Antonio; Ciria, Luis F.; Sanabria, Daniel; Perakakis, Pandelis			Exercise practice associates with different brain rhythmic patterns during vigilance	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						EEG; Time frequency; Inter-trial coherence; Exercise; Sustained attention; Physical fitness	ANAEROBIC THRESHOLD; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; AEROBIC FITNESS; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; GAMMA; POWER	Cardiovascular fitness has repeatedly been associated to enhanced cognitive and brain functioning, generally in the form of differences in reaction time and response accuracy, as well as in event-related potentials (ERPs) and blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging while participants performed executive demanding tasks. However, the evidence regarding potential differences in oscillatory neural activity, an inherent characteristic of brain functioning, is scarce. To fill this gap, here, we extracted and analysed (using a data-driven exploratory approach) brain oscillatory activity, both tonic (overall electroencephalographic - EEG - oscillatory activity) and transient (event related spectral perturbation [ERSP] and inter-trial coherence [ITC]), from a previous published dataset (Luque-Casado et al. 2016), where we showed different behavioural and ERP patterns during a vigilance/sustained attention task as a function of cardiovascular fitness in young adults. The ERSP results of the current study revealed increased theta (4-8 Hz) and upper beta (20-40 Hz) power and reduced lower beta (14-20 Hz) suppression after the target stimulus presentation in the higher-fit group compared to their lower-fit peers, but these differences disappeared in the second part of the task. ITC results mimicked the ERSP pattern within theta (4-8 Hz), while no differences were observed for the remaining frequency bands. Interestingly, the overall timedependent effect in transient oscillatory activity followed the reaction time pattern of results. The analysis of the overall EEG oscillatory (tonic) dynamics did not show significant differences between groups. In sum, cardiorespiratory fitness was related to a brain oscillatory differential response pattern over a wide range of the frequency spectrum and spatio-temporal distribution, which seems to underlie the positive relationship between aerobic fitness and behavioural performance in a sustained attention task. Future studies are warranted to study the causal nature (beyond mere association) of these findings.

Rejection of EEG artifacts is an essential process in EEG analysis since such artifacts cause many problems in EEG signals analysis. One of the most challenging issues in EEG denoising processes is removing the ocular artifacts where Electrooculographic (EOG), and EEG signals have an overlap in both frequency and time domains. In this paper, we build and train a deep learning model to deal with this challenge and remove the ocular artifacts effectively. In the proposed scheme, we convert each EEG signal to an image to be fed to a U-NET model, which is a deep learning model usually used in image segmentation tasks. We proposed three different schemes and made our U-NET based models learn to purify contaminated EEG signals similar to the process used in the image segmentation process. The results confirm that one of our schemes can achieve a reliable and promising accuracy to reduce the Mean square error between the target signal (Pure EEGs) and the predicted signal (Purified EEGs).

J	Salpekar, JA				Salpekar, Jay A.			Seeking Alpha: Can Neurofeedback Actually Work?	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material								Objective: Children with epilepsy experience cognitive deficits and well-being issues that have detrimental effects on their development. Pharmacotherapy is the standard of care in epilepsy; however, few interventions exist to promote cognitive development and to mitigate disease burden. We aimed to examine the impact of 2 different modalities of neurofeedback (NFB) on cognitive functioning and quality of life (QOL) measurements in children and adolescents with controlled focal epilepsy. The study also explored the effects of NFB on clinical outcomes and electroencephalography (EEG) quantitative analysis. Methods: Participants (n = 44) with controlled focal epilepsy were randomized to 1 of 3 arms: sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) NFB (n = 15), slow cortical potentials (SCP) NFB (n = 16), or sham NFB (n = 13). All participants received 25 sessions of intervention. The attention switching task (AST), Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale, seizure frequency, EEG power spectrum, and coherence were measured at baseline, postintervention, and at 3-month follow-up. Results: In children and adolescents with controlled focal epilepsy, SMR training significantly reduced reaction time in the AST (P = .006), and this was correlated with the difference of change for theta power on EEG (P = .03); only the SMR group showed a significant decrease in beta coherence (P = .03). All groups exhibited improvement in QOL (P <= .05). Conclusions: This study provides the first data on 2 NFB modalities (SMR and SCP) including cognitive, neurophysiological, and clinical outcomes in pediatric epilepsy. Sensorimotor rhythm NFB improved cognitive functioning, while all the interventions showed improvements in QOL, demonstrating a powerful placebo effect in the sham group.

The current standard method for rTMS defines the stimulation intensity based on the evoked liminal response in the visual or motor system (e.g., resting motor threshold). The key limitation of the current approach is that the magnitude of the resulting electric field remains elusive. A better characterization of the electric field strength induced by a given rTMS protocol is necessary in order to improve the understanding of the neural mechanisms of rTMS. In this study we used a novel approach, in which individualized prospective computational modeling of the induced electric field guided the choice of stimulation intensity. We consistently found that rhythmic rTMS protocols increased neural synchronization in the posterior alpha frequency band when measured simultaneously with scalp electroencephalography. We observed this effect already at electric field strengths of roughly half the lowest conventional field strength, which is 80% of the resting motor threshold. We conclude that rTMS can induce immediate electrophysiological effects at much weaker electric field strengths than previously thought.

Predominantly, the features extracted from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) of the EEG data significantly improve the classification accuracy. A specific number of narrow band oscillatory components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), are obtained after EMD of the data. The first three IMFs are selected to extract three time and three frequency domain statistical features corresponding to each IMF. These features are chosen due to the strong data adaptation capability of EMD for the transient signals such as an EEG. Furthermore, the features are selected keeping in mind the differences in the distribution, average value, and regularity of the guilty and innocent subjects' brain signals. The proposed combination of extracted features with customized SVM demonstrates better accuracy than the other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods reported earlier. The proposed hybrid combination of features prominently distinguishes the guilty and innocent subjects with the classification accuracy of 99.44%.

This synchronization induces a speech-specific, replicable neural phase pattern across trials and enables perceived speech to be classified. In this study, we hypothesized that neural oscillations during articulatory imagination of speech could also synchronize with the rhythm of speech imagery. To validate the hypothesis, after replacing the imagined speech with overt speech due to the physically unobservable nature of imagined speech, we investigated (1) whether the EEG-based regressed speech envelopes correlate with the overt speech envelope and (2) whether EEG during the imagined speech can classify speech stimuli with different envelopes. The variability of the duration of the imagined speech across trials was corrected using dynamic time warping. The classification was based on the distance between a test data and a template waveform of each class. Results showed a significant correlation between the EEG-based regressed envelope and the overt speech envelope. The average classification accuracy was 38.5%, which is significantly above the rate of chance (33.3%). These results demonstrate the synchronization between EEG during the imagined speech and the envelope of the overt counterpart. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

Awareness is related to reduced post-stimulus alpha power: a no-report inattentional blindness study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; attention; awareness; neural oscillations; visual awareness negativity	BAND OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN EEG; ATTENTION; CAPTURE; CONSCIOUSNESS; PERCEPTION; RHYTHM; INCREASES; REFLECT; PREDICT	Delineating the neural correlates of sensory awareness is a key requirement for developing a neuroscientific understanding of consciousness. A neural signal that has been proposed as a key neural correlate of awareness is amplitude reduction of 8-14 Hz alpha oscillations. Alpha oscillations are also closely linked to processes of spatial attention, providing potential alternative explanations for past results associating alpha oscillations with awareness. We employed a no-report inattentional blindness (IB) paradigm with electroencephalography to examine the association between awareness and the power of 8-14 Hz alpha oscillations. We asked whether the alpha-power decrease commonly reported when stimuli are perceived is related to awareness, or other factors that commonly confound awareness investigations, specifically task-relevance and visual salience. Two groups of participants performed a target discrimination task at fixation while irrelevant non-salient shape probes were presented briefly in the left or right visual field. One group was explicitly informed of the peripheral probes at the commencement of the experiment (the control group), whereas the other was not told about the probes until halfway through the experiment (IB group). Consequently, the IB group remained unaware of the probes for the first half of the experiment. In all conditions in which participants were aware of the probes, there was an enhanced negativity in the event-related potential (the visual awareness negativity). Furthermore, there was an extended contralateral alpha-power decrease when the probes were perceived, which was not present when they failed to reach awareness. These results suggest alpha oscillations are intrinsically associated with awareness itself.

The diagnosis of this disorder is currently based on analysis of the electroencephalograph' (EEG) signals in the time-frequency domain. The analysis is performed applying various algorithms that yield high performance, however the challenge of effective real-time epilepsy diagnosis persists. To address this, we have developed a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based solution for the classification of generalized and focal epileptic seizure types using a feed-forward multi-layer neural network architecture (MLP ANN). The neural network algorithm is trained, validated and tested on 822 captured signals from Temple University Hospital Seizure Detection Corpus (TUH EEG Corpus) database. Inputs into the system were five main features obtained from EEG signals by time-frequency analysis followed by Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and subsequent statistical analysis. Out of the total number of samples, 583 (70 %) of them were utilised during the system development in MATLAB and TensorFlow and 239 (30 %) samples were further used for subsequent testing of the model performance on the FPGA. Subsequently, the adequate parameters of the ANN model were determined by using k-Fold Cross-Validation. Finally, the best performing ANN model in terms of average validation data accuracy achieved during cross-validation was implemented on the FPGA for real-time seizure classification. The digital ANN solution was coded in Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) and tested on the FPGA using 30 % reaming data. The results of this research demonstrate that epilepsy diagnosis with quite high accuracy (95.14 %) can be achieved with (5-12-3) MLP ANN implemented on FPGA. Also, the results show the steps towards appropriate implementation of ANN on the FPGA. These results can be utilised as the basis for the design of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) allowing large serial production.

Dementias have been associated with changes in neural oscillations across the frequency spectrum, including the alpha range. Alpha is the most prominent rhythm in human EEG and is best detected during awake resting state (RS). Though several studies measured alpha power and synchronization in MCI, findings have not yet been integrated. Objective: To consolidate findings on power and synchronization of alpha oscillations across stages of cognitive decline. Methods: We included studies published until January 2020 that compared power or functional connectivity between 1) people with MCI and cognitively healthy older adults (OA) or people with a neurodegenerative dementia, and 2) people with progressive and stable MCI. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed when enough data was available. Results: Sixty-eight studies were included in the review. Global RS alpha power was lower in AD than in MCI (ES = -0.30; 95% CI=-0.51, -0.10; k= 6), and in MCI than in OA (ES = -1.49; 95% CI = -2.69, -0.29; k= 5). However, the latter meta-analysis should be interpreted cautiously due to high heterogeneity. The review showed lower RS alpha power in progressive than in stable MCI, and lower task-related alpha reactivity in MCI than in OA. People with MCI had both lower and higher functional connectivity than OA. Publications lacked consistency in MCI diagnosis and EEG measures. Conclusion: Research indicates that RS alpha power decreases with increasing impairment, and could-combined with measures from other frequency bands-become a biomarker of early cognitive decline.

On a neurophysiological level, theta band power has been suggested to be important during inhibitory control as well as proactive control processes. Here we ask whether theta activity in the pre-trial/between-trial time period, reflects proactive control that correlates with theta activity in the upcoming trial. Theoretical considerations also suggest that such a correlation is modulated by the demands on inhibition. To investigate these questions, we conducted an EEG study using a Go/Nogo task in which demands on inhibitory control are varied. We used different EEG beamforming approaches to focus the analysis on the functional neuroanatomical level. We show that theta band activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC, BA10) is associated with the proactive control in the pre-trial interval and correlates with theta-related processes in the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG, BA45) during response inhibition. In addition, we show that demands on inhibitory control modulate the inter-relation between proactive vmPFC and inhibitory control-related rIFG-theta activity. Such effects were not observed for beta frequency activity. The study is the first to emphasize the relevance of pre-trial (proactive) vmPFC theta-band activity during inhibitory control in humans. It is shown that pre-trial activity, which is often neglected in EEG research, provides valuable information about the neuronal dynamics of cognitive control.

Methods: Sixty-one children with BECTS diagnoses and 60 age- and education-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Four-hour EEG recordings were analyzed for each patient to check for interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), nondipole spikes, and other atypical EEG features and to examine the spike-wave index of nonrapid eyemovement (NREM) sleep. All 121 children underwent a series of neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive function. Results: Patients with a high NREM sleep discharge index (>= 55%) in the first sleep cycle exhibited significantly lower scores for arithmetic calculation, executive function, and attention and memory tests than patients with a low discharge index (<55%). Eight patients with HFOs exhibited even poorer performance than HFO-negative patients for arithmetic calculation, executive function, vocabulary comprehension, visual perception, vocal perception, spatial memory ability, and response ability. Children with bilateral discharge exhibited poorer ability in three-dimensional spatial imaging test, poorer memory, and slower response than did those with unilateral discharge (P < .05). Nondipole spikes, multiple asynchronous discharges, and generalized spike-wave discharges respectively had an impact on calculation ability, memory, and reaction ability respectively (P < .05). Conclusions: Spike frequencies in stage 3 and 4 sleep varied from those observed in stage 1 and 2 sleep; the highest spike frequencywas in stage 2 sleep. High NREM sleep discharge index (i.e., >= 55%) and HFOs were linked to the highest risk for cognitive deficit, while bilateral discharges, nondipole spikes, multiple asynchronous discharges, and generalized spike-wave discharges were less indicative of cognitive impairment.

This systematic review aims to provide an updated overview of the relationship between resting EEG cortical activity and approach/avoidance motivation personality traits. Methods: The review process was conducted according to the PRISMA-Statement, using PsycArticles, MEDLINE, Scopus, Science Citation Index, and Research Gate database. Restrictions were made by selecting EEG studies conducted in resting idling conditions, which included approach/avoidance personality traits or parallel measures, and an index of EEG brain activity. In the review 50 studies were selected, wherein 7120 healthy adult individuals participated. Results: The study of the relationship between resting EEG cortical activity and approach/avoidance personality traits provides controversial and unclear results. Therefore, the validity of resting asymmetry or frequency oscillations as a potential marker for approach/avoidance personality traits is not supported. Conclusions: There are important contextual and interactional factors not taken into account by researchers that could mediate or moderate this relationship or prove it scarcely replicable. Further, it would be necessary to conduct more sessions of EEG recordings in different seasons of the year to test the validity and the reliability of the neurobiological measures.

Motor imagery recently has been an interesting issue since the development of many cognitive studies including neuromuscular disorder rehabilitation. This research is focusing on comparing two motions, one with real motion, and the other is with no motion, but by using imagery motion. C3 and C4 channels are used to record the EEG data. The data processing is done by filtering the EEG band by using Finite Impulse Response (FIR) to limit the low pass and high pass frequency. The raw data is then cleared from the artifact by using the Automatic Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) method. The clean EEG is then decomposed into sub-band alpha and beta using the Butterworth filter. For comparing the two kinds of motions, time-domain feature extraction is used with parameters: Mean, Mean Absolute Value (MAV), and Standard Deviation (STD). The analysis is carried out by comparing the results of extraction parameters of real motor motion with imagery motion. The experimental results show that STD produces the highest number of data frames with a similar value between the real motion and imagery motion compared to other parameters. The value of the STD extraction on the alpha band ( mu-rhythm) frequency in C3 channel is 654 data frames (85.16%), and C4 channel is 672 data frames (87.45%), while the beta band frequency in C3 channel is 528 data frames (68.75%), and in C4 channel is 536 data frames (69.82%). The conclusion is standard deviation shows the best parameter with a similar pattern between real motion and imagery motion.

There is currently no cure for creatine transporter deficiency, and reliable biomarkers of translational value for monitoring disease progression and response to therapeutics are sorely lacking. Here, we found that mice lacking functional creatine transporter display a significant alteration of neural oscillations in the EEG and a severe epileptic phenotype that are recapitulated in patients with creatine transporter deficiency. In-depth examination of knockout mice for creatine transporter also revealed that a decrease in EEG theta power is predictive of the manifestation of spontaneous seizures, a frequency that is similarly affected in patients compared to healthy controls. In addition, knockout mice have a highly specific increase in haemodynamic responses in the cerebral cortex following sensory stimuli. Principal component and Random Forest analyses highlighted that these functional variables exhibit a high performance in discriminating between pathological and healthy phenotype. Overall, our findings identify novel, translational and non-invasive biomarkers for the analysis of brain function in creatine transporter deficiency, providing a very reliable protocol to longitudinally monitor the efficacy of potential therapeutic strategies in preclinical, and possibly clinical, studies.

Detection of epileptic attack is commonly carried out by viewing and analysing long-duration multi-channel EEG records. To counter this time-consuming process, a hybrid Local Binary Pattern-Wavelet based approach, classifying EEG in epileptic patients, is adopted in this research. Epilepsy is characterized by multiple ictal patterns in the form of synchronous epileptiform discharge transients. This work attempts to classify seizure from normal EEG recordings using the low-frequency activity. In order to perform this classification, the EEG signal is filtered and then transformed using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) into a new signal. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is employed to decompose the obtained signal. Wavelet coefficients are calculated to 5 levels of decomposition. A combination of univariate and bivariate features forms the feature set for seizure detection. This feature set extracted from low-frequency band coefficients helps in bringing out the dispersion, symmetry, and peakedness present in the EEG signal. A novel LBP based Spatio-temporal analysis of the continuous EEG signal for epilepsy detection is carried out on 105 seizures from 14 randomly selected subjects of CHB-MIT EEG database. A sensitivity of 100% is achieved on the CHB-MIT database while long term EEG is being tested with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. The algorithm works well to obtain a false detection rate (FP/Hour) of 0.59. The specificity of 99.8% is attained with a mean accuracy of 99.6% when tested on 498.9 h of EEG data.

Accurate detection of spontaneous seizures using a generalized linear model with external validation	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						focal epilepsy; machine learning; model validation; quantitative EEG; seizure detection	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ALGORITHM; ENTROPY; EEG	Objective Seizure detection is a major facet of electroencephalography (EEG) analysis in neurocritical care, epilepsy diagnosis and management, and the instantiation of novel therapies such as closed-loop stimulation or optogenetic control of seizures. It is also of increased importance in high-throughput, robust, and reproducible pre-clinical research. However, seizure detectors are not widely relied upon in either clinical or research settings due to limited validation. In this study, we create a high-performance seizure-detection approach, validated in multiple data sets, with the intention that such a system could be available to users for multiple purposes. Methods We introduce a generalized linear model trained on 141 EEG signal features for classification of seizures in continuous EEG for two data sets. In the first (Focal Epilepsy) data set consisting of 16 rats with focal epilepsy, we collected 1012 spontaneous seizures over 3 months of 24/7 recording. We trained a generalized linear model on the 141 features representing 20 feature classes, including univariate and multivariate, linear and nonlinear, time, and frequency domains. We tested performance on multiple hold-out test data sets. We then used the trained model in a second (Multifocal Epilepsy) data set consisting of 96 rats with 2883 spontaneous multifocal seizures. Results From the Focal Epilepsy data set, we built a pooled classifier with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.995 and leave-one-out classifiers with an AUROC of 0.962. We validated our method within the independently constructed Multifocal Epilepsy data set, resulting in a pooled AUROC of 0.963. We separately validated a model trained exclusively on the Focal Epilepsy data set and tested on the held-out Multifocal Epilepsy data set with an AUROC of 0.890. Latency to detection was under 5 seconds for over 80% of seizures and under 12 seconds for over 99% of seizures. Significance This method achieves the highest performance published for seizure detection on multiple independent data sets. This method of seizure detection can be applied to automated EEG analysis pipelines as well as closed loop interventional approaches, and can be especially useful in the setting of research using animals in which there is an increased need for standardization and high-throughput analysis of large number of seizures.

In China, electroacupuncture based on meridians theory "treating flaccid paralysis by Yangming alone" has been widely used for stroke rehabilitation in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to explore the electroencephalography change of electroacupuncture intervention on strokes patients with flaccid paralysis. Methods. Twenty-three stroke patients with flaccid paralysis and six stroke patients with spasticity accepted electroacupuncture with the acupoints Hegu [LI4], Shousanli [LI10], and Quchi [LI11] for 20 minutes and their EEG data were recorded before, during, and after the electroacupuncture intervention. Results. Compared with the baseline EEG signals before electroacupuncture, the ipsilesional and contralesional beta-band average power of patients with flaccid paralysis and spasticity were significantly increased during the needles retention stage and decreased slightly after removing the needles. The significant decrease of the ipsilesional and contralesional delta band average power in patients with flaccid paralysis occurred during the electroacupuncture stimulation, and they increased after the removal of the needles. The ipsilesional delta band average power of patients with spasticity significantly decreased during the electroacupuncture stimulation. Conclusion. From this pilot electrophysiological study, we provided a possible electrophysiological mechanism of the curative effect of electroacupuncture for stroke rehabilitation.

Up to now, various modeling approaches for automatic emotion recognition have been reported. However, the time dependency property during emotion process has not been fully considered. In order to grasp the temporal information of EEG, we adopt deep Simple Recurrent Units (SRU) network which is not only capable of processing sequence data but also has the ability to solve the problem of long-term dependencies occurrence in normal Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Before training the emotion models, Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) was applied to decompose the original EEG into five constituent sub-bands, from which features were then extracted using time, frequency and nonlinear analysis. Next, deep SRU models were established using four different features over five frequency bands and favorable results were found to be related to higher frequency bands. Finally, three ensemble strategies were employed to integrate base SRU models to get more desirable classification performance. We evaluate and compare the performance of shallow models, deep models and ensemble models. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed emotion recognition system based on SRU network and ensemble learning could achieve satisfactory identification performance with relatively economic computational cost.

Global and domain specific cognitive performance of each participant was assessed psychometrically using the Mini-mental state exam and the Cognistat, and a 32-lead monopolar EEG was recorded during a resting baseline phase and an active phase in which participants completed the Stroop test.Mainresults: Global cognitive performance was successfully predicted (81%-85% of variance) by a combination of fast wave activity variables in the alpha, beta and theta frequency bands. Interestingly, predicting domain specific performance had varying degrees of success (42%-99% of the variance predicted) and relied on combinations of both slow and fast wave activity, with delta and gamma activity predicting attention performance; delta, theta, and gamma activity predicting memory performance; and delta and beta variables predicting judgement performance.Significance: Global and domain specific cognitive performance of Australian nurses may be predicted with varying degrees of success by a unique combination of EEG variables. These proposed models image transitory cognitive declines and as such may prove useful in the prediction of early cognitive impairment, and may enable better diagnosis, and management of cognitive impairment.

Such a scenario could be when they are exposed to ongoing speech and need to sustain their attention for a rather long period of time, which requires listening effort. Two well-established physiological methods that have been found to be sensitive to identify changes in listening effort are pupillometry and electroencephalography (EEG). However, these measurements have been used mainly for momentary, evoked or episodic effort. The aim of this study was to investigate how sustained effort manifests in pupillometry and EEG, using continuous speech with varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Eight hearing-aid users participated in this exploratory study and performed a continuous speech-in-noise task. The speech material consisted of 30-second continuous streams that were presented from loudspeakers to the right and left side of the listener (+/- 30 degrees azimuth) in the presence of 4-talker background noise (+180 degrees azimuth). The participants were instructed to attend either to the right or left speaker and ignore the other in a randomized order with two different SNR conditions: 0 dB and -5 dB (the difference between the target and the competing talker). The effects of SNR on listening effort were explored objectively using pupillometry and EEG. The results showed larger mean pupil dilation and decreased EEG alpha power in the parietal lobe during the more effortful condition. This study demonstrates that both measures are sensitive to changes in SNR during continuous speech.

Traditionally, techniques such as PCA and ICA, which rely on strong non-physiological assumptions such as orthogonality and statistical independence, have been used for this purpose. Recently, tensor decomposition techniques such as parallel factor analysis have gained more popularity in neuroimaging applications as they are able to inherently contain the multidimensionality of neuroimaging data and achieve uniqueness in decomposition without making strong assumptions. Previously, the coupled matrix-tensor decomposition (CMTD) has been applied for the fusion of the EEG and fMRI. Only recently the coupled tensor-tensor decomposition (CTTD) has been proposed. Here for the first time, we propose the use of CTTD of a 4th order EEG tensor (space, time, frequency, and participant) and 3rd order fMRI tensor (space, time, participant), coupled partially in time and participant domains, for the extraction of the task related features in both modalities. We used both the sensor-level and source-level EEG for the coupling. The phase shifted paradigm signals were incorporated as the temporal initializers of the CTTD to extract the task related features. The validation of the approach is demonstrated on simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from six participants performing an N-Back memory task. The EEG and fMRI tensors were coupled in 9 components out of which seven components had a high correlation (more than 0.85) with the task. The result of the fusion recapitulates the well-known attention network as being positively, and the default mode network working negatively time-locked to the memory task.

In the auditory domain, contrasts of parietal alpha power for leftward and rightward attention reveal qualitatively similar lateralization; however, it is not clear whether alpha lateralization changes monotonically with the direction of auditory attention as it does for visual spatial attention. In addition, most previous studies of alpha oscillation did not consider individual differences in alpha frequency, but simply analyzed power in a fixed spectral band. Here, we recorded electroencephalography in human subjects when they directed attention to one of five azimuthal locations. After a cue indicating the direction of an upcoming target sequence of spoken syllables (yet before the target began), alpha power changed in a task-specific manner. Individual peak alpha frequencies differed consistently between central electrodes and parieto-occipital electrodes, suggesting multiple neural generators of task-related alpha. Parieto-occipital alpha increased over the hemisphere ipsilateral to attentional focus compared to the contralateral hemisphere, and changed systematically as the direction of attention shifted from far left to far right. These results showing that parietal alpha lateralization changes smoothly with the direction of auditory attention as in visual spatial attention provide further support to the growing evidence that the frontoparietal attention network is supramodal.

Methods We retrospectively studied 20 children who underwent epilepsy surgery. We identified ripples on HD-EEG and MEG data, localized their generators, and compared them with intracranial EEG (icEEG) ripples. When ripples and spikes co-occurred, we performed source imaging distinctly on the data above 80 Hz (to localize ripples) and below 70 Hz (to localize spikes). We assessed whether missed resection of ripple sources predicted poor outcome, separately for ripples-on-spikes and ripples-alone. Similarly, predictive value of spikes was calculated. Results We observed scalp ripples in 16 patients (10 good outcome). Ripple sources were highly concordant to the icEEG ripples (HD-EEG concordance: 79%; MEG: 83%). When ripples and spikes co-occurred, their sources were spatially distinct in 83-84% of the cases. Removing the sources of ripples-on-spikes predicted good outcome with 90% accuracy for HD-EEG (P = 0.008) and 86% for MEG (P = 0.044). Conversely, removing ripples-alone did not predict outcome. Resection of spike sources (generated at the same time as ripples) predicted good outcome for HD-EEG (P = 0.036; accuracy = 87%), while did not reach significance for MEG (P = 0.1; accuracy = 80%). Interpretation HD-EEG and MEG localize interictal ripples with high precision in children with refractory epilepsy. Scalp ripples-on-spikes are prognostic, noninvasive biomarkers of epileptogenicity, since removing their cortical generators predicts good outcome. Conversely, scalp ripples-alone are most likely generated by non-epileptogenic areas.

As the brain activity of the prestimulus and encoding phases has a crucial effect on subsequent memory outcomes (e.g., remembered or forgotten), previous studies have tried to predict the memory performance in this period. Conventional studies have used the spectral power or event-related potential of specific regions as the classification feature. However, as multiple brain regions work collaboratively to process memory, it could be a better option to use functional connectivity within the memory-related brain network to predict subsequent memory performance. In this study, we acquired the EEG signals while performing an associative memory task that remembers scene-word pairs. For the connectivity analysis, we estimated the cross-mutual information within the default mode network with the time-frequency spectra at the prestimulus and encoding phases. Then, we predicted the success or failure of subsequent memory outcome with the connectivity features. We found that the classifier with support vector machine achieved the highest classification accuracy of 80.83% +/- 12.65% (mean +/- standard deviation) using the beta (13-30 Hz) connectivity at encoding phase among the multiple frequency bands and task phases. Using the prestimulus beta connectivity, the classification accuracy of 72.45% +/- 12.52% is also achieved. Among the features, the connectivity related to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was found to contribute to successful memory encoding. The connectivity related to the posterior cingulate cortex was found to contribute to the failure of memory encoding. The present study showed for the first time the successful prediction with high accuracy of subsequent memory outcome using single-trial functional connectivity.

In a previous study using eye-tracking data, it was reliably recognized whether the eyes of a driver had become fixated or pursued hazard cues. A limitation of using eye-tracking data is that it cannot be identified whether the anticipatory activity of a driver to hazards has been activated. This study aimed to propose a method to recognize whether the psychological anticipation of a driver had been activated by a hazard cue using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as input. Thirty-six drivers participated in a simulated driving task designed according to a standard psychological anticipatory study paradigm. Power spectral density (PSD) features were extracted from raw EEG data, and feature dimensions were reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that when a driver detected a hazard cue, the alpha band immediately decreased, and the beta band increased approximately 300 ms after the cue appeared. Based on performance evaluation of the support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), SVM could detect the anticipatory activity of the driver to a potential hazard in a timely manner with an accuracy of 81%. The findings demonstrated that the hazard anticipatory activity of a driver could be recognized with EEG data as input.

Pain phenotypes classified by machine learning using electroencephalography features	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; MATRIX; INJURY; TESTS; THETA	Pain is a multidimensional experience mediated by distributed neural networks in the brain. To study this phenomenon, EEGs were collected from 20 subjects with chronic lumbar radiculopathy, 20 age and gender matched healthy subjects, and 17 subjects with chronic lumbar pain scheduled to receive an implanted spinal cord stimulator. Analysis of power spectral density, coherence, and phase-amplitude coupling using conventional statistics showed that there were no significant differences between the radiculopathy and control groups after correcting for multiple comparisons. However, analysis of transient spectral events showed that there were differences between these two groups in terms of the number, power, and frequency-span of events in a low gamma band. Finally, we trained a binary support vector machine to classify radiculopathy versus healthy subjects, as well as a 3-way classifier for subjects in the 3 groups. Both classifiers performed significantly better than chance, indicating that EEG features contain relevant information pertaining to sensory states, and may be used to help distinguish between pain states when other clinical signs are inconclusive.

J	Packard, PA; Steiger, TK; Fuentemilla, L; Bunzeck, N				Packard, Pau A.; Steiger, Tineke K.; Fuentemilla, Lluis; Bunzeck, Nico			Neural oscillations and event-related potentials reveal how semantic congruence drives long-term memory in both young and older humans	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PROACTIVE BRAIN; CATEGORY NORMS; TOP-DOWN; SCHEMA; RECOGNITION; CONFIDENCE; RECOLLECTION; LANGUAGE	Long-term memory can improve when incoming information is congruent with known semantic information. This so-called congruence effect has widely been shown in younger adults, but age-related changes and neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, congruence improved recognition memory in younger and older adults (i.e. congruence effect), with only weak evidence for age-related decline in one behavioral study. In an EEG study, however, no significant behavioral differences in the congruence effect could be observed between age-groups. In line with this observation, electroencephalography data show that, in both groups, congruence led to widespread differences in Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), starting at around 400ms after stimulus onset, and theta, alpha and beta oscillations (4-20Hz). Importantly, these congruence-related ERPs were associated to increases in memory performance for congruent items, in both age groups. Finally, the described ERPs and neural oscillations in the theta-alpha range (5-13Hz) were less pronounced in the elderly despite a preserved congruence effect. Together, semantic congruence increases long-term memory across the lifespan, and, at the neural level, this could be linked to neural oscillations in the theta, alpha and beta range, as well as ERPs that were previously associated with semantic processing.

The present study aimed to investigate the development of memory processes both for auditory and visual memory using electroencephalography (EEG)-Brain Dynamics methodologies. Sixteen healthy children between the ages of 6 and 7 years and eighteen healthy young adults (age: 21.32 +/- 3.28 years) were included in the study. EEG was recorded from 18 channels during the visual and auditory memory paradigms. Two different subtests of the WISC-IV IQ test were applied to all children. Eventrelated theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) power and phase-locking were analyzed. The young adults had higher memory performance than the children for both auditory and visual paradigms. The children had increased theta phase-locking and left alpha power in response to the remembered objects in comparison to the forgotten objects. The young adults had higher theta and alpha phase-locking than the children over the frontal and central locations (p < 0.05), and the children had higher parietal-occipital alpha phase-locking than the young adults. There was an increase in alpha power in children, whereas young adults had decreased post-stimulus alpha power in response to memory paradigms. The present study showed that frontocentral theta and alpha phase-locking had an essential role in brain maturation and successful memory performance. Event-related theta and alpha responses could be one of the important indicators of the mature and healthy brain, and these responses could change depending on the maturation state and age.

To date, despite the emergence of neuroscientific literature on the role of body orientation on hand action perception, limited studies have directly investigated the role of body orientation in the interaction between gesture and language. To address this research question, we carried out an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment presenting to participants (n= 21) videos of frontal and lateral communicative hand gestures of 5 s (e.g., raising a hand), followed by visually presented sentences that are either congruent or incongruent with the gesture (e.g., "the mountain ishigh/low horizontal ellipsis "). Participants underwent a semantic probe task, judging whether a target word is related or unrelated to the gesture-sentence event. EEG results suggest that, during the perception phase of handgestures, while both frontal and lateral gestures elicited a power decrease in both the alpha (8-12 Hz) and the beta (16-24 Hz) bands, lateral versus frontal gestures elicited reduced power decrease in the beta band, source-located to the medial prefrontal cortex. For sentence comprehension, at the critical word whose meaning is congruent/incongruent with the gesture prime, frontal gestures elicited an N400 effect for gesture-sentence incongruency. More importantly, this incongruency effect was significantly reduced for lateral gestures. These findings suggest that body orientation plays an important role in gesture perception, and that its inferred social-communicative intention may influence gesture-language interaction at semantic level.

For this purpose, EEG background activity from 51 healthy control subjects, 51 mild cognitive impairment patients, 50 mild AD patients, 50 moderate AD patients, and 50 severe AD patients was analyzed by means of bispectrum. Three inter-band features were extracted from bispectrum matrices: bispectral relative power (BispRP), cubic bispectral entropy (BispEn), and bispectral median frequency (BispMF). BispRP results showed an increase of delta and theta interactions with other frequency bands and the opposite behavior for alpha, beta-1, and beta-2. Delta and theta interactions, along with the rest of the spectrum, also experimented a decrease of BispEn with disease progression, suggesting these bands interact with a reduced variety of components in advanced stages of dementia. Finally, BispMF showed a consistent reduction along the AD continuum in all bands, which is reflective of an interaction of the global spectrum with lower frequency bands as the disease develops. Our results indicate a progressive decrease in inter-band interactions with the severity of the disease, especially those involving high frequency components. Since inter-band coupling oscillations are related to complex and multi-scaled brain processes, these alterations likely reflect the neurodegeneration associated with the AD continuum.

While some aspects learning have been well studied by EEG (e.g., theta and gamma oscillations), the role of spontaneous and scale-free brain activity remains unclear. We used a continuous chemistry learning EEG paradigm to explore how scale-free brain activity is related learning. We found a learning effect in participants (N = 22) with an increase in test accuracy (learning gain) and decrease in test question response times in a counterbalanced pre/post-test experiment. In the brain we found increased overall (mixed) broadband power (1-50 Hz) during learning compared to rest. We then used the IRASA method to separate oscillatory and fractal (i.e. scale-free) spectral components and observed an increase in low-frequency oscillatory band powers during learning. More importantly, we found that fractal power increased during the learning sessions relative to oscillatory power. Finally, the structure of the fractal power spectra (PLE) correlated to the individual participants' learning gains. These findings support the importance of scale-free activity for learning from a complex visual paradigm. We tentatively hypothesize that this fractal component is involved in integrating the different time scales of the learning material with those of the spontaneous activity during learning and mental model shaping.

Technological advances such as powerful wireless EEG systems have led to a renewed interest in EEG as a clinical and research tool for studying real-time changes in the brain. We report here the first normative study of EEG activity while healthy young adults completed a series of cognitive tests recently published by the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIH-TCB), a commonly-used standardized measure of cognition primarily used in clinical populations. In this preliminary study using a wireless EEG system, we examined power spectral density (PSD) in four EEG frequency bands. During baseline and cognitive testing, PSD activity for the lower frequency bands (theta and alpha) was greater, relative to the higher frequency bands (beta and gamma), suggesting participants were relaxed and mentally alert. Alpha, beta and gamma activity was increased during a memory test compared to two other, less demanding executive function tests. Gamma activity was also inversely correlated with performance on the memory test, consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis which proposes that better cognitive performance may link with lower cortical energy consumption. In summary, our study suggests that cognitive performance is related to the dynamics of EEG activity in a normative young adult population.

Among various sleep electroencephalography activities, the sleep spindle is one specific electroencephalographic rhythm that has potential to be a biomarker for AD. This review ex-plores the association between sleep spindles and AD-related dementia from a neuropsychological perspective by a systematic re-examining of recent findings. In general, sleep spindles, characterized by density, amplitude, duration, and frequency, are disrupted in AD. Moreover, its functional coupling with slow oscillation also suffers in AD. While preliminary, our observations and comparisons suggest that spindle density rather than frequency and fast spindles rather than slow spindles could be more sensitive to AD-related dementia, and spindle plasticity provides possibilities for targeted interference. In conclusion, quantitative and qualitative features of sleep spindles represent potential non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers for AD and provide both therapeutic and public health implications.

However, the fact is that we know very little yet about the electrophysiological marker for assessing diver sleepiness. Previous studies and our researches have shown that alpha blocking phenomenon and alpha wave attenuation-disappearance phenomenon represent two different sleepiness levels, the relaxed wakefulness and the sleep onset, respectively. This paper proposes a novel model for driver sleepiness detection based on electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. Our model aims to track the change in alpha waves and differentiate the two alpha-related phenomena. Continuous wavelet transform is adopted to extract features from physiological signals in both time and frequency domains. Meanwhile, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is introduced to deal with temporal information of EEG and EOG signals. To deal with insufficient physiological sample problem, generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to augment the training dataset. Experimental results indicate that the F1 score for detecting start and end points of alpha waves reaches to around 95%. And Conditional Wasserstein GAN (CWGAN) we adopted was effective in augmenting dataset and boost classifier performance. Meanwhile, our LSTM classifier achieved a mean accuracy of 98% for classifying end points of alpha waves under leave-one-subject-out cross validation. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several studies have suggested that the propagation direction of a traveling waves can be task dependent. For example, a recent electroencephalography (EEG) study from our group found that forward waves (i.e., occipital to frontal, FW waves) were observed during visual processing, whereas backward waves (i.e., frontal to occipital, BW waves) mostly occurred in the absence of sensory input. These EEG recordings, however, were obtained from different experimental sessions and different groups of subjects. To further examine how the waves' direction changes between task conditions, 13 human participants were tested on a target detection task while EEG signals were recorded simultaneously. We alternated visual stimulation (5-s display of visual luminance sequences) and resting state (5 s of black screen) within each single trial, allowing us to monitor the moment to -moment progression of traveling waves. As expected, the direction of a waves was closely linked with task conditions. First, FW waves from occipital to frontal regions, absent during rest, emerged as a result of visual processing, while BW waves in the opposite direction dominated in the absence of visual inputs, and were reduced (but not eliminated) by external visual inputs. Second, during visual stimulation (but not rest), both waves coexisted on average, but were negatively correlated. In summary, we conclude that the functional role of a traveling waves is closely related with their propagating direction, with stimulus -evoked FW waves supporting visual processing and spontaneous BW waves involved more in top -down control.

Sixteen episodes of clinical Szs were recorded by scalp EEG with a 2-seconds time constant. Among the 16 recorded episodes of Sz, four EEG Sz patterns originated from the left posterior temporal area (chronic focus), and all patterns (100%) exhibited active DC shifts preceding the conventional pattern by 12 seconds. Twelve EEG Sz patterns originated from the right parietal area (acute focus), and the high-frequency oscillations (five Szs) (41.6%) and DC shifts (six Szs) (50%) occurred first, followed by the conventional pattern 8 seconds later. Because both the active and the passive DC shifts were recorded with a time constant of 2 seconds, which was smaller than that reported previously for ictal DC shifts (e.g., time constant of 10 seconds), clinically useful ictal DC shifts could be routinely inspected with a time constant of 2 seconds.

However, due to the limited temporal resolution of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, the role(s) of the insula in auditory processing remains unclear. As the anterior insula (aI) and the posterior insula (pI) have different connections and are thought to be functionally distinct, it is likely that these two areas contribute differently to auditory processing. Our study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of auditory processing in the insula using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). Eight epileptic patients completed two passive listening tasks and one three-stimulus auditory oddball detection task during the intracranial EEG monitoring of their drug-resistant seizures. Recordings were obtained from depth electrodes implanted in 11 insulae. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed using permutation analyses during the N100 and the P300 intervals, and modulations of alpha, theta, and gamma band responses were compared using Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney analyses. N100 responses to auditory stimuli were mostly observed in the pI and were little affected by task conditions. Auditory target detection was associated with P300 ERPs, and alpha, theta, high- and low-gamma responses, preferentially at aI contacts. Results suggest that the aI is involved in voluntary attentional processing of task-relevant information, whereas the pI is involved in automatic auditory processing.

Thus, the main aim of the current study was to investigate triple network functional dynamics in subjects with high trait anxiety during resting state (RS) through electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity. Twenty-three individuals with high-trait-anxiety (HTA) and forty-five participants with low-trait-anxiety (LTA) were enrolled. EEG analyses were conducted by means of the exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography software (eLORETA). Compared to LTA participants, HTA subjects showed a decrease of alpha connectivity within the salience network (SN), between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and both left and right anterior insula (AI). Furthermore, SN functional connectivity strength was negatively correlated with higher trait anxiety, even when controlling for potential confounding variables (e.g., depressive and obsessive compulsive symptoms). Taken together, our results point out a specific functional connectivity pattern in HTA individuals, which consists in a dysfunctional communication within the SN, specifically in the AI-dACC pathway. This functional pattern could underline, at rest, saliency detection and brain correlates of altereted emotion regulation and cognitive control processes typically involved in anxiety.

Task-related electroencephalography was collected in 23 young adults following 20 min of rest and AE on separate, counterbalanced days. The results revealed reductions in standard deviation of response time and coefficient of variation of response time following AE compared to rest. Neuroelectric analyses showed increased P3 amplitude following AE compared to rest. Task-related frontal alpha desynchronization was stronger in the 2-back compared with the 1-back task following AE, while no such modulation was observed following rest. These findings suggest AE may temporarily enhance working memory, as reflected by decreases in response variability, which are accompanied by neuroelectric indices reflecting greater upregulation of attentional processes.

However, the active BCI paradigm is still underdeveloped with a lack of variety. It is imperative to adapt more voluntary mental activities for the active BCI control, which can induce separable electroencephalography (EEG) features. This study aims to demonstrate the brain function of timing prediction, i.e., the expectation of upcoming time intervals, is accessible for BCIs. Eighteen subjects were selected for this study. They were trained to have a precise idea of two sub-second time intervals, i.e., 400 ms and 600 ms, and were asked to measure a time interval of either 400 ms or 600 ms in mind after a cue onset. The EEG features induced by timing prediction were analyzed and classified using the combined discriminative canonical pattern matching and common spatial pattern. It was found that the ERPs in low-frequency (0 similar to 4 Hz) and energy in high-frequency (20 similar to 60 Hz) were separable for distinct timing predictions. The accuracy reached the highest of 93.75% with an average of 76.45% for the classification of 400 vs. 600 ms timing.

High gamma cortical processing of continuous speech in younger and older listeners	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory spectrogram; Spectrotemporal; Volume source localization; Aging, speech encoding	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSES; SPECTROTEMPORAL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; BRAIN-STEM RESPONSES; WHOLE-HEAD MEG; AGING MIDBRAIN; REPRESENTATION; PHASE; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Neural processing along the ascending auditory pathway is often associated with a progressive reduction in characteristic processing rates. For instance, the well-known frequency-following response (FFR) of the auditory midbrain, as measured with electroencephalography (EEG), is dominated by frequencies from similar to 100 Hz to several hundred Hz, phase-locking to the acoustic stimulus at those frequencies. In contrast, cortical responses, whether measured by EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG), are typically characterized by frequencies of a few Hz to a few tens of Hz, time-locking to acoustic envelope features. In this study we investigated a crossover case, cortically generated responses time-locked to continuous speech features at FFR-like rates. Using MEG, we analyzed responses in the high gamma range of 70-200 Hz to continuous speech using neural source-localized reverse correlation and the corresponding temporal response functions (TRFs). Continuous speech stimuli were presented to 40 subjects (17 younger, 23 older adults) with clinically normal hearing and their MEG responses were analyzed in the 70-200 Hz band. Consistent with the relative insensitivity of MEG to many subcortical structures, the spatiotemporal profile of these response components indicated a cortical origin with similar to 40 ms peak latency and a right hemisphere bias. TRF analysis was performed using two separate aspects of the speech stimuli: a) the 70-200 Hz carrier of the speech, and b) the 70-200 Hz temporal modulations in the spectral envelope of the speech stimulus. The response was dominantly driven by the envelope modulation, with a much weaker contribution from the carrier. Age-related differences were also analyzed to investigate a reversal previously seen along the ascending auditory pathway, whereby older listeners show weaker midbrain FFR responses than younger listeners, but, paradoxically, have stronger cortical low frequency responses. In contrast to both these earlier results, this study did not find clear age-related differences in high gamma cortical responses to continuous speech. Cortical responses at FFR-like frequencies shared some properties with midbrain responses at the same frequencies and with cortical responses at much lower frequencies.

Since EEG signals are highly nonstationary, wavelet transformation is applied to raw EEG signals to extract spectral information in time-frequency domain. These spectral features are fed as input to machine learning techniques to train the model and to predict the epileptic seizures. Machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear SVC, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Naive Bayes are explored for comparison and to validate the results. Nave Bayes and SVM classifiers recorded high recognition accuracies of 95.86% and 98.30%, respectively, and has outperformed other ML techniques to detect epileptic seizures using wavelet features in EEG signals.

Reconfigurations within resonating communities of brain regions following TMS reveal different scales of processing	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neuroimaging; Network flexibility; Network allegiance; Local-global processing; TMS; EEG	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; FAST NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; ALPHA-BAND; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; FREQUENCY; CORTEX	An overarching goal of neuroscience research is to understand how heterogeneous neuronal ensembles cohere into networks of coordinated activity to support cognition. To investigate how local activity harmonizes with global signals, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) while single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) perturbed occipital and parietal cortices. We estimate the rapid network reconfigurations in dynamic network communities within specific frequency bands of the EEG, and characterize two distinct features of network reconfiguration, flexibility and allegiance, among spatially distributed neural sources following TMS. Using distance from the stimulation site to infer local and global effects, we find that alpha activity (8-12 Hz) reflects concurrent local and global effects on network dynamics. Pairwise allegiance of brain regions to communities on average increased near the stimulation site, whereas TMS-induced changes to flexibility were generally invariant to distance and stimulation site. In contrast, communities within the beta (13-20 Hz) band demonstrated a high level of spatial specificity, particularly within a cluster comprising paracentral areas. Together, these results suggest that focal magnetic neurostimulation to distinct cortical sites can help identify both local and global effects on brain network dynamics, and highlight fundamental differences in the manifestation of network reconfigurations within alpha and beta frequency bands.

Inter-brain neural synchronization and its implications for theories of human consciousness	NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS			English	Article						neural synchronization; hyperscanning; electroencephalography; EEG; social interaction; human mind; consciousness	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; COGNITION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COMMUNICATION; COORDINATION; ENTRAINMENT; COOPERATION	The association between neural oscillations and functional integration is widely recognized in the study of human cognition. Large-scale synchronization of neural activity has also been proposed as the neural basis of consciousness. Intriguingly, a growing number of studies in social cognitive neuroscience reveal that phase synchronization similarly appears across brains during meaningful social interaction. Moreover, this inter-brain synchronization has been associated with subjective reports of social connectedness, engagement, and cooperativeness, as well as experiences of social cohesion and 'self-other merging'. These findings challenge the standard view of human consciousness as essentially first-person singular and private. We therefore revisit the recent controversy over the possibility of extended consciousness and argue that evidence of inter-brain synchronization in the fastest frequency bands overcomes the hitherto most convincing sceptical position. If this proposal is on the right track, our understanding of human consciousness would be profoundly transformed, and we propose a method to test this proposal experimentally.

Numerous studies have investigated the neural mechanisms of emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) features. In the previous study, emotion target was presented under a static or irregular background, which made the response highly time-locked. As an oscillatory component of EEG, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has distinctive frequency and phase properties, which provides more stable information than the other components of EEG. This study combined the emotion target with SSVEP to explore neural mechanisms of visual neurons under flickering background. Three basic emotions (delightfulness, sadness and, anger) were presented in 216 frequency-intensity conditions. Participants were asked to recognize the emotions and make judgments. The degree of alpha entrainment (valued as normalized Shannon entropy), SSVEP amplitude and recognition accuracy were calculated as response features. The results indicated that: SSVEP amplitude and recognition accuracy positively correlated with each other in frequency domain (7-15 Hz); alpha entrainment, and recognition accuracy had similar linear variation in intensity domain (level 1-4), and had a threshold around intensity 3; the three basic emotions had no clear relationship with each other in recognition. This study provided a new sight for neuroscience and would be an important reference to clinical psychology. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

After confirming a deficit at 30 Hz with electroencephalography (EEG), we applied 20 minutes of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to transiently restore this activity in adults with dyslexia. The intervention significantly improved phonological processing and reading accuracy as measured immediately after tACS. The effect occurred selectively for a 30-Hz stimulation in the dyslexia group. Importantly, we observed that the focal intervention over the left auditory cortex also decreased 30-Hz activity in the right superior temporal cortex, resulting in reinstating a left dominance for the oscillatory response. These findings establish a causal role of neural oscillations in phonological processing and offer solid neurophysiological grounds for a potential correction of low-gamma anomalies and for alleviating the phonological deficit in dyslexia.

Thus, they often act as distractors, interfering with performance in concurrent primary tasks. Keeping task-relevant information in focus while suppressing the impact of distracting stimuli is one of the functions of working memory (WM). Macroscopic brain oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) have recently been identified as a neural correlate of WM processing. Using electroencephalography, we examined the extent to which changes in alpha power and inter-site connectivity during a typical WM task are sensitive to load and emotional distraction. Participants performed a lateralized change-detection task with two levels of load (four vs. two items), which was preceded by naturalistic scenes rated either as unpleasant or neutral, acting as distractors. The results showed the expected parieto-occipital alpha reduction in the hemisphere contralateral to the WM task array, compared to the ipsilateral hemisphere, during the retention interval. Selectively heightened oscillatory coupling between frontal and occipital sensors was observed (1) during the retention interval as a function of load, and (2) upon the onset of the memory array, after viewing neutral compared to unpleasant distractors. At the end of the retention interval, we observed greater coupling during the unpleasant compared to the neutral condition. These findings are consistent with the notions that (1) representing more items in WM requires greater interconnectivity across cortical areas, and (2) unpleasant emotional distractors interfere with subsequent WM processing by disrupting processing during the encoding stage.

Concepts have two very different relations: thematic relations based on the co-occurrence of events or scenarios, and taxonomic relations based on similarity or shared features. However, it remains unclear whether thematic and taxonomic relationships differentially affect fear generalization. To clarify the underlying cognitive mechanisms of these relations, the current study combined the classical fear conditioning procedure with electroencephalography (EEG). Forty participants were conditioned to a neutral word by pairing the presentation of the word with an unpleasant electrical pulse. A different stimulus was not paired with the electrical pulse. Next, during generalization testing, thematically related or taxonomic-related words were presented. Behavioral responses (shock expectancy and response time) and brain responses (event-related potentials [ERP] and oscillation activity) were recorded. Behavioral results showed that taxonomic relations initiated higher shock expectancy compared with thematic relations, and that conceptual relations did not affect response times. Taxonomic relations induced larger P2 components than thematic relations, and danger generalization stimuli initiated smaller P600 components than safe generalization stimuli. In addition, the magnitudes of alpha and beta oscillations were larger for danger generalization stimuli. These results suggested that taxonomic stimuli generalize broader responses compared with thematic relations after fear conditioning. Therefore, we report a possible new electrophysiological evidence for the presentation of fear generalization. These findings aid our understanding of fear generalization at the concept level and have clinical implications for the cognitive treatment of anxiety disorders.

We hypothesized that age-related alterations in pain tolerance are associated with functioning deterioration of the frontal cortex during normal aging. Twenty-one young and 41 elderly healthy participants underwent a tonic heat pain test, during which cerebral activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Elderly participants were divided into two subgroups according to their scores on executive tests, high performers (HPs; n = 21) and low performers (LPs; n = 20). Pain measures [exposure times (ETs) and perceived pain ratings] and cerebral activity were compared among the three groups. ETs were significantly lower in elderly LPs than in young participants and elderly HPs. Electroencephalographic analyses showed that gamma-band oscillations (GBOs) were significantly increased in pain state for all subjects, especially in the frontal sites. Source analysis showed that GBO increase in elderly LPs was contributed not only by frontal but also by central, parietal, and occipital regions. These findings suggest that better preservation of frontal functions may result in better pain tolerance by elderly subjects.

Changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity associated with mental fatigue has been frequently studied and considered a promising biomarker of mental fatigue. This is despite differences in methodologies and outcomes in prior research. A systematic review with meta-analyses was conducted to establish the influence of mental fatigue on EEG activity spectral bands, and to determine in which regions fatigue-related EEG spectral changes are likely to occur. A high-yield search strategy identified 21 studies meeting inclusion criteria for investigating the change in EEG spectral activity in non-diseased adults engaged in mentally fatiguing tasks. A medium effect size (using Cohen's g) of 0.68 (95%CI: 0.24-1.13) was found for increase in overall EEG activity following mental fatigue. Further examination of individual EEG spectral bands and regions using network meta-analyses indicated large increases in theta (g = 1.03; 95%CI: 0.79-1.60) and alpha bands (g = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.47-1.43), with small to moderate changes found in delta and beta bands. Central regions of the scalp showed largest change (g = 0.80; 95%CI: 0.46-1.21). Sub-group analyses indicated large increases in theta activity in frontal, central and posterior sites (all g > 1), with moderate changes in alpha activity in central and posterior sites. Findings have implications for fatigue monitoring and countermeasures with support for change in theta activity in frontal, central and posterior sites as a robust biomarker of mental fatigue and change in alpha wave activity considered a second line biomarker to account for individual variability.

The aim of this study was to find a robust objective measure for the sleep disturbance in patients having PTSD. Methods: The current study assessed EEG power across a wide frequency range and multiple scalp locations, in matched trauma-exposed individuals with and without PTSD, during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. In addition, a full polysomnographical evaluation was performed, including sleep staging and assessment of respiratory function, limb movements, and heart rate. The occurrence of sleep disorders was also assessed. Results: In patients having PTSD, NREM sleep shows a substantial loss of slow oscillation power and increased higher frequency activity compared with controls. The change is most pronounced over right-frontal sensors and correlates with insomnia. PTSD REM sleep shows a large power shift in the opposite direction, with increased slow oscillation power over occipital areas, which is strongly related to nightmare activity and to a lesser extent with insomnia. These pronounced spectral changes occur in the context of severe subjective sleep problems, increased occurrence of various sleep disorders and modest changes in sleep macrostructure. Conclusions: This is the first study to show pronounced changes in EEG spectral topologies during both NREM and REM sleep in PTSD. Importantly, the observed power changes reflect the hallmarks of PTSD sleep problems: insomnia and nightmares and may thus be specific for PTSD. A spectral index derived from these data distinguishes patients from controls with high effect size, bearing promise as a candidate biomarker.	[de Boer, M.; Hofman, W.

Inter-brain Synchronization in the Practice of Tibetan Monastic Debate	MINDFULNESS			English	Article						Hyperscanning; Monastic debate; Tibetan Buddhism; Meditation; Concentration; Analytical meditation	FRONTAL-MIDLINE-THETA; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; MEDITATION; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; MAINTENANCE; ENGAGEMENT; FREQUENCY	Objectives Although mindfulness meditation is the familiar and researched form of mental training derived from Buddhism, it represents but one form of practice. Monastic debate is an interactive and dyadic analytical meditation practice that originates from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition where monastics seek to jointly deepen their understanding of complicated philosophical issues. To date, monastic debate and analytic meditation have yet to be examined in the context of scientific investigation. Methods In the current study, we examined the neural correlates of this analytical meditation practice by means of hyperscanning electroencephalography, a method well-suited for examining social interactions. Results Consistent with the idea that analytical meditation helps to train concentration, we observed that over the course of the debate, mid-frontal theta oscillations-a correlate of absorption-increased significantly. This increase was stronger for more experienced monks as compared with monks at the beginning of their education. In addition, we found evidence for increases in synchrony in frontal alpha oscillations between paired debaters during moments of agreement as compared with disagreement on a set of premises. Conclusions Together, these findings provide an initial understanding of Tibetan monastic debate and analytical meditation using neuroscientific methods.

In this study, we used human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to show that anticipation resets the phase of delta oscillations in piriform cortex prior to odor arrival. Anticipatory phase reset correlates with ensuing odor-evoked theta power and improvements in perceptual accuracy. These effects were consistently present in each individual subject and were not driven by potential confounds of pre-inhale motor preparation or power changes. Together, these findings suggest that states of anticipation enhance olfactory perception through phase resetting of delta oscillations in piriform cortex.

Cortical connectivity and spectral perturbations underlying TENS stimulation of hand nerves: a case study	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHM	The major challenge in upper limbs neuroprosthetic improvement is the implementation of effective sensory feedback. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of the median and ulnar nerves confirmed, with electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, the presence of appropriate responses in relevant cortical areas with induced sensation successfully located in the innervation regions of each nerve. The characterization of these elicited responses could be used to recreate precise somatotopic feedback from hand protheses. Using TENS and EEG, the purpose of this study was to detect distinctions in time-frequency cortical dynamics and connectivity occurring after stimulation of hand nerves. Region of interest (ROI) were selected according to topographical distributions and Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP) localization and were named Contralateral Parietal (Cont P), Central Frontal (Cent F) and Superior Parietal (Sup P). The analysis of cortical oscillations showed spectral inflections in theta [4-7 Hz] and alpha [7.5-12.5 Hz] band which occurred at 60 ms in Cont P and 300 ms in Sup P and prominent for the ulnar condition over the median one. The beta band decrease [16-30 Hz] which occurred in the same ROIs was especially significant after ulnar stimulation too. Effective connectivity measures did not differ significantly across conditions but exhibited some slight difference in the alpha-band causal flow coming from Cent F in direction to Cont P and Sup P. Although pending completion of multiple-subjects study, these results already suggest magnitude differences in somatosensory spectral fluctuations and sensorimotor interactions flows.

In the classification and detection of epileptic seizures, electroencephalography (EEG) measurements, which record the electrical activities of the brain, are frequently used. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its derivative, ensemble EMD (EEMD) are recently developed methods used to decompose non-stationary and nonlinear signals such as EEG into a finite number of oscillations called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Our main objective in this study is to present a hybrid IMF selection method combining four different approaches (energy, correlation, power spectral distance, and statistical significance measures), and investigate the effect of selected IMFs extracted by EMD and EEMD on the classification. We have applied the proposed IMF selection approach on the classification of EEG signals recorded from epilepsy patients who are under treatment at our collaborator hospital. Multichannel EEG signals collected from epilepsy patients are decomposed into IMFs, and then IMF selection was performed. Finally, time- and spectral-domain, and nonlinear features are extracted and feature sets are created for the classification. Results The maximum classification accuracies obtained using various combinations of IMFs were 94.56%, 95.63%, 96.8%, and 96.25% for SVM, KNN, naive Bayes, and logistic regression classifiers, respectively, by using EMD analysis; whereas, the EEMD approach has provided maximum classification accuracies of 96.06%, 97%, 97%, and 96.25% for SVM, KNN, naive Bayes, and logistic regression, respectively. Classification performance with the same features obtained using direct EEG signals instead of the decomposed IMFs was worse than the aforementioned 2 approaches for every combination. Conclusion Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IMF selection approach affects the classification results. Also, EEMD provides a robust method for feature extraction from EEG signals in order to classify pre-seizure and seizure segments.

Many studies use headphones to deliver a click train stimulus (40 Hz) to evoke the brain oscillations. However, headphones can generate a stimulus transduction artifact. The aim of this study is to investigate a stimulus transducer artifact due to click train stimulation. We further describe the influence of the artifact to final data analysis. We recorded hdEEG from a human head phantom to control the experimental conditions. The intertrial phase clustering was computed to evaluate phase locking across trials before and during stimulation by headphones and speakers (control condition). Results show, that headphones generated artifact in higher harmonic components of 40 Hz. Time-frequency analysis proves that the artifact doe to headphones is phase locked to stimulation onset. On the other hand, the speakers did not create this artifact. In future work, we will compare our results with results on human subjects.

Early diagnosis of ADHD may effectively reduce the symptoms and side effects of this disorder. Recording and analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the proper functional methods to detect such disorders, which merits independency from subjects variability. This study considers classification of ADHD and healthy subjects by using EEG signals and temporal and frequency features such as common spatial pattern (CSP), selective nonlinear attributes, and through usage of filter banks and time windowing approaches. In order to evaluate our proposed method, we applied it on a benchmark dataset, namely NBML, which consists of 328 epochs of recorded EEG signals from 61 subjects in two classes of ADHD and healthy. The proposed method achieved the discrimination accuracy of 83.33% of the two classes by using the proposed KNN classifier, which proved superior to previously reported results on the same dataset.

Such synchronized networks are transient and dynamic, established on the timescale of milliseconds in order to support ongoing cognitive operations. However, few studies characterizing dynamic electrophysiological brain networks have simultaneously accounted for temporal non-stationarity, spectral structure, and spatial properties. Here, we propose an analysis framework for characterizing the large-scale phase-coupling network dynamics during task performance using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We exploit the high spatiotemporal resolution of MEG to measure time-frequency dynamics of connectivity between parcellated brain regions, yielding data in tensor format. We then use a tensor component analysis (TCA)-based procedure to identify the spatio-temporal-spectral modes of covariation among separate regions in the human brain. We validate our pipeline using MEG data recorded during a hand movement task, extracting a transient motor network with beta-dominant spectral mode, which is significantly modulated by the movement task. Next, we apply the proposed pipeline to explore brain networks that support cognitive operations during a working memory task. The derived results demonstrate the temporal formation and dissolution of multiple phase-coupled networks with specific spectral modes, which are associated with face recognition, vision, and movement. The proposed pipeline can characterize the spectro-temporal dynamics of functional connectivity in the brain on the subsecond timescale, commensurate with that of cognitive performance.

Fifteen patients with cingulate gyrus epilepsy (mean age = 21 years) and 15 healthy controls (mean age = 24 years) were studied in the resting state using magnetoencephalography. Twelve brain areas of interest in the default mode network were extracted and investigated with multifrequency signals that included alpha (alpha, 8-13 Hz), beta (beta, 14-30 Hz), and gamma (gamma, 31-80 Hz) band oscillations. Patients with cingulate gyrus epilepsy had significantly greater connectivity in all three frequency bands (alpha, beta, gamma). A frequency-specific elevation of functional connectivity was found in patients compared to controls. The greater functional connectivity in the gamma band was significantly more prominent than that of the alpha and beta bands. Patients with cingulate gyrus epilepsy and controls differed significantly in functional connectivity between the left angular gyrus and left posterior cingulate cortex in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands. The results of the node degree analysis were similar to those of the functional connectivity analysis. Our findings reveal for the first time that brain activity in the gamma band may play a key role in the default mode network in cingulate gyrus epilepsy. Altered functional connectivity of the left angular gyrus and left posterior cingulate cortex may be a new biomarker for cingulate gyrus epilepsy.

After corpus callosotomy, seven patients did not experience further ESs (favorable outcome group), and the remaining 10 patients had ongoing ESs (unfavorable outcome group). We used pre-operative scalp EEG data from monopolar montages using the average reference. The relative power spectrum (PS), ictal power laterality (IPL) among the hemispheres, and phase lag, calculated by the cross-power spectrum (CPS) among symmetrical electrodes (i.e., F3 and F4), were analyzed in the EEG data of ESs from 143 pre-operative scalp video-EEG records. Analyses were conducted separately in each frequency band from the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma range. We compared the means of those data in each patient between favorable and unfavorable outcome groups. Results: Among all frequency bands, no significant differences were seen in the individual mean relative PSs in the favorable and unfavorable outcome group. Although the mean IPLs in each patient tended to be high in the unfavorable outcome group, no significant differences were found. The mean CPSs in the delta, theta, and gamma frequency bands were significantly higher in the unfavorable than in the favorable outcome group. Using the Youden index, the optimal cutoff points of those mean CPS values for unfavorable outcomes were 64.00 in the delta band (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 80%), 74.20 in the theta band (100, 80%), and 82.05 in the gamma band (100, 80%). Subanalyses indicated that those CPS differences originated from pairs of symmetrical electrodes in the bilateral frontal and temporal areas. Significance: Ictal power and laterality of the ictal power in each frequency band were not associated with the outcomes of CC; however, the phase lags seen in the delta, theta, and gamma frequency bands were larger in the unfavorable than in the favorable outcome group. The phase lags may predict outcomes of CC for ESs on pre-surgical scalp-ictal EEGs.

However, whether the AD brain shows similar changes from a dynamic or cross-frequency view remains poorly explored. This paper provides an effective framework to investigate the properties of multiplex brain networks in AD considering inter-frequency and temporal dynamics. Using resting-state EEG signals, two types of multiplex networks were reconstructed separately considering the network interactions between different frequency bands or time points. We further applied multiplex network features to characterize functional integration and segregation of the cross-frequency or time-varying networks. Finally, machine learning methods were employed to evaluate the performance of multiplex-network-based indexes for detection of AD. Results revealed that the brain networks of AD patients are disrupted with reduced segregation particularly in the left occipital area for both cross-frequency and time-varying networks. However, the alteration of integration differs among brain regions and may show an increasing trend in the frontal area of AD brain. By combining the features of integration and segregation in time-varying networks, the best classification performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.5%. These findings suggest that our multiplex framework can be applied to explore functional integration and segregation of brain networks and characterize the abnormalities of brain function. This may shed new light on the brain network analysis and extend our understanding of brain function in patients with neurological diseases.

However, the implementation of non-invasive MI-based BCIs with more than three commands is still a difficult task. First, the number of MIs for decoding different actions is limited by the constraint of maintaining an adequate spacing among the corresponding sources, since the electroencephalography (EEG) activity from near regions may add up. Second, EEG generates a rather noisy image of brain activity, which results in a poor classification performance. Here, we propose a solution to address the limitation of identifiable motor activities by using combined MIs (i.e., MIs involving 2 or more body parts at the same time). And we propose two new multilabel uses of the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, namely MC2CMI and MC2SMI approaches. We recorded EEG signals from seven healthy subjects during an 8-class EEG experiment including the rest condition and all possible combinations using the left hand, right hand, and feet. The proposed multilabel approaches convert the original 8-class problem into a set of three binary problems to facilitate the use of the CSP algorithm. In the case of the MC2CMI method, each binary problem groups together in one class all the MIs engaging one of the three selected body parts, while the rest of MIs that do not engage the same body part are grouped together in the second class. In this way, for each binary problem, the CSP algorithm produces features to determine if the specific body part is engaged in the task or not. Finally, three sets of features are merged together to predict the user intention by applying an 8-class linear discriminant analysis. The MC2SMI method is quite similar, the only difference is that any of the combined MIs is considered during the training phase, which drastically accelerates the calibration time. For all subjects, both the MC2CMI and the MC2SMI approaches reached a higher accuracy than the classic pair-wise (PW) and one-vs.-all (OVA) methods. Our results show that, when brain activity is properly modulated, multilabel approaches represent a very interesting solution to increase the number of commands, and thus to provide a better interaction.

This phenomenon, also known as diaschisis, has clinical and metabolic correlates but lacks a clear electrophysiological counterpart, except for the long-standing evidence of a relative EEG slowing over the injured hemisphere. Here, we aim at testing whether this EEG slowing is linked to the pathological intrusion of sleep-like cortical dynamics within an awake brain. We used a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) to study cortical reactivity in a cohort of 30 conscious awake patients with chronic focal and multifocal brain injuries of ischaemic, haemorrhagic and traumatic aetiology. We found that different patterns of cortical reactivity typically associated with different brain states (coma, sleep, wakefulness) can coexist within the same brain. Specifically, we detected the occurrence of prominent sleep-like TMS-evoked slow waves and off-periods-reflecting transient suppressions of neuronal activity-in the area surrounding focal cortical injuries. These perilesional sleep-like responses were associated with a local disruption of signal complexity whereas complex responses typical of the awake brain were present when stimulating the contralesional hemisphere. These results shed light on the electrophysiological properties of the tissue surrounding focal brain injuries in humans. Perilesional sleep-like off-periods can disrupt network activity but are potentially reversible, thus representing a principled read-out for the neurophysiological assessment of stroke patients, as well as an interesting target for rehabilitation.

Multielectrode array analysis of EEG biomarkers in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Fragile X syndrome; Autism; Auditory cortex; Sensory hypersensitivity; EEG; Multielectrode array; Gamma power	EPILEPSY; MALES; FMR1; MICE; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES	Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability with symptoms that include increased anxiety and social and sensory processing deficits. Recent EEG studies in humans with FXS have identified neural oscillation deficits that include increased resting state gamma power, increased amplitude of auditory evoked potentials, and reduced inter-trial phase coherence of sound-evoked gamma oscillations. Identification of comparable EEG biomarkers in mouse models of FXS could facilitate the pre-clinical to clinical therapeutic pipeline. However, while human EEG studies have involved 128-channel scalp EEG acquisition, no mouse studies have been performed with more than three EEG channels. In the current study, we employed a recently developed 30-channel mouse multielectrode array (MEA) system to record and analyze resting and stimulus-evoked EEG signals in WT vs. Fmr1 KO mice. Using this system, we now report robust MEA-derived phenotypes including higher resting EEG power, altered event-related potentials (ERPs) and reduced inter-trial phase coherence to auditory chirp stimuli in Fmr1 KO mice that are remarkably similar to those reported in humans with FXS. We propose that the MEA system can be used for: (i) derivation of higher-level EEG parameters; (ii) EEG biomarkers for drug testing; and (ii) mechanistic studies of FXS pathophysiology.

With the help of Electroencephalography (EEG), the human brain electric activity can be noninvasively measured at high temporal resolution. Several typical quasi-stable states are introduced to represent the oscillation of the global scalp electric field. These so-called microstates reflect spatiotemporal dynamics of coherent neural activities and capture the switch of brain states within the millisecond range. In this study, the microstates of high-density EEG were extracted and investigated during propofol-induced transition of consciousness. To analyze microstates on the frequency domain, a novel microstate-wise spectral analysis was proposed by the means of multivariate empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert-Huang transform. During the transition of consciousness, a map with a posterior central maximum denoted as microstate F appeared and became salient. The current results indicated that the coverage, occurrence, and power of microstate F significantly increased in moderate sedation. The results also demonstrated that the transition of brain state from rest to sedation was accompanied by significant increase in mean energy of all frequency bands in microstate F. Combined with studies on the possible cortical sources of microstates, the findings reveal that non-canonical microstate F is highly associated with propofol-induced altered states of consciousness. The results may also support the inference that this distinct topography can be derived from canonical microstate C (anterior-posterior orientation). Finally, this study further develops pertinent methodology and extends possible applications of the EEG microstate during propofol-induced anesthesia.

Here, in the human somatosensory domain, we assessed effects of subthreshold (imperceptible) electrical finger nerve stimulation - either presented as single pulses or as brief (1 s) 7 Hz pulse trains-on mu-alpha rhythm and perceptual performance. In electroencephalography, subthreshold single pulses transiently similar to 150-350 ms poststimulus) increased mu activity (event-related synchronization), while, interestingly, subthreshold trains led to prolonged (>1 s) mu desynchronization. In psychophysics, detection of near-threshold target stimuli was consistently reduced when presented together with subthreshold trains (at three delays), whereas for targets paired with subthreshold single pulses detection remained unaffected (30 and 180 ms) or was even elevated (60 ms). Though both imperceptible, single pulses and pulse trains exerted opposite effects on neural signaling and perception. We suggest that the common neural basis is preferential activation of cortical inhibitory interneurons. While the inhibitory impact of a subthreshold single pulse (reflected by mu synchronization) is not psychophysically detectable-rather perception may be facilitated-repetition of the same subthreshold pulse shifts the excitation-inhibition balance toward an inhibitory cortical state (reflected by perceptual impediment) accompanied by mu desynchronization. These differential findings provide novel insights on the notion of alpha activity mediating functional inhibition.

EEG Functional Connectivity is a Weak Predictor of Causal Brain Interactions	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Connectomics; EEG; Functional connectivity; TMS; Evoked potentials; Propagation	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NETWORKS; TMS; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; FMRI	In recent years there has been an explosion of research evaluating resting-state brain functional connectivity (FC) using different modalities. However, the relationship between such measures of FC and the underlying causal brain interactions has not been well characterized. To further characterize this relationship, we assessed the relationship between electroencephalography (EEG) resting state FC and propagation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked potentials (TEPs) at the sensor and source level in healthy participants. TMS was applied to six different cortical regions in ten healthy individuals (9 male; 1 female), and effects on brain activity were measured using simultaneous EEG. Pre-stimulus FC was assessed using five different FC measures (Pearson's correlation, mutual information, weighted phase lag index, coherence and phase locking value). Propagation of the TEPs was quantified as the root mean square (RMS) of the TEP voltage and current source density (CSD) at the sensor and source level, respectively. The relationship between pre-stimulus FC and the spatial distribution of TEP activity was determined using a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis. On the group level, all FC measures correlated significantly with TEP activity over the early (15-75 ms) and full range (15-400 ms) of the TEP at the sensor and source level. However, the predictive value of all FC measures is quite limited, accounting for less than 10% of the variance of TEP activity, and varies substantially across participants and stimulation sites. Taken together, these results suggest that EEG functional connectivity studies in sensor and source space should be interpreted with caution.	[Vink, Jord J.

Hence, neurologists treating epileptic patients monitor the temporal evolution of the different bands. We propose a covariance-based method to detect and characterize epileptic seizures operating on the band-filtered EEG signal. The algorithm is unsupervised and performs a principal component analysis of intra-cranial EEG recordings, detecting transient fluctuations of the power in each frequency band. Its simplicity makes it suitable for online implementation. Good sampling of the non-ictal periods is required, while no demands are imposed on the amount of data during ictal activity. We tested the method with 32 seizures registered in 5 patients. The area below the resulting receiver-operating characteristic curves was 87% for the detection of seizures and 91% for the detection of recruited electrodes. To identify the behaviorally relevant correlates of the physiological signal, we identified transient changes in the variance of each band that were correlated with the degree of loss of consciousness, the latter assessed by the so-called Consciousness Seizure Scale, summarizing the performance of the subject in a number of behavioral tests requested during seizures. We concluded that those crisis with maximal impairment of consciousness tended to exhibit an increase in variance approximately 40 s after seizure onset, with predominant power in the theta and alpha bands and reduced delta and beta activity.

Current investigation using neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques laid the foundation of our understanding regarding the brain activities in the spatial, temporal, and spectral domains. However, a comprehensive view integrating these three aspects yet to be achieved by not only adopting multi- modalities of the data acquisition system but also employing algorithms to integrate them into a systematic framework. Thus, this study conducted a passive listening task using words and white noises as acoustic stimuli and utilized high-density electroencephalography (EEG) system with effective connectivity analysis to reconstruct the brain network dynamics with high temporal and spectral resolution. Besides, we introduced the high-spatial-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging- (fMRI) constraints into a representational similarity analysis to examine the functional performance of spatially distributed networks over time. Our results revealed that during speech perception, networks for auditory and higher cognition functioned along the ventral stream via theta and gamma oscillations and exhibited hierarchical responsive differences between word and noise conditions. Speech motor programming networks participated along the dorsal stream mainly in the beta band during a later period of speech perception. Alpha band activity served as a mediation for the dual pathway through oscillatory suppression. These functional networks progressed parallelly for the completion of the complex speech perception.

Sensorimotor cortex beta oscillations reflect motor skill learning ability after stroke	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						stroke; beta oscillations; EEG; motor learning; plasticity	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; CROSS-VALIDATION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; GABA LEVELS; MOVEMENT; BRAIN	Recovery of skilled movement after stroke is assumed to depend on motor learning. However, the capacity for motor learning and factors that influence motor learning after stroke have received little attention. In this study, we first compared motor skill acquisition and retention between well-recovered stroke patients and age- and performance-matched healthy controls. We then tested whether beta oscillations (15-30 Hz) from sensorimotor cortices contribute to predicting training-related motor performance. Eighteen well-recovered chronic stroke survivors (mean age 64 +/- 68 years, range: 50-74 years) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were trained on a continuous tracking task and subsequently retested after initial training (45-60 min and 24 h later). Scalp electroencephalography was recorded during the performance of a simple motor task before each training and retest session. Stroke patients demonstrated capacity for motor skill learning, but it was diminished compared to age- and performance-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, although the properties of beta oscillations prior to training were comparable between stroke patients and healthy controls, stroke patients did show less change in beta measures with motor learning. Lastly, although beta oscillations did not help to predict motor performance immediately after training, contralateral (ipsilesional) sensorimotor cortex post-movement beta rebound measured after training helped predict future motor performance, 24 h after training. This finding suggests that neurophysiological measures such as beta oscillations can help predict response to motor training in chronic stroke patients and may offer novel targets for therapeutic interventions.

We propose the use of the bicoherence as a QPC quantification method to understand the nature of brain rhythm interplay. Methods: We firstly provide a simulation study to show under which condition of signal to noise ratio (SNR) the bicoherence is a reliable QPC quantifier and how to interpret the results. Secondly, in the light of the simulation results, we applied the bicoherence analysis to real EEG data acquired on thirteen volunteers during a cue-paced reaching motor task to quantify coupling and decoupling between mu and beta rhythms. An inter-trial averaging procedure was adopted in order to allow the correct calculation of the bicoherence during a motor task. Results: Simulations demonstrated that SNR has a strong impact on the correct quantification of bicoherence and that a reliable detection of QPC is possible when the SNR is favorable (>-5 dB). Results from EEG data demonstrated a QPC between mu and beta rhythms during the resting state and its fading during movement planning and execution, providing valuable information for the interpretation of their dynamics. Conclusion: The bicoherence was proven to be an effective tool for the investigation of coupling between the sensorimotor rhythms during all the phases of a motor task. This was assessed in relation to the physiological changing of the SNR characterizing the frequency components of interest.

Nonetheless, attempts to assess cognitive load in real-time by means of physiological data have been proven difficult, and interpreting these data remains challenging. The aim of this study is to examine whether and how well experienced cognitive load can be measured through psycho-physiological data. The approach of this study is rather unique, for a combination of reasons. First, this study takes a multimodal approach, monitoring EDA (electrodermal activity), EEG (electroencephalography) and EOG (electrooculography). Second, this study is based on a relatively intensive data collection (N = 46) in a controlled lab setting in which varying cognitive load levels are deliberately induced. Finally, not only focussing on statistical significance but also on the size of the association gives insights into how suitable physiological markers are to measure cognitive load. Results from a multilevel analysis suggest that the following physiological markers might be related to cognitive load, for example, in an industrial context: the rate and the duration of skin conductance responses, the alpha power, the alpha peak frequency and the eye blink rate. About 22.8% of the variance in self-reported cognitive load can be explained using these five measures.

J	Li, SJ; Fan, MX; Yu, HG; Gao, L				Li, Sujiao; Fan, Mengxue; Yu, Honggliu; Gao, Lin			Gamma frequency band shift of contralateral corticomuscular synchronous oscillations with force strength for hand movement tasks	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						bimanual; corticomuscular coherence; EEG-EMG; synchronous oscillations	BETA-RANGE COHERENCE; MOTOR; SYSTEM; STATE	Bilateral voluntary contractions involve functional changes in both primary motor cortices. However how the unilateral voluntary contraction of hand muscles influences the contralateral corticomuscular synchronous oscillations mechanisms remains unclear. In the bimanual tasks, nine healthy subjects were instructed to generate force by abducting their left-hand index finger against a force sensor and simultaneously the right-hand precise pinch task with visual feedback. They were divided into four conditions according to the two contraction force levels of the left-hand muscles 5% and 50% maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) and with/without visual feedback for the right hand. Corticomuscular synchronization of the right hand in the beta band was revealed when the subjects performed the bimanual exercise with 5% MVC of left-hand muscles, which is consistent with previous studies. As the contraction strength of the left-hand muscle increased to 50% MVC, the corticomuscular coherence (CMC) frequency of the right hand shifted to gamma band, and the CMC in beta band decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the electroencephalography -> electromyography direction. This phenomenon suggests that the corticomuscular synchronous oscillation will shift from beta band to higher frequencies (principally gamma) as the contraction force of the contralateral hand increases, which may be due to the changes in the subject's attention and more frequent synchronization of neuromuscular motor neurons oscillations. These findings will be helpful to explore the hand motion control and feedback mechanisms, and further provide a basis for the application of neuromuscular coupling in clinical rehabilitation evaluation.

Two types of directional microphone (DM) technologies for spatial noise processing were chosen: one with a wide directionality (wide DM) and another with a narrower directionality (narrow DM) to accentuate the speech source. Participants with a severe hearing loss were fitted with hearing aids and participated in two EEG experiments. In the first one, participants listened to sentences in cafeteria noise and were asked to rate the experienced listening effort. The second EEG experiment was a listening span task during which participants had to repeat sentence material and then recall the final words of the last four sentences. Subjective listening effort was lower with narrow than wide DM and EEG alpha power was reduced for the narrow DM. The results of the listening span task indicated a reduction in experienced memory effort and better memory performance. During the memory retention phase, EEG alpha level for the narrow relative to the wide DM was reduced. This effect was more pronounced during linguistically difficult sentences. This study extends previous findings, as it reveals a benefit for narrow DM in terms of cognitive performance and memory effort also on a neural level, and when speech intelligibility is almost 100%. Together, this indicates that a narrow and focused DM allows for a more efficient neurocognitive processing than a wide DM.

However, an applicable technique for fatigue detection/prediction is hindered due to substantial inter-subject differences in behavioural impairment and brain activity. Here, we developed a fully crossvalidated, data-driven analysis framework incorporating multivariate regression model to explore the feasibility of utilizing functional connectivity (FC) to predict the fatigue-related behavioural impairment at individual level. EEG was recorded from 40 healthy adults as they performed a 30-min high-demanding sustained attention task. FC were constructed in different frequency bands using three widely-adoptedmethods (including coherence, phase log index (PLI), and partial directed coherence (PDC)) and contrasted between the most vigilant and fatigued states. The differences of individual FC (diff (FC)) were considered as features; whereas the TOT slop across the course of task and the differences of reaction time (Delta RT) between the most vigilant and fatigued states were chosen to represent behavioural impairments. Behaviourally, we found substantial inter-subject differences of impairments. Furthermore, we achieved significantly high accuracies for individualized prediction of behavioural impairments using diff (PDC). The identified top diff (PDC) features contributing to the individualized predictions were found mainly in theta and alpha bands. Further interrogation of diff (PDC) features revealed distinct patterns between the TOT slop and Delta RT prediction models, highlighting the complex neural mechanisms of mental fatigue. Overall, the current findings extended conventional brain-behavioural correlation analysis to individualized prediction of fatigue-related behavioural impairments, therebymoving a step forward towards development of applicable techniques for quantitative fatigue monitoring in real-world scenarios.

In this paper, a novel seizure prediction algorithm is proposed employing the tensor decomposition on long-term intracranial EEG recordings. The modified Stockwell transform (MST) is conducted on the segmented EEG signals to transform into two-dimensional instantaneous power spectra. Then, the third-order tensor representation of the multi-channel EEG signals are structured with the models of time, frequency and space. Tucker decomposition, one valid tensor decomposition method, is applied to obtain the principal components of the EEG tensors and the smaller core tensors after decomposition are extracted as features of interictal EEG and preictal EEG. After that, the classification of preictal and interictal data is achieved by feeding the features into Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA) classifier. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm is carried out on the Freiburg EEG database and a sensitivity of 88.49% for the seizure occurrence period of 30 min, meanwhile, a sensitivity of 97.62% for the seizure occurrence period of 50 min are yielded with a false alarm rate of 0.25/h. The results show that this algorithm based on tensor analysis has notable performance for seizure prediction.

Since the discovery of the population vector that directly relates neural spiking activity with arm movement direction, it has become feasible to control robotic arms and neuroprostheses using invasively recorded brain signals. For non-invasive approaches, a direct relation between human brain signals and arm movement direction is yet to be established. Approach. Here, we investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in temporal and spectral domains in a continuous, circular arm movement task. Using machine learning methods that respect the linear mixture of brain activity within EEG signals, we show that directional information is represented in the temporal domain in amplitude modulations of the same frequency as the arm movement, and in the spectral domain in power modulations of the 20-24 Hz frequency band. Main results. In the temporal domain, the directional information was mainly expressed in primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) contralateral to the moving arm, while in the spectral domain SM1 and PPC of both hemispheres predicted arm movement direction. The different cortical representations suggest distinct neural representations in both domains. Significance. This direct relation between neural activity and arm movement direction in both domains demonstrates the potential of machine learning to reveal neuroscientific insights about the dynamics of human arm movements.

To probe the effective connectivity and cortical excitability modulated by covertly shifted attention, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to directly perturb the right retinotopic visual cortex with respect to attended and unattended locations, and the impact of this was tracked from the stimulated area to other areas by concurrent use of electroencephalography (EEG). TMS to the contralateral visual hemisphere led to a stronger evoked potential than stimulation to the ipsilateral hemisphere. Moreover, stronger beta- and gamma-band effective connectivities assessed as time-delayed phase synchronizations between stimulated areas and other areas were observed when TMS was delivered to the contralateral hemisphere. These effects were more enhanced when they preceded more prominent alpha lateralization, which is known to be associated with attentional gating. Our results indicate that attention-regulated cortical feedforward effective connectivity can be probed by TMS-EEG with direct cortical stimulation, thereby bypassing thalamic gating. These results suggest that cortical gating of the feedforward input is achieved by regulating the effective connectivity in the phase dynamics between cortical areas.

Martin, O. Postal, J.J. Eggermont. Oscillations in the auditory system, their possible role. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV XXX XXX-XXX, 2020. - Neural oscillations are thought to have various roles in brain processing such as, attention modulation, neuronal communication, motor coordination, memory consolidation, decision-making, or feature binding. The role of oscillations in the auditory system is less clear, especially due to the large discrepancy between human and animal studies. Here we describe many methodological issues that confound the results of oscillation studies in the auditory field. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between neural entrainment and oscillations that remains unclear. Finally, we aim to identify which kind of oscillations could be specific or salient to the auditory areas and their processing. We suggest that the role of oscillations might dramatically differ between the primary auditory cortex and the more associative auditory areas. Despite the moderate presence of intrinsic low frequency oscillations in the primary auditory cortex, rhythmic components in the input seem crucial for auditory processing. This allows the phase entrainment between the oscillatory phase and rhythmic input, which is an integral part of stimulus selection within the auditory system.

These include fast activity above the gamma band, known as high frequency oscillations (HFOs), and infraslow activity (ISA) below the delta band, sometimes referred to as direct current (DC) or ictal baseline shifts (IBS). HFOs in particular have been extensively studied as potential biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue in light of evidence showing that resection of brain tissue containing HFOs is associated with good surgical outcomes. Not all HFOs are conclusively pathological, however, as they can be recorded in nonepileptic tissue and induced by cognitive, visual, or motor tasks. Consequently, efforts to distinguish between pathological and physiological HFOs have identified several traits specific to pathological HFOs, such as coupling with interictal spikes, association with delta waves, and stereotypical morphologies. On the opposite end of the EEG spectrum, sub-delta oscillations have been shown to colocalize with the seizure onset zones (SOZ) and appear in a narrower spatial distribution than activity in the conventional EEG frequency bands. In this report, we review studies that implicate HFOs and ISA in ictogenesis and discuss current limitations such as inter-observer variability and poor standardization of recording techniques. Furthermore, we propose that HFOs and ISA should be analyzed in addition to activity in the conventional EEG band during intracranial presurgical EEG monitoring to identify the best possible surgical margin.

Examining the optimal timing for closed-loop auditory stimulation of slow-wave sleep in young and older adults	SLEEP			English	Article						closed-loop auditory stimulation; sleep; slow oscillation; age; memory	HIGH-DENSITY EEG; SPINDLES; MEMORY; PHASE; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY; AGE	Study Objectives: Closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) is a method for enhancing slow oscillations (SOs) through the presentation of auditory clicks during sleep. CLAS boosts SOs amplitude and sleep spindle power, but the optimal timing for click delivery remains unclear. Here, we determine the optimal time to present auditory clicks to maximize the enhancement of SO amplitude and spindle likelihood. Methods: We examined the main factors predicting SO amplitude and sleep spindles in a dataset of 21 young and 17 older subjects. The participants received CLAS during slow-wave-sleep in two experimental conditions: sham and auditory stimulation. Post-stimulus SOs and spindles were evaluated according to the click phase on the SOs and compared between and within conditions. Results: We revealed that auditory clicks applied anywhere on the positive portion of the SO increased SO amplitudes and spindle likelihood, although the interval of opportunity was shorter in the older group. For both groups, analyses showed that the optimal timing for click delivery is close to the SO peak phase. Click phase on the SO wave was the main factor determining the impact of auditory stimulation on spindle likelihood for young subjects, whereas for older participants, the temporal lag since the last spindle was a better predictor of spindle likelihood. Conclusions: Our data suggest that CLAS can more effectively boost SOs during specific phase windows, and these differ between young and older participants. It is possible that this is due to the fluctuation of sensory inputs modulated by the thalamocortical networks during the SO.

The purpose of this study is to judge whether this combination method of multispectral image and convolutional neural network (CNN) method can be used to distinguish amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and normal controls (NC) with T2DM effectively. Approach. In this study, the authors first combined EEG signals from aMCI patients with T2DM and NC with T2DM on five different frequency bands, including Theta, Alpha1, Alpha2, Beta1, and Beta2. Then, the authors converted these time series into a series of multispectral images. Finally, the images data were classified with the CNN method. Main results. The classification effects of up to 89%, 91%, and 92% are obtained on the three combinations of frequency bands: Theta, Alpha1, and Alpha2; Alpha1, Alpha2, and Beta1; and Alpha2, Beta1, and Beta2. The spatial properties of EEG signals are highlighted, and its classification performance is found to be better than all the previous methods in the field of aMCI and T2DM diagnosis. The combination of multispectral images and CNN can be used as an effective biomarker for distinguishing the EEG signals in patients with aMCI and T2DM and in patients with NC with T2DM. Significance. The combined approach used in this paper provides a new perspective for the analysis of EEG signals in patients with aMCI and T2DM.

Despite a wealth of research on the neurophysiological features of sleep in this population, progress in this field has been slow. We aimed to review the literature on sleep electroencephalography (EEG) studies in Bipolar Disorder, considering sleep architecture and microstructural oscillatory activity. We included a total of 22 studies: six on sleep during manic episodes, seven during depressive episodes, seven in euthymic patients and two in high-risk individuals. The most consistent findings were increased SOL and REM density across all stages of the disorder. Only two studies reported a reduced spindle count during bipolar depression and euthymia, respectively. Although not specific for Bipolar Disorder, SOL and REM density have been repeatedly found to be increased across all stages of illness in this population. Whereas the former reflects a difficulty initiating sleep, the latter can be considered a neurophysiological signature of patients' overall reduced sleep need, independent of illness stage.

With the advantage of economic efficiency, portability, and fewer physical constraints, fNIRS enables studying of the human brain at versatile environment and various body positions, including at bed side and during exercise, which complements the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, like fMRI, fNIRS imaging can be influenced by the presence of a strong global component. Yet, the nature of the global signal in fNIRS has not been established. In this study, we investigated the relationship between fNIRS global signal and electroencephalogram (EEG) vigilance using simultaneous recordings in resting healthy subjects in high-density and whole-head montage. In Experiment 1, data were acquired at supine, sitting, and standing positions. Results found that the factor of body positions significantly affected the amplitude of the resting-state fNIRS global signal, prominently in the frequency range of 0.05-0.1 Hz but not in the very low frequency range of less than 0.05 Hz. As a control, the task-induced fNIRS or EEG responses to auditory stimuli did not differ across body positions. However, EEG vigilance plays a modulatory role in the fNIRS signals in the frequency range of less than 0.05 Hz: resting-state sessions of low EEG vigilance measures are associated with high amplitudes of fNIRS global signals. Moreover, in Experiment 2, we further examined the epoch-to-epoch fluctuations in concurrent fNIRS and EEG data acquired from a separate group of subjects and found a negative temporal correlation between EEG vigilance measures and fNIRS global signal amplitudes. Our study for the first time revealed that vigilance as a neurophysiological factor modulates the resting-state dynamics of fNIRS, which have important implications for understanding and processing the noises in fNIRS signals.

The total duration of HFOs is extremely short compared to the entire duration of EEG dataset to be analyzed. Therefore, visual marking of HFOs is time-consuming and laborious process. In order to promote the clinical use of HFOs oscillations as reliable biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue and to conduct large-scale investigations on cerebral HFOs activities, several automatic detection techniques have been proposed over the past few years. In the present framework, we propose a novel approach for detecting HFOs based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our method is subsequently compared with six other methods. HFOs detection performance is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, false discovery rate, area under the ROC curve and execution time. Our results demonstrate that SVM approach yields low false detection (FDR = 6.36%) but, in its current implementation, is moderately sensitive to detect HFOs with a sensitivity of 71.06%.

Age-related slowing down in the motor initiation in elderly adults	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; OLDER-ADULTS; BRAIN; THETA; EEG; IMAGERY; CONNECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE	Age-related changes in the human brain functioning crucially affect the motor system, causing increased reaction time, low ability to control and execute movements, difficulties in learning new motor skills. The lifestyle and lowered daily activity of elderly adults, along with the deficit of motor and cognitive brain functions, might lead to the developed ambidexterity, i.e., the loss of dominant limb advances. Despite the broad knowledge about the changes in cortical activity directly related to the motor execution, less is known about age-related differences in the motor initiation phase. We hypothesize that the latter strongly influences the behavioral characteristics, such as reaction time, the accuracy of motor performance, etc. Here, we compare the neuronal processes underlying the motor initiation phase preceding fine motor task execution between elderly and young subjects. Based on the results of the whole-scalp sensor-level electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, we demonstrate that the age-related slowing down in the motor initiation before the dominant hand movements is accompanied by the increased theta activation within sensorimotor area and reconfiguration of the theta-band functional connectivity in elderly adults.

Patients were grouped based on their cognitive functions or their EEG patterns. The mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFVm) of the unilateral middle cerebral artery was measured using TCD and was used to calculate various relevant parameters. The 19 patients participated in a total of 54 effective TCD-vEEG monitoring sessions. We found a significant effect of clinical severity for the following measurements: spike wave index (SWI), peak and average deep sleep stage (N3) CBFVm, peak, average and minimum deep sleep and awake CBFVm, and CBFVm oscillations during deep sleep. Nevertheless, CBFVm oscillations were not related to SWI. Furthermore, CBFVm oscillations revealed a statistically significant difference between the near-ESES and asymmetric-ESES groups. CBFVm oscillations may reflect the neuro-vascular coupling process associated with ESES disfunction. Understanding the relationship between CBFVm oscillations and epileptic activity will be important for assessing the neuropsychological damage associated with ESES and for developing treatment options for this and other diseases.

A key proposal from de Villiers and colleagues proposes the essential role of complementation syntax in FBU development. The current study, using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), addressed one opposing hypothesis purporting that complementation is redundant to FBU by characterizing the electrophysiological correlates of FBU and complementation syntax in school-age children. Time-frequency decomposition showed robust parieto-occipital low beta (12-16 Hz) power reduction in the belief versus complementation conditions. This divergence was also supported by event-related potentials (ERPs), with parieto-occipital late slow waves around 600 to 900 ms distinguishing belief and complementation conditions. The false belief condition generated the lowest behavioral response accuracy, suggesting that it is the most challenging condition. Together, the current findings provide evidence showing that complementation is not redundant to FBU. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Guan, Yao; Keil, Andreas; Farrar, M.

That is why this paper proposed a novel full processing chain of EEG signals analysis for epileptic seizures detection that applied a new alternative approach for EEG rhythms decomposition. EEG signals are decomposed into their different background rhythms using discrete Jacobi polynomial transforms (JPTs) and a 28-dimension feature vector is extracted in frequency and time domains. Due to the high dimension and redundancy of these features, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied for dimensionality reduction and informative and discriminative low dimension feature vectors are computed and feed as inputs of the support vector machines (SVM) classifiers. The validation of this processing chain is done experimentally using an online available database which consists of five hundred EEG signals. Analysis demonstrated that the EEG rhythms decomposition using JPTs can be implemented as a single-step process and provides more abundant information for class discrimination. In addition, twelve experiments closely related to clinical applications are examined and promising results are achieved with maximum accuracies between 96.25-100 %. Overall, it is found that the proposed processing chain will be useful in providing an accurate and objective scheme for automatic EEG rhythms decomposition and epileptic seizures detection that can be integrated into implantable devices intended to predict the onset of seizures and trigger a focal treatment to block the seizures progression.

This study examined electrocortical and behavioral correlates of motivation and emotion in relation to these shy subtypes in 67 children (M-age = 10.41 years,SD = 3.23). Using resting state electroencephalography, findings revealed that positive shy and low shy children had greater relative left frontal alpha asymmetry compared to non-positive shy children, and positive shy children had a higher frontal delta-beta correlation compared to other groups. Non-positive shy children scored highest on parent-reported school avoidance. These findings converge with previous work reporting distinct correlates in positive and non-positive shyness, extending this to two brain measures of motivation and emotion.

Greater childhood cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with better top-down cognitive control: A midfrontal theta oscillation study	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; fitness; oscillatory brain rhythms; time-frequency analysis; top-down control	AEROBIC FITNESS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SELF-ASSESSMENT; FRONTAL THETA; BRAIN; CHILDREN; VARIABILITY; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	The aim of the current study was to examine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and electroencephalogram-based neural oscillations, using midfrontal theta, during an inhibitory control task in children. One-hundred seventy-one school-aged children (mean age = 8.9 +/- 0.6 years; 46% girls) were recruited. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by a test of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2peak) while inhibitory control performance was measured via a modified flanker task with an electroencephalogram. Behavioral findings demonstrated that higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with higher response accuracy regardless of task difficulty as well as lower response variability during trials with lower cognitive demand. Neuroelectric outcomes revealed that higher cardiorespiratory fitness was correlated with smaller modulation of theta (4-7 Hz) oscillatory power regardless of task difficulty. Collectively, the current findings indicate that higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with better performance on a task that modulates inhibitory control, signified by higher, and more stable, task performance. More importantly, higher childhood cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with better top-down control and cortical communication, as reflected by midfrontal theta. Such findings support the critical role of cardiorespiratory fitness in brain health during childhood.

The time-frequency EEG signal is comprised of both phase-locked activity (associated with stimulus-specific processes) and nonphase-locked activity (represents processes thought to persist over longer timeframes and do not contribute to the average ERP). In the present study, we used a cued task-switching paradigm to examine whether phase-locked and nonphase-locked power are differentially modulated by switch and mixing effects in intervals associated with the need for proactive control (CTI) and reactive control (post-target interval). Phase-locked activity was observed in the theta and alpha bands, closely resembled that seen for total power, and was consistent with switch and mixing ERP positivities. Nonphase-locked analyses showed theta and alpha power effects for both switch and mixing effects early in the CTI and as well as more sustained alpha and beta activity around cue onset, and extending from mid-CTI into the post-target interval. Nonphase-locked activity in pretarget alpha and posttarget theta power were both correlated with response time mixing cost. These findings provide novel insight into phase-locked and nonphase-locked activity associated with switch and mixing costs that are not evident with ERP or total time-frequency analyses.

Loss of Circadian Timing Disrupts Theta Episodes during Object Exploration	CLOCKS & SLEEP			English	Article						circadian; suprachiasmatic; memory; hippocampus; EEG; theta oscillation	HIPPOCAMPAL ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; PROJECTIONS; MODULATION; ANTEROGRADE; RHYTHMS	This study examined whether theta oscillations were compromised by the type of circadian disruption that impairs hippocampal-dependent memory processes. In prior studies on Siberian hamsters, we developed a one-time light treatment that eliminated circadian timing in the central pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). These arrhythmic animals had impaired hippocampal-dependent memory whereas animals made arrhythmic with SCN lesions did not. The current study examined whether theta oscillations are compromised by the same light treatment that produced memory impairments in these animals. We found that both methods of inducing circadian-arrhythmia shortened theta episodes in the EEG by nearly 50%. SCN-lesioned animals, however, exhibited a 3-fold increase in the number of theta episodes and more than doubled the total time that theta dominated the EEG compared to SCN-intact circadian-arrhythmic animals. Video tracking showed that changes in theta were paralleled by similar changes in exploration behavior. These results suggest that the circadian-arrhythmic SCN interferes with hippocampal memory encoding by fragmenting theta oscillations. SCN-lesioned animals can, however, compensate for the shortened theta episodes by increasing their frequency. Implications for rhythm coherence and theta sequence models of memory formation are discussed.	[Loewke, Adrienne C.; Garrett, Alex; Steiger, Athreya; Fisher, Nathan; Heller, H.

The deep analysis of the interactions with the smartphone, aligned with the principles of the Internet of People, allow us to distinguish between normal and abnormal use. One of the multiple applications of this type of analysis will contribute to the early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, based on anomalies in the interaction. This work aims to take the first steps towards that ambitious goal: to determine the cognitive load required for different typical tasks with smartphones. By properly identifying which tasks require a higher cognitive load, we will be able to start studying metrics and indicators that contribute to the early diagnosis of cognitive pathologies. The analysis of cognitive load was carried out after an experiment with 26 users who performed 12 typical tasks with a mobile device while their brain activity was monitored through electroencephalography. The results identify that there are clearly tasks with a higher cognitive demand, with audio production and consumption being the most notable, which has been validated experimentally and statistically.

While ample neumimaging evidence for such accounts comes from investigations of spatial connectivity, understanding temporal disruptions is important to fully capture the essence of dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. Recent electmphysiology studies suggest that long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in the amplitude dynamics of neural oscillations captures the integrity of transferred information in the healthy brain. Thus, in this study, 25 schizophrenia patients and 25 controls (8 females/group) were recorded during two five-minutes of resting-state magnetoencephalography (once with eyes-open and once with eyes-closed). We used source-level analyses to investigate temporal dysconnectivity in patients by characterizing LRTCs across cortical and sub-cortical brain regions. In addition to standard statistical assessments, we applied a machine learning framework using support vector machine to evaluate the discriminative power of LRTCs in identifying patients from healthy controls. We found that neural oscillations in schizophrenia patients were characterized by reduced signal memory and higher variability across time, as evidenced by cortical and subcortical attenuations of LRTCs in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Support vector machine significantly classified participants using LRTCs in key limbic and paralimbic brain areas, with decoding accuracy reaching 82%. Importantly, these brain regions belong to networks that are highly relevant to the symptomology of schizophrenia. These findings thus posit temporal dysconnectivity as a hallmark of altered information processing in schizophrenia, and help advance our understanding of this pathology.

Moreover, people suffering from alcoholism are susceptible to various health problems such as cardiomyopathy, immune system disorder, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, brain anomalies, and heart problems. New method: This study presents a novel approach, based on Fourier theory, known as Fourier decomposition method (FDM) for automatic identification of alcoholism using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The FDM approach is employed to decompose EEG signals into a set of desired orthogonal components, commonly referred as Fourier intrinsic band functions (FIBFs), obtained by dividing the complete bandwidth of EEG signal under analysis into equal frequency bands. Time-domain features such as Hjorth parameters, kurtosis, inter-quartile range, and median frequency are extracted from FIBFs. To reduce the complexity, Kruskal-Wallis (KW) statistical test, is performed to adopt the most significant features. Results: Simulation results are obtained using different classification methods, namely, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The proposed approach with the SVM classifier using radial basis function provides average accuracy of 99.98%, sensitivity of 99.99% and specificity of 99.97%. Performance is also tested in the presence of noise. Comparison with existing method(s): Classification results highlight the superior performance of our method in comparison to existing works. Conclusions: The proposed scheme provides an efficient approach and can be employed in real-time alcoholism detection.

We present the first EEG dataset (available here) with recordings of subjects with genuine and fake emotional expressions. We build our experimental paradigm for classification of smiles; genuine smiles, fake/acted smiles and neutral expression. We propose multiple methods to extract intrinsic features from three EEG emotional expressions; genuine, neutral, and fake/acted smile. We extracted EEG features using three time-frequency analysis methods: discrete wavelet transforms (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and incorporating DWT into EMD (DWT-EMD) at three frequency bands. We then evaluated the proposed methods using several classifiers including, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). We carried out an experimental paradigm on 28-subjects underwent three types of emotional expressions, genuine, neutral and fake/acted. The results showed that incorporating DWT into EMD extracted more hidden features than sole DWT or sole EMD method. The power spectral feature extracted by DWT, EMD, and DWT-EMD showed different neural patterns across the three emotional expressions at all the frequency bands. We performed binary classification experiments and achieved acceptable accuracy reaching a maximum of 84% in all type of emotions, classifiers and bands using sole DWT or EMD. Meanwhile, a combination of DWT-EMD achieved the highest classification accuracy with ANN in classifying true emotional expressions from fake expressions in the alpha and beta bands with an average accuracy of 94.3% and 84.1%, respectively. Our results suggest combining DWT-EMD for future emotion studies and highlight the association of alpha and beta frequency bands with emotions.

Currently, EEG-based affective computing (emotion recognition) has become an interesting issue to be studied further. Emotions are not only closely related to aspects of HCI but also affect human health. Meanwhile, EEG is also considered a transparent tool in objectively revealing human emotions because the brain naturally produces EEG signals. This study focuses on comparing and classifying human emotions (happy and sad) based on EEG data. The channels used for recording EEG data are F7, F8, FP1, and FP2. Data preprocessing such as signal filtering, Independent Component Analysis, and Band Decomposition aims to clean the raw signal from artifacts and separate the signals according to specific frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma). Then, statistical feature extraction is performed in the time domain to obtain the Mean values, Mean Absolute Value (MAV), and Standard Deviation values for further data analysis. The results show that emotion of happy has a higher feature value compared to emotion of sad. In the classification of happy and sad emotions using several algorithms, Random Forest signifies the highest classification accuracy (88.90%), compared to other algorithms such as SVM (86.70%), K-NN (88.87%), and Naive Bayes (86.63%).

Meditation can be described as a non-physical exercise of being in a sustained state of mental relaxation and focused attention. When exiting a meditation state, be it voluntarily or otherwise externally disturbed, a transition Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal can be observed. This study proposed an extraction of EEG transition feature of the signal between state of meditation and post meditation using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Wavelet analysis retains both time and frequency information, allowing the transition feature to be easily identified and localised on the time scale. When given a continuous meditation EEG signal as input, results from DWT were applied to detect time localised transition during meditation. Results from our studies has demonstrated that the DWT feature extraction model is capable of detecting when a meditation practitioner exited meditation state at a 96.90% accuracy. This meditation transition report can be used in part as a feedback to the practitioner on their sustained meditation performance.

Thus, we aimed to directly compare the electrophysiological effects of single-session tDCS and gamma-tACS in healthy subjects, matching the intervention protocol as closely as possible. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blinded, and active-controlled study. Sixty healthy college students were enrolled in the study. Both tACS with, at 40 Hz frequency, and tDCS have the same current intensity (2 mA, 30 min) within the same target area (right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after single-session stimulation. Results: Significant differences in theta, alpha, low-beta, and gamma frequencies were found between tDCS, tACS, and the sham groups. Low-beta source activity of the middle temporal gyrus was decreased only after an intervention with tACS. Conclusion: The present study indicates that tDCS and tACS resulted in an increased range of frequency activity, including slow- and fast-wave bands. Specifically, tDCS modulates the frontal region, while tACS modulates neural oscillations at the fronto-central, parietal, and temporal areas. The tACS also decreased low-beta source activity in the middle temporal gyrus. Identifying the common and unique EEG patterns of tDCS and tACS may help shed light on their potential clinical benefits and distinctive neuropathology in various clinical symptoms.

The physical features include short stature, webbing of the neck, and gonadal dysgenesis. Typically, patients with Turner syndrome exhibit no intellectual disability, and a few cases of TS have been associated with epilepsy. Herein, we present a case of TS with intractable epilepsy. The patient presented with global developmental delay at the age of two and karyotyping revealed mosaicism [45, X/46, X del (X) (q21.1)]. At the age of seven, she had generalized tonic epilepsy as well as several focal-onset seizures. She developed daily seizures, which were refractory to several antiepileptic drugs. Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) revealed multifocal spikes, and ictal EEG revealed shifting foci. She visited our hospital at the age of 13. Her peripheral white blood cells G-band and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method chromosome with cheek swab examinations revealed 45, X. Her peripheral white blood cell mosaic pattern may have disappeared over time or become indetectable. We treated her with clobazam, and then lamotrigine and valproic acid combination therapy, which resulted in a reduction in the frequency of seizures by approximately 50%. Epilepsy and intellectual disability in this case may be due to the mosaic deletion at Xq21.1. Further analysis of similar cases may provide valuable information for effective therapeutic strategies.

In this study, we set to identify brain networks that carry out such evaluations. We therefore assessed the time-course of neural responses with intracerebral EEG in human patients during an attentional reading task, contrasting to-be-attended vs. to-be-ignored items. We measured High-Frequency Activity [50-150 Hz] as a proxy of population-level spiking activity and we identified a crucial component of a Gate-Keeping Mechanism bilateral in the mid-Ventro-Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (VLPFC), at the interplay of the Ventral and Dorsal Attention Networks, that selectively reacts before domain specialized cortical regions that engage in full stimulus analysis according to task demands.

However, direct comparisons between conventional two-dimensional (2D) and VR stimulations are lacking. Thus, the present study compared electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of explicit task and implicit emotional attention between 2D and VR stimulation. Participants (n= 16) viewed angry and neutral faces with equal size and distance in both 2D and VR, while they were asked to count one of the two facial expressions. For the main effects of emotion (angry vs. neutral) and task (target vs. nontarget), established event related potentials (ERP), namely the late positive potential (LPP) and the target P300, were replicated. VR stimulation compared to 2D led to overall bigger ERPs but did not interact with emotion or task effects. In the frequency domain, alpha/beta-activity was larger in VR compared to 2D stimulation already in the baseline period. Of note, while alpha/beta event related desynchronization (ERD) for emotion and task conditions were seen in both VR and 2D stimulation, these effects were significantly stronger in VR than in 2D. These results suggest that enhanced immersion with the stimulus materials enabled by VR technology can potentiate induced brain oscillation effects to implicit emotion and explicit task effects.

The current EEG study examined the ERP and oscillatory correlates of neural feedback processing under risky and ambiguous decision making. Participants performed a wheel-of-fortune task and received either gain or nongain feedback following risky or ambiguous gambles while their EEG was recorded. Results revealed that the early, obligatory detection of reward information was not dependent on the nature of the previous gamble, which was reflected by the reward positivity. However, risky gambling seemed to elicit an enhanced cognitive control signal as indexed by theta oscillation, whereas ambiguous gambling increased the affective and motivational salience during feedback processing as represented by the P3 and delta oscillation. Together, our findings suggest that feedback processing during risky and ambiguous decision making taps into common and distinct electrophysiological correlates.

Anomaly EEG detection is a long-standing problem in analysis of EEG signals. The basic premise of this problem is consideration of the similarity between two nonstationary EEG recordings. A well-established scheme is based on sequence matching, typically including three steps: feature extraction, similarity measure, and decision-making. Current approaches mainly focus on EEG feature extraction and decision-making, and few of them involve the similarity measure/quantification. Generally, to design an appropriate similarity metric, that is compatible with the considered problem/data, is also an important issue in the design of such detection systems. It is however impossible to directly apply those existing metrics to anomaly EEG detection without any consideration of domain specificity. Methodology. The main objective of this work is to investigate the impacts of different similarity metrics on anomaly EEG detection. A few metrics that are potentially available for the EEG analysis have been collected from other areas by a careful review of related works. The so-called power spectrum is extracted as features of EEG signals, and a null hypothesis testing is employed to make the final decision. Two indicators have been used to evaluate the detection performance. One is to reflect the level of measured similarity between two compared EEG signals, and the other is to quantify the detection accuracy. Results. Experiments were conducted on two data sets, respectively. The results demonstrate the positive impacts of different similarity metrics on anomaly EEG detection. The Hellinger distance (HD) and Bhattacharyya distance (BD) metrics show excellent performances: an accuracy of 0.9167 for our data set and an accuracy of 0.9667 for the Bern-Barcelona EEG data set. Both of HD and BD metrics are constructed based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient, implying the priority of the Bhattacharyya coefficient when dealing with the highly noisy EEG signals. In future work, we will exploit an integrated metric that combines HD and BD for the similarity measure of EEG signals.

Previous studies reported changes in power spectra during encoding phase related to behavioral performance, however decoding phase still needs to be explored. This study investigates neural oscillations changes related to memory process. Participants were asked to perform a memory task for encoding and decoding phase while EEG signals were recorded. Results showed that for encoding phase, there was a significant decrease of power in low beta, high beta bands over fronto-central area and a decrease in low beta, high beta and gamma bands over left temporal area related to successful subsequent memory effects. For decoding phase, only significant decreases of alpha power were observed over fronto-central area. This finding showed relevance of beta and alpha band for encoding and decoding phase of a memory task respectively.

For many types of biomarkers (particularly biomarkers of diagnosis), reliability over short periods is critically important. In the field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), resting electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral densities (PSD) are well-studied for their potential as biomarkers. Classically, such data have been decomposed into pre-specified frequency bands (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Recent technical advances, such as the Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F (FOOOF) algorithm, allow for targeted characterization of the features that naturally emerge within an EEG PSD, permitting a more detailed characterization of the frequency band-agnostic shape of each individual's EEG PSD. Here, using two resting EEGs collected a median of 6 days apart from 22 children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) controls during the Feasibility Visit of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials, we estimate test-retest reliability based on the characterization of the PSD shape in two ways: (1) Using the FOOOF algorithm we estimate six parameters (offset, slope, number of peaks, and amplitude, center frequency and bandwidth of the largest alpha peak) that characterize the shape of the EEG PSD; and (2) using nonparametric functional data analyses, we decompose the shape of the EEG PSD into a reduced set of basis functions that characterize individual power spectrum shapes. We show that individuals exhibit idiosyncratic PSD signatures that are stable over recording sessions using both characterizations. Our data show that EEG activity from a brief 2-min recording provides an efficient window into characterizing brain activity at the single-subject level with desirable psychometric characteristics that persist across different analytical decomposition methods. This is a necessary step towards analytical validation of biomarkers based on the EEG PSD and provides insights into parameters of the PSD that offer short-term reliability (and thus promise as potential biomarkers of trait or diagnosis) vs. those that are more variable over the short term (and thus may index state or other rapidly dynamic measures of brain function). Future research should address the longer-term stability of the PSD, for purposes such as monitoring development or response to treatment.

Little is known about their cortical generators and functional significance. Stereo-EEG per-formed for presurgical epilepsy evaluation offers the unique possibility to study neurophysiology in situ in the human brain. We investigated intracranial correlates of scalp-detected STW in 26 patients (14 women) undergoing combined stereo-EEG/ polysomnography. We visually marked STW segments in scalp EEG and selected stereo-EEG channels exhibiting normal activity for intracranial analyses. Channels were grouped in 30 brain regions. The spectral power in each channel and frequency band was computed during STW and non-STW control segments. Ripples (80-250 Hz) were automatically detected during STW and control segments. The spectral power in the different frequency bands and the ripple rates were then compared between STW and control segments in each brain region. An increase in 2-4 Hz power during STW segments was found in all brain regions, except the occipital lobe, with large effect sizes in the parietotemporal junction, the lateral and orbital frontal cortex, the anterior insula, and mesiotemporal structures. A widespread increase in high-frequency activity, including ripples, was observed concomitantly, involving the sensorimotor cortex, associative areas, and limbic structures. This distribution showed a high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Our results suggest that STW are associated with widely distributed, but locally regulated REM sleep slow oscillations. By driving fast activities, STW may orchestrate synchronized reactivations of multifocal activities, allowing tagging of complex representations necessary for REM sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

For many years, researchers aimed at identifying cerebral correlates of language abilities. More recently, the development of new data analysis tools has generated a shift toward the investigation of complex cerebral networks. In 2015, Weiss-Croft and Baldeweg published a very interesting systematic review on the development of functional language networks, explored through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Compared to fMRI and because of their excellent temporal resolution, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide different and important information on brain activity. Both therefore constitute crucial neuroimaging techniques for the investigation of the maturation of functional language brain networks. The main objective of this systematic review is to provide a state of knowledge on the investigation of language-related cerebral networks in children, through the use of EEG and MEG, as well as a detailed portrait of relevant MEG and EEG data analysis methods used in that specific research context. To do so, we have summarized the results and systematically compared the methodological approach of 24 peer-reviewed EEG or MEG scientific studies that included healthy children and children with or at high risk of language disabilities, from birth up to 18 years of age. All included studies employed functional and effective connectivity measures, such as coherence, phase locking value, and Phase Slope Index, and did so using different experimental paradigms (e.g., at rest or during language-related tasks). This review will provide more insight into the use of EEG and MEG for the study of language networks in children, contribute to the current state of knowledge on the developmental path of functional connectivity in language networks during childhood and adolescence, and finally allow future studies to choose the most appropriate type of connectivity analysis.

In general, subjects wearing a single-channel EEG electrode located atF(8)(10-20 international standards) were required to perform mental tasks by mentally visualising the rotation of a star and mind relaxation at a specific time and by robot orientation. The visualisation of a rotating star suggests that the mobile robot is currently oriented towards a target, thus enabling target selection. We showed that proposed classifier obtained the best accuracy of 92.09% in classifying the subject's performing mental rotation task or mental relaxation when compared with conventional classification methods such as support vector machine-75.69%,Kth-nearest neighbour-65.50% and linear discriminant analysis-65.20%. Furthermore, different from conventional methods, the use of 1D-CNN enables end-to-end learning, that is the automatic decoding of EEG signals without requiring feature selection or extraction. To validate that the proposed classifier performs better than conventional methods, the extracted kernel weights of proposed 1D-CNN filters were visualised as a temporal plot, and spectral analysis was performed on the extracted weights. The obtained results confirmed that the proposed 1D-CNN was able to generate filters that resemble the EEG wave patterns of different frequencies and spectral analysis confirmed that the filters exploited information from multiple frequency bands (such as alpha band and beta band) that are often associated with a heightened mental state when performing mental tasks.

In this study, it is purposed to determine and map the change in the energy of brain oscillations using a new quantitative approach, based on wavelet transform. An approach, seperating the EEG records to four main sub-band and then quantizing the energy values of them, is suggested. Moreover, energy maps of scalp surface are formed by using these energy values. To test the suggested method, EEG records of epileptic patients which had been obtained from CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database were utilized. The signals which would be analyzed were prepared such that the seizure was in the middle and the signal consists of pre-seizure and post-seizure as long as the seizure time. Then, by using the data obtained, energy differences during pre-seizure, seizure and post-seizure were compared for each sub-band energy percentage. It is thought that the suggested method can be applied to EEGs recorded for epilepsy and other pathologies to be informed about brain dynamics. In addition, in case of getting records simultaneously from several montages, the method can be used for localization of sources causing brain pathologies with other brain imaging techniques.

Functional connectivity (FC) dynamics have been studied in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, while it is largely unknown in electrophysiological data, e.g. EEG. Approach. The present study proposed a novel analytic framework to study spatiotemporal dynamics of FC (dFC) in resting-state human EEG data, including independent component analysis, cortical source imaging, sliding-window correlation analysis, and k-means clustering. Main results. Our results confirm that major fMRI intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) can be successfully reconstructed from EEG using our analytic framework. Prominent spatial and temporal variability were revealed in these ICNs. The mean dFC spatial patterns of individual ICNs resemble their corresponding static FC (sFC) patterns but show fewer cross-talks among distinct ICNs. Our investigation unveils evidences of time-domain variations in individual ICNs comparable to their mean FC level in terms of magnitude. The major contributors to these variations are from the frequency below 0.0156 Hz, in the similar range of FC dynamics from fMRI data. Among different ICNs, larger temporal variabilities are observed in the frontal attention and auditory/visual ICNs, while sensorimotor, salience, and default model networks showed less. Our analytic framework for the first time revealed quasi-stable states within individual EEG ICNs, with various strengths or spatial patterns that were reliably detected at both group and individual levels. These states all together reveal a more complete picture of EEG ICNs: (1) quasi-stable state spatial patterns as a whole for each EEG ICN are more consistent with the corresponding fMRI ICN in terms of the bilateral distribution and multi-nodes structure; (2) EEG ICNs reveal more transient patterns about within-ICN between-node communications than fMRI ICNs. Significance. The present findings highlight the fact that rich temporal and spatial dynamics exist in ICN that can be detected from EEG data. Future studies might extend investigations towards spectral dynamics of EEG ICNs.

Recognizing emotions from EEG signals is also becoming an important computer-aided method for diagnosing emotional disorders in neurology and psychiatry. Another advantage of this approach is recognizing emotions without clinical and medical examination, which plays a major role in completing the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) structure. Emotions recognition ability, without traditional utilization strategies such as self-assessment tests, is of paramount importance. EEG signals are considered the most reliable technique for emotions recognition because of the non-invasive nature. Manual analysis of EEG signals is impossible for emotions recognition, so an automatic method of EEG signals should be provided for emotions recognition. One problem with automatic emotions recognition is the extraction and selection of discriminative features that generally lead to high computational complexity. This paper was design to prepare a new approach to automatic two-stage classification (negative and positive) and three-stage classification (negative, positive, and neutral) of emotions from EEG signals. In the proposed method, directly apply the raw EEG signal to the convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM), without involving feature extraction/selection. In prior literature, this is a challenging method. The suggested deep neural network architecture includes 10-convolutional layers with 3-LSTM layers followed by 2-fully connected layers. The LSTM network in a fusion of the CNN network has been used to increase stability and reduce oscillation. In the present research, we also recorded the EEG signals of 14 subjects with music stimulation for the process. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm for two-stage classification (negative and positive) and three-stage classification (negative, neutral and positive) of emotion for 12 active channels showed 97.42% and 96.78% accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 0.94 and 0.93 respectively. We also compared our proposed LSTM-CNN network (end-to-end) with other hand-crafted methods based on MLP and DBM classifiers and achieved promising results in comparison with similar approaches. According to the high accuracy of the proposed method, it can be used to develop the human-computer interface system.

Methods: In this paper, we use the transcranial ultrasound of different parameters to stimulate the mouse motor cortex, cause tail muscle contraction and movement, and simultaneously record local field potentials (LFPs) in the mouse motor cortex. The relative power and entropy of the LFPs under different ultrasonic parameters are analyzed. Results: The relative power of the theta [4-8 Hz] frequency bands decreases with an increase in spatial-peak and pulse-average intensity (I-sppa) at 0-0.5 s and 0.5-1 s; the relative power of the gamma [30-45 Hz] frequency bands increases with an increase in I-sppa at 0-0.5 s and 0.5-1 s; the relative power each of the gamma [30-45 Hz] and high gamma [55-100 Hz] frequency bands increases with an increase in the SD at 0-0.5 s and 0.5-1 s; the entropy values decrease with increases in I-sppa and SD at 0-0.5 s. Conclusion: The relative power and entropy of neural oscillations in the motor cortex can be modulated by TUS with different parameters, namely, ultrasound intensity and stimulation duration.

Recently, different patterns of EEG background activity were described from which high-frequency oscillations occur: high-frequency oscillations with continuously oscillating background were found to be primarily physiological, those from quiet background were linked to epileptic tissue. It is unclear, whether these interactions remain stable over several days and during different sleep-wake stages. High-frequency oscillation patterns (oscillatory vs. quiet background) were analysed in 23 patients implanted with depth and subdural grid electrodes. Pattern scoring was performed on every channel in 10s intervals in three separate day- and night-time EEG segments. An entropy value, measuring variability of patterns per channel, was calculated. A low entropy value indicated a stable occurrence of the same pattern in one channel, whereas a high value indicated pattern instability. Differences in pattern distribution and entropy were analysed for 143280 10s intervals with allocated patterns from inside and outside the seizure onset zone, different electrode types and brain regions. We found a strong association between high-frequency oscillations out of quiet background activity, and channels of the seizure onset zone (35.2% inside versus 9.7% outside the seizure onset zone, P<0.001), no association was found for high-frequency oscillations from continuous oscillatory background (P=0.563). The type of background activity remained stable over the same brain region over several days and was independent of sleep stage and recording technique. Stability of background activity was significantly higher in channels of the seizure onset zone (entropy mean value 0.56 +/- 0.39 versus 0.64 +/- 0.41; P<0.001). This was especially true for the presumed epileptic high-frequency oscillations out of quiet background (0.57 +/- 0.39 inside versus 0.72 +/- 0.37 outside the seizure onset zone; P<0.001). In contrast, presumed physiological high-frequency oscillations from continuous oscillatory backgrounds were significantly more stable outside the seizure onset zone (0.72 +/- 0.45 versus 0.48 +/- 0.53; P<0.001). The overall low entropy values suggest that interactions between high-frequency oscillations and background activity are a stable phenomenon specific to the function of brain regions. High-frequency oscillations occurring from a quiet background are strongly linked to the seizure onset zone whereas high-frequency oscillations from an oscillatory background are not. Pattern stability suggests distinct underlying mechanisms. Analysing short time segments of high-frequency oscillations and background activity could help distinguishing epileptic from physiologically active brain regions.

However, there is no clear evidence indicating either stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) or subdural electrodes (SDE) as the optimal method. Our goal was to examine differences in postresection seizure freedom rates between SEEG- and SDE-informed resective epilepsy surgeries. Additionally, we aimed to determine potential clinical indicators for SEEG or SDE monitoring in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed in which we searched for primary articles using keywords such as "electroencephalography", "intracranial grid", and "epilepsy." Only studies containing individual patient data (IPD) were included for analysis. A one-stage IPD meta-analysis was performed to determine differences in rates of seizure freedom (International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines and Engel classification) and resection status between SEEG and SDE patients. A Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to determine the effect of time on seizure freedom status. Additionally, a principal component analysis was performed to investigate primary drivers of variance between these two groups. Results: This IPD meta-analysis compared differences between SEEG and SDE invasive monitoring techniques in 595 patients from 33 studies. Our results demonstrate that while there was no difference in seizure freedom rates regardless of resection (p 0.0565), SEEG was associated with a lower rate of resection compared with SDE (82.00% SEEG, 92.74% SDE, p = 0.0002). Additionally, while SDE was associated with a higher rate of postresection seizure freedom (54.04% SEEG, 64.32% SDE, p = 0.0247), the difference between seizure freedom rates following SEEG- or SDE-informed resection decreased with long-term follow-up. A principal component analysis showed that cases resulting in SEEG were associated with lower risk of morbidity than SDE cases, which were strongly collinear with multiple subpial transections, anterior temporal lobectomy, amygdalectomy, and hippocampectomy. Significance: In this IPD meta-analysis of SEEG and SDE invasive monitoring techniques, SEEG and SDE were associated with similar rates of seizure freedom at latest follow-up. The former was associated with lower rates of resection. Furthermore, the clinical phenotypes of patients undergoing SEEG monitoring was associated with lower rates of complications. Future long-term prospective registries of IPD are promising options for clarifying the differences in these intracranial monitoring techniques as well as the unique patient phenotypes that may be associated with their indication.

In this study, by considering the specific information exchange between EEG channels from the perspective of whole brain activities, the convolution neural network (CNN) and the directed transfer function (DTF) were merged to present a novel method for patient-specific seizure prediction. Firstly, the intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) signals were segmented and the information flow features of iEEG signals were calculated by using the DTF algorithm. Then, these features were reconstructed as the channel-frequency maps according to channel pairs and the frequency of information flow. Finally, these maps were fed into the CNN model and the outputs were post-processed by the moving average approach to predict the epileptic seizures. By the evaluation of cross-validation method, the proposed algorithm achieved the averaged sensitivity of 90.8%, the averaged false prediction rate of 0.08 per hour. Compared to the random predictor and other existing algorithms tested on the Freiburg EEG dataset, our proposed method achieved better performance for seizure prediction in all patients. These results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm could provide an robust seizure prediction solution by using deep learning to capture the brain network changes of iEEG signals from epileptic patients.

However, it is still unclear how the temporal dynamics of brain states change during these periods, which are shaped by prior conscious experiences. Here, we examined the very brief periods of wakeful rest immediately after encoding and recognition of auditory and visual stimuli, by applying the EEG microstate analysis, in which the global variance of the EEG is explained by only a few prototypical topographies. We identified the dominant brain states of sub-second duration during the tasks-dependent periods of rest, finding that the temporal dynamics-represented here by two temporal parameters: the frequency of occurrence and the fraction of time coverage-of three task-related microstate classes changed compared to wakeful rest. This study provides evidence of experience-dependent temporal changes in post-encoding periods of resting brain activity, which can be captured using the EEG microstates approach.

In order to solve these problems, we propose a novel EEG feature prepresentation method for seizure detection based on the Log Mel-Filterbank energy feature. We propose to adapt the Mel-Filterbank energy to EEG features with logrithm transform in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, we also propose the sequential forward channel selection(SFCS) algorithm to incorporate channel correlation and balance the computing consumption. Experiments show that our proposed method have significant contributions in channel selection and feature representation to the problem of EEG signal analysis.

An open question for researchers is how sensitive the results of EEG analyses are to variations in preprocessing methods and parameters. To address this issue, we analyze the effect of preprocessing methods on downstream EEG analysis using several simple signal and event-related measures. Signal measures include recording-level channel amplitudes, study-level channel amplitude dispersion, and recording spectral characteristics. Event-related methods include ERPs and ERSPs and their correlations across methods for a diverse set of stimulus events. Our analysis also assesses differences in residual signals both in the time and spectral domains after blink artifacts have been removed. Using fully automated pipelines, we evaluate these measures across 17 EEG studies for two ICA-based preprocessing approaches (LARG, MARA) plus two variations of Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR). Although the general structure of the results is similar across these preprocessing methods, there are significant differences, particularly in the low-frequency spectral features and in the residuals left by blinks. These results argue for detailed reporting of processing details as suggested by most guidelines, but also for using a federation of automated processing pipelines and comparison tools to quantify effects of processing choices as part of the research reporting.

J	Zhang, YJ; Zhu, CZ				Zhang, Yujin; Zhu, Chaozhe			Assessing Brain Networks by Resting-State Dynamic Functional Connectivity: An fNIRS-EEG Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						functional connectivity; resting state; dynamic; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; electroencephalogram	SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; EYES OPEN; VARIABILITY; CONSCIOUSNESS; FMRI	The coordination of brain activity between disparate neural populations is highly dynamic. Investigations into intrinsic brain organization by evaluating dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (dRSFC) have attracted great attention in recent years. However, there are few dRSFC studies based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) even though it has some advantages for studying the temporal evolution of brain function. In this research, we recruited 20 young adults and measured their resting-state brain fluctuations in several areas of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes using fNIRS-electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneous recording. Based on a sliding-window approach, we found that the variability of the dRSFC within any region of interest was significantly lower than the connections between region of interests but noticeably greater than the correlation between the channels with a short interoptode distance, which mainly consist of physiological fluctuations occurring in the superficial layers. Furthermore, based on a time-resolved k-means clustering analysis, the temporal evolution was extracted for three dominant functional networks. These networks were roughly consistent between different subject subgroups and in varying sliding time window lengths of 20, 30, and 60 s. Between these three functional networks, there were obvious time-varied and system-specific synchronous relationships. In addition, the oscillation of the frontal-parietal-temporal network showed significant correlation with the switching of one EEG microstate, a finding which is consistent with a previous functional MRI-EEG study. All this evidence implies the functional significance of fNIRS-dRSFC and demonstrates the feasibility of fNIRS for extracting the dominant functional networks based on RSFC dynamics.

Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen during transition from wakefulness to sleep measured with high temporal resolution OxFlow MRI with concurrent EEG	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Cerebral metabolism; concurrent EEG; sleep; venous saturation; wakefulness	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; BLOOD-FLOW; CONSUMPTION; CONSEQUENCES; NEUROBIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; DEPRIVATION; ARTIFACT; OXIMETRY; ADULTS	During slow-wave sleep, synaptic transmissions are reduced with a concomitant reduction in brain energy consumption. We used 3 Tesla MRI to noninvasively quantify changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of O-2(CMRO2) during wakefulness and sleep, leveraging the 'OxFlow' method, which provides venous O(2)saturation (SvO(2)) along with cerebral blood flow (CBF). Twelve healthy subjects (31.3 +/- 5.6 years, eight males) underwent 45-60 min of continuous scanning during wakefulness and sleep, yielding one image set every 3.4 s. Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) data were available in eight subjects. Mean values of the metabolic parameters measured during wakefulness were stable, with coefficients of variation below 7% (average values: CMRO2 = 118 +/- 12 mu mol O-2/min/100 g, SvO(2) = 67.0 +/- 3.7% HbO(2), CBF = 50.6 +/- 4.3 ml/min/100 g). During sleep, on average, CMRO(2)decreased 21% (range: 14%-32%; average nadir = 98 +/- 16 mu mol O-2/min/100 g), while EEG slow-wave activity, expressed in terms of delta-power, increased commensurately. Following sleep onset, CMRO(2)was found to correlate negatively with relative delta-power (r = -0.6 to -0.8,P < 0.005), and positively with heart rate (r = 0.5 to 0.8,P < 0.0005). The data demonstrate that OxFlow MRI can noninvasively measure dynamic changes in cerebral metabolism associated with sleep, which should open new opportunities to study sleep physiology in health and disease.

The instantaneous spectrum analysis is derived from the ensemble empirical mode decomposition which decomposes signals into a gathering of intrinsic mode functions without mode mixing. The multi-marginal Hilbert-Huang spectrum is introduced to estimate frequency contents. As a result, the amplitude of brain rhythms related to the cognitive load can be determined accurately. A model study was performed at first to test the efficacy of the proposed algorithm by comparing with the Fourier based technique, then a prefrontal experiment was conducted to show the advantages of the proposed method. With the higher resolution and more realistic of the proposed method relative to conventional spectrum analysis, more significant features of the signal can be extracted. We believe that the proposed method has the potential to be a substantial technique in electroencephalograph data analysis.

Test-retest reliability of brain oscillations in a prepulse inhibition and facilitation paradigm: effects of gender in healthy humans	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalographic oscillations; gender; intraclass correlation; prepulse inhibition; prepulse facilitation; test-retest reliability	AUDITORY STARTLE REFLEX; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PPI	There is a growing interest in assessing the reliability of electroencephalographic (EEG) measures in clinical and research settings. Prepulse inhibition (PPI: representing attentional modulation) and facilitation (PPF: reflecting selective attention) paradigms have been used to study inhibitory function and selective attention, respectively. However, to date, little has been known with regards to the stability of brain oscillatory activity during PPI and PPF. We investigated the stability of event-related EEG oscillations during PPI and PPF in healthy humans over two monthly sessions. Power spectral densities were analysed at traditional frequency bands (delta, alpha, beta sub-bands, and gamma). We assessed test-retest reliability by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs, absolute agreement definition) and examined potential effects of gender. The results showed good-to-excellent reproducibility of EEG power (both in PPI and PPF) over all frequency bands (ICCs > 0.75), except for delta (ICCs < 0.75), with alpha exhibiting the highest repeatability performance. In addition, females showed reduced reliability compared to males in both PPI and PPF, possibly attributed to menstrual cycle phase across our female participants. Overall, our findings suggest that brain oscillatory activity can be test-retest reliable, while gender needs to be controlled with caution. Finally, event-related EEG oscillations during both PPI and PPF could provide a complementary tool to study psychopathology in clinical practice.

The combination of motor imaging and brain-computer interface technology can take advantage of patients' willingness to take the initiative to assist them in rehabilitation. Studies have shown that MI combined with BCI rehabilitation training is better than traditional rehabilitation training. Transient visual evoked potentials and motor imaging constructed a hybrid BCI system. Three healthy subjects were tested. EEG signals were superimposed preprocessing according to visual stimulus superimposed frequency and motor guidance frequency respectively. Transient visual evoked EEG segmentation is used as a control signal of choice, the use of wavelet decomposition helps to extract features, and then use BP neural network recognition for classification and identification. Visual guidance, motion-oriented event-related synchronization, or desynchronization feature signals as rehabilitation exercise control signals, are using time-domain sliding energy analysis to extract features, and then using BP neural network recognition for classification and identification. EEG signals collected in the experiment were superimposed signals of transient visual evoked and motorized EEG. There were 300 transient electroencephalogram (EEG) and 100 segments Imagine EEG segmentation. According to the results of the test, the average recognition rate of visual evoked EEG reached 95.42%; the average recognition rate of motor imaginary EEG was 73.08%, but there was a large individual difference in motor imaging EEG signals except 1 Name of the test rate of 85%, the remaining two subjects were less than 70% recognition rate. There is a large individual difference between motion imaging and signal feature recognition, and it takes a long time to train. Therefore, it is necessary to study further the selection of control signals for rehabilitation training. As the threshold feedback signal, controlling the amplitude feedback of rehabilitation training can promote the motivation of participants' motivation to stimulate and enhance the rehabilitation treatment effect.

To date, the mechanisms underlying attacks, characterised by a painless perception of abrupt, loud noises at transitional sleep-wake or wake-sleep states, are by and large unclear. Methods and results In order to address the current gap in the knowledge of potential underlying pathophysiology, a retrospective case-control study of polysomnographic recordings of patients presenting to a tertiary sleep disorders clinic with exploding head syndrome was conducted. Interictal (non-attack associated) electroencephalographic biomarkers were investigated by performing macrostructural and event-related dynamic spectral analyses of the whole-night EEG. In patients with exploding head syndrome, additional oscillatory activity was recorded during wakefulness and at sleep/wake periods. This activity differed in its frequency, topography and source from the alpha rhythm that it accompanied. Conclusion Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesise that at times of sleep-wake transition in patients with exploding head syndrome, aberrant attentional processing may lead to amplification and modulation of external sensory stimuli.

Here, we compare quantified time-evolving frequency of stereotyped rocking with signal analysis of intracerebral electroencephalographic data. Methods. - In a single patient, prefrontal seizures with rhythmic anteroposterior body rocking recorded on stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) were analyzed using fast Fourier transform, time-frequency decomposition and phase amplitude coupling, with regards to quantified video data. Comparison was made with seizures without rocking in the same patient, as well as resting state data. Results. - Rocking movements in the delta (similar to 1 Hz) range began a few seconds after SEEG onset of low voltage fast discharge. During rocking movements: (1) presence of a peak of delta band activity was visible in bipolar montage, with maximal power in epileptogenic zone and corresponding to mean rocking frequency; (2) correlation, using phase amplitude coupling, was shown between the phase of this delta activity and high-gamma power in the epileptogenic zone and the anterior cingulate region. Conclusions. - Here, delta range rhythmic body rocking was associated with cortical delta oscillatory activity and phase-coupled high-gamma energy. These results suggest a neural signature during expression of motor semiology incorporating both temporal features associated with rhythmic movements and spatial features of seizure discharge.

Daniel			Task-specific Disruptions in Theta Oscillations during Working Memory for Temporal Order in People with Schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS; GENERIC METHOD; TERM-MEMORY; ALPHA; DEFICITS; GAMMA	Prior studies demonstrated that neural oscillations are enhanced during working memory (WM) maintenance and that this activity can predict behavioral performance in healthy individuals. However, it is unclear whether the relationship holds for people with WM deficits. People with schizophrenia have marked WM deficits, and such deficits are most prominent when patients are required to process relationships between items, such as temporal order. Here, we used EEG to compare the relationship between oscillatory activity and WM performance in patients and controls. EEG was recorded as participants performed tasks requiring maintenance of complex objects ("Item") or the temporal order of objects ("Order"). In addition to testing for group differences, we examined individual differences in EEG power and WM performance across groups. Behavioral results demonstrated that patients showed impaired performance on both Item and Order trials. EEG analyses revealed that patients showed an overall reduction in alpha power, but the relationship between alpha activity and performance was preserved. In contrast, patients showed a reduction in theta power specific to Order trials, and theta power could predict performance on Order trials in controls, but not in patients. These findings demonstrate that WM impairments in patients may reflect two different processes: a general deficit in alpha oscillations and a specific deficit in theta oscillations when temporal order information must be maintained. At a broader level, the results highlight the value of characterizing brain-behavior relationships, by demonstrating that the relationship between neural oscillations and WM performance can be fundamentally disrupted in those with WM deficits.

This electroencephalography (EEG) study investigated the specific electrophysiological correlates dissociating action-related from stimulus-related representations in WM using three different experimental conditions based on the same stimulus material. In the experiment, a random sequence of single numbers (from 1 to 6) was presented and participants had to indicate whether the current number (N0 condition), the preceding number (N-1 condition), or the sum of the current and the preceding number (S-1 condition) was odd or even. Accordingly, participants had to store a stimulus representation in S-1 and an action representation in N-1 until the onset of the next stimulus. In the EEG, the storage of stimulus representations (S-1) was reflected by a fronto-central slow wave indicating the rehearsal of information that was required for the response in the following trial. In contrast, the storage of action representations (N-1) went along with a posterior positive slow wave, suggesting that the action plan was actively stored in WM until the presentation of the next stimulus. Crucially, preparing for the next response in N-1 was associated with increased contralateral mu/beta suppression, predicting the response time in the given trial. Our findings, thus, show that the WM processes for stimulus- and action representations can be clearly dissociated from each other with a distinct sequence of EEG correlates for encoding, storage, and response preparation.

The technique is suitable for time series analysis with noise and disturbances. EES were collected, and alpha waves of the occipital region were analysed by comparing the signals from participants in two states, eyes open and eyes closed. Firstly, EES were characterized and analysed by means of techniques already known to compare with the results of the innovative technique that we present here. We verified that, standard recurrence quantification analysis by means of EES time series cannot statistically distinguish the two states. However, the new frequency spectrum recurrence quantification exhibit quantitatively whether the participants have their eyes open or closed. In sequence, new quantifiers are created for analysing the recurrence concentration on frequency bands. These analyses show that EES with similar frequency spectrum have different recurrence levels revealing different behaviours of the nervous system. The technique can be used to deepen the study on depression, stress, concentration level and other neurological issues and also can be used in any complex system.

One of the major concerns in MI-EEG based BCI is to have an accurate classification, and effective and fast feature extraction is the key to build a successful MI-EEG classification model. In this paper, a novel classification system for MI-EEG signals is proposed based on flexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT). The filtered MI-EEG signals are firstly subjected to the FAWT to obtain sub-bands, and time-frequency features are calculated from the sub-bands. MDS is then adopted to reduce the dimension of the extracted features, and principal component analysis (PCA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), locally linear embedding (LLE) and Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) are utilized as comparison. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is utilized to complete the classification of left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) MI-EEG signals. The proposed method is experimentally validated on BCI Competition II Data Set III (BCI Dataset III) and BCI Competition III Data Set Mb (BCI Dataset Mb). As a result, the combined method of FAWT, MDS attains the maximal mutual information (MaI) of 0.95 and the maximum accuracy (ACC) of 94.29% using BCI Dataset III, and the mean of the maximal MaI steepness of 0.3740 using BCI Dataset IIIb. The proposed method yields better performance in comparison to the existing methods. Overall, the effectiveness of the proposed approach suggests that it can be a worthwhile and promising method for a MI-EEG based BCI system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sleep stage classification (or sleep staging), which studies the human sleep process and classifies the sleep stages, is an important reference to the diagnosis and study of sleep disorders. Many scholars have conducted a series of sleep staging studies, but the correlation between different sleep stages and the accuracy of classification still needs to be improved. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic sleep stage classification based on EEG. By constructing an improved empirical mode decomposition and K-means experimental model, the concept of "frequency-domain correlation coefficient" is defined. In the process of feature extraction, the feature vector with the best correlation in the time-frequency domain is selected. Extraction and classification of EEG features are realized based on the K-means clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the classification accuracy is significantly improved, and our proposed algorithm has a positive impact on sleep staging compared with other algorithms.

This includes cognitive processes that are essential for the performance of a motor act, such as the slowing down in response to an external stimulus. The objective of this study was to identify aging-associated functional changes in the brain networks that are involved in the transformation of external stimuli into motor action. To investigate this topic, we employed dynamic graphs based on phase-locking of Electroencephalography signals recorded from healthy younger and older subjects while performing a simple visually-cued finger-tapping task. The network analysis yielded specific age-related network structures varying in time in the low frequencies (2-7 Hz), which are closely connected to stimulus processing, movement initiation and execution in both age groups. The networks in older subjects, however, contained several additional, particularly interhemispheric, connections and showed an overall increased coupling density. Cluster analyses revealed reduced variability of the subnetworks in older subjects, particularly during movement preparation. In younger subjects, occipital, parietal, sensorimotor and central regions were-temporally arranged in this order-heavily involved in hub nodes. Whereas in older subjects, a hub in frontal regions preceded the noticeably delayed occurrence of sensorimotor hubs, indicating different neural information processing in older subjects. All observed changes in brain network organization, which are based on neural synchronization in the low frequencies, provide a possible neural mechanism underlying previous fMRI data, which report an overactivation, especially in the prefrontal and pre-motor areas, associated with a loss of hemispheric lateralization in older subjects.

Currently, self-reported pain is the main criterion used by clinicians assessing patients with pain. However, it is subjective, and multiple factors can affect pain levels. In this study, we investigated the neural correlates of FM pain using conditioned pain modulation (CPM), electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Methods. - In this cross-sectional neurophysiological analysis of a randomized, double-blind controlled trial, 36 patients with flbromyatgia were included. We analyzed CPM, EEG variables and TMS measures and their correlation with pain levels as measured by a visual analog scale. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify the predictors of pain severity. Results. -We found: (1) no association between pain levels and CPM; (2) an association between reduced alpha and beta power over the central region in resting-EEG and higher pain levels; (3) an association between smaller event-related desynchronization (ERD) responses in theta and delta bands over the central region and higher pain levels; (4) an association between smaller ERD responses in theta and delta bands and smaller intracortical inhibition and higher intracortical facilitation ratios; (5) an association between smaller ERD responses in delta band and reduced CPM. Conclusions. - Our results do not support CPM as a biomarker for pain intensity in FM. However, our specific EEG findings showing the relationship between pain, CPM and TMS measures suggest that FM leads to a disruption of inhibitory neural modulators and thus support CPM as a likely predictive marker of disrupted pain modulation system. These neurophysiological markers need to be further explored in potential future trials as to find novel targets for the treatment of FM. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The algorithm produces a single number, the DFA exponent, that reflects the strength of long-range temporal correlations in the data. No methods have been developed to generate confidence intervals for the DFA exponent for a single time series segment. Thus, we present a statistical measure of uncertainty for the DFA exponent in electroencephalographic (EEG) data via application of a moving-block bootstrap (MBB). We tested the effect of three data characteristics on the DFA exponent: (1) time series length, (2) the presence of artifacts, and (3) the presence of discontinuities. We found that signal lengths of similar to 5 minutes produced stable measurements of the DFA exponent and that the presence of artifacts positively biased DFA exponent distributions. In comparison, the impact of discontinuities was small, even those associated with artifact removal. We show that it is possible to combine a moving block bootstrap with DFA to obtain an accurate estimate of the DFA exponent as well as its associated confidence intervals in both simulated data and human EEG data. We applied the proposed method to human EEG data to (1) calculate a time-varying estimate of long-range temporal dependence during a sleep-wake cycle of a healthy infant and (2) compare pre- and post-treatment EEG data within individual subjects with pediatric epilepsy. Our proposed method enables dynamic tracking of the DFA exponent across the entire recording period and permits within-subject comparisons, expanding the utility of the DFA algorithm by providing a measure of certainty and formal tests of statistical significance for the estimation of long-range temporal dependence in neural data.

Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) fast (40-200 Hz) oscillations (FOs) were recently suggested to indicate epilepsy severity. Epileptic FOs may undergo age-dependent longitudinal change in individual patients, however, and the typical pattern of such change is not yet fully clarified. We therefore investigated the age-related correspondence between clinical courses and FOs in pediatric patients with TSC-associated epilepsy. Subjects and methods: FOs were semi-automatically detected from scalp sleep EEG data recorded from 23 children (15 boys, 8 girls; initial data obtained at <10 years of age) with TSC-associated epilepsy. Results: The number of FOs per patient that were associated with spikes was significantly greater than that of FOs unassociated with spikes (median 145 and 5, respectively; p = 0.0001 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In the eight patients who had West syndrome (WS) in infancy, FOs associated with spikes were abundant during the WS period prior to adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy, with significantly greater numbers of FOs compared to the post-WS period (median 242 and 0, respectively; p = 0.0078). As there was no such time-dependent difference regarding FOs unassociated with spikes, FOs associated with spikes were identified as epileptic. The detected FOs included both gamma and ripple oscillations with no consistent age-dependent shifts in dominant frequency. There were no apparent age-related changes in FO duration. Conclusions: Epileptic scalp FOs are confirmed to correspond to severity of epileptic encephalopathy, particularly in WS, even during the long-term evolutional courses of TSC-associated epilepsy.

The human ability to implement a sustained attention task is supported by brain networks that dynamically formed and dissolved through oscillatory synchronization. The decrement of vigilance induced by prolonged task engagement affects sustained attention. However, little is known about which stage or combinations are affected by vigilance decrement. Here, we applied an analysis framework composed of weighted phase lag index (wPLI) and tensor component analysis (TCA) to an EEG dataset collected during 80 min sustained attention task to examine the electrophysiological basis of such effect. We aimed to characterize the phase-coupling networks to untangle different phases involved in sustained attention and study how they are modulated by vigilance decrement. We computed the time-frequency domain wPLI from each block and subject and constructed a fourth-order tensor, containing the time, frequency, functional connectivity (FC), and blocks x subjects. This tensor was subjected to the TCA to identify the interacted and low-dimensional components representing the frequency-specific dynamic FC (fdFC). We extracted four types of neuromakers during a sustained attention task, namely the pre-stimulus alpha right-lateralized parieto-occipital FC, the post-stimulus theta fronto-parieto-occipital FC, delta fronto-parieto-occipital FC, and beta right/left sensorimotor FCs. All these fdFCs were impaired by vigilance decrement. These fdFCs, except for the beta left sensorimotor network, were restored by rewards, although the restoration by reward in the beta right sensorimotor network was transient. These findings provide implications for dissociable effects of vigilance decrement on sustained attention by utilizing the tensor-based framework.

Accurate detection of HFOs is significant for the preoperative localization of epileptic SOZs. In this paper, a new method is proposed to automatically detect ripples (Rs) and fast ripples (FRs) from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in epilepsy. A moving-window technique is utilized to segment the filtered signals which are obtained by filtering the raw iEEG signals using two Chebyshev band-pass filters. Two stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) models are proposed to automatically detect Rs and FRs, respectively. By optimizing the parameters of the two SSAE models, our method yields higher sensitivity (88.9+/-2.4% for Rs and 83.2+/-2.5% for FRs) and higher specificity (92.3+/-2.8% for Rs and 86.1+/-2.8% for ERs) than other three methods do.

Toward explaining this, a previous experimental study using manipulation by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) revealed more global propagation of phase resetting in the eyes-open condition than in the eyes-closed condition in the alpha band. Those results indicate a significant increase of directed information flow across brain networks from the stimulated area to the rest of the brain when the eyes are open, suggesting that sensitivity to environmental changes and external stimuli is adaptively controlled by changing the dynamics of the alpha rhythm. However, the mathematical mechanism mediating the changes in the sensitivity has not been well elucidated. In this study, we propose a qualitative mathematical model that describes the characteristic behavior of the EEG phase dynamics. Numerically, we find that the propagation properties of the phase resetting qualitatively depend on whether the population of oscillators at the stimulated area are synchronized. These results support the hypothesis that the dynamics of the alpha oscillations controls sensitivity to external stimuli. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to determine the link between anxiety and executive functions through quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) based on the RDoC system. Nineteen-channel EEGs were recorded at the psychiatric clinic from 41 patients with symptoms of anxiety. The EEG power spectra were analysed. The Executive Intelligence Test (EXIT) including the K-WAIS-IV, Stroop, controlled oral word association, and the design fluency tests were performed. A partial, inversed, and significant association was observed between executive intelligence quotient (EIQ) and the absolute delta power in the central region. Similarly, a partial, inversed, and significant association was observed between design fluency and the absolute delta power in the left parietal area. Our findings suggest that the increase in delta power in the central region and left P3 was negatively correlated with the decrease in executive function. It is expected that the absolute delta power plays a specific role in the task-negative default mode network in the relationship between anxiety and executive function.

We used multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) to investigate whether the time course of the deployment of covert spatial attention leading up to the observer's perceptual decision can be decoded from both EEG alpha power and raw activity traces. Decoding attention from these signals can help determine whether raw EEG signals and alpha power reflect the same or distinct features of attentional selection. Using a classical cueing task, we showed that the orientation of covert spatial attention can be decoded by both signals. However, raw activity and alpha power may reflect different features of spatial attention, with alpha power more associated with the orientation of covert attention in space and raw activity with the influence of attention on perceptual processes.

Subjective clinical evaluation still remains crucial in its diagnosis. Discussed are two key aspects in the "characterizing ADHD" and on the quest for objective "pathognomonic/endophenotypic diagnostic markers of ADHD". The first aspect briefly revolves around issues related to identification of pathognomonic/endophenotypic diagnostic markers in ADHD. Issues discussed include changes in ADHD definition, remission/persistence and overlapping-symptoms cum shared-heritability with its co-morbid cross-border mental disorders. The second aspect discussed is neurobiological and EEG-based studies on ADHD. Given the neurobiological and temporal aspects of ADHD symptoms the electroencephalograph (EEG) like NeuralScan by Medeia appears as an appropriate tool. The EEGs appropriateness is further enhanced when coupled with suitable behavior/cognitive/motor/psychological tasks/paradigms yielding EEG-based markers like event-related-potential (ERPs like P3 amplitudes and latency), reaction time variability (RTV), Theta:Beta ratio (TBR) and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). At present, these markers could potentially help in the neurobiological characterization of ADHD and either help in identifying or lay the groundwork for identifying pathognomonic and/or endophenotypic EEG-based markers enabling its diagnosis, treatment and management.

It has been suggested in several ways that the amount of HFO at a certain point in time may reflect the disease activity or severity. This could be clinically useful in several ways, especially as noninvasive recording of HFO appears feasible. We grouped the potential hypotheses into 4 categories: (1) HFO as biomarkers to predict the development of epilepsy; (2) HFO as biomarkers to predict the occurrence of seizures; (3) HFO as biomarkers linked to the severity of epilepsy, and (4) HFO as biomarkers to evaluate outcome of treatment. We will review the literature that addresses these 4 hypotheses and see to what extent HFO can be used to measure seizure propensity and help determine prognosis of this unpredictable disease.

However, the nature and temporal dynamics of the neural representations in VSTM that support this stability are barely understood. Here we combined human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings with analyses using deep neural networks and semantic models to probe the representational format and temporal dynamics of information in VSTM. We found clear evidence that VSTM maintenance occurred in two distinct representational formats which originated from different encoding periods. The first format derived from an early encoding period (250 to 770 ms) corresponded to higher-order visual representations. The second format originated from a late encoding period (1,000 to 1,980 ms) and contained abstract semantic representations. These representational formats were overall stable during maintenance, with no consistent transformation across time. Nevertheless, maintenance of both representational formats showed substantial arrhythmic fluctuations, i.e., waxing and waning in irregular intervals. The increases of the maintained representational formats were specific to the phases of hippocampal low-frequency activity. Our results demonstrate that human VSTM simultaneously maintains representations at different levels of processing, from higher-order visual information to abstract semantic representations, which are stably maintained via coupling to hippocampal low-frequency activity.

Results suggest that recurrence indices of HRV might contribute to improve activity episodes detection for BCI control as the highest performance was achieved with power spectral density features of EEG in combination with recurrence HRV features (AUROC = 0.81 +/- 0.07).

Two studies examined whether discrete areas of attention are equally affected by sleep loss. This was achieved using a repeated-measures within-subjects design, with two contrasting conditions: normal sleep and partial sleep restriction of 5-h. Study 1 compared performance on a sustained attention task (Psychomotor Vigilance task; PVT) with performance on a transient attention task (Attentional Blink; AB). PVT performance, but not performance on the AB task, was impaired after sleep restriction. Study 2 sought to determine the neural underpinnings of the phenomenon, using electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency analysis, which measured activity during the brief eyes-closed resting state before the tasks. AB performance was unaffected by sleep restriction, despite clearly observable changes in brain activity. EEG results showed a significant reduction in resting state alpha oscillations that was most prominent centrally in the right hemisphere. Changes in individual alpha and delta power were also found to be related to changes in subjective sleepiness and PVT performance. Results likely reflect different levels of impairment in specific forms of attention following sleep loss.

Imaging studies using vestibular stimulation have revealed a vestibular thalamo-cortical dominance in the right hemisphere in right handers and the left hemisphere in left handers. We investigated if the behavioural characteristics and neural correlates of vection differ between healthy left and right-handed individuals. 64-channel EEG was recorded while 25 right handers and 25 left handers were exposed to vection-compatible roll motion (coherent motion) and a matched, control condition (incoherent motion). Behavioural characteristics, i.e. vection presence, onset latency, duration and subjective strength, were also recorded. The behavioural characteristics of vection did not differ between left and right handers (allp > 0.05). Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis revealed significant decreases in alpha power during vection-compatible roll motion (p < 0.05). The topography of this decrease was handedness-dependent, with left handers showing a left lateralized centro-parietal decrease and right handers showing a bilateral midline centro-parietal decrease. Further time-frequency analysis, time locked to vection onset, revealed a comparable decrease in alpha power around vection onset and a relative increase in alpha power during ongoing vection, for left and right handers. No effects were observed in theta and beta bands. Left and right-handed individuals show vection-related alpha power decreases at different topographical regions, possibly related to the influence of handedness-dependent vestibular dominance in the visual-vestibular interaction that facilitates visual self-motion perception. Despite this difference in where vection-related activity is observed, left and right handers demonstrate comparable perception and underlying alpha band changes during vection.

However, mapping the TP with functional magnetic resonance imaging is technically challenging and thus understanding its interaction with other key emotional circuitry, such as the amygdala, remains elusive. We exploited the unique advantages of stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) to assess the responses of the TP and the amygdala during the perception of emotionally salient stimuli of pictures, music and movies. These stimuli consistently elicited high gamma responses (70-140 Hz) in both the TP and the amygdala, accompanied by functional connectivity in the low frequency range (2-12 Hz). Computational analyses suggested that the TP drove this effect in the theta frequency range, modulated by the emotional valence of the stimuli. Notably, cross-frequency analysis indicated the phase of theta oscillations in the TP modulated the amplitude of high gamma activity in the amygdala. These results were reproducible across three types of sensory inputs including naturalistic stimuli. Our results suggest that multimodal emotional stimuli induce a hierarchical influence of the TP over the amygdala. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Low-Dose Perampanel Rescues Cortical Gamma Dysregulation Associated With Parvalbumin Interneuron GluA2 Upregulation in Epileptic Syngap1(+/-) Mice	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Gamma oscillations; GluA2; Intellectual disability; Myoclonic seizures; Parvalbumin interneurons; Perampanel	GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; THETA; MUTATIONS; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; MATURATION; NEURONS	BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function SYNGAP1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and epilepsy. SYNGAP1 is a Ras GTPase-activating protein that underlies the formation and experience-dependent regulation of postsynaptic densities. The mechanisms that contribute to this proposed monogenic cause of intellectual disability and epilepsy remain unresolved. METHODS: We established the phenotype of the epileptogenesis in a Syngap1(+/-) mouse model using 24-hour video electroencephalography (vEEG)/electromyography recordings at advancing ages. We administered an acute low dose of perampanel, a Food and Drug Administration-approved AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist, during a follow-on 24-hour vEEG to investigate the role of AMPARs in Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the region- and location-specific differences in the expression of the GluA2 AMPAR subunit. RESULTS: A progressive worsening of the epilepsy with emergence of multiple seizure phenotypes, interictal spike frequency, sleep dysfunction, and hyperactivity was identified in Syngap(+/-) mice. Interictal spikes emerged predominantly during non-rapid eye movement sleep in 24-hour vEEG of Syngap(+/-) mice. Myoclonic seizures occurred at behavioral-state transitions both in Syngap(+/-) mice and during an overnight EEG from a child with SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency. In Syngap(+/-) mice, EEG spectral power analyses identified a significant loss of gamma power modulation during behavioral-state transitions. A significant region-specific increase of GluA2 AMPAR subunit expression in the somas of parvalbumin-positive interneurons was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Acute dosing with perampanel significantly rescued behavioral state-dependent cortical gamma homeostasis, identifying a novel mechanism implicating Ca2+-impermeable AMPARs on parvalbumin-positive interneurons underlying circuit dysfunction in SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency.

Here, we hypothesize that the movement-related power modulation in the beta-band observed during regular finger tapping, deteriorates in the transition period before upper limb freezing (ULF). Methods: We analyzed a 36-channel EEG of 13 patients with PD during self-paced repetitive tapping of the right index finger. In offline analysis, we compared the transition period immediately before ULF ('transition') with regular tapping regarding movement-related power modulation and interregional phase synchronization. Results: From time-frequency analyses, we observed that the tap cycle related beta-band power modulation over the left sensorimotor area was diminished in the transition period before ULF. Furthermore, increased beta-band power was observed in the transition period compared to regular tapping centered over the left centro-parietal and right frontal areas. Phase synchronization between the left fronto-parietal areas and the left sensorimotor area was elevated during transition compared to regular tapping. Conclusion: Together, these results indicate that diminished beta band power modulation and increased phase synchronization precede ULF. Significance: We demonstrate that pathological cortical motor processing is present in the transition phase from regular tapping to an ULF episode.

Resting-State SEEG May Help Localize Epileptogenic Brain Regions	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Brain networks; Functional connectivity; Intracranial EEG; Localization; Seizure	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STEREO-ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; SURGERY	BACKGROUND: Stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) is a minimally invasive neurosurgical method to localize epileptogenic brain regions in epilepsy but requires days in the hospital with interventions to trigger several seizures. OBJECTIVE: To make initial progress in the development of network analysis methods to identify epileptogenic brain regions using brief, resting-state SEEG data segments, without requiring seizure recordings. METHODS: In a cohort of 15 adult focal epilepsy patients undergoing SEEG, we evaluated functional connectivity (alpha-band imaginary coherence) across sampled regions using brief (2 min) resting-state data segments. Bootstrapped logistic regression was used to generate a model to predict epileptogenicity of individual regions. RESULTS: Compared to nonepileptogenic structures, we found increased functional connectivity within epileptogenic regions (P < .05) and between epileptogenic areas and other structures (P < .01, paired t-tests, corrected). Epileptogenic areas also demonstrated higher clustering coefficient (P < .01) and betweenness centrality (P < .01), and greater decay of functional connectivity with distance (P < .05, paired t-tests, corrected). Our functional connectivity model to predict epileptogenicity of individual regions demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.78 and accuracy of 80.4%. CONCLUSION: Our study represents a preliminary step towards defining resting-state SEEG functional connectivity patterns to help localize epileptogenic brain regions ahead of neurosurgical treatment without requiring seizure recordings.

Here, we investigate anticipatory and reactive effects of feature-based attention using separate fMRI and EEG recordings, while participants attended to one of two spatially overlapping visual features (motion and orientation). We focused on EEG source analysis of local neuronal rhythms and nested oscillations and on graph analysis of connectivity changes in a network of fMRI-defined regions of interest, and characterized a cascade of attentional effects at multiple spatial scales. We discuss how the results may reconcile several theories of selective attention, by showing how beta rhythms support anticipatory information routing through increased network efficiency, while reactive alpha-band desynchronization patterns and increased alpha-gamma coupling in task-specific sensory areas mediate stimulus-evoked processing of task-relevant signals.

Here, we investigate the effects of tACS using an intermittent tACS-EEG protocol and use, in addition to classical metrics, Lempel-Ziv-Welch complexity (LZW) to characterize the interactions between task, endogenous and exogenous oscillations. In a cross-over study, EEG was recorded from thirty participants engaged in a change-of-speed detection task while receiving multichannel tACS over the visual cortex at 10 Hz, 70 Hz and a control condition. In each session, tACS was applied intermittently during 5 s events interleaved with EEG recordings over multiple trials. We found that, with respect to control, stimulation at 10 Hz (tACS10) enhanced both alpha and gamma power, gamma-LZW complexity and gamma but not alpha phase locking value with respect to tACS onset (alpha-PLV, gamma-PLV), and increased reaction time (RT). tACS70 increased RT with little impact on other metrics. As trials associated with larger gamma-power (and lower gamma-LZW) predicted shorter RT, we argue that tACS10 produces a disruption of functionally relevant fast oscillations through an increase in alpha-band power, slowing behavioural responses and increasing the complexity of gamma oscillations. Our study highlights the complex interaction between tACS and endogenous brain dynamics, and suggests the use of algorithmic complexity inspired metrics to characterize cortical dynamics in a behaviorally relevant timescale.

Decomposing alpha and 1/f brain activities reveals their differential associations with cognitive processing speed	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha oscillation; 1/f power law pattern; EEG; Cognitive processing speed	PRESTIMULUS OSCILLATORY POWER; SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; TIME DISTRIBUTIONS; EEG ALPHA; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	Research in cognitive neuroscience has extensively demonstrated that the temporal dynamics of brain activity are associated with cognitive functioning. The temporal dynamics mainly include oscillatory and 1/f noise-like, non-oscillatory brain activities that coexist in many forms of brain activity and confound each other's variability. As such, observed functional associations of narrowband oscillations might have been confounded with the broad-band 1/f component. Here, we investigated the relationship between resting-state EEG activity and the efficiency of cognitive functioning in N = 180 individuals. We show that 1/f brain activity plays an essential role in accounting for between-person variability in cognitive speed - a relationship that can be mistaken as originating from brain oscillations using conventional power spectrum analysis. At first glance, the power of alpha oscillations appeared to be predictive of cognitive speed. However, when dissociating pure alpha oscillations from 1/f brain activity, only the 1/f predicted cognitive speed, whereas the predictive power of alpha vanished. With this highly powered study, we disambiguate the functional relevance of the 1/f power law pattern in resting state neural activities and substantiate the necessity of isolating the 1/f component from oscillatory activities when studying the functional relevance of spontaneous brain activities.

Despite the wide popularity of the topic, current attempts to summarize the research in the field are narrative reviews. We address this gap by providing a descriptive systematic review, in which we investigated oscillatory correlates of maintenance of verbal and visual information in WM. The systematic approach enabled us to challenge some common views popularized by previous research. The identified literature (100 EEG/MEG studies) highlighted the importance of theta oscillations in verbal WM: frontal midline theta enhanced with load in most verbal studies, while more equivocal results have been obtained in visual studies. Increasing WM load affected alpha activity in most studies, but the direction of the effect was inconsistent: the ratio of studies that found alpha increase versus decrease with increasing load was 80/20% in the verbal WM domain and close to 60/40% in the visual domain. Alpha asymmetry (left < right) was a common finding in both verbal and visual WM studies. Beta and gamma activity studies yielded the least convincing data: a diversity in the spatial and frequency distribution of beta activity prevented us from making a coherent conclusion; gamma rhythm was virtually neglected in verbal WM studies with no systematic support for sustained gamma changes during the delay in EEG studies in general.

It was important to resolve how these cues influenced consumers' online purchasing decision. We also knew little about how the human brain processed these cues simultaneously, and which cue would occupy a dominant position in neural activity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the neural correlates of online shopping decisions and how online rating and product price jointly influenced such purchase decisions. Research Method: Eighteen undergraduates were recruited to participate in this research. Each participant was exposed to all four experimental conditions combining 2 (product price: high vs. low) x 2 (online rating: positive vs. negative) with a total of 192 trials. They were required to rate the degree of willingness-to-pay. EEG data were obtained with 64 electrodes placed on the Easy Cap according to the International 10-20 system. We conducted both the event-related potentials analysis and the time-frequency analysis for the EEG data. Results: The behavioral findings indicated that products with positive rating and low price increased the willingness-to-pay. The EEG results showed that larger late positive potentials were elicited by products with low price compared with high price under positive rating condition, but not under negative rating condition, reflecting the modulated effect of online rating on the emotional arousal elicited by product price. Furthermore, we found larger alpha event related desynchronization elicited by products with positive rating compared with negative rating, indicating that more cognitive resources were allocated for products with a positive rating. Conclusion: Combined with behavioral and EEG analysis, our results emphasized the more important position of product rating compared with price. The findings deepened the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the online shopping decision process. More attention should be paid to online ratings on the webpage of the electronic store, because negative ratings made a product less appealing for prospective consumers regardless of price. Thus, the owners should build good reputations for their online products, which were fundamental to the consumers' online purchasing decisions.

The application of neuromarketing techniques to the study of food packaging has recently gained considerable popularity both in academia and practice, but there are still some concerns about the methods and metrics commercially offered and the interpretation of their findings. This represents the motivation of this investigation, whose objective is twofold: (1) to analyze the methodologies and measurements commonly used in neuromarketing commercial research on packaging, and (2) to examine the extent to which the results of food packaging studies applying neuromarketing techniques can be reproduced under similar methodologies. Obtained results shed light on the application of neuromarketing techniques in the evaluation of food packaging and reveal that neuromarketing and declarative methodologies are complementary, and its combination may strengthen the studies' results. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of having a framework that improves the validity and reliability of neuromarketing studies to eradicate mistrust toward the discipline and provide brands with valuable insights into food packing design.

In this paper, we present a novel technique, termed common frequency pattern (CFP), to extract the variance features from a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal for sleep stage classification. The learning task is formulated by finding significant frequency patterns that maximize variance for one class and that at the same time, minimize variance for the other class. The proposed methodology for automated sleep scoring is tested on the benchmark Sleep-EDF database and finally achieves 97.9%, 94.22%, and 90.16% accuracy for two-state, three-state, and five-state classification of sleep stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method identifies discriminative characteristics of sleep stages robustly and achieves better performance as compared to the state-of-the-art sleep staging algorithms. Apart from the enhanced classification, the frequency patterns that are determined by the CFP algorithm is able to find the most significant bands of frequency for classification and could be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanisms of sleep stages.

J	Donoghue, T; Dominguez, J; Voytek, B				Donoghue, Thomas; Dominguez, Julio; Voytek, Bradley			Electrophysiological Frequency Band Ratio Measures Conflate Periodic and Aperiodic Neural Activity	ENEURO			English	Article							EEG THETA/BETA RATIO; AGE	Band ratio measures, computed as the ratio of power between two frequency bands, are a common analysis measure in neuro-electrophysiological recordings. Band ratio measures are typically interpreted as reflecting quantitative measures of periodic, or oscillatory, activity. This assumes that the measure reflects relative powers of distinct periodic components that are well captured by predefined frequency ranges. However, electrophysiological signals contain periodic components and a 1/f-like aperiodic component, the latter of which contributes power across all frequencies. Here, we investigate whether band ratio measures truly reflect oscillatory power differences, and/or to what extent ratios may instead reflect other periodic changes such as in center frequency or bandwidth and/or aperiodic activity. In simulation, we investigate how band ratio measures relate to changes in multiple spectral features, and show how multiple periodic and aperiodic features influence band ratio measures. We validate these findings in human electroencephalography (EEG) data, comparing band ratio measures to parameterizations of power spectral features, and find that multiple disparate features influence ratio measures. For example, the commonly applied theta / beta ratio is most reflective of differences in aperiodic activity, and not oscillatory theta or beta power. Collectively, we show that periodic and aperiodic features can create the same observed changes in band ratio measures, and that this is inconsistent with their typical interpretations as measures of periodic power. We conclude that band ratio measures are a non-specific measure, conflating multiple possible underlying spectral changes, and recommend explicit parameterization of neural power spectra as a more specific approach. Significance Statement Neural oscillations are a ubiquitous feature of investigation in electrophysiological recordings. Frequency band ratio measures are a common approach to investigate neural oscillations, applied across cognitive and clinical neuroscience, and in recording modalities such as in electroencephalography and local field potentials. In this work we systematically investigate the methodological properties of band ratio measures. We show that band ratio measures are not specific to measuring oscillatory power, as they are intended and interpreted to do. Rather, they often reflect other features of the data, such as aperiodic, or activity. These findings are significant for interpreting prior empirical and clinical research, guiding future work, and another motivation that aperiodic neural activity should be a key consideration when studying electrophysiological data.

We assessed the influence of the time of night on the EEG correlates of DR from REM sleep. Specifically, we tested the continuity-hypothesis (on the theta EEG band) and the activation-hypothesis (on the delta and beta bands). Methods: Twenty-seven subjects underwent polysomnography with multiple provoked awakenings during REM sleep. Only the subjects showing combinations of dream recall (REC) and non-REC (NREC) conditions in both first (1st-2nd sleep cycle) and second (3rd4th sleep cycle) part of the night were included in the analyses. The final sample was composed of 10 subjects (mean age 24 +/- 0.70). EEG power spectra of the 5-min of REM sleep preceding each awakening were computed by a fast Fourier transform. The following frequency bands were considered: delta (0.50-4.75 Hz), theta (5.00-7.75 Hz), and beta (16.00-24.75 Hz). We also calculated the delta/beta power ratio as an integrated EEG index of activation. Results: The 2x2 within-subjects ANOVA recall x time revealed: a) no significant effect for time and no interaction; b) significant differences over the occipital area in the beta band; c) significant differences over the parietal area for the activation index values. Overall, the results indicated that DR is associated with higher activation regardless of homeostatic pressure across the night of sleep. Conclusion: In line with recent findings, we have shown that DR is predicted by desynchronized EEG activity during REM sleep, providing clear evidence in favor of the activationhypothesis. We have also confirmed that the EEG pattern of DR can be ascribed to state-like factors. Further studies should assess whether homeostatic modulation may interact with some dream features and the related EEG predictors.

Brandon			Association of Sleep Electroencephalography-Based Brain Age Index With Dementia	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EEG; MILD; OSCILLATIONS; SEX	This cross-sectional study examines a sleep electroencephalography-based brain age index as a potential biomarker associated with dementia. Question Can an electroencephalography-based brain age index, calculated as the difference between chronological and estimated brain age through sleep electroencephalography, serve as a potential biomarker associated with dementia? Findings This cross-sectional study of 9834 polysomnograms using machine learning found that brain age index increased monotonically from nondementia to dementia subpopulations. Meaning These findings suggest that brain age index may be a useful biomarker associated with dementia and could have utility as a screening tool for the presence of underlying neurodegenerative disease and monitoring of disease progression. Importance Dementia is an increasing cause of disability and loss of independence in the elderly population yet remains largely underdiagnosed. A biomarker for dementia that can identify individuals with or at risk for developing dementia may help close this diagnostic gap. Objective To investigate the association between a sleep electroencephalography-based brain age index (BAI), the difference between chronological age and brain age estimated using the sleep electroencephalogram, and dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants In this retrospective cross-sectional study of 9834 polysomnograms, BAI was computed among individuals with previously determined dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitive symptoms but no diagnosis of MCI or dementia, and among healthy individuals without dementia from August 22, 2008, to June 4, 2018. Data were analyzed from November 15, 2018, to June 24, 2020. Exposure Dementia, MCI, and dementia-related symptoms, such as cognitive change and memory impairment. Main Outcomes and Measures The outcome measures were the trend in BAI when moving from groups ranging from healthy, to symptomatic, to MCI, to dementia and pairwise comparisons of BAI among these groups. Findings A total of 5144 sleep studies were included in BAI examinations. Patients in these studies had a median (interquartile range) age of 54 (43-65) years, and 3026 (59%) were men. The patients included 88 with dementia, 44 with MCI, 1075 who were symptomatic, and 2336 without dementia. There was a monotonic increase in mean (SE) BAI from the nondementia group to the dementia group (nondementia: 0.20 [0.42]; symptomatic: 0.58 [0.41]; MCI: 1.65 [1.20]; dementia: 4.18 [1.02]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that a sleep-state electroencephalography-based BAI shows promise as a biomarker associated with progressive brain processes that ultimately result in dementia.

We first briefly discuss how intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings, performed for clinical practice, are used to study human cognition with the spatiotemporal and single-trial precision traditionally limited to non-human animal research. We then delineate how studies using iEEG have informed our understanding of issues fundamental to human cognition: auditory prediction, working and episodic memory, and internal cognition. We also discuss the potential of iEEG to infer causality through the manipulation or 'engineering' of neurocognitive processes via spatiotemporally precise electrical stimulation. We close by highlighting limitations of iEEG, potential of burgeoning techniques to further increase spatiotemporal precision, and implications for future research using intracranial approaches to understand, restore, and enhance human cognition.

Identifying site- and stimulation-specific TMS-evoked EEG potentials using a quantitative cosine similarity metric	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; EXCITABILITY; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; BREAKDOWN	The ability to interpret transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked electroencephalography (EEG) potentials (TEPs) is limited by artifacts, such as auditory evoked responses produced by discharge of the TMS coil. TEPs generated from direct cortical stimulation should vary in their topographical activity pattern according to stimulation site and differ from responses to sham stimulation. Responses that do not show these effects are likely to be artifactual. In 20 healthy volunteers, we delivered active and sham TMS to the right prefrontal, left primary motor, and left posterior parietal cortex and compared the waveform similarity of TEPs between stimulation sites and active and sham TMS using a cosine similarity-based analysis method. We identified epochs after the stimulus when the spatial pattern of TMS-evoked activation showed greater than random similarity between stimulation sites and sham vs. active TMS, indicating the presence of a dominant artifact. To do this, we binarized the derivatives of the TEPs recorded from 30 EEG channels and calculated cosine similarity between conditions at each time point with millisecond resolution. Only TEP components occurring before approximately 80 ms differed across stimulation sites and between active and sham, indicating site and condition-specific responses. We therefore conclude that, in the absence of noise masking or other measures to decrease neural artifact, TEP components before about 80 ms can be safely interpreted as stimulation location-specific responses to TMS, but components beyond this latency should be interpreted with caution due to high similarity in their topographical activity pattern.

In Japan, a country in which invasive studies using subdural electrodes (SDEs) have been the mainstream, SEEG has been approved for insurance coverage in 2020 and is expected to gain in popularity. Some concepts supporting SEEG methodology are fundamentally different from that of SDE studies. Clinicians interested in utilizing SEEG in their practice should be aware of those aspects in which they differ. Success in utilizing the SEEG methodology relies heavily on the construction of an a priori hypothesis regarding the putative seizure onset zone (SOZ) and propagation. This article covers the technical and theoretical aspects of SEEG, including the surgical techniques and precautions, hypothesis construction, and the interpretation of the recording, all with the aim of providing an introductory guide to SEEG.

Our approach makes the simplifying assumptions that different people's brains exhibit similar correlational structure, and that activity and correlation patterns vary smoothly over space. One can then ask, for an arbitrary individual's brain: given recordings from a limited set of locations in that individual's brain, along with the observed spatial correlations learned from other people's recordings, how much can be inferred about ongoing activity at other locations throughout that individual's brain? We show that our approach generalizes across people and tasks, thereby providing a person- and task-general means of inferring high spatiotemporal resolution full-brain neural dynamics from standard low-density intracranial recordings.

Distraction by Unintentional Recognition: Neurocognitive Mechanisms and Effects of Aging	PSYCHOLOGY AND AGING			English	Article						aging; recognition; cognitive control; ERPs; EEG oscillations	LATE POSTERIOR NEGATIVITY; SOURCE MEMORY RETRIEVAL; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; CONTEXT MEMORY; RECOLLECTION; ERP	Sometimes, we intentionally evaluate stimuli to assess whether we recognize them, whereas, at other times, stimuli automatically elicit recognition despite our efforts to ignore them. If multiple stimuli are encountered in the same environment, intentional recognition judgments can be biased by unintentional recognition of to-be-ignored stimuli. Aging is associated with increased distractibility and impaired intentional retrieval processes, which can make older adults more susceptible to distraction-induced recognition biases. We measured recognition memory performance, event-related potentials (ERPs), and electroencephalography oscillations in old (age range = 60-74) and young (age range = 18-24) adults to investigate how aging affects unintentional and intentional memory processes, and how these processes interact over time to produce distraction-induced recognition biases. Older participants had poorer intentional recognition memory, but the biasing effect of unintentional distractor recognition was similar across age groups. FRP effects related to intentional and unintentional recognition that were strongly expressed in the younger group were reduced or absent in the older group. Furthermore, the older group showed qualitatively different ERP activity during intentional recognition compared with the younger group. However, similar patterns of theta and alpha oscillations were found in both age groups, who showed theta power increases for both intentional and unintentional recognition, whereas alpha power was enhanced for intentional recognition but reduced for unintentional recognition. Overall, the findings show that unintentional and intentional recognition involve multiple dissociable memory processes that have different time-courses and functional characteristics and are differentially affected by aging. Whereas aging has strong effects on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying intentional recognition memory, unintentional recognition mechanisms are less affected.

To determine whether EEG differentiates the prodromal phase of DLB from other causes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and whether EEG is predictive for time to conversion from MCI to DLB, we compared EEGs and clinical follow-up of patients with MCI due to DLB with those of patients with MCI due to Alzheimer disease (MCI-AD). Methods We compared 37 patients with MCI who developed DLB during follow-up or had an abnormal I-123-PF-CIT SPECT scan (MCI-DLB) with 67 age-matched patients with MCI-AD. EEGs were assessed visually with a score of increasing abnormality (range 1-5). We performed fast Fourier transform to analyze the power spectrum. With survival analyses, EEG characteristics were related to time to progression to dementia. Results The visual EEG score was higher in MCI-DLB (score >2 in 60%) compared to MCI-AD (score >2 in 8%, p < 0.001). We found frontal intermittent delta activity in 22% of MCI-DLB, not in MCI-AD. Patients with MCI-DLB had a lower peak frequency (7.5 [6.0-9.9] Hz vs 8.8 [6.8-10.2] in MCI-AD, p < 0.001) and more slow-wave activity. Several individual EEG measures showed good performance to discriminate MCI-DLB from MCI-AD (areas under the curve up to 0.94). In MCI-DLB, high visual EEG score, diffuse abnormalities, and low alpha 2 power were related to time to progression to dementia (hazard ratios 4.1, 9.9, 5.1, respectively). Conclusions Profound EEG abnormalities are already present in the prodromal stage of DLB and have diagnostic and prognostic value. Classification of evidence This study provides Class III evidence that EEG abnormalities are more common in MCI-DLB than MCI-AD.

J	Valentin, S; Harkotte, M; Popov, T				Valentin, Simon; Harkotte, Maximilian; Popov, Tzvetan			Interpreting neural decoding models using grouped model reliance	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG-DATA; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; INFERENCE; PATTERNS; CODES	Author summary Modern machine learning algorithms currently receive considerable attention for their predictive power in neural decoding applications. However, there is a need for methods that make such predictive models interpretable. In the present work, we address the problem of assessing which aspects of the input data a trained model relies upon to make predictions. We demonstrate the use of grouped model reliance as a generally applicable method for interpreting neural decoding models. Illustrating the method on a case study, we employed an experimental design in which a comparably small number of participants (10) completed a large number of trials (972) over three electroencephalography (EEG) recording sessions from a Sternberg working memory task. Trained decoding models consistently relied on predictor variables from the alpha frequency band, which is in line with existing research on the relationship between neural oscillations and working memory. However, our analyses also indicate large inter-individual variability with respect to the relation between activity patterns and working memory load in frequency and topography. We argue that grouped model reliance provides a useful tool to better understand the workings of (sometimes otherwise black box) decoding models. Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly popular for decoding psychological constructs based on neural data. However, as a step towards bridging the gap between theory-driven cognitive neuroscience and data-driven decoding approaches, there is a need for methods that allow to interpret trained decoding models. The present study demonstrates grouped model reliance as a model-agnostic permutation-based approach to this problem. Grouped model reliance indicates the extent to which a trained model relies on conceptually related groups of variables, such as frequency bands or regions of interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. As a case study to demonstrate the method, random forest and support vector machine models were trained on within-participant single-trial EEG data from a Sternberg working memory task. Participants were asked to memorize a sequence of digits (0-9), varying randomly in length between one, four and seven digits, where EEG recordings for working memory load estimation were taken from a 3-second retention interval. The present results confirm previous findings insofar as both random forest and support vector machine models relied on alpha-band activity in most subjects. However, as revealed by further analyses, patterns in frequency and topography varied considerably between individuals, pointing to more pronounced inter-individual differences than previously reported.

To solve this problem, many temporal and spatial feature based channel selection methods have been proposed. However, temporal and spatial features do not accurately reflect changes in the power of the oscillatory EEG. Thus, spectral features of MI-related EEG signals may be useful for channel selection. Bispectrum analysis is a technique developed for extracting non-linear and non-Gaussian information from non-linear and non-Gaussian signals. The features extracted from bispectrum analysis can provide frequency domain information about the EEG. Therefore, in this study, we propose a bispectrum-based channel selection (BCS) method for MI-based BCI. The proposed method uses the sum of logarithmic amplitudes (SLA) and the first order spectral moment (FOSM) features extracted from bispectrum analysis to select EEG channels without redundant information. Three public BCI competition datasets (BCI competition IV dataset 1, BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition III dataset IIIa) were used to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results indicate that our BCS method outperforms use of all channels (83.8% vs 69.4%, 86.3% vs 82.9% and 77.8% vs 68.2%, respectively). Furthermore, compared to the other state-of-the-art methods, our BCS method also can achieve significantly better classification accuracies for MI-based BCI (Wilcoxon signed test, p < 0.05).

Without considering any artifact removal approach, the residual neural network (ResNet) architecture is used to automatically learn the distinctive features of different sleep stages from the power spectral density (PSD) of the raw EEG data. The residual block of the ResNet learns the intrinsic features of different sleep stages from the EEG data while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. The proposed approach is validated using the sleep dataset of the Dreams database, which comprises of EEG signals for 20 healthy human subjects, 16 female and 4 male. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ResNet based approach in identifying different sleep stages in both female and male subjects compared to state-of-the-art methods with classification accuracies of 87.8% and 83.7%, respectively.

Brain activity (basal activity, imaginary motor task and actual motor task) is obtained from 12 healthy volunteer subjects using an EEG (Cz channel). GBA is analyzed using the mean power spectral density (PSD) value. Event-related synchronization (ERS) is calculated from the PSD values of the basal GBA (GBAb), the GBA of the imaginary movement (GBAim) and the GBA of the actual movement (GBAac). The mean GBAim and GBAac values for the right and left hands are significantly higher than the GBAb value (p = 0.007). No significant difference is detected between mean GBA values during the imaginary and actual movement (p = 0.242). The mean ERS values for the imaginary movement (ERSimM (%) = 23.52) and for the actual movement (ERSacM = 27.47) do not present any significant difference (p = 0.117). We demonstrated that ERS could provide a useful way of indirectly checking the function of neuronal motor circuits activated by voluntary movement, both imaginary and actual. These results, as a proof of concept, could be applied to physiology studies, brain-computer interfaces, and diagnosis of cognitive or motor pathologies.

These strategies are thought to favour the mechanisms of brain plasticity that take place after brain injury. However, the level of evidence is low. Markers of brain plasticity would favour validation of these rehabilitation programs. In this paper, we consider the study of mu rhythm for this goal by describing the characteristics of mu rhythm in adults and children with typical development, then review the current literature on mu rhythm in CP. Mu rhythm is composed of brain oscillations recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) over the sensorimotor areas. The oscillations are characterized by their frequency, topography and modulation. Frequency ranges within the alpha band (similar to 10 Hz, mu alpha) or beta band (similar to 20 Hz, mu beta). Source location analyses suggest that mu alpha reflects somatosensory functions, whereas mu beta reflects motor functions. Event-related desynchronisation (ERD) followed by event-related (re-)synchronisation (ERS) of mu rhythm occur in association with a movement or somatosensory input. Even if the functional role of the different mu rhythm components remains incompletely understood, their maturational trajectory is well described. Increasing age from infancy to adolescence is associated with increasing ERD as well as increasing ERS. A few studies characterised mu rhythm in adolescents with spastic CP and showed atypical patterns of modulation in most of them. The most frequent findings in patients with unilateral CP are decreased ERD and decreased ERS over the central electrodes, but atypical topography may also be found. The patterns of modulations are more variable in bilateral CP. Data in infants and young children with CP are lacking and studies did not address the questions of intra-individual reliability of mu rhythm modulations in patients with CP nor their modification after motor learning. Better characterization of mu rhythm in CP, especially in infants and young children, is warranted before considering this rhythm as a potential neurophysiological marker of brain plasticity.

A validation of Emotiv EPOC Flex saline for EEG and ERP research	PEERJ			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Emotiv; Validation; MMN; P300; SSVEP; EPOC Flex; N170; Alpha	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; FACE; ALPHA; N170; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; INVERSION; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	Background: Previous work has validated consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems for use in research. Systems in this class are cost-effective and easy to set up and can facilitate neuroscience outside of the laboratory. The aim of the current study was to determine if a new consumer-grade system, the Emotiv EPOC Saline Flex, was capable of capturing research-quality data. Method: The Emotiv system was used simultaneously with a research-grade EEG system, Neuroscan Synamps2, to collect EEG data across 16 channels during five well-established paradigms: (1) a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm that involved a passive listening task in which rare deviant (1,500 Hz) tones were interspersed amongst frequent standard tones (1,000 Hz), with instructions to ignore the tones while watching a silent movie; (2) a P300 paradigm that involved an active listening task in which participants were asked to count rare deviant tones presented amongst frequent standard tones; (3) an N170 paradigm in which participants were shown images of faces and watches and asked to indicate whether the images were upright or inverted; (4) a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm in which participants passively viewed a flickering screen (15 Hz) for 2 min; and (5) a resting state paradigm in which participants sat quietly with their eyes open and then closed for 3 min each. Results: The MMN components and P300 peaks were equivalent between the two systems (BF10 = 0.25 and BF10 = 0.26, respectively), with high intraclass correlations (ICCs) between the ERP waveforms (>0.81). Although the N170 peak values recorded by the two systems were different (BF10 = 35.88), ICCs demonstrated that the N170 ERP waveforms were strongly correlated over the right hemisphere (P8; 0.87-0.97), and moderately-to-strongly correlated over the left hemisphere (P7; 0.52-0.84). For the SSVEP, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was larger for Neuroscan than Emotiv EPOC Flex (19.94 vs. 8.98, BF10 = 51,764), but SNR z-scores indicated a significant brain response at the stimulus frequency for both Neuroscan (z = 12.47) and Flex (z = 11.22). In the resting state task, both systems measured similar alpha power (BF10 = 0.28) and higher alpha power when the eyes were closed than open (BF10 = 32.27). Conclusions: The saline version of the Emotiv EPOC Flex captures data similar to that of a research-grade EEG system. It can be used to measure reliable auditory and visual research-quality ERPs. In addition, it can index SSVEP signatures and is sensitive to changes in alpha oscillations.

J	Brennan, JR; Martin, AE				Brennan, Jonathan R.; Martin, Andrea E.			Phase synchronization varies systematically with linguistic structure composition	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						compositionality; language; electroencephalography; neural oscillations; phase synchronization; naturalistic language processing	WRAP-UP; LEXICAL ACCESS; REPRESENTATIONS; SPEECH; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; NEUROSCIENCE; SYNTAX; CLAUSE	Computation in neuronal assemblies is putatively reflected in the excitatory and inhibitory cycles of activation distributed throughout the brain. In speech and language processing, coordination of these cycles resulting in phase synchronization has been argued to reflect the integration of information on different timescales (e.g. segmenting acoustics signals to phonemic and syllabic representations; (Giraud and Poeppel 2012 Nat. Neurosci. 15, 511 (doi:10.1038/nn.3036)). A natural extension of this claim is that phase synchronization functions similarly to support the inference of more abstract higher-level linguistic structures (Martin 2016 Front. Psychol. 7, 120; Martin and Doumas 2017 PLoS Biol. 15, e2000663 (doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2000663); Martin and Doumas. 2019 Curr. Opin. Behav. Sci. 29, 77-83 (doi:10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.04.008)). Hale et al. (Hale et al. 2018 Finding syntax in human encephalography with beam search. arXiv 1806.04127 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04127)) showed that syntactically driven parsing decisions predict electroencephalography (EEG) responses in the time domain; here we ask whether phase synchronization in the form of either inter-trial phrase coherence or cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between high-frequency (i.e. gamma) bursts and lower-frequency carrier signals (i.e. delta, theta), changes as the linguistic structures of compositional meaning (viz., bracket completions, as denoted by the onset of words that complete phrases) accrue. We use a naturalistic story-listening EEG dataset from Hale et al. to assess the relationship between linguistic structure and phase alignment. We observe increased phase synchronization as a function of phrase counts in the delta, theta, and gamma bands, especially for function words. A more complex pattern emerged for CFC as phrase count changed, possibly related to the lack of a one-to-one mapping between 'size' of linguistic structure and frequency band-an assumption that is tacit in recent frameworks. These results emphasize the important role that phase synchronization, desynchronization, and thus, inhibition, play in the construction of compositional meaning by distributed neural networks in the brain.

Mobile steady-state evoked potential recording: Dissociable neural effects of real-world navigation and visual stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						SSVEP; Mobile EEG; Lateralization; Vestibular cognition; Locomotion; Navigation	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG; SPACE; COST	Background: The ability to record brain activity in humans during movement, and in real world environments, is an important step towards understanding cognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) is well suited to mobile applications but suffers from the problem of artefacts introduced into the signal during movement. Steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) give an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and averaging a sufficient number of trials will eventually remove any noise not phase locked to the visual flicker. New Method: Here we present a method for producing SSVEPs of real world environments using modified LCD shutter glasses, which are commonly used for 3D TV, by adapting the glass to flicker at neurophysiologically relevant frequencies (alpha band). Participants viewed a room whilst standing and walking. Either the left or right side of the room was illuminated, to test if it is possible to recover the resulting SSVEPs when walking, as well as to probe the effect of walking on neural activity. Additionally, by using a signal generator to produce "simulated SSVEPs" on the scalp we can demonstrate that this method is able to accurately recover evoked neural responses during walking. Results: The amplitude of SSVEPs over right parietal cortex was reduced by walking. Furthermore, the waveform and phase of the SSVEPs is highly preserved between walking and standing, but was sensitive to whether the left or right side of the room was illuminated. Conclusions: This method allows probing neural responses during natural movements within real environments, potentially at a wide range of frequencies.

Theta activity (4-8 Hz), especially frontal, has been extensively associated to working memory tasks, increasing with task complexity and error monitoring. Alpha rhythm (8-14 Hz) has been hypothesized to enhance processes within the attentional focus via inhibition of task-irrelevant regions (alpha increase) and engagement of task-relevant regions (alpha decrease). Here, we provide further contribution to the investigation of alpha and theta activity by computing electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha and theta power from 10 participants who performed a resting phase (no attention) and a mental arithmetic task (internal attention), under two different visual conditions i.e., pictures and no picture presentation. Pictures stimulated external attention and acted as distractors during the math task but not during rest. Results show that frontal theta power increased during the math task vs rest, more largely in presence of visual distractors. Posterior alpha power increased in the math task vs rest in picture condition, but not in the no picture condition; moreover, it decreased in the picture vs no picture condition during rest but not during the math task. These results support frontal theta as a mechanism implementing cortical control in complex tasks and indicate that EEG alpha power reflects a sophisticate balance between increase in some regions and decrease in other regions, depending on the current goal and external context.

In this study, by the acquisition of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from 30 healthy participants who perform four different hand movements, necessary features are extracted and classified to determine their accuracies. Statistical time domain features are extracted from the mu and beta frequency band. The Event related desynchronization (ERD)/Event related synchronization (ERS) measurements are extracted, from which it was evident that both mu and beta frequency bands are more efficient in the C3 channel. By applying the Paired Samples t-test, the extracted features are analyzed and were determined to have a 95% significant level of difference between the mu and beta band, being statistically efficient in the beta band of the C3 channel. By employing different classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Naive Bayesian classifier and Binary Decision Tree (BDT) algorithms on both channel's mu and beta frequency bands, it was observed that the performance of beta frequency band classifiers shows 90% accuracy in binary class classification. In the comparative study of all these classifiers, LDA and Naive Bayes show above 95% accuracy for binary class classification.

Boosts in brain signal variability track liberal shifts in decision bias	ELIFE			English	Article							PHYSIOLOGICAL TIME-SERIES; NEURAL VARIABILITY; ENTROPY; MODULATION; NOISE; EEG; MECHANISMS; PREDICTS; MODEL; POWER	Adopting particular decision biases allows organisms to tailor their choices to environmental demands. For example, a liberal response strategy pays off when target detection is crucial, whereas a conservative strategy is optimal for avoiding false alarms. Using conventional time-frequency analysis of human electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, we previously showed that bias setting entails adjustment of evidence accumulation in sensory regions (Kloosterman et al., 2019), but the presumed prefrontal signature of a conservative-to-liberal bias shift has remained elusive. Here, we show that a liberal bias shift is reflected in a more unconstrained neural regime (boosted entropy) in frontal regions that is suited to the detection of unpredictable events. Overall EEG variation, spectral power and event-related potentials could not explain this relationship, highlighting that moment-to-moment neural variability uniquely tracks bias shifts. Neural variability modulation through prefrontal cortex appears instrumental for permitting an organism to adapt its biases to environmental demands.

It is still an open question, however, whether intentional forgetting is an active process based on the inhibition of unwanted memory traces or whether it occurs passively through reduced recruitment of selective rehearsal [1, 2]. Here, we show that intentional control of memory encoding relies on both, enhanced active inhibition and decreased selective rehearsal, and that these two processes can be separated in time and space. We applied representational similarity analysis (RSA [3]) and time-frequency analysis to EEG data during an item-method directed forgetting experiment [4]. We identified neural signatures of both, the intentional suppression and the voluntary upregulation of item-specific representations. Successful active forgetting was associated with a downregulation of item-specific representations in an early time window 500 ms after the instruction. This process was initiated by an increase in oscillatory alpha (8-13 Hz) power, a well-established signature of neural inhibition [5, 6], in occipital brain areas. During a later time window, 1500 ms after the cue, intentional forgetting was associated with reduced employment of active rehearsal processes, as reflected by an attenuated upregulation of item-specific representations as compared to intentionally encoded items. Our data show that active inhibition and selective rehearsal are two separate mechanisms whose consecutive employment allows for a voluntary control of memory formation.

Postictal generalized electroencephalogram (EEG) suppression (PGES) is a period of suppressed brain activity often occurring after generalized tonic-clonic seizure, a most significant risk factor for SUDEP. Therefore, PGES has been considered as a potential biomarker for SUDEP risk. Automatic PGES detection tools can address the limitations of labor-intensive, and sometimes inconsistent, visual analysis. A successful approach to automatic PGES detection must overcome computational challenges involved in the detection of subtle amplitude changes in EEG recordings, which may contain physiological and acquisition artifacts. Objective: This study aimed to present a random forest approach for automatic PGES detection using multichannel human EEG recordings acquired in epilepsy monitoring units. Methods: We used a combination of temporal, frequency, wavelet, and interchannel correlation features derived from EEG signals to train a random forest classifier. We also constructed and applied confidence-based correction rules based on PGES state changes. Motivated by practical utility, we introduced a new, time distance-based evaluation method for assessing the performance of PGES detection algorithms. Results: The time distance-based evaluation showed that our approach achieved a 5-second tolerance-based positive prediction rate of 0.95 for artifact-free signals. For signals with different artifact levels, our prediction rates varied from 0.68 to 0.81. Conclusions: We introduced a feature-based, random forest approach for automatic PGES detection using multichannel EEG recordings. Our approach achieved increasingly better time distance-based performance with reduced signal artifact levels. Further study is needed for PGES detection algorithms to perform well irrespective of the levels of signal artifacts.

Participants saw an image of a product (the target in a visual metaphorical relationship), and then made a same-different judgment in response to a second image (the source in a visual metaphorical relationship) which was (in)congruous to the first image in terms of shape and/or function. We collected behavioral (button-press reaction time and accuracy), and neural (N270, delta and theta band activity) measures. The time-frequency analysis showed faster processing of incongruous visual information. Moreover, shape and conceptual incongruity were associated with increased N270 amplitude as well as delta (1-3 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) band power. Noticeably, compared with conceptual incongruity, shape incongruity evoked a larger N270 amplitude and stronger delta and theta band oscillation. In addition, the average topographical analysis revealed a frontal and central distribution of the power activity. The analysis of attitudes towards the advertising metaphor pictures also proved the supportive role played by incongruity. In conclusion, incongruity facilitates target-source matching in pictorial metaphors of Chinese advertising. The findings obtained from the study are important to metaphor designs of advertising pictures.

To overcome such disadvantages, numerous seizure detection techniques involving signal processing and machine learning tools have been developed. However, there still remain the problems of automatic detection with high efficiency and accuracy in distinguishing normal, interictal and ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this study we propose a novel method for automatic identification of epileptic seizures in singe-channel EEG signals based upon time-scale decomposition (ITD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks. First, EEG signals are decomposed into a series of proper rotation components (PRCs) and a baseline signal by using the ITD method. The first two PRCs of the EEG signals are extracted, which contain most of the EEG signals' energy and are considered to be the predominant PRCs. Second, four levels DWT is employed to decompose the predominant PRCs into different frequency bands, in which third-order Daubechies (db3) wavelet function is selected for analysis. Third, phase space of the PRCs is reconstructed based on db3, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear EEG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in EEG system dynamics between normal, interictal and ictal EEG signals. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify EEG system dynamics between normal (healthy), interictal and ictal EEG signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on the University of Bonn's widely used and publicly available epilepsy dataset to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy for eleven cases is reported to be 98.15%. Compared with many state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic detection of seizure EEG signals in the clinical application.

Frequency decomposition and phase synchronization of the visual evoked potential using the empirical mode decomposition	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK			English	Article						electroencephalogram; empirical mode decomposition; phase synchronization; visual evoked potential	COMPONENT	Objectives: The phase characteristics of the representative frequency components of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be a means of understanding the brain functions of human senses and perception. In this paper, we found out that visual evoked potential (VEP) is composed of the dominant multi-band component signals of the EEG through the experiment. Methods: We analyzed the characteristics of VEP based on the theory that brain evoked potentials can be decomposed into phase synchronized signals. In order to decompose the EEG signal into across each frequency component signals, we extracted the signals in the time-frequency domain with high resolution using the empirical mode decomposition method. We applied the Hilbert transform (HT) to extract the signal and synthesized it into a frequency band signal representing VEP components. VEP could be decomposed into phase synchronized delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency signals. We investigated the features of visual brain function by analyzing the amplitude and latency of the decomposed signals in phase synchronized with the VEP and the phase-locking value (PLV) between brain regions. Results: In response to visual stimulation, PLV values were higher in the posterior lobe region than in the anterior lobe. In the occipital region, the PLV value of theta band was observed high. Conclusions: The VEP signals decomposed into constituent frequency components through phase analysis can be used as a method of analyzing the relationship between activated signals and brain function related to visual stimuli.

Detecting and analyzing the wave forms of spindles as well as determining the areas and durations of sleep spindles are quite important to understand the sleeping process thoroughly. However, the fact that spindles have temporary regime features and lower amplitudes compared to the background EEG signals makes resolving and distinguishing between them difficult. Although there have been extensive research on the decomposition of EEG signals and about the general characteristics of the spindles, the existing studies do not decompose the components in a dynamic fashion. This study takes this argument as its starting point and comes up with a methodology to detect the spindles in the sleep EEG. In particular, this study separates EEG signals into trend and cycle components via frequency analysis, where the methodology allows for system parameters and the components to be estimated simultaneously. Since the methodology allows for the parameters to vary over time, observing the time patterns of the estimated parameters have the potential to reveal further information about the sleep process.

Although data-driven machine learning (ML) approach has shown promise in MWL recognition, there is still difficulty in acquiring a sufficient number of labeled data to train the ML models. This paper proposes a semi-supervised extreme learning machine (SS-ELM) algorithm for MWL pattern classification requiring only a small number of labeled data. The measured data analysis results show that the proposed SS-ELM paradigm can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of MWL classification and thus provide a competitive ML approach to utilizing a large number of unlabeled data which are available in many real-world applications.

Behavioral studies show that FE recognition ability decreases with aging. Studying how event-related brain oscillations change with normal aging is important to better understand the underlying mechanisms of emotional processes. The aim of this study is to investigate changes in FE recognition due to normal aging using the EEG-Brain Oscillations approach. Fifteen young and fifteen elderly healthy subjects were included in the study. 15 photographs were used with 5 different FEs (angry, happy, neutral, sad, fearful). After each EEG recording session, subjects were asked to identify the FEs that were presented. Event-related delta, theta and, alpha phase-locking and frequency-band responses were analyzed. In the FE recognition part of the study, young subjects obtained better scores than the elderly subjects. There was a significant result regarding the locationXgroup comparison in the delta response; the young group had a higher delta response than the elderly group over the occipital area. There were significant locationXgroup differences in the theta and alpha phase locking values; the elderly group had higher theta and alpha phase locking values than the young group in the frontal area. Group differences were significant in the theta response and theta phase locking; the elderly individuals' theta response and phase locking values were higher compared to those of the young individuals. In elderly individuals, FE recognition impairment has been observed. It has been shown that the impairment may be characterized by decreased occipital delta responses and phase locking. This can be interpreted to mean that elderly individuals may have developed different brain dynamics as a compensating mechanism since they are not as efficient as young individuals in performing these functions.

In this study, we used multivariate pattern analysis in electrophysiology data to investigate the effects of covert spatial attention on the quality of stimulus processing and its underlying mechanisms. Our results show that covert spatial attention led to (i) an anticipatory alpha power desynchronization; (ii) enhanced stimuli identity information. Moreover, we found that alpha power fluctuations in anticipation of the relevant stimuli boosted and prolonged the coding of stimulus identity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Alpha- and theta-band oscillations have been linked to the inhibition of anticipated and attentionally avoidable distractors. However, the neurophysiological background of the rejection of task-irrelevant stimuli appearing in the focus of attention is not fully understood. We aimed to examine whether theta and alpha-band oscillations serve as an indicator of successful distractor rejection. Twenty-four students were enrolled in the study. 64-channel EEG was recorded during a modified Sternberg working memory task where weak and strong (salient) distractors were presented during the retention period. Event-related spectral perturbation in the alpha frequency band was significantly modulated by the saliency of the distracting stimuli, while theta oscillation was modulated by the need for cognitive control. Moreover, stronger alpha desynchronization to strong relative to weak distracting stimuli significantly increased the probability of mistakenly identifying the presented distractor as a member of the memory sequence. Therefore, our results suggest that alpha activity reflects the vulnerability of attention to distracting salient stimuli.

For instance, in the context of epilepsy research, a number of different electrophysiological patterns have been associated with epileptogenic activity. Motivated by the need to define automated seizure focus detectors, we propose a novel data-driven algorithm for the spatial identification of localized events that is based on the following rationale: the distribution of emerging oscillations during confined events across all recording sites is highly non-uniform and can be mapped using a spatial entropy function. By applying this principle to EEG recording obtained from 67 distinct seizure epochs, our method successfully identified the seizure focus on a group of ten drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients (average sensitivity: 0.94, average specificity: 0.90) together with its characteristic electrophysiological pattern signature. Cross-validation of the method outputs with postresective information revealed the consistency of our findings in long follow-up seizure-free patients. Overall, our methodology provides a reliable computational procedure that might be used as in both experimental and clinical domains to identify the neural populations undergoing an emerging functional or pathological transition.

Spectral fingerprints of correct vestibular discrimination of the intensity of accelerations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Vestibular stimulation; Vestibular perception; Vestibular evoked potentials; Inter trial phase clustering (ITPC); Inter site phase clustering (ISPC); Decision-making; Theta oscillations; Sensation perception transition; Cluster-based permutation test	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INTRAPARIETAL AREA; DECISION; NEURONS; BRAIN; EEG; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Perceptual decision-making is a complex task that requires multiple processing steps performed by spatially distinct brain regions interacting in order to optimize perception and motor response. Most of our knowledge on these processes and interactions were derived from unimodal stimulations of the visual system which identified the lateral intraparietal area and the posterior parietal cortex as critical regions. Unlike the visual system, the vestibular system has no primary cortical areas and it is associated with separate multisensory areas within the temporo-parietal cortex with the parieto-insular vestibular cortex, PIVC, being the core region. The aim of the presented experiment was to investigate the transition from sensation to perception and to reveal the main structures of the cortical vestibular system involved in perceptual decision-making. Therefore, an EEG analysis was performed in 35 healthy subjects during linear whole-body accelerations of different intensities on a motordriven motion platform (hexapod). We used a discrimination task in order to judge the intensity of the accelerations. Furthermore, we manipulated the expectation of the upcoming stimulus by indicating the probability (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) of the motion direction. The analysis of the vestibular evoked potentials (VestEPs) showed that the decision-making process leads to a second positive peak (P2b) which was not observed in previous task-free experiments. The comparison of the estimated neural generators of the P2a and P2b components showed significant activity differences in the anterior cingulus, the parahippocampal and the middle temporal gyri. Taking into account the time courses of the P2 components, the physical properties of the stimuli, and the responses given by the subjects we conclude that the P2b likely reflects the transition from the processing of sensory information to perceptual evaluation. Analyzing the decision-uncertainty reported by the subjects, a persistent divergence of the time courses starting at 188 ms after the acceleration was found at electrode Pz. This finding demonstrated that meta-cognition by means of confidence estimation starts in parallel with the decision-making process itself. Further analyses in the time-frequency domain revealed that a correct classification of acceleration intensities correlated with an inter-trial phase clustering at electrode Cz and an inter-site phase clustering of theta oscillations over frontal, central, and parietal cortical areas. The sites where the phase clustering was observed corresponded to core decision-making brain areas known from neuroimaging studies in the visual domain.	[Ertl, M.; Klaus, M.; Mast, F.

This process allows the brain to obtain meaning, e.g., about sentiment, or the emotional valence, expressed in the written text. How exactly the brain extracts the sentiment of single words during naturalistic reading is largely unknown. This is due to the challenges of naturalistic imaging, which has previously led researchers to employ highly controlled, timed word-by-word presentations of custom reading materials that lack ecological validity. Here, we aimed to assess the electrical neural correlates of word sentiment processing during naturalistic reading of English sentences. We used a publicly available dataset of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking recordings, and word-level semantic annotations from 7129 words in 400 sentences (Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus; Hollenstein et al., 2018). We computed fixation-related potentials (FRPs), which are evoked electrical responses time-locked to the onset of fixations. A general linear mixed model analysis of FRPs cleaned from visual-and motor-evoked activity showed a topographical difference between the positive and negative sentiment condition in the 224-304 ms interval after fixation onset in left-central and right-posterior electrode clusters. An additional analysis that included word-, phrase-, and sentence-level sentiment predictors showed the same FRP differences for the word-level sentiment, but no additional FRP differences for phrase-and sentence-level sentiment. Furthermore, decoding analysis that classified word sentiment (positive or negative) from sentiment-matched 40-trial average FRPs showed a 0.60 average accuracy (95% confidence interval: [0.58, 0.61]). Control analyses ruled out that these results were based on differences in eye movements or linguistic features other than word sentiment. Our results extend previous research by showing that the emotional valence of lexico-semantic stimuli evoke a fast electrical neural response upon word fixation during naturalistic reading. These results provide an important step to identify the neural processes of lexico-semantic processing in ecologically valid conditions and can serve to improve computer algorithms for natural language processing.

In particular, the alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz), known to be modulated during attention, has previously been considered as candidate biomarker for ADHD. In the present study, we asked adult ADHD patients to self-regulate their own alpha rhythm using neurofeedback (NFB), in order to examine the modulation of alpha oscillations on attentional performance and brain plasticity. Twenty-five adult ADHD patients and 22 healthy controls underwent a 64-channel EEG-recording at resting-state and during a Go/NoGo task, before and after a 30 min-NFB session designed to reduce (desynchronize) the power of the alpha rhythm. Alpha power was compared across conditions and groups, and the effects of NFB were statistically assessed by comparing behavioral and EEG measures pre-to-post NFB. Firstly, we found that relative alpha power was attenuated in our ADHD cohort compared to control subjects at baseline and across experimental conditions, suggesting a signature of cortical hyper-activation. Both groups demonstrated a significant and targeted reduction of alpha power during NFB. Interestingly, we observed a post-NFB increase in resting-state alpha (i.e. rebound) in the ADHD group, which restored alpha power towards levels of the normal population. Importantly, the degree of post-NFB alpha normalization during the Go/NoGo task correlated with individual improvements in motor inhibition (i.e. reduced commission errors) only in the ADHD group. Overall, our findings offer novel supporting evidence implicating alpha oscillations in inhibitory control, as well as their potential role in the homeostatic regulation of cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance.

In human studies, preparation and cancellation of movements are accompanied by changes in the a-frequency band (15-29 Hz) of electroencephalogram (EEG). Previous studies with human participants performing stop signal (countermanding) tasks have described reduced frequency of transient a-bursts over sensorimotor cortical areas before movement initiation and increased a-bursting over medial frontal areas with movement cancellation. This modulation has been interpreted as contributing to the trial-by trial control of behavior. We performed identical analyses of EEG recorded over the frontal lobe of macaque monkeys (one male, one female) performing a saccade countermanding task. While we replicate the occurrence and modulation of a-bursts associated with initiation and cancellation of saccades, we found that a-bursts occur too infrequently to account for the observed stopping behavior. We also found a-bursts were more common after errors, but their incidence was unrelated to response time (RT) adaptation. These results demonstrate the homology of this EEG signature between humans and macaques but raise questions about the current interpretation of a band functional significance.

The epileptogenic activity is also known to be suppressed by cognitive processing. However, differences between epileptic and healthy brain behavior during rest and task were not studied in detail. In this study we investigate the impact of cognitive processing on epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic hippocampus and the intracranial EEG features representing the underlying electrophysiological processes. We investigated intracranial EEG in 24 epileptic and 24 non-epileptic hippocampi in patients with intractable focal epilepsy during a resting state period and during performance of various cognitive tasks. We evaluated the behavior of features derived from high frequency oscillations, interictal epileptiform discharges and functional connectivity and their changes in relation to cognitive processing. Subsequently, we performed an analysis whether cognitive processing can contribute to classification of epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampus using a machine learning approach. The results show that cognitive processing suppresses epileptogenic activity in epileptic hippocampus while it causes a shift toward higher frequencies in non-epileptic hippocampus. Statistical analysis reveals significantly different electrophysiological reactions of epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampus during cognitive processing, which can be measured by high frequency oscillations, interictal epileptiform discharges and functional connectivity. The calculated features showed high classification potential for epileptic hippocampus (AUC = 0.93). In conclusion, the differences between epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampus during cognitive processing bring new insight in delineation between pathological and physiological processes. Analysis of computed iEEG features in rest and task condition can improve the functional mapping during pre-surgical evaluation and provide additional guidance for distinguishing between epileptic and non-epileptic structure which is absolutely crucial for achieving the best possible outcome with as little side effects as possible.

However, the risk for adverse events increases considerably in long interventions, emergencies and patients with certain comorbidities. To this day, there is no objective device to monitor sedation depth. Brain monitors have been developed for general anesthesia. These devices are based on an automatic analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Studies to utilize brain monitors from anesthesia in conscious sedation during endoscopy did not show any benefit. This article provides a review of EEG-based monitoring of sedation depth in conscious sedation with classic methods and neural networks. Special characteristics of time series analysis and corresponding network architectures are discussed.

However, due to the spared colliculo-extrastriate pathway, they might retain the ability to implicitly process motion stimuli through the activation of spared dorsal-extrastriate areas, despite the absence of awareness. To test this hypothesis, Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from a group of hemianopic patients without blindsight (i.e., who performed at chance in different forced-choice tasks), while motion stimuli, static stimuli or no stimuli (i.e., blank condition) were presented either in their intact or in their blind visual field. EEG analyses were performed in the time-frequency domain. The presentation of both motion and static stimuli in the intact field induced synchronization in the theta band and desynchronization both in the alpha and the beta band. In contrast, for stimuli presented in the blind field, significantly greater desynchronization in the alpha range was observed only after the presentation of motion stimuli, compared to the blank condition, over posterior parietal-occipital electrodes in the lesioned hemisphere, at a late time window (500-800 msec). No alpha desynchronization was elicited by static stimuli. These results show that hemianopic patients can process only visual signals relying on the activation of the dorsal pathway (i.e., motion stimuli) in the absence of awareness and suggest different patterns of electro-physiological activity for conscious and unconscious visual processing. Specifically, visual processing in the absence of awareness elicits an activity limited to the alpha range, most likely reflecting a "local" process, occurring within the extrastriate areas and not participating in inter-areal communication. This also suggests a response specificity in this frequency band for implicit visual processing. In contrast, visual awareness evokes changes in different frequency bands, suggesting a "global" process, accomplished by activity in a wide range of frequencies, probably within and across cortical areas.

The key motivation is that IMF's allow the computation of meaningful Hilbert transforms of non-stationary data, from which instantaneous time-frequency representations may be derived. Our spatiotemporal intrinsic mode decomposition (STIMD) method leverages spatial correlations to generalize the extraction of IMF's from one-dimensional signals, commonly performed using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), to multi-dimensional signals. Further, this data-driven method enables future-state prediction. We demonstrate STIMD on several synthetic examples, comparing it to common matrix factorization techniques, namely singular value decomposition (SVD), independent component analysis (ICA), and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). We show that STIMD outperforms these methods at reconstruction and extracting interpretable modes. Next, we apply STIMD to analyze two real-world datasets, gravitational wave data and neural recordings from the rodent hippocampus. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods:47 non-demented patients with PD were examined and re-examined after 3 years. At both time-points, the patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological assessment and EEG in eyes-closed resting-state condition. The results of cognitive tests were normalized and individually summarized to obtain a "global cognitive score" (GCS). Change of GCS was used to represent cognitive changes over time. GRMPT and SAILR was used for further analysis. Linear regression models were calculated. Results:GRMPT and SAILR independently predicted cognitive change. Combination of GRMPT and SAILR improved the significance of the regression model as compared to using each of these measures alone. GRMPT and SAILR only slightly correlate between each other. Conclusion:The combination of axial signs and rigidity with quantitative EEG improves early identification of patients with PD prone to severe cognitive decline. GRMPT and SAILR seem to reflect different disease mechanisms. SignificanceCombination of EEG and axial motor impairment assessment may be a valuable marker in the cognitive prognosis of PD.

Nonhuman primate findings have shown that decision-making implicates modulations in unit firing rates and local field potentials (LFPs) across frontal and parietal cortices. Yet the electrophysiological brain mechanisms that underlie free choice in humans remain ill defined. Here, we address this question using rare intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in surgical epilepsy patients performing a delayed oculomotor decision task. We find that the temporal dynamics of high-gamma (HG, 60-140 Hz) neural activity in distinct frontal and parietal brain areas robustly discriminate free choice from instructed saccade planning at the level of single trials. Classification analysis was applied to the LFP signals to isolate decision-related activity from sensory and motor planning processes. Compared with instructed saccades, free-choice trials exhibited delayed and longer-lasting HG activity during the delay period. The temporal dynamics of the decision-specific sustained HG activity indexed the unfolding of a deliberation process, rather than memory maintenance. Taken together, these findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence in humans for the role of sustained high-frequency neural activation in frontoparietal cortex in mediating the intrinsically driven process of freely choosing among competing behavioral alternatives.

Seizure burden fluctuates with the female reproductive cycle in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Convolutional neural network; EEG; Epilepsy; Estrous cycle; Hippocampus; Kainic acid	HORMONE-RELEASING HORMONE; KAINIC ACID MODEL; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; ESTROUS-CYCLE; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; STEROID-HORMONES; BINDING-SITES; ESTRUS CYCLE; RAT; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Women with catamenial epilepsy often experience increased seizure burden near the time of ovulation (periovulatory) or menstruation (perimenstrual). To date, a rodent model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that exhibits similar endogenous fluctuations in seizures has not been identified. Here, we investigated whether seizure burden changes with the estrous cycle in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE. Adult female IHKA mice and saline-injected controls were implanted with EEG electrodes in the ipsilateral hippocampus. At one and two months post-injection, 24/7 video-EEG recordings were collected and estrous cycle stage was assessed daily. Seizures were detected using a custom convolutional neural network machine learning process. Seizure burden was compared within each mouse between diestrus and combined proestrus and estrus days (pro/estrus) at two months post-injection. IHKA mice showed higher seizure burden on pro/ estrus compared with diestrus, characterized by increased time in seizures and longer seizure duration. When all IHKA mice were included, no group differences were observed in seizure frequency or EEG power. However, increased baseline seizure burden on diestrus was correlated with larger cycle-associated differences, and when analyses were restricted to mice that showed the severe epilepsy typical of the IHKA model, increased seizure frequency on pro/estrus was also revealed. Controls showed no differences in EEG parameters with cycle stage. These results suggest that the stages of proestrus and estrus are associated with higher seizure burden in IHKA mice. The IHKA model may thus recapitulate at least some aspects of reproductive cycle-associated seizure clustering.

Here we manipulated the need for interhemispheric integration using a novel multiple object tracking (MOT) task in which stimuli either moved between the two visual hemifields, requiring interhemispheric integration, or moved within separate visual hemifields. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure interhemispheric coherence during the task. Human observers (21 women; 20 men) were poorer at tracking objects between versus within hemifields. reflecting a cost of interhemispheric integration. Critically, gamma coherence was greater in trials requiring interhemispheric integration, particularly between sensors over parieto-occipital areas. In approximately half of the participants. the observed cost of integration was associated with a failure of the cerebral hemispheres to become coherent in the gamma band. Moreover, individual differences in this integration cost correlated with endogenous gamma coherence at these same sensors, although with generally opposing relationships for the real and imaginary part of coherence. The real part (capturing synchronization with a near-zero phase lag) benefited between-hemifield tracking; imaginary coherence was detrimental. Finally, instantaneous phase coherence over the tracking period uniquely predicted between-hemifield tracking performance, suggesting that effective integration benefits from sustained interhemispheric synchronization. Our results show that gamma coherence mediates interhemispheric integration during MOT and add to a growing body of work demonstrating that coherence drives communication across cortically distributed neural networks. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using a multiple object tracking paradigm, we were able to manipulate the need for interhemispheric integration on a per-trial basis, while also having an objective measure of integration efficacy (i.e.. tracking performance). We show that tracking performance reflects a cost of integration, which correlates with individual differences in interhemispheric EEG coherence. Gamma coherence appears to uniquely benefit between-hemifield tracking, predicting performance both across participants and across trials.

These oscillations also provide inhibitory connections to neural circuits that perform lower-level processes. Deficit in the performance of these oscillations has been examined as a marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD, such as the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques, do not occur in a spatially homogeneous fashion and progress more prominently in the medial temporal lobe in the early stages of the disease. This region of the brain contains neural circuitry involved in olfactory perception. Several studies have suggested that olfactory deficit can be used as a marker for early diagnosis of AD. A quantitative assessment of the performance of the olfactory system can hence serve as a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, offering a relatively convenient and inexpensive diagnosis method. This study examines the decline in the perception of olfactory stimuli and the deficit in the performance of high-frequency frontal oscillations in response to olfactory stimulation as markers for AD. Two measurement modalities are employed for assessing the olfactory performance: 1) An interactive smell identification test is used to sample the response to a sizable variety of odorants, and 2) Electroencephalography data are collected in an olfactory perception task with a pair of selected odorants in order to assess the connectivity of frontal cortex regions. Statistical analysis methods are used to assess the significance of selected features extracted from the recorded modalities as Alzheimer's biomarkers. Olfactory decline regressed to age in both healthy and mild AD groups are evaluated, and single- and multi-modal classifiers are also developed. The novel aspects of this study include: 1) Combining EEG response to olfactory stimulation with behavioral assessment of olfactory perception as a marker of AD, 2) Identification of odorants most significantly affected in mild AD patients, 3) Identification of odorants which are still adequately perceived by mild AD patients, 4) Analysis of the decline in the spatial coherence of different oscillatory bands in response to olfactory stimulation, and 5) Being the first study to quantitatively assess the performance of olfactory decline due to aging and AD in the Iranian population.

A novel, robust deep wavelet sparse autoencoder (DWSAE) method is presented and validated for fully automated EOG artifact removal. DWSAE takes advantage of wavelet transform and sparse autoencoder to become a universal EOG artifact corrector. After being trained without supervision, the sparse autoencoder performs EOG correction on time-frequency coefficients collected after brain wave signal wavelet decomposition. Corrected coefficients are then used for wavelet reconstruction of uncontaminated EEG signals. DWSAE is compared with five other methods: second-order blind identification, information maximization, joint approximation diagonalization of eigen-matrices, wavelet neural network (WNN) and wavelet thresholding (WT). Experimental results on a visual attention task dataset, a mental state recognition dataset and a semi-simulated contaminated EEG dataset show that DWSAE is capable of suppressing EOG artifacts effectively, while preserving the nature of background EEG signals. The mean square error of signals before and after correction by DWSAE on a semi-simulated contaminated EEG segment of 30 s is the lowest (65.62) when compared to the results produced by WNN and WT. DWSAE addresses limitations posed by these methods in three ways. First, DWSAE can be performed automatically and online in a single channel of EEG data; this has advantages over independent component analysis-based methods. Second, its results are robust and stable in comparison with those of other wavelet-based methods. Third, as an unsupervised learning scheme, DWSAE does not require the off-line training that is necessary for WNN and other supervised learning machine learning-based methods.

High-voltage, diffuse delta rhythms coincide with wakeful consciousness and complexity in Angelman syndrome	NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS			English	Article						disorders of consciousness; neurology; sleep and dreaming; states of consciousness; theories and models	LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTEGRATED INFORMATION; IMPAIRED CONSCIOUSNESS; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; SPECTRAL EEG; SLOW WAVES; SLEEP	Abundant evidence from slow wave sleep, anesthesia, coma, and epileptic seizures links high-voltage, slow electroencephalogram (EEG) activity to loss of consciousness. This well-established correlation is challenged by the observation that children with Angelman syndrome (AS), while fully awake and displaying volitional behavior, display a hypersynchronous delta (1-4 Hz) frequency EEG phenotype typical of unconsciousness. Because the trough of the delta oscillation is associated with down-states in which cortical neurons are silenced, the presence of volitional behavior and wakefulness in AS amidst diffuse delta rhythms presents a paradox. Moreover, high-voltage, slow EEG activity is generally assumed to lack complexity, yet many theories view functional brain complexity as necessary for consciousness. Here, we use abnormal cortical dynamics in AS to assess whether EEG complexity may scale with the relative level of consciousness despite a background of hypersynchronous delta activity. As characterized by multiscale metrics, EEGs from 35 children with AS feature significantly greater complexity during wakefulness compared with sleep, even when comparing the most pathological segments of wakeful EEG to the segments of sleep EEG least likely to contain conscious mentation and when factoring out delta power differences across states. These findings (i) warn against reverse inferring an absence of consciousness solely on the basis of high-amplitude EEG delta oscillations, (ii) corroborate rare observations of preserved consciousness under hypersynchronization in other conditions, (iii) identify biomarkers of consciousness that have been validated under conditions of abnormal cortical dynamics, and (iv) lend credence to theories linking consciousness with complexity.

EEG phase synchronization during semantic unification relates to individual differences in children's vocabulary skill	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						children; EEG; language development; oscillations; phase synchrony; semantic unification	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; NETWORK; MEG; CONNECTIVITY; MEMORY; WORDS; LAG	As we listen to speech, our ability to understand what was said requires us to retrieve and bind together individual word meanings into a coherent discourse representation. This so-called semantic unification is a fundamental cognitive skill, and its development relies on the integration of neural activity throughout widely distributed functional brain networks. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine, for the first time, how these functional brain networks develop in children. Twenty-six children (ages 4-17) listened to well-formed sentences and sentences containing a semantic violation, while EEG was recorded. Children with stronger vocabulary showed N400 effects that were more concentrated to centroparietal electrodes and greater EEG phase synchrony (phase lag index; PLI) between right centroparietal and bilateral frontocentral electrodes in the delta frequency band (1-3 Hz) 1.27-1.53 s after listening to well-formed sentences compared to sentences containing a semantic violation. These effects related specifically to individual differences in receptive vocabulary, perhaps pointing to greater recruitment of functional brain networks important for top-down semantic unification with development. Less skilled children showed greater delta phase synchrony for violation sentences 3.41-3.64 s after critical word onset. This later effect was partly driven by individual differences in nonverbal reasoning, perhaps pointing to non-verbal compensatory processing to extract meaning from speech in children with less developed vocabulary. We suggest that functional brain network communication, as measured by momentary changes in the phase synchrony of EEG oscillations, develops throughout the school years to support language comprehension in different ways depending on children's verbal and nonverbal skill levels.

J	Jonak, K				Jonak, Kamil			Widespread Reductions of Spontaneous Neurophysiological Activity in Leber's Disease-An Application of EEG Source Current Density Reconstruction	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						EEG; LHON; alpha band; gamma band; current-source density	HEREDITARY OPTIC NEUROPATHY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BLIND; SYNCHRONIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PATTERNS; HUMANS; NERVE	Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare, maternally inherited genetic disease caused by a mutation of mitochondrial DNA. Classical descriptions have highlighted structural abnormalities in various parts of patients' optic tracts; however, current studies have proved that changes also affect many cortical and subcortical structures, not only these belonging to the visual system. This study aimed at improving our understanding of neurophysiological impairments in LHON. First of all, we wanted to know if there were any differences between the health control and LHON subjects in the whole-brain source electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. Second, we wanted to investigate the associations between the observed results and some selected aspects of Leber's disease's clinical picture. To meet these goals, 20 LHON patients and 20 age-matched healthy control (HC) subjects were examined. To investigate the electrophysiological differences between the HC and LHON groups, a quantitative analysis of the whole-brain current source density was performed. The signal analysis method was based on scalp EEG data and an inverse solution method called low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). In comparison with the healthy subjects, LHON participants showed significantly decreased neuronal activity in the alpha and gamma bands; more specifically, in the alpha band, the decrease was mainly found in the occipital lobes and secondary visual cortex, whereas, in the gamma band, the reduced activity occurred in multiple cortical areas. Additionally, a correlation was found between the alpha band activity of the right secondary visual cortex and the averaged thickness of the right retinal nerve fiber layer in the LHON participants. Our study suggests that LHON is associated with widespread cortical de-activation, rather than simply abnormalities of structures constituting the visual system.

Human studies of episodic memory, however, have provided mixed evidence for theta's role in successful learning and remembering. Re-evaluating these conflicting findings leads us to conclude that: (i) successful memory is associated both with increased narrow-band theta oscillations and a broad-band tilt of the power spectrum; (ii) theta oscillations specifically support associative memory, whereas the spectral tilt reflects a general index of activation; and (iii) different cognitive contrasts (generalized versus specific to memory), recording techniques (invasive versus noninvasive), and referencing schemes (local versus global) alter the balance between the two phenomena to make one or the other more easily detectable.

The development of high-resolution, immersive virtual reality technologies has opened exciting new possibilities for gathering data on human wayfinding that could not otherwise be readily obtained. We developed a research platform using a virtual environment and electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the neural processes associated with landmark usage and recognition during urban navigation tasks. By adjusting the architectural parameters of different buildings in this virtual environment, we isolated and tested specific design features to determine whether or not they served as a target for landmarking. EEG theta band (4-7 Hz) event-related synchronization/desynchronization over posterior scalp areas was evaluated at the time when participants observed each target building along a predetermined self-paced route. A multi-level linear model was used to investigate the effects of salient architectural features on posterior scalp areas. Our results support the conclusion that highly salient architectural features-those that contrast sharply with the surrounding environment-are more likely to attract visual attention, remain in short-term memory, and activate brain regions associated with wayfinding compared with non-salient buildings. After establishing this main aggregate effect, we evaluated specific salient architectural features and neural correlates of navigation processing. The buildings that most strongly associated extended gaze time, location recall accuracy, and changes in theta-band neural patterns with landmarking in our study were those that incorporated rotational twist designs and natural elements such as trees and gardens. Other building features, such as unusual facade patterns or building heights, were to a lesser extent also associated with landmarking.

SWRs, playing a crucial role in memory consolidation, are oscillatory patterns in the mammalian brain hippocampus seen on an EEG during immobility and sleep. An SWR is composed of large-amplitude sharp waves accompanied by fast field potential oscillations known as ripple rhythms. However, most of the current commercial software for brain wave processing does not provide with an accurate SWR extraction function. Also, so far there are few literatures that fully explore the ripple detection method. Taking a fuller look at the characteristics of ripple events, an improved pipeline is presented to extract SWRs. The utility of detection based on the large-amplitude feature of SWRs will be weakened by another feature, fast oscillation. Therefore, to shield the extraction from that undesired influence, Hilbert transformation is suggested to restore the analytical signal in complex number field and then to obtain the envelope of the original EEG. Next, Gaussian window is adopted to get rid of some artifacts. Then, the central and the start and end segment of an SWR are successively determined with a sliding window. In addition, considering that the determination of the duration of a ripple also changes the frequency content of a detected, truncated ripple by the spectral leakage effect, which makes it hard to find the actual frequency of the rhythm, we add Hanning window to prevent that effect. From three sets of multi-channel in vivo recording EEG data obtained from different genotypes of mice, we detected SWR events with the proposed method, whose effectiveness and accuracy were validated.

Increased Phase Cone Turnover in 80-250 Hz Bands Occurs in the Epileptogenic Zone During Interictal Periods	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG ripple; EEG phase cones; epilepsy and phase cones; high-frequency brain signals; cortical phase transitions; phase clusters	SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SYNCHRONIZATION PATTERNS; STATE TRANSITIONS; EPILEPTIC SITES; GAMMA EEGS; SCALP EEG; DYNAMICS; PERCEPTION; FIELDS	We found that phase cone clustering patterns in EEG ripple bands demonstrate an increased turnover rate in epileptogenic zones compared to adjacent regions. We employed 256 channel EEG data collected in four adult subjects with refractory epilepsy. The analysis was performed in the 80-150 and 150-250 Hz ranges. Ictal onsets were documented with intracranial EEG recordings. Interictal scalp recordings, free of epileptiform patterns, of 240-s duration, were selected for analysis for each subject. The data was filtered, and the instantaneous phase was extracted after the Hilbert transformation. Spatiotemporal contour plots of the unwrapped instantaneous phase with 1.0 ms intervals were constructed using a montage layout of the 256 electrode positions. Stable phase cone patterns were selected based on criteria that the sign of spatial gradient did not change for a minimum of three consecutive time samples and the frame velocity was consistent with known propagation velocities of cortical axons. These plots exhibited increased dynamical formation and dissolution of phase cones in the ictal onset zones, compared to surrounding cortical regions, in all four patients. We believe that these findings represent markers of abnormally increased cortical excitability. They are potential tools that may assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) non-invasively provides a polarity-specific electric current to modulate brain excitability. Little is known about the therapeutic potential of tDCS in SE. Here, we aim to determine the tDCS effects on seizure severity, EEG and post-SE consequences in rats with kainic acid (KA)-induced SE. Rats were subjected to cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation over the dorsal hippocampus for 5 days. KA was intraperitoneally injected to induce SE. We used continuous video-EEG recording to monitor seizure activity, immunostaining and Timm staining to evaluate neuron counts and mossy fiber sprouting, and ELISA for Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein measurement. Two featured EEG patterns, gamma ranged high-frequency polyspikes and low-frequency spike-and-wave complexes, were identified in the hippocampal CA1 of KA-induced SE rats. tDCS elicited a significant decrease in severe seizures of Racine stages 4-5 in KA-induced SE rats. tDCS-treated rats manifested diminished high-frequency oscillation during SE, decreased chronic spontaneous spike activities and mossy fiber sproutings compared to sham. tDCS-treated rats also exhibited significantly lower hippocampal BDNF protein levels than sham immediately and 4 weeks after SE. A positive correlation between the hippocampal BDNF level and the seizure severity of SE was found. Altogether, our results show that repeated cathodal tDCS can mitigate seizure severity, alter ictal EEG pattern and reduce the chronic adverse consequences in KA-induced SE rats, supporting the therapeutic potential of tDCS in severe prolonged epileptic seizures.

Acute pharmacological inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity during development restores perineuronal net formation and normalizes auditory processing in Fmr1 KO mice	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						electroencephalography; fragile X syndrome; matrix metalloproteinase-9; parvalbumin; perineuronal nets; sensory hypersensitivity	FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MOUSE MODEL; GENETIC REMOVAL; MINOCYCLINE TREATMENT; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL RESPONSES; NEURONS; AUTISM	Individuals with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit cognitive impairments, social deficits, increased anxiety, and sensory hyperexcitability. Previously, we showed that elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) may contribute to abnormal development of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the developing auditory cortex (AC) of Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice, which likely underlie auditory hypersensitivity. Thus, MMP-9 may serve as a potential target for treatment of auditory hypersensitivity in FXS. Here, we used the MMP-2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, to pharmacologically inhibit MMP-9 activity during a specific developmental period and to test whether inhibition of MMP-9 activity reverses neural oscillation deficits and behavioral impairments by enhancing PNN formation around PV cells in Fmr1 KO mice. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure resting state and sound-evoked electrocortical activity in auditory and frontal cortices of postnatal day (P)22-23 male mice before and one-day after treatment with SB-3CT (25 mg/kg) or vehicle. At P27-28, animal behaviors were tested to measure the effects of the treatment on anxiety and hyperactivity. Results show that acute inhibition of MMP-9 activity improved evoked synchronization to auditory stimuli and ameliorated mouse behavioral deficits. MMP-9 inhibition enhanced PNN formation, increased PV levels and TrkB phosphorylation yet reduced Akt phosphorylation in the AC of Fmr1 KO mice. Our results show that MMP-9 inhibition during early postnatal development is beneficial in reducing some auditory processing deficits in the FXS mouse model and may serve as a candidate therapeutic for reversing sensory hypersensitivity in FXS and possibly other ASDs.

This paper introduces a new multimodal dataset called MERTI-Apps based on Asian physiological signals and proposes a genetic algorithm (GA)-long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model to derive the active feature groups for emotion recognition. This study developed an annotation labeling program for observers to tag the emotions of subjects by their arousal and valence during dataset creation. In the learning phase, a GA was used to select effective LSTM model parameters and determine the active feature group from 37 features and 25 brain lateralization features extracted from the electroencephalogram (EEG) time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. The proposed model achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0156 in terms of the valence regression performance in the MAHNOB-HCI dataset, and RMSE performances of 0.0579 and 0.0287 in terms of valence and arousal regression performance, and 65.7% and 88.3% in terms of valence and arousal accuracy in the in-house MERTI-Apps dataset, which uses Asian-population-specific 12-channel EEG data and adds an additional brain lateralization (BL) feature. The results revealed 91.3% and 94.8% accuracy in the valence and arousal domain in the DEAP dataset owing to the effective model selection of a GA.

However, the performance remains insufficient for real-time decoding owing to the endogenous signal characteristics compared to other BMI paradigms. This study aims to enhance the MRCP decoding performance from the perspective of preprocessing techniques (i.e., spectral filtering). To the best of our knowledge, existing MRCP studies have used spectral filters with a fixed frequency bandwidth for all subjects. Hence, we propose a subject-dependent and section-wise spectral filtering (SSSF) method that considers the subjects' individual MRCP characteristics for two different temporal sections. In this study, MRCP data were acquired under a powered exoskeleton environments in which the subjects conducted self-initiated walking. We evaluated our method using both our experimental data and a public dataset (BNCI Horizon 2020). The decoding performance using the SSSF was 0.86 (+/- 0.09), and the performance on the public dataset was 0.73 (+/- 0.06) across all subjects. The experimental results showed a statistically significant enhancement ( ${p} < {0.01}$ ) compared with the fixed frequency bands used in previous methods on both datasets. In addition, we presented successful decoding results from a pseudo-online analysis. Therefore, we demonstrated that the proposed SSSF method can involve more meaningful MRCP information than conventional methods.

The aim of the present study was to compare the GluN2B negative allosteric modulator (NAM) traxoprodil (CP-101,606) with the unselective NMDA receptor channel blocker S-ketamine to give insight into central target engagement and differentiation on multiple EEG readouts. For qEEG recordings telemetric transmitters were implanted in male Wistar rats. Recorded EEG data were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation to determine power spectra and vigilance states. Additionally, body temperature and locomotor activity were assessed via telemetry. For recordings of auditory event-related potentials (AERP) male C57B1/6J mice were chronically implanted with deep electrodes using a tethered system. Power spectral analysis revealed a significant increase in gamma power following ketamine treatment, whereas traxoprodil (6&18 mg/kg) induced an overall decrease primarily within alpha and beta bands. Additionally, ketamine disrupted sleep and enhanced time spent in wake vigilance states, whereas traxoprodil did not alter sleep-wake architecture. AERP and mismatch negativity (MMN) revealed that ketamine (10 mg/kg) selectively disrupts auditory deviance detection, whereas traxoprodil (6 mg/kg) did not alter MMN at clinically relevant doses. In contrast to ketamine treatment, traxoprodil did not produce hyperactivity and hypothermia. In conclusion, ketamine and traxoprodil showed very different effects on diverse EEG readouts differentiating selective GluN2B antagonism from non-selective pan-NMDA-R antagonists like ketamine. These readouts are thus perfectly suited to support drug discovery efforts on NMDA-R and understanding the different functions of NMDA-R subtypes.

Historically the classification of EEG into physiological, pathological, or artifacts has been performed by expert visual review of the recordings. However, the size of EEG data recordings is rapidly increasing with a trend for higher channel counts, greater sampling frequency, and longer recording duration and complete reliance on visual data review is not sustainable. In this study, we publicly share annotated intracranial EEG data clips from two institutions: Mayo Clinic, MN, USA and St. Anne's University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic. The dataset contains intracranial EEG that are labeled into three groups: physiological activity, pathological/epileptic activity, and artifactual signals. The dataset published here should support and facilitate training of generalized machine learning and digital signal processing methods for intracranial EEG and promote research reproducibility. Along with the data, we also propose a statistical method that is recommended for comparison of candidate classifier performance utilizing out-of-institution/out-of-patient testing.

Previous studies have shown asymmetrical responses in auditory cortical regions following perceived peripheral sound shifts. Moreover, higher-order cortical areas perform inferences on the sources of disparate audiovisual signals. Recent studies have also highlighted top-down influence in the ventriloquist illusion and postulated a governing function of neural oscillations for crossmodal processing. In this EEG study, we analyzed source-reconstructed neural oscillations to address the question of whether perceived sound shifts affect the laterality of auditory responses. Moreover, we investigated the modulation of neural oscillations related to the occurrence of the illusion more generally. With respect to the first question, we did not find evidence for significant changes in the laterality of auditory responses due to perceived sound shifts. However, we found a sustained reduction of mediofrontal theta-band power starting prior to stimulus onset when participants perceived the illusion compared to when they did not perceive the illusion. We suggest that this effect reflects a state of diminished cognitive control, leading to reliance on more readily discriminable visual information and increased crossmodal influence. We conclude that mediofrontal theta-band oscillations serve as a neural mechanism underlying top-down modulation of crossmodal processing in the ventriloquist illusion.

Whilst recent theoretical developments suggest that this is achieved by an interplay between bottom-up and top-down attentional mechanisms, their underlying neural dynamics are still poorly understood. Furthermore, it is still matter of discussion as to whether these attentional mechanisms are truly self-specific or instead driven by face familiarity. To address these questions, we used EEG to record the brain activity of twenty-five healthy participants whilst identifying their own face, a friend's face and a stranger's face. Time-frequency analysis revealed a greater sustained power decrease in the alpha and beta frequency bands for the self-face, which emerged at late latencies and was maintained even when the face was no longer present. Critically, source analysis showed that this activity was generated in key brain regions for self-face recognition, such as the fusiform gyrus. As in the Myth of Narcissus, our results indicate that one's own face might have the potential to hijack attention. We suggest that this effect is specific to the self and driven by a top-down attentional control mechanism, which might facilitate further processing of personally relevant events.

However, data are limited regarding the brain activation during resting state in these children. The current study aims to investigate the brain oscillation at rest in children orphaned by HIV/AIDS using resting-state EEG data. Data were derived from a larger neurodevelopmental study in which 90 children aged 9-17 years orphaned by AIDS and 66 matched controls were recruited through the local communities and school system. Children (63 orphans and 65 controls) who had resting-state EEG data and completed the Teacher-Child Rating Scale (T-CRS) were included in the current analysis. EEG results showed that children orphaned by HIV/AIDS had increased theta activity in the midline region, decreased beta activity in left hemisphere and overall increased theta/beta power ratio. Furthermore, the theta/beta ratio is positively correlated with learning problem and acting out scores, and negatively correlated with task orientation and peer social skill activities. Findings support that children orphaned by HIV/AIDS demonstrate different brain activity compared to non-orphan controls and also suggest that the EEG activities in resting state may serve as useful indicators of children's behavioral problems.

Nevertheless, both roughly recruit the same brain areas (spatially overlapping networks in the parietal cortex) and happen at the same time (roughly 250 msec poststimulus onset). We tested the hypothesis that symbolic and nonsymbolic processing are segregated by means of functionally relevant networks in different frequency ranges: high gamma (above 50 Hz) for symbolic processing and lower beta (12-17 Hz) for nonsymbolic processing. EEG signals were quantified as participants compared either symbolic numbers or nonsymbolic quantities. Larger EEG gamma-band power was observed for more difficult symbolic comparisons (ratio of 0.8 between the two numbers) than for easier comparisons (ratio of 0.2) over frontocentral regions. Similarly, beta-band power was larger for more difficult nonsymbolic comparisons than for easier ones over parietal areas. These results confirm the existence of a functional dissociation in EEG oscillatory dynamics during numerical processing that is compatible with the notion of distinct linguistic processing of symbolic numbers and approximation of nonsymbolic numerical information.

Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) are among the reliable neurophysiological tools to investigate patients with neuropathic pain, as they can provide an objective account of the functional status of thermo-nociceptive pathways. The goal of this study was to explore the functioning of the nociceptive afferent pathways by examining LEPs in patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (cWAD), patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and healthy controls (HCs). Design. Case-control study. Setting. A single medical center in Belgium. Subjects. The LEPs of 21 patients with cWAD, 19 patients with CFS, and 18 HCs were analyzed in this study. Methods. All participants received brief nociceptive CO2 laser stimuli applied to the dorsum of the left hand and left foot while brain activity was recorded with a 32-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). LEP signals and transient power modulations were compared between patient groups and HCs. Results. No between-group differences were found for stimulus intensity, which was supraliminal for A delta fibers. The amplitudes and latencies of LEP wave components N1, N2, and P2 in patients with cWAD and CFS were statistically similar to those of HCs. There were no significant differences between the time-frequency maps of EEG oscillation amplitude between HCs and both patient populations. Conclusions. EEG responses of heat-sensitive A delta fibers in patients with cWAD and CFS revealed no significant differences from the responses of HCs. These findings thus do not support a state of generalized central nervous system hyperexcitability in those patients.

Our aim was to evaluate alpha and beta activity during guitar playing. Materials and Method Twenty healthy right-handed people participated in this study. Cortical activity was measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) during rest and 4 tasks (1: easy music with an auditory stimulus; 2: easy music with an audiovisual stimulus; 3: complex music with an auditory stimulus; 4: complex music with an audiovisual stimulus). The peak frequency (PF), median frequency (MF) and root mean square (RMS) of alpha and beta EEG signals were assessed. Results A higher alpha PF at the T3-P3 was observed, and this difference was higher between rest and task 3, rest and task 4, tasks 1 and 3, and tasks 1 and 4. For beta waves, a higher PF was observed at C4-P4 and a higher RMS at C3-C4 and O1-O2. At C4-P4, differences between rest and tasks 2 and 4 were observed. The RMS of beta waves at C3-C4 presented differences between rest and task 3 and at O1-O2 between rest and task 2 and 4. Conclusion The action observation of audiovisual stimuli while playing guitar can increase beta wave activity in the somatosensory and motor cortexes; and increase in the alpha activity in the somatosensory and auditory cortexes and increase in the beta activity in the bilateral visual cortexes during complex music execution, regardless of the stimulus type received.

FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						state space models; multilayer networks; high-dimensional time series model; transcranial direct current stimulation; dynamic graphical model	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; INTERHEMISPHERIC INHIBITION; GRAPHICAL MODELS; EEG DATA; CONNECTIVITY; EXCITABILITY; PERCEPTION; STROKE	Sparse time series models have shown promise in estimating contemporaneous and ongoing brain connectivity. This paper was motivated by a neuroscience experiment using EEG signals as the outcome of our established interventional protocol, a new method in neurorehabilitation toward developing a treatment for visual verticality disorder in post-stroke patients. To analyze the [complex outcome measure (EEG)] that reflects neural-network functioning and processing in more specific ways regarding traditional analyses, we make a comparison among sparse time series models (classic VAR, GLASSO, TSCGM, and TSCGM-modified with non-linear and iterative optimizations) combined with a graphical approach, such as a Dynamic Chain Graph Model (DCGM). These dynamic graphical models were useful in assessing the role of estimating the brain network structure and describing its causal relationship. In addition, the class of DCGM was able to visualize and compare experimental conditions and brain frequency domains [using finite impulse response (FIR) filter]. Moreover, using multilayer networks, the results corroborate with the susceptibility of sparse dynamic models, bypassing the false positives problem in estimation algorithms. We conclude that applying sparse dynamic models to EEG data may be useful for describing intervention-relocated changes in brain connectivity.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a simple and widely used assessment tool that allows one to analyze the bioelectric activity of the brain. As a result, one can observe brain waves with different frequencies and amplitudes that correspond to the temporary synchronization of different parts of the brain. Synchronization patterns may be changed by almost any type of pathological conditions, such as psychiatric diseases and structural abnormalities of the brain tissue. In various neuropsychiatric disorders, the coordination of cortical activity may be decreased or enhanced as a result of neurobiological compensatory mechanisms. Methods. In this paper, we analyzed the EEG signals in resting-state condition, with reference to three patients with a similar set of psychopathological symptoms typical for the first psychotic episode, but with different functional and structural neural basis of the disease. Additionally, those patients were compared with a demographically matched healthy individual. We used the non-linear method of time series analysis based on the recurrences of states, to verify whether functional connectivity configurations assessed with recurrence method will qualitatively distinguish patients from a healthy subject, but also differentiate patients from each other. Results. Obtained results confirmed that the connectivity architecture mapped with the recurrence analysis substantially differentiated all participants from each other. An applied analysis additionally showed the specificity of cortical desynchronization and over-synchronization matched to the psychiatric or neurological basis of the disease. Despite this encouraging finding, group-oriented studies are needed to corroborate our qualitative results, based only on a series of clinical case studies.

While its subtractive origin strongly influences the amplitude, thus hindering its detection, other external factors, such as subject's inefficiency to allocate attention to the cued target, or the heterogeneity of the visual context, may strongly affect the elicitation of the component itself. It would therefore be extremely important to create a tool that, using as few sweeps as possible, could reliably establish whether an N2pc is present in an individual subject. In the present work, we propose an approach by resorting to a time-frequency analysis of N2pc individual signals; in particular, power at each frequency band (alpha/beta/delta/theta) was computed in the N2 time range and correlated to the estimated amplitude of the N2pc. Preliminary results on fourteen human volunteers of a visual search design showed a very high correlation coefficient (over 0.9) between the low frequency bands power and the mean absolute amplitude of the component, using only 40 sweeps. Results also seemed to suggest that N2pc amplitude values higher than 0.5 mu V could be accurately classified according to time-frequency indices.

J	de Boer, B; te Molder, H; Verbeek, PP				de Boer, Bas; te Molder, Hedwig; Verbeek, Peter-Paul			Constituting 'Visual Attention': On the Mediating Role of Brain Stimulation and Brain Imaging Technologies in Neuroscientific Practice	SCIENCE AS CULTURE			English	Article						Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation; technological mediation theory; cognitive neuroscience; postphenomenology; conversation analysis; philosophy of technology	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; EXPERIENCE; IMAGES; FMRI	An important development within cognitive neuroscience is the use of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS), a technique which holds the promise of establishing causal relationships between brain processes and cognitive processes. However, NIBS does not allow researchers to observe neurophysiological processes, and must be coupled with imaging technologies such as Electroencephalography (EEG) for the visualization of neurophysiological change. Technologies such as NIBS and EEG are not neutral intermediaries between scientists and the world, but actively mediate the reality that scientists investigate. How these technologies shape the objects of neuroscientific study becomes clear when analyzing real-life conversations between neuroscientists researching visual attention. During the constitution of visual attention, neuroscientists need to manage a tension between the epistemic norms of 'causality' and 'reality', and how this tension is managed differs when different technologies are used. In the case of NIBS, the tension between reality and causality is managed in terms of the relation between experimental results obtained within the laboratory and the 'real' world outside of the laboratory. When NIBS and EEG are combined, neuroscientist orient to the norms of causality and reality in a different way: now, the reality of the causality obtained within scientific experiments needs to managed. This indicates that neuroscientists cannot straightforwardly assume the causal efficacy of the brain on human behavior. Instead, the coming into being of neuroscientific objects such as visual attention is both dependent on technological mediations and on how the tension between the norms of 'causality' and 'reality' is managed.

Disturbances in oscillatory activity are associated with several disease states, including chronic pain. Studies of neural oscillations related to pain have identified several functional bands, especially alpha, beta, and gamma bands, implicated in nociceptive processing. In this review, we introduce several properties of neural oscillations that are important to understand the role of brain oscillations in nociceptive processing. We also discuss the role of neural oscillations in the maintenance of efficient communication in the brain. Finally, we discuss the role of neural oscillations in healthy and chronic pain nociceptive processing. These data and concepts illustrate the key role of regional and interregional neural oscillations in nociceptive processing underlying acute and chronic pains.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the anesthetic depth monitoring using PLE and to evaluate the correlation between PLE and bispectral index (BIS) values during propofol anesthesia. Methods In thirty-five adult patients undergoing elective surgery, anesthesia was induced with propofol using target-controlled infusion (the Schneider model). We recorded the PLE value, raw EEG, BIS value, and hemodynamic data when the target effect-site concentration (Ce) of propofol reached 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 mu g/ml before intubation and 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 mu g/ml after intubation and injection of muscle relaxant. We analyzed whether PLE and raw EEG data from the PLE monitor reflected the anesthetic depth as the Ce of propofol changed, and whether PLE values were comparable to BIS values. Results PLE values were inversely correlated to changes in propofol Ce (propofol Ce from 0 to 6.0 mu g/ml, r(2) = - 0.83; propofol Ce from 6.0 to 2.0 mu g/ml, r(2) = - 0.46). In the spectral analysis of EEG acquired from the PLE monitor, the persistence spectrogram revealed a wide distribution of power at loss of consciousness (LOC) and recovery of consciousness (ROC), with a narrow distribution during unconsciousness. The power spectrogram showed the typical pattern seen in propofol anesthesia with slow alpha frequency band oscillation. The PLE value demonstrated a strong correlation with the BIS value during the change in propofol Ce from 0 to 6.0 mu g/ml (r(2) = 0.84). PLE and BIS values were similar at LOC (62.3 vs. 61.8) (P > 0.05), but PLE values were smaller than BIS values at ROC (64.4 vs 75.7) (P < 0.05). Conclusions The PLE value is a useful anesthetic depth indicator, similar to the BIS value, during propofol anesthesia. Spectral analysis of EEG acquired from the PLE monitor demonstrated the typical patterns seen in propofol anesthesia.

However, optimi- zation of methodological approaches is still necessary to standardize analyses of their microstructural character- istics. Additionally, some relevant features of these oscillations remain unexplored in pathological conditions. Among others, slow wave traveling is a promising proxy for diurnal processes of brain connectivity and excitabil- ity. The study of slow oscillations propagation appears particularly relevant when schizophrenia is conceptual- ized as a dys-connectivity syndrome. Given the rising knowledge on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying slow wave traveling, this measure might offer substantial advantages over other approaches in inves- tigating brain connectivity. Herein we: 1) con firm the stability of our previous findings on slow waves and sleep spindles in FDRs using dif- ferent automated algorithms, and 2) report the dynamics of slow wave traveling in FDRs of Schizophrenia pa- tients. A 256 -channel, high -density EEG system was employed to record a whole night of sleep of 16 FDRs and 16 age- and gender -matched control subjects. A recently developed, open source toolbox was used for slow wave visualization and detection. Slow waves were con firmed to be signi ficantly smaller in FDRs compared to the control group. Additionally, several traveling parameters were analyzed. Traveled distances were found to be signi ficantly reduced in FDRs, whereas origins showed a different topographical pattern of distribution from control subjects. In contrast, local speed did not differ between groups. Overall, these results suggest that slow wave traveling might be a viable method to study pathological conditions interfering with brain connectivity.

This article presents a novel method for sleep-stage differentiation based on sonification of sleep-EEG signals using wavelet transform and recurrent neural network (RNN). Methods: Two RNNs were designed and trained separately based on a database of classical guitar pieces and Kurdish tanbur Makams using a long short-term memory model. Moreover, discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packet decomposition were used to determine the association between the EEG signals and musical pitches. Continuous wavelet transform was applied to extract musical beat-based features from the EEG. Then, the pretrained RNN was used to generate music. To test the proposed model, 11 sleep EEGs were mapped onto the guitar and tanbur frequency intervals and presented to the pretrained RNN. Next, the generated music was randomly presented to 2 neurologists. Results: The proposed model classified the sleep stages with an accuracy of >81% for tanbur and more than 93% for guitar musical pieces. The inter-rater reliability measured by Cohen's kappa coefficient (kappa) revealed good reliability for both tanbur (kappa = 0.64, p < 0.001) and guitar musical pieces (kappa = 0.85, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The present EEG sonification method leads to valid sleep staging by clinicians. The method could be used on various EEG databases for classification, differentiation, diagnosis, and treatment purposes. Real-time EEG sonification can be used as a feedback tool for replanning of neurophysiological functions for the management of many neurological and psychiatric disorders in the future.

In particular, employing this algorithm for feature selection as a wrapper technique in Brain-Computer Interfaces applications was recently proposed with great results. Moreover, the training time of the model was decreased while maintaining a high classification accuracy, both essential conditions for a successful BCI. The drawback of this model was the sensitiveness to changes in the direction and magnitude of the rotation angle, which can produce adverse effects in both performance and convergence time. Chaotic systems and Evolutionary algorithms, when combined, can enhance the convergence rate and speed of the evolutionary process, incrementing the capacity of reaching the global optima. In this paper we explore the effects of adding ergodicity to a QiEA by the employment of chaotic maps in two operators: chaotic uniform crossover and chaotic quantum update gate. To validate the proposed approach, six commonly used chaotic maps arc tested with data of Motor Imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) of right and left hand movement. The results of these experiments are compared with the ones of a QiEA and a classical Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the proposed model, Wavelet Packet Decomposition is employed as the time-frequency analysis to characterize the signal, whereas a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network is used as a classifier. The results demonstrated that Chaotic QiEAs can significantly improve the convergence time of the model with only a small loss in the final accuracy.

Challenging the use of left-temporal EEG alpha oscillations as valid measures of verbal processing and conscious motor control	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Conscious motor processing; Reinvestment; Verbal-analytical; T7-Fz; Neural efficiency	CORTICAL ACTIVATION; PERFORMANCE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COACTIVATION; MARKSMEN	This study tested the validity of EEG left-temporal alpha power and upper-alpha T7-Fz connectivity as indices of verbal activity and conscious motor control. Participants (n= 20) reached for, and transported, a jar under three conditions: a control condition and two self-talk conditions aimed at eliciting either task-unrelated verbal processing or task-related conscious control, while EEG and hand kinematics were recorded. Compared to the control condition, both self-talk conditions increased self-reported verbal processing, but only the task-related self-talk condition increased left-temporal activity (i.e., alpha power decreased). However, as cortical activity increased across the entire scalp topography, conscious control likely elicits a multitude of processes that may not be explained by left-temporal activity or verbal processing alone, but by a widespread decrease in neural efficiency. No significant effects for T7-Fz connectivity were detected. Results suggest that left-temporal EEG alpha oscillations are unlikely to uniquely reflect verbal processing during conscious motor control.	[Parr, Johnny V.

The study was conducted in 2018 in Ningbo University in Zhejiang Province (China) on 235 students aged 20-21. The results showed that in the experimental group, when perceiving music, symmetrical hemisphere interaction parameters dominate (p <= 0.05), in both groups, right-hand parameters dominate in speech perception. The third group showed a difference in the depth of decrease in the amplitude of the alpha rhythm with respect to the resting state (p <= 0.03) in the low-frequency range when listening to a fragment of Slavic folklore. The interaction of the cerebral hemispheres determines a high result in the processing of music. The latter manifested itself when listening to Slavic music: the width of the alpha-1 range is wider when listening in comparison with the state of rest.

ANS acuity is a reliable predictive factor of mathematical achievements and is most likely not influenced by educational or cultural factors of general cognitive processing. It is well established that individuals with mathematics anxiety (MA) perform normally in general cognitive tasks but significantly below-average in mathematical tasks such as numerical magnitude processing, computation and mathematical problem solving. Previous behavioral study reported significant negative correlations between MA level and ANS acuity but it remained unclear whether MA individuals are deficient in their ANS functioning. The current study explored the approximate number processing in individuals with mathematics anxiety at a neural level and gathered electrophysiological evidences for ANS deficiency in MA individuals. We selected 31 individuals with high math anxiety and 29 individuals with low math anxiety who were matched for mean general intelligence, rapid visual perception ability, visual searching ability and mean general anxiety level. The participants completed a dot array task both actively and passively as their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded. In the active dot array task, the participants were required to make judgements on the relative quantities of blue and yellow dots while the ratio of the dots were manipulated to be high or low. In the passive viewing task, the participants were required to complete an irrelevant task to ensure that proper attention was paid to the stimuli while the ratio was also manipulated. We found that the behavioral performances of the two groups were comparable in both active and passive viewing tasks. However, event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed that the high anxiety group had larger P2p amplitudes at the occipital electrodes than the low anxiety group in both active and passive viewing tasks. Furthermore, time-frequency analysis was performed and significant ratio effects were found in the low anxiety group in delta band (1 similar to 5 Hz) event-related synchronization (ERS) and beta band (29 similar to 34 Hz) event-related desynchronization ( ERD) while no ratios effects were found in the low anxiety group. The current study provided electrophysiological evidences for ANS deficiencies in individuals with MA. The findings of this study have important theoretical implications for the causes of the impaired mathematical abilities in MA individuals as well as for effective interventions for MA.

Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of this ability can be used to identify whether a person is distracted during listening to a target speech, especially in a learning context. This paper investigates the neural correlates of learning from the speech presented in a noisy environment using an ecologically valid learning context and electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, the following listening tasks were performed while 64-channel EEG signals were recorded: (1) attentive listening to the lectures in background sound, (2) attentive listening to the background sound presented alone, and (3) inattentive listening to the background sound. For the first task, 13 lectures of 5 min in length embedded in different types of realistic background noise were presented to participants who were asked to focus on the lectures. As background noise, multi-talker babble, continuous highway, and fluctuating traffic sounds were used. After the second task, a written exam was taken to quantify the amount of information that participants have acquired and retained from the lectures. In addition to various power spectrum-based EEG features in different frequency bands, the peak frequency and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of alpha-band activity were estimated. To reduce these dimensions, a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the different listening conditions resulting in the feature combinations that discriminate most between listening conditions and persons. Linear mixed-effect modeling was used to explain the origin of extracted principal components, showing their dependence on listening condition and type of background sound. Following this unsupervised step, a supervised analysis was performed to explain the link between the exam results and the EEG principal component scores using both linear fixed and mixed-effect modeling. Results suggest that the ability to learn from the speech presented in environmental noise can be predicted by the several components over the specific brain regions better than by knowing the background noise type. These components were linked to deterioration in attention, speech envelope following, decreased focusing during listening, cognitive prediction error, and specific inhibition mechanisms.

Its clinical application is mainly oriented towards helping people with severe motor disabilities. This work is carried out mainly based on the digital processing of the so-called "brain rhythms" from records from a freely accessible database. The methodology that implements the preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction stages is established with the purpose of distinguishing movement of the right hand (RHM) in contrast to the movement of the left hand (LHM). The results obtained are described by analyzing EEG signals in the time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. The degree of recognition of the movement was high in both cases. The identification of the running movement was 84% for the analysis of RHM and LHM (open and close de fist). This result is preliminary and will be the starting point for further developments.

Visual cues are especially important in noisy environments, when the auditory signal is less reliable. Neuronal oscillations might be involved in the cortical processing of audiovisual speech by selecting which sensory channel contributes more to perception. To test this, we designed computer-generated naturalistic audiovisual speech stimuli where one mismatched phoneme-viseme pair in a key word of sentences created bistable perception. Neurophysiological recordings (high-density scalp and intracranial electroencephalography) revealed that the precise phase angle of theta-band oscillations in posterior temporal and occipital cortex of the right hemisphere was crucial to select whether the auditory or the visual speech cue drove perception. We demonstrate that the phase of cortical oscillations acts as an instrument for sensory selection in audiovisual speech processing.

This study investigates the indicators of electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory activity and processes that are correlated with manual movements executed by the subdominant (left) hand in women with a high or a low individual alpha-frequency. Material and methods. 113 healthy right-handed women from the ages of 19 to 21 were divided randomly into two experimental groups with high (n = 59, I alpha F > 10.25 Hz) and low (n = 54, I alpha F <= 10.25 Hz) individual EEG alpha-frequency (I alpha F). EEG power during flexion or extension of the subdominant hand fingers was evaluated. Results. Manual movements performed by women, especially those exhibiting high modal alpha-frequency, were accompanied by reduced alpha and beta power in mid and posterior cortical areas. These changes occurred in combination with a local power increase in alpha 1-oscillations in the frontal leads. A local increase of alpha 3-activity in the frontal cortex areas was also revealed in women with low I alpha F. In this same group of women, generalized increases in EEG power of theta-, beta- and gamma-oscillations were observed in the cortex. Conclusions. These results revealed a greater redundancy of brain processes in women with low I alpha F power compared to women with high alpha-frequency.

J	Anderson, DE; Madhavan, D; Swaminathan, A				Anderson, David E.; Madhavan, Deepak; Swaminathan, Arun			Global brain network dynamics predict therapeutic responsiveness to cannabidiol treatment for refractory epilepsy	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						refractory epilepsy; EEG; graph theory; cannabidiol; anti-epileptic drugs	GRAPH-THEORY FINDINGS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; CANNABINOIDS; SEIZURES; COMMUNICATION; MECHANISMS; DISORDERS; SYNCHRONY; CHILDREN	Refractory epilepsy is a chronic brain network disorder characterized by unresponsiveness to multiple (>2) anti-epileptic drugs. Cannabidiol, a non-psychotropic neuroactive substance, is an emerging anti-epileptic treatment that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of refractory epilepsy, especially Lennox Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Here, we evaluated associations between global brain network dynamics and related changes and responsiveness to cannabidiol therapy using a combination of electroencephalography phase coherence and graph theoretical analyses. Refractory epilepsy patients with Lennox Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome underwent serial electroencephalography testing prior to and during cannabidiol treatment. Patients showing greater than 70% seizure frequency reduction were classified as treatment responders for the purposes of this study. We calculated inter-electrode electroencephalography phase coherence in delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands. Graph theoretical analysis of brain network dynamics was extracted from phase coherence to evaluate measures of network integration (i.e. characteristic path length, global efficiency and degree) and segregation (i.e. modularity and transitivity). We found that responders, relative to non-responders, showed increased network integration-as indexed by relatively higher global efficiency and lower degree-and increased network segregation-as indexed by relatively higher modularity-exclusively in the beta-frequency band. We also found that larger cannabidiol dosages were associated with increased network integration-as indexed by higher global efficiency with increasing dose-and increased network segregation-as indexed by lower transitivity with increasing dose-in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. In summary, we demonstrate novel effects of cannabidiol on brain network dynamics with important implications for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and, possibly, across broader research applications in the future.

To better understand how these warning signs prompted hazard, this study investigated the intrinsic mechanism of hazard perception of warning signs, including warning words (low versus high hazard levels) and surrounding shapes (upright triangle versus circle). We recruited 18 participants and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG). We found that a combination of high-hazard-level words and an upright triangle shape significantly elicited more negative N300 and increased theta-band (3-8 Hz) synchronization, but reduced beta-band (15-30 Hz) desynchronization. The N300 component represented the emotional arousal strength, theta oscillations reflected the engagement of retrieval of emotional experiences from episodic memory, and beta oscillation connoted the semantic encoding. Thus, these findings suggested that a high-hazard-level combination had the ability to obtain high priority in cognitive processing. The EEG pattern changes allowed us to assess whether the hazard perception of warning signs was high or low, which could be an accurate indicator to better evaluate the design of warning signs.

The participant-specific time window relative to the visual cue has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the CSP. However, the time window is usually selected experientially or manually. To solve this problem, we propose a novel feature selection approach for MI-based BCIs. Specifically, multiple time segments were obtained by decomposing each EEG sample of the MI task. Furthermore, the features were extracted by CSP from each time segment and were combined to form a new feature vector. Finally, the optimal temporal combination patterns for the new feature vector were selected based on four feature selection algorithms, i.e., mutual information, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, principal component analysis and stepwise linear discriminant analysis (denoted as MUIN, LASSO, PCA, and SWLDA, respectively), and the classification algorithm was employed to evaluate the average classification accuracy. With three BCI competition datasets, the results of the four proposed algorithms were compared with traditional CSP algorithm in classification accuracy. Experimental results show that compared with traditional algorithm, the proposed methods significantly improve performance. Specifically, the LASSO achieved the highest accuracy (88.58%) among the proposed methods. Importantly, the average classification accuracies using the proposed approaches significantly improved 10.14% (MUIN), 11.40% (LASSO), 6.08% (PCA), and 10.25% (SWLDA) compared to that using CSP. These results indicate that the proposed approach is expected to be practical in MI-based BCIs.

BOLD and EEG signal variability at rest differently relate to aging in the human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain signal variability; Resting state; BOLD; fMRI; EEG; Aging; Sex; Default mode network	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; SEX-DIFFERENCES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; STATE NETWORKS; ALPHA-RHYTHM	Variability of neural activity is regarded as a crucial feature of healthy brain function, and several neuroimaging approaches have been employed to assess it noninvasively. Studies on the variability of both evoked brain response and spontaneous brain signals have shown remarkable changes with aging but it is unclear if the different measures of brain signal variability - identified with either hemodynamic or electrophysiological methods - reflect the same underlying physiology. In this study, we aimed to explore age differences of spontaneous brain signal variability with two different imaging modalities (EEG, fMRI) in healthy younger (25 +/- 3 years, N = 135) and older (67 +/- 4 years, N = 54) adults. Consistent with the previous studies, we found lower blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) variability in the older subjects as well as less signal variability in the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations (1-12 Hz), measured in source space. These age-related reductions were mostly observed in the areas that overlap with the default mode network. Moreover, age-related increases of variability in the amplitude of beta-band frequency EEG oscillations (15-25 Hz) were seen predominantly in temporal brain regions. There were significant sex differences in EEG signal variability in various brain regions while no significant sex differences were observed in BOLD signal variability. Bivariate and multivariate correlation analyses revealed no significant associations between EEG- and fMRI-based variability measures. In summary, we show that both BOLD and EEG signal variability reflect aging-related processes but are likely to be dominated by different physiological origins, which relate differentially to age and sex.

Automatic seizure detection is also an important component of closed-loop responsive cortical stimulation systems. The goal of this study is to evaluate EEG-based features recently proposed for seizure detection to discover the optimum ones for a reliable seizure detection system. We extracted seizure detection features from intracranial EEG signals that were recorded during invasive pre-surgical epilepsy monitoring of people with drug resistant focal epilepsy at the Epilepsy Center of the University Hospital of Freiburg. Features from time, frequency and phase space domains as well as similarity/dissimilarity features were considered. The performance of each feature was investigated using the statistical test ANOVA. Performance analysis was conducted separately on the recordings from the channels within the seizure-onset zone (SOZ-in) and the recordings from the channels outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ-out). Similarity/dissimilarity features that measure dynamic properties of the EEG signal and the evolving phenomena of the seizures could significantly separate ictal (during seizure) states from pre-ictal (before seizure) states (p < 0.01). Among them, our proposed feature, Bhattacharyya-based dissimilarity index (BBDI), successfully passed Tukey's post-hoc test as well suggesting that it can distinguish both pre-ictal and post-ictal (after seizure) periods from ictal period. BBDI was further applied to detect epileptic seizures and achieved area under the curve of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) equal to 0.96 and 0.94 for SOZ-in and SOZ-out channels, respectively. No significant difference (p = 0.59) was observed in the performance of features between SOZ-in recordings and SOZ-out recordings. The discriminative value of EEG seizure detection features was determined by statistical tests. As a result, the best features to be selected for a reliable seizure detection system designed for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were suggested, which include similarity/dissimilarity indices.

The primary aim was to compare the changes in electrocortical activity after surgical incision. The secondary aim was to compare the changes in time, frequency, and wavelet domain parameters after loss of consciousness (LoC) and after intubation. Real-time EEG data were recorded from 19 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and signals were quantified with time, frequency, and wavelet domain parameters. An increase in hjorth activity, hjorth complexity, rms value, total band power, relative delta band power, standard deviation and maxima of approximation coefficients (a(5)), minima of detail coefficients (d(5), d(4), and d(3)) and decrease in hjorth mobility; approximate entropy; relative theta, alpha, and beta band power; specentropy; median, spectral edge, and mean frequency; mean of detail coefficients (d(4)); standard deviation of detail coefficients (d(5), d(4), and d(3)); maxima of detail coefficients (d(5)); and minima of approximation coefficients (a(5)) were observed during LoC. Decrease in hjorth activity; hjorth mobility; rms value; total band power; relative theta band power; median frequency; standard deviation of coefficients (a(5), d(5), d(4), and d(3)); and maxima of coefficients (a(5), d(5), d(4), and d(3)) and increase in hjorth complexity; mean of detail coefficients (d(5)); and minima of coefficients (a(5), d(5), d(4), and d(3)) were observed after intubation. Significant decrease in hjorth activity; hjorth mobility; total band power; relative alpha band power; specentropy; median and mean frequency; standard deviation and maxima of detail coefficients (d(5), d(4), and d(3)) and increase in rms value; relative delta band power; mean of coefficients (a(5) and d(5)); and minima of coefficients (d(5), d(4), and d(3)) were observed due to surgical incision. It can be concluded that different spectral and temporal parameters of EEG signals are highly sensitive to induction, intubation, and surgical incision which are potentially informative for measuring the depth of anaesthesia or efficacy of anaesthetic agents.

It also has profound implications on how we assess such interactions. Given that the brain is a delayed network due to the finite conduction velocity of the electrical impulses traveling across its fibers, the existence of long-distance zero-lag functional connectivity may be considered improbable. However, in this study, using human intracranial recordings we demonstrate that most interhemispheric connectivity between homotopic cerebral regions is zero-lagged and that this type of connectivity is ubiquitous. Volume conduction can be safely discarded as a confounding factor since it is known to drop almost completely within short interelectrode distances (<20 mm) in intracranial recordings. This finding should guide future electrophysiological connectivity studies and highlight the importance of considering the role of zero-lag connectivity in our understanding of communication between cell assemblies.

Rama			Automatic epileptic seizure recognition using reliefF feature selection and long short term memory classifier	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Fast empirical mode decomposition; Independent component analysis; Long short-term memory; reliefF feature selection	PHASE-SPACE REPRESENTATION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; WAVELET TRANSFORM; LINE LENGTH; EEG; NETWORK; SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal based epileptic seizure recognition is an emerging technique that efficiently identifies the non-stationary progresses of brain activities. Usually, the epilepsy is recognized by clinicians on the basis of visual observation of EEG signals that normally consumes more time and also sensitive to noise. In this research, a new supervised system is proposed for automatic epileptic seizure detection. Initially, the signals are collected from Temple University Hospital (TUH), Bern-Barcelona EEG (BB-EEG), Bonn University EEG (BU-EEG) and simulated database. Then, fast empirical mode decomposition (FEMD) and feature extraction (combination of entropy, frequency, auto-regressive, and statistical features) are employed for extracting the features from collected data. Besides, reliefF approach is used to lessen the number of extracted features by obtaining a set of active feature vectors that completely solves the "curse of dimensionality" issue. After feature selection, a supervised classifier [long short-term memory (LSTM)] is utilized for classifying the epileptic seizure classes. Experimental phase demonstrates that the proposed work efficiently classifies the epileptic seizure classes by means of miss rate, specificity, false discovery rate (FDR), false omission rate (FOR), sensitivity, and accuracy. From the experimental result, the proposed work improves the classification accuracy upto 0.6-16% related to the existing works.

Studies on social cognition and gossip have also revealed the activation of similar areas from the reward network. In this study we wanted to assess the electrophysiological correlates of the anticipation and processing of novel information (as an intrinsic cognitive reward) depending on the degree of elicited curiosity and the content of the information. 24 healthy volunteers participated in this EEG experiment. The task consisted of 150 questions and answers divided into three different conditions: trivia-like questions, personal-gossip information about celebrities and personal-neutral information about the same celebrities. Our main results from the ERPs and time-frequency analysis pinpointed main differences for gossip in comparison with personal-neutral and trivia-like conditions. Specifically, we found an increase in beta oscillatory activity in the outcome phase and a decrease of the same frequency band in the expectation phase. Larger amplitudes in P300 component were also found for gossip condition. Finally, gossip answers were the most remembered in a one-week memory test. The arousing value and saliency of gossip information, its rewarding effect evidenced by the increase of beta oscillatory power and the recruitment of areas from the brain reward network in previous fMRI studies, as well as its potential social value have been argued in order to explain its differential processing, encoding and recall.

To check the influences of the human brain's power spectrum density (PSD) pre and post a 2D and 3D movie watching, a five-member test group was arranged. In this study, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used as a neuroimaging method. EEG recordings of five individuals were taken both before and after watching 2D and 3D movies. The main framework of this study was to analyze the effects of power spectrum density (PSD) of the human brain by testing all EEG frequency bands before and after 2D and 3D movie watching, also to determine effective brain lobes, and consequently, EEG channels. After 2D/3D EEG recording, this record was divided into three stages for analysis. These stages consisted of Relax, Watching, and Rest. This benchmarking analysis included 1) before and after watching the 2D movie (R2b and R2a), II) before and after watching the 3D movie (R3b and R3a), and III) after watching the 2D/3D movie (R2a and R3a). In the Relax and Rest stages, the 2D/3D EEG power differences in all channels of brain regions for the five EEG bands, including delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha (alpha), beta (beta), and gamma (gamma), were analyzed and compared. The PSD based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) was used to select the dominant bands in this study. Feature extraction was performed on the preprocessed EEG signals using SIFT and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In the 2D analysis, delta, theta, alpha, and beta acted as dominant bands, in 3D, beta, theta, and alpha were dominant bands, and in 2D/3D, delta and alpha were selected as meaningful and dominant bands. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms were considered in order to classify the obtained R2a and R3a EEG signals. After the dominant band selection, the correct choice of effective channel combinations in these bands resulted in the percentage of high success of classifiers for Stage III. Taking into account the optimum number of channels, the best percentage of classification accuracy for the average of PLSR and SVM classification results by considering the best channels of SVM and DWT feature extraction method is 91.83% and 80.73% respectively.

Seizures can be detected by monitoring the brain and muscle activities, heart rate, oxygen level, artificial sounds, or visual signatures through EEG, EMG, ECG, motion, or audio/video recording on the human head and body. In this article, we first discuss recent advances in seizure sensing, signal processing, time- or frequency-domain analysis, and classification algorithms to detect and classify seizure stages. Then, we show a strong potential of applying recent advancements in non-invasive brain stimulation technology to treat seizures. In particular, we explain the fundamentals of brain stimulation approaches, including (1) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), (2) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), (3) transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and how to use them to treat seizures. Through this review, we intend to provide a broad view of both recent seizure diagnoses and treatments. Such knowledge would help fresh and experienced researchers to capture the advancements in sensing, detection, classification, and treatment seizures. Last but not least, we provide potential research directions that would attract seizure researchers/engineers in the field.

The structure of the EEG time series is composed of many neural rhythms interacting at different spatiotemporal scales. This interaction is often named as cross frequency coupling, and consists of transient couplings between various parameters of different rhythms. This coupling has been hypothesized to be a basic mechanism involved in cognitive functions. There are several methods to measure cross frequency coupling between two rhythms but no single method has been selected as the gold standard. Current methods only serve to explore two rhythms at a time, are computationally demanding, and impose assumptions about the nature of the signal. Here we present a new approach based on Information Theory in which we can characterize the interaction of more than two rhythms in a given EEG time series. It estimates the mutual information of multiple rhythms (MIMR) extracted from the original signal. We tested this measure using simulated and real empirical data. We simulated signals composed of three frequencies and background noise. When the coupling between each frequency component was manipulated, we found a significant variation in the MIMR. In addition, we found that MIMR was sensitive to real EEG time series collected with open vs. closed eyes, and intra-cortical recordings from epileptic and non-epileptic signals registered at different regions of the brain. MIMR is presented as a tool to explore multiple rhythms, easy to compute and without a priori assumptions.

The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) involves neural activity in the brain elicited by trains of a click sound, and its maximum response is obtained at 40 Hz (40-Hz ASSR). Abnormalities of the 40-Hz ASSR are also widely reported in patients with schizophrenia. Thus, the test-retest reliability of the ASSR is important for its clinical and translational application. However, there are only limited studies reporting the short-term reliability between acquisitions at two time points made using the same electroencephalogram (EEG) system. Furthermore, the long-term reliability between multiple EEG systems and the reliability of spontaneous gamma activity are unknown but are crucial for multicenter collaborative research. Methods We examined the long-term test-retest reliability of 40-Hz ASSR oscillatory activities indexed by the phase locking factor (PLF), evoked power, and (non-phase-locked) induced power between two clinical 19-electrode EEG systems [recorded twice for EEG-1 (time1 and time2) and EEG-2 (time3 and time4)] at four time points from 14 healthy controls over a duration of 5 months. Test-retest reliability was examined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results Both PLF and evoked power showed good to excellent ICCs (>0.60), mainly in the Fz-electrode, both within each EEG system-EEG-1 [(time1 vs. time2) PLF: ICC = 0.66, evoked power: ICC = 0.88] and EEG-2 [(time3 vs. time4) PLF: ICC = 0.82, evoked power: ICC = 0.77]-and between the two EEG systems [(EEG-1 vs. EEG-2) PLF: ICC = 0.73, evoked power: ICC = 0.84]. In contrast, induced power showed the highest (excellent) ICC between the two EEG systems (ICC = 0.95) mainly in the Cz-electrode. For PLF, the Fz-electrode showed better test-retest reliability across all EEG recordings than the Cz-electrode (Fz: ICC = 0.67, Cz: ICC = 0.63), whereas we found similar excellent reproducibility across all EEG recordings from both electrodes for evoked power (Fz: ICC = 0.79, Cz: ICC = 0.77) and induced power (Fz: ICC = 0.79, Cz: ICC = 0.80). Conclusion The 40-Hz ASSR oscillatory activities, including induced power, showed excellent test-retest reliability, even when using different EEG systems over a duration of 5 months. These findings confirm the utility of the 40-Hz ASSR as a reliable clinical and translatable biomarker for multicenter collaborative research.

Little has been done on the effects of subject variability, both across individuals and within the same individual, on BCI performance. For example, stress, arousal, motivation, and fatigue can all affect the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals used by a BCI, which in turn impacts performance. Overcoming the impact of such user variability on BCI performance is an impending and inevitable challenge for routine applications of BCIs in the real world. To systematically explore the factors affecting BCI performance, this study embeds a Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based BCI into a "game with a purpose" (GWAP) to obtain data over significant lengths of time, under both high- and low-stress conditions. Ten healthy volunteers played a GWAP that resembles popular match-three games, such as Jewel Quest, Zoo Boom, or Candy Crush. We recorded the target search time, target search accuracy, and EEG signals during gameplay to investigate the impacts of stress on EEG signals and BCI performance. We used Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to determine whether the subject had found and attended to the correct target. The experimental results show that SSVEP target-classification accuracy is reduced by stress. We also found a negative correlation between EEG spectra and the SNR of EEG in the frontal and occipital regions during gameplay, with a larger negative correlation for the high-stress conditions. Furthermore, CCA also showed that when the EEG alpha and theta power increased, the search accuracy decreased, and the spectral amplitude drop was more evident under the high-stress situation. These results provide new, valuable insights into research on how to improve the robustness of BCIs in real-world applications.

Testing the effect of tACS over parietal cortex in modulating endogenous alpha rhythm and temporal integration windows in visual perception	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; neural oscillations; tES; timing; vision	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; LOCAL ENTRAINMENT; PHASE; BRAIN; ATTENTION; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PATHWAY	Neural oscillations in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) have been proposed as a key mechanism for the temporal resolution of visual perception. Higher alpha frequencies have been related to improved segregation of visual events over time, whereas lower alpha frequencies have been related to improved temporal integration. Similarly, also the phase of ongoing alpha has been shown to correlate with temporal integration/segregation. To test a causal relationship between alpha oscillations and perception, we here employed multi-channel transcranial alternating current stimulation (mc-tACS) over the right parietal cortex, whereas participants performed a visual temporal integration/segregation task that used identical stimuli with different instructions. Before and after mc-tACS we recorded the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) to extract the individual alpha frequency (IAF) and delivered electrical stimulation at slightly slower and faster frequencies (IAF +/- 2 Hz). We hypothesized that this would not only drive endogenous alpha rhythms, but also affect temporal integration and segregation in an opposite way. However, the mc-tACS protocol used here did not consistently increase or decrease the IAF after the stimulation and did not affect temporal integration/segregation accuracy as expected. Although we found some preliminary evidence for an influence of tACS phase on temporal integration accuracy, the ongoing phase of mc-tACS oscillations did not reliably modulate temporal integration/segregation accuracy in a sinusoidal way as would have been predicted by an effective entrainment of brain oscillations. These findings may guide future studies using different stimulation montages for investigating the role of cortical alpha oscillations for human vision.

This paper aims to improve the practicability of the SSVEP-BCIs for high-speed spelling. The system acquired the electroencephalogram (EEG) data from a self-developed dedicated EEG device and the stimulation was arranged as a keyboard. The task-related component analysis (TRCA) spatial filter was modified (mTRCA) for target classification and showed significantly higher performance compared with the original TRCA in the offline analysis. In the online system, the dynamic stopping (DS) strategy based on Bayesian posterior probability was utilized to realize alterable stimulating time. In addition, the temporal filtering process and the programs were optimized to facilitate the online DS operation. Notably, the online ITR reached 330.4 +/- 45.4 bits/min on average, which is significantly higher than that of fixed stopping (FS) strategy, and the peak value of 420.2 bits/min is the highest online spelling ITR with a SSVEP-BCI up to now. The proposed system with portable EEG acquisition, friendly interaction, and alterable time of command output provides more flexibility for SSVEP-based BCIs and is promising for practical high-speed spelling.

We propose a novel automated method called the S-Transform Gaussian Mixture detection algorithm (SGM) to detect high-frequency oscillations (HFO) combining the strengths of different families of previously published detectors. Approach. This algorithm does not depend on parameter tuning on a subject (or database) basis, uses time-frequency characteristics, and relies on non-supervised classification to determine if the events standing out from the baseline activity are HFO or not. SGM consists of three steps: the first stage computes the signal baseline using the entropy of the autocorrelation; the second uses the S-Transform to obtain several time-frequency features (area, entropy, and time and frequency widths); and in the third stage Gaussian mixture models cluster time-frequency features to decide if events correspond to HFO-like activity. To validate the SGM algorithm we tested its performance in simulated and real environments. Main results. We assessed the algorithm on a publicly available simulated stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) database with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), obtaining very good results for medium and high SNR signals. We further tested the SGM algorithm on real signals from patients with focal epilepsy, in which HFO detection was performed visually by experts, yielding a high agreement between experts and SGM. Significance. The SGM algorithm displayed proper performance in simulated and real environments and therefore can be used for non-supervised detection of HFO. This non-supervised algorithm does not require previous labelling by experts or parameter adjustment depending on the subject or database considered. SGM is not a computationally intensive algorithm, making it suitable to detect and characterize HFO in long-term SEEG recordings.

To develop and implement a novel approach which combines the technique of scout EEG source imaging (ESI) with convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks. Approach. The technique of ESI uses a boundary element method (BEM) and weighted minimum norm estimation (WMNE) to solve the EEG forward and inverse problems, respectively. Ten scouts are then created within the motor cortex to select the region of interest (ROI). We extract features from the time series of scouts using a Morlet wavelet approach. Lastly, CNN is employed for classifying MI tasks. Main results. The overall mean accuracy on the Physionet database reaches 94.5% and the individual accuracy of each task reaches 95.3%, 93.3%, 93.6%, 96% for the left fist, right fist, both fists and both feet, correspondingly, validated using ten-fold cross validation. We report an increase of up to 14.4% for overall classification compared with the competitive results from the state-of-the-art MI classification methods. Then, we add four new subjects to verify the validity of the method and the overall mean accuracy is 92.5%. Furthermore, the global classifier was adapted to single subjects improving the overall mean accuracy to 94.54%. Significance. The combination of scout ESI and CNN enhances BCI performance of decoding EEG four-class MI tasks.

By using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) of cortical electroencephalography (EEG) data, we tried to investigate the neural changes of spatiotemporal functional connectivity (FC) and fast oscillation (FO) dynamics in a rat model of methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-induced MCD. A total of 28 infant rats with prenatal exposure to MAM and those of age matched 28 controls with prenatal saline exposure were used. RS-fMRI were acquired at postnatal day 15 (P15) and 29 (P29), and correlation coefficient analysis of eleven region of interests (ROI) was done to find the differences of functional networks between four groups. Two hour-cortical EEGs were also recorded at P15 and P29 and the ERSP of gamma (30-80 Hz) and ripples (80-200 Hz) were analyzed. The rats with MCD showed significantly delayed development of superior colliculus-brainstem network compared to control rats at P15. In contrast to marked maturation of default mode network (DMN) in controls from P15 to P29, there was no clear development in MCD rats. The MCD rats showed significantly higher cortical gamma and ripples-ERSP at P15 and lower cortical ripples-ERSP at P29 than those of control rats. This study demonstrated delayed development of FC and altered cortical FO dynamics in rats with malformed brain. The results should be further investigated in terms of the epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction in patients with MCD.

However, much remains to be learned regarding the precise manner how these deficits contribute to disrupting both speech and cognitive functions in those who stutter. Herein, we examine the suitability of electroencephalographic (EEG) mu rhythms for addressing these deficits. We review some previous findings of mu rhythm activity differentiating stuttering from non-stuttering individuals and present some new preliminary findings capturing stuttering-related deficits in working memory. Mu rhythms are characterized by spectral peaks in alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-25 Hz) frequency bands (mu-alpha and mu-beta). They emanate from premotor/motor regions and are influenced by basal ganglia and sensorimotor function. More specifically, alpha peaks (mu-alpha) are sensitive to basal ganglia-based inhibitory signals and sensory-to-motor feedback. Beta peaks (mu-beta) are sensitive to changes in timing and capture motor-to-sensory (i.e., forward model) projections. Observing simultaneous changes in mu-alpha and mu-beta across the time-course of specific events provides a rich window for observing neurophysiological deficits associated with stuttering in both speech and cognitive tasks and can provide a better understanding of the functional relationship between these stuttering symptoms. We review how independent component analysis (ICA) can extract mu rhythms from raw EEG signals in speech production tasks, such that changes in alpha and beta power are mapped to myogenic activity from articulators. We review findings from speech production and auditory discrimination tasks demonstrating that mu-alpha and mu-beta are highly sensitive to capturing sensorimotor and basal ganglia deficits associated with stuttering with high temporal precision. Novel findings from a non-word repetition (working memory) task are also included. They show reduced mu-alpha suppression in a stuttering group compared to a typically fluent group. Finally, we review current limitations and directions for future research.

It is present at the turning point between non-sensory driven spontaneous networks and cortical network functioning. Despite its clinical importance, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this spontaneous nested activity and its functional role have not yet been determined. The coupling between neural oscillations at different timescales is a key feature of ongoing neural activity, the characteristics of which are determined by the network structure and dynamics. The underlying mechanisms of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) are associated with several putative functions in adults. In order to show that this generic mechanism is already in place early in the course of development, we analyzed electroencephalography recordings from sleeping preterm newborns (24-27 wGA). Employing cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analyses, we found that TTAs were orchestrated by the SWs defined by a precise temporal relationship. Notably, TTAs were synchronized to the SW trough, and were suppressed during the SW peak. Spontaneous endogenous TTA-SWs constitute one of the very early signatures of the developing temporal neural networks with key functions, such as language and communication. The presence of a fine-tuned relationship between the slow activity and the TTA in premature neonates emphasizes the complexity and relative maturity of the intimate mechanisms that shape the CFC, the disruption of which can have severe neurodevelopmental consequences.

J	Power, L; Neyedli, HF; Boe, SG; Bardouille, T				Power, Lindsey; Neyedli, Heather F.; Boe, Shaun G.; Bardouille, Timothy			Efficacy of low-cost wireless neurofeedback to modulate brain activity during motor imagery	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						neurofeedback; electroencephalography; motor imagery; cortical oscillations; wireless; accessibility	MENTAL PRACTICE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; STROKE; EEG; RECOVERY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; REORGANIZATION; EXECUTION; SOFTWARE	Objectives: Motor imagery can be used as an adjunct to traditional stroke rehabilitation therapies for individuals who have hand and arm impairment resulting from their stroke. The provision of neurofeedback during motor imagery allows individuals to receive real time information regarding their motor imagery-related brain activity. However, the equipment required to administer this feedback is expensive and largely inaccessible to many of the individuals who could benefit from it. Available EEG-based technology provides an accessible, low-cost, wireless alternative to traditional neurofeedback methods, with the tradeoff of lower gain and channel count resulting in reduced signal quality. This study investigated the efficacy of this wireless technology for the provision of motor imagery-related neurofeedback. Approach: Twenty-eight healthy individuals participated in a 2-group, double-blinded study which involved imagining performing a unimanual button pressing task while receiving neurofeedback that is either a direct transform of their motor imagery-related brain activity (i.e., real) or is related to someone else's brain activity (i.e., sham). The change in amplitude of 15-30 Hz (beta) rhythmic brain activity elicited during the task blocks was calculated and analyzed across sessions and groups. Main Results: We found that individuals who received real neurofeedback showed a statistically significant positive trajectory in modulating the amplitude of the beta rhythm across sessions, while those who received sham feedback showed a negative trajectory. Our results did not indicate a trend of increased lateralization across sessions, as has been shown in previous studies. Significance: Our main findings replicated previous results with research-grade equipment indicating that there is potential for introducing this wireless technology for the provision of neurofeedback. Given the marginal longitudinal effect of neurofeedback in our study, further study is required to address the limitations associated with this technology before our protocol can be implemented in a clinical setting.

The working mechanism of this paradoxical phenomenon remains unknown. In this study, we used electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography to investigate a spectacular zolpidem-induced awakening, including the recovery of functional communication and the ability to walk in a patient with severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We show that cognitive deficits, speech loss, and motor impairments after severe brain injury are associated with stronger beta band connectivity throughout the brain and suggest that neurological recovery after zolpidem occurs with the restoration of beta band connectivity. This exploratory work proposes an essential role for beta rhythms in goal-directed behavior and cognition. It advocates further fundamental and clinical research on the role of increased beta band connectivity in the development of neurological deficits after severe brain injury. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

In particular, BCI has been widely used to detect the intention of users in motor imagery (MI)-based tasks. Although the MI classification accuracy has been largely enhanced from previous efforts, MI-BCI studies have focused on extracting features only during MI tasks, not during the preparatory phases. The increment of alpha band power is induced by performing a task with attention. This study proposes a n approach for increasing MI-BCI performance by analyzing brain state in preparatory before the task. EEG recordings of nine healthy subjects from the open BCI dataset were investigated. The alpha lateralization index (ALI) was calculated for each trial and high ALI trials were utilized for learning lateralization-based model. MI classification accuracy using the lateralization-based model marked high performance (median accuracy = 63.2 %; interquartile range (IQR) = 50.0% - 54.8%) than the total trial-based approach (median accuracy = 52.0%; IQR = 50.0 % - 54.8%) with statistical significance (p = 0.018). This study suggests alpha lateralization which is an imbalance pattern between ipsilateral and contralateral is one of the main factors for improvement of performance. Accordingly, since the alpha liberalization before MI task could exert an effect on the MI phase, the analysis combined preparation with MI would derive highly benefit for the MI classification.

Consequently a significant research effort has been made in the development of automatic EEG data analysis tools including but not limited to seizure detection as seizure frequency and/or intensity are one of the most important indicators of brain development. In this paper we propose to evaluate time dependent power spectral density using short time Fourier transform and using Frechet distance measure to detect presence and/or absence of seizures. We propose to use three different distance measures as they capture different properties of the corresponding PSD matrices. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms using real data set obtained in the NICU of the McMaster University Hospital. In order to benchmark performance of our proposed techniques we trained and tested a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

Different levels of concentration and mental representations of each sport will reflect on brainwaves. The related brainwave researches of sports' field are applying scientific analysis to provide quantitative data, which provide researchers, coaches, and players to understand the psychological states of athletes during sports. Obviously, the performance of certain sports is related to the. frequency of brainwave, the psychological states of players in different sports can be analysed with other frequencies. The proposed method in this study can be used as a prototype of high potential players' selection system in the future or can be used as adjusting the mental state for active athletes to improve training efficiency and performance. This study aims to establish classification model of sports by analysing electroencephalogram (EEG) of athletes with data mining techniques. In data collection, collects the EEG with pressure of the athletes with filling out the questionnaires in limited time. In data analysis, applies the Butterworth low-pass filter to remove noise before converts the EEG to power spectral density by Fast Fourier Transform, then extracts 24 features according to frequency bands and statistical methods as the basis of the classification model. Last but not least, constructs the classification model by machine learning algorithms such as C4.5 and CART and compares the accuracy of different classifiers. By means of proposed sports classification model coordinated with other biotechnologies such as electrocardiogram and electromyogram, which can help athletes and prospective athletes to well understand psychological conditions and choose more appropriate sports.

IDENTIFYING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN ENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SIGNAL IRREGULARITY AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY OPERATIVE ATTENTION	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-APPLICATIONS BASIS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Approximate entropy; Spatial attention; RR interval; Heart rate variability	INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; BRAIN-HEART; TIME; VOLUNTARY; MEMORY; COMPONENTS; SYSTEM; MODEL	This study identifies a correlation between low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV) and encephalographic (EEG) complexity to differentiate internally operative attention (INT) and externally operative attention (EXT). Electrophysiological fluctuations in response to Posner's spatial orienting paradigm were explored in 14 healthy volunteers who participated in 6 alternating sessions of attention tasks. HRV analysis was used to measure heart rate fluctuations, and approximate entropy (ApEn) was used to measure changes in the irregularity of EEG and HRV. Power spectral analysis of HRV revealed that there was found to be a significant difference between INT and EXT for HRV-low frequency (HRV-LF) and LH/HF ratio. ApEn for RR-interval time series increased for both attention tasks as compared to baseline and recovery session. The relationship between HRV-LF and EEG spectral power measured at F4 revealed significant negative correlation during (r = -0:613, with p < 0:05) EXT than (r = -0:116, with p > 0:05) INT. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation, yet of moderate strength was noted between HRV-LF and ApEn of EEG signal measured at POz (r = 0:591, with p < 0:05) during EXT as compared to INT (r <1/4> 0:007, with p > 0:05) and, a significant negative correlation was observed between ApEn of RR-interval and ApEn of EEG signal measured at POz (r = -0:574, with p < 0:05) during EXT as compared to INT (r = -0:490, with p > 0:05). Thus, it is evident that EXT leads to more irregularity in parietal regions of the brain than the INT. During EXT, the irregularity over the parietal region linked to increased sympathetic activity as compared to INT and corresponds to decreased heart rate. These results may benefit in designing robust human-computer interfaces and accelerated training paradigm to raise an athlete's performance.

In the present study, we tested for effects of tVNS on behavioral performance and frontal midline theta activity during response conflicts. Frontal midline theta reflects transient activation of the posterior midfrontal cortex in situations requiring increased executive control of action. It is an established marker for top-down action control. We carried out a combined behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) within-subjects experimental study employing a cued go-no-go-change task. Twenty-two healthy young adults participated. We found that tVNS enhanced global behavioral accuracy, i.e., decreased the proportion of erroneous and missed responses, compared with sham (placebo) stimulation, and reduced conflict costs on behavioral performance in go/change response conflicts. Furthermore, in trials eliciting go/stop conflicts, frontal midline theta was enhanced under tVNS. These findings corroborate the potential of tVNS to enhance executive control of action. For the first time, we show an effect of tVNS on frontal midline theta activity, which suggests that tVNS specifically interacts with the neural mechanisms underlying action control. We conclude that tVNS is a promising method to enhance executive control and recommend the further investigation of tVNS as a candidate treatment of clinically relevant executive control deficits.

Electrophysiological studies of reward system functions have identified frequency-specific brain networks for the processing of positive (high-beta frequency) and negative (theta frequency) events. Remarkably, midbrain dopaminergic signalling also includes theta and high-beta frequency modes, which have been assumed to reflect tonic and phasic dopamine responses, respectively. The aim of the present study was to identify alterations of oscillatory responses to reward feedback in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Seventeen patients with schizophrenia and 18 healthy controls performed a gambling task during recording of 64-channel electroencephalography. The theta and high-beta band total power were investigated in response to feedback events depending on feedback valence (loss or gain) and magnitude (5 vs. 25 points). Results: Both the increase of theta oscillatory activity in response to loss feedback (compared to gain feedback) and the increase of high-beta oscillatory activity in response to gain feedback (compared to loss feedback) were reduced in patients. The difference in high-beta responses to gain versus loss feedback in patients was associated with the severity of negative symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with current models of reward system dysfunction in schizophrenia, and indicate deficits in both cortical tonic and subcortical phasic dopamine activity, consistent with the complex dopaminergic abnormalities in schizophrenia.

Although previous studies have analyzed active and passive tactile processing in humans, little is known about the neurophysiological basis of width discrimination in humans. Here we present a width discrimination task for humans that reproduces the main features of the width discrimination task previously developed for rodents. The task required subjects to actively or passively sample two movable bars forming a "narrow" or "wide" aperture. Subjects were then required to press one of two buttons to indicate if the bar width was "narrow" or "wide". Behavioral testing showed that subjects were capable of discriminating between wide or narrow apertures up to distances of 0.1 cm. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings further suggested distinct topographic maps for active and passive versions of the task during the period associated with the aperture discrimination. These results indicate that the Human Differential Width Discrimination Task is a valuable tool to describe the behavioral characteristics and neurophysiological basis of tactile processing. Active and passive width discrimination has been extensively studied in rodents but not in humans. Human subjects were capable of discriminating aperture widths of 0.1 cm. Electroencephalography recordings showed that active and passive versions of the task were associated with different topographic maps. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Suetani, H; Kitajo, K				Suetani, Hiromichi; Kitajo, Keiichi			A manifold learning approach to mapping individuality of human brain oscillations through beta-divergence	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Oscillology; EEG; Individuality; Manifold learning; Information divergence; Out-of-sample extension	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; ALPHA-BETA; ROBUST; ICA	This paper proposes an approach for visualizing individuality and inter-individual variations of human brain oscillations measured as multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in a low-dimensional space based on manifold learning. Using a unified divergence measure between spectral densities termed the "beta-divergence", we introduce an appropriate dissimilarity measure between multichannel EEG signals. Then, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE; a state-of-the-art algorithm for manifold learning) together with the beta-divergence based distance was applied to resting state EEG signals recorded from 100 healthy subjects. We were able to obtain a fine low-dimensional visualization that enabled each subject to be identified as an isolated point cloud and that represented inter-individual variations as the relationships between such point clouds. Furthermore, we also discuss how the performance of the low-dimensional visualization depends on the beta-divergence parameter and the t-SNE hyper parameter. Finally, borrowing from the concept of locally linear embedding (LLE), we propose a method for projecting the test sample to the t-SNE space obtained from the training samples and investigate that availability.

Acute identification of biomarkers for post-CM epilepsy would allow for follow-up of the highest risk populations in resource-limited regions. We investigated the utility of electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical metrics obtained during acute CM infection for predicting epilepsy. Methods: We analyzed 70 EEGs recorded within 24 h of admission for CM hospitalization obtained during the Blantyre Malaria Project Epilepsy Study (2005-2007), a prospective cohort study of pediatric CM survivors. While all studies underwent spectral analyses for comparisons of mean power band frequencies, a subset of EEGs from the 10 subjects who developed epilepsy and 10 age- and sex-matched controls underwent conventional visual analysis. Findings were tested for relationships to epilepsy outcomes. Results: Ten of the 70 subjects developed epilepsy. There were no significant differences between groups that were analyzed via visual EEG review; however, spectral EEG analyses revealed a significantly higher gamma-delta power ratio in CM survivors who developed epilepsy (0.23 +/- 0.10) than in those who did not (0.16 +/- 0.06), p = 0.003. Excluding potential confounders, multivariable logistic-regression analyses found relative gamma power (p = 0.003) and maximum temperature during admission (p = 0.03) significant and independent predictors of post-CM epilepsy, with area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve of 0.854. Conclusions: We found that clinical and EEG metrics acquired during acute CM presentation confer risk of post-CM epilepsy. Further studies are required to investigate the utility of gamma activity as a potential biomarker of epileptogenesis and study this process over time. Additionally, resource limitations currently prevent follow-up of all CM cases to surveil for epilepsy, and identification of acute biomarkers in this population would offer the opportunity to allocate resources more efficiently.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis is based on behavioral symptoms referred by the patient or their caregivers, which includes a high subjective component. This highlights the need to find biomarkers that might help clinicians to objectively identify this condition and to assess the evolution of the patient and the effectiveness of the treatments using quantitative information. Previous studies suggest that data from quantitative electroencephalography (gEEG) could be useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with ADHD; however, many professionals do not know its possibilities. Aims. To describe and discuss the principal findings of qEEG neurometry in ADHD subjects along the last 10 years. Patients and methods. A systematic review, based on PRISMA methodology and using PubMed database, was carried out to identify original articles published in the last 10 years, that studied qEEG parameters within the ADHD context. Results. A total of 13 research articles out of 65 were selected for an in-depth analysis. Conclusions. qEEG parameters could provide relevant information in the context of ADHD; however, its applicability is currently limited to complementing the subjective diagnosis methods and not to its replacement, as published data are just preliminary and need larger and deeper studies. However, qEEG data can help to better understand ADHD and its neurophysiology, characterize its subtypes and therefore move towards personalized and more effective treatments.

Effect of Virtual Reality on the EEG Sub-Band Frequency Powers of Autistic and Control groups	2020 SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO SIGNALS, IMAGES, AND INSTRUMENTATION (ICBSII)			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bio Signals, Images, and Instrumentation (ICBSII)	FEB 27-28, 2020	Chennai, INDIA			Virtual Reality; Autism; Band power; Relative power; Cognitive Load	OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY	Cognitive load while performing a task indicates the magnitude of effort taken by the individual for the completion of the task. The effort taken by the control and autistic children vary depending on the task they perform. Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technology that has been considered as a learning tool for both the groups. EEG signals has been recorded and quantifiable parameters have been measured to assess the cognitive load while subjecting the children to VR platform. The derived features from theta and alpha oscillations have been considered for study. The results show that there were abnormal impairments in the theta and alpha band values in the autistic group compared to the controls. The relative power values obtained show an increase in delta band values due to enhanced neural processing and a gradual decrease in the power values of the other EEG sub-bands for both the groups. This suggests that VR can be used as a learning tool for improving the cognition of children with neurodevelopmental disorders.

To examine a possible causal contribution of gamma oscillations to cognitive function, recent studies have employed various types of brain stimulation to induce gamma oscillations. Techniques such as optogenetics or sensory stimulation appear to engage canonical neurocircuits that encompass excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, similarly to those driven by sensory experience, to induce gamma entrainment. Sensory evoked gamma entrainment improves cognitive function in mouse models. Oscillations have traditionally been studied at the neurophysiological level; however, sensory evoked gamma entrainment is able to induce gene expression changes in multiple cell types including neurons and microglia. Furthermore, evidence suggests that chronic gamma entrainment offers neuroprotective effects.

Event-related potential and EEG oscillatory predictors of verbal memory in mild cognitive impairment	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; event-related potential; mild cognitive impairment; memory; Alzheimer's disease	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WORD REPETITION; CONVERSION; MCI; MODULATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; BIOMARKERS; RESPONSES; ALPHA	Reliable biomarkers of memory decline are critical for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Previous work has found three EEG measures, namely the event-related brain potential P600, suppression of oscillatory activity in the alpha frequency range (similar to 10 Hz) and cross-frequency coupling between low theta/high delta and alpha/beta activity, each of which correlates strongly with verbal learning and memory abilities in healthy elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment or prodromal Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we address the question of whether event-related or oscillatory measures, or a combination thereof, best predict the decline of verbal memory in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Single-trial correlation analyses show that despite a similarity in their time courses and sensitivities to word repetition, the P600 and the alpha suppression components are minimally correlated with each other on a trial-by-trial basis (generally vertical bar r(s)vertical bar < 0.10). This suggests that they are unlikely to stem from the same neural mechanism. Furthermore, event-related brain potentials constructed from bandpass filtered (delta, theta, alpha, beta or gamma bands) single-trial data indicate that only delta band activity (1-4Hz) is strongly correlated (r = 0.94, P < 0.001) with the canonical P600 repetition effect; event-related potentials in higher frequency bands are not. Importantly, stepwise multiple regression analyses reveal that the three event-related brain potential/oscillatory measures are complementary in predicting California Verbal Learning Test scores (overall R(2')s in 0.45-0.63 range). The present study highlights the importance of combining EEG event-related potential and oscillatory measures to better characterize the multiple mechanisms of memory failure in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or prodromal Alzheimer's disease.

At present, most classifications and predictions of depression rely on different characteristics. Comparing with the previous work, we use local binary pattern (LBP) and signal singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technology to extract features from the original signal. Firstly, the LBP signal is obtained by encoding the segmented signal. Then, we use SSA to decompose and reconstruct the LBP signal to remove noise and divide the frequency band. Finally, we feed the data of each frequency band to K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) for classification. The experimental results show that LBP and SSA features achieve the best classification effect on SVM, and the accuracy of beta band is the highest with 99.24% accuracy, 99.34% sensitivity and 99.12% specificity respectively.

These impairments have been related to clinical symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations. Some researchers have hypothesized that aberrant low-frequency oscillations contribute to auditory information processing deficits in ScZ. A paradigm for which modulations in low-frequency oscillations are consistently found in healthy individuals is the auditory continuity illusion (ACI), in which restoration processes lead to a perceptual grouping of tone fragments and a mask, so that a physically interrupted sound is perceived as continuous. We used the ACI paradigm to test the hypothesis that low-frequency oscillations play a role in aberrant auditory information processing in patients with ScZ (N=23). Compared with healthy control participants we found that patients with ScZ show elevated continuity illusions of interrupted, partially-masked tones. Electroencephalography data demonstrate that this elevated continuity perception is reflected by diminished 3 Hz power. This suggests that reduced low-frequency oscillations relate to elevated restoration processes in ScZ. Our findings support the hypothesis that aberrant low-frequency oscillations contribute to altered perception-related auditory information processing in ScZ.

Thus, BCI toggle switches based on electrooculogram (EOG) signals were developed to toggle on/off synchronous BCI systems. The conventional BCI toggle switches exhibit fast responses with high accuracy; however, they have a high FPR or cannot be applied to patients with oculomotor impairments. To circumvent these issues, we developed a novel BCI toggle switch that users can employ to toggle on or off synchronous BCIs by holding their breath for a few seconds. Two states-normal breath and breath holding-were classified using a linear discriminant analysis with features extracted from the respiration-modulated photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. A real-time BCI toggle switch was implemented with calibration data trained with only 1-min PPG data. We evaluated the performance of our PPG switch by combining it with a steady-state visual evoked potential-based BCI system that was designed to control four external devices, with regard to the true-positive rate and FPR. The parameters of the PPG switch were optimized through an offline experiment with five subjects, and the performance of the switch system was evaluated in an online experiment with seven subjects. All the participants successfully turned on the BCI by holding their breath for approximately 10 s (100% accuracy), and the switch system exhibited a very low FPR of 0.02 false operations per minute, which is the lowest FPR reported thus far. All participants could successfully control external devices in the synchronous BCI mode. Our results demonstrated that the proposed PPG-based BCI toggle switch can be used to implement practical BCIs.

Gait impairments are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), reflecting dysfunction of cortico-basal ganglia-brainstem circuits. Recent studies using implanted electrodes and surface electroencephalography have demonstrated gait-related brain oscillations in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. Here, we review the physiological and pathophysiological roles of (1) basal ganglia oscillations, (2) cortical oscillations, and (3) basal ganglia-cortical interactions during walking. These studies extend a novel framework for movement of disorders where specific patterns of abnormal oscillatory synchronization in the basal ganglia thalamocortical network are associated with specific signs and symptoms. Therefore, we propose that many gait dysfunctions in PD arise from derangements in brain network, and discuss potential therapies aimed at restoring gait impairments through modulation of brain network in PD.

A New Wavelet-Based Neural Network for Classification of Epileptic-Related States using EEG	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Wavelet-based neural networks; Epileptic seizure detection; EEG analysis; Machine learning classification; Wavelet selection	SEIZURE DETECTION; OPTIMAL SELECTION; SIGNALS; ENTROPY; MODEL; RECOGNITION; PREDICTION; FAMILIES; SYSTEM	In this paper, we present a novel neural network able to classify epileptic seizures using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, called "Multidimensional Radial Wavelons Feed-Forward Wavelet Neural Network" (MRW-FFWNN). The network is part of a classification system, which distinguishes among three brain states related to epilepsy namely ictal, interictal and healthy. Efficient methods for pre-processing EEG's, extracting features and getting the final class decisions were selected using a statistical three-fold cross-validation method, which assures the robustness of the system and its generalization ability. The following methods were systematically analyzed to find the most appropriate for this problem: 1) Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters for noise reduction; 2) discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) for frequency decomposition of the EEG signals; 3) average correlation and maximum voting correlation for selecting a suitable mother wavelet for frequency decomposition; 4) Binary-tree and one-vs-one (OVO) decomposition strategies for primary binary classification; 5) voting and weighted-voting strategy aggregation strategies for the final classification. The integrated system was assessed using a three-fold cross validation, applied to a benchmark provided by the University of Bonn, getting an average accuracy of 93.33% when tested using sets Z, S and F and 95.0% when sets Z, S, F and O were used. The proposed network got competitive accuracy, compared with other state-of-the art classifiers, training in almost a half of the time than the ones with similar accuracy.

J	Wollman, I; Arias, P; Aucouturier, JJ; Morillon, B				Wollman, Indiana; Arias, Pablo; Aucouturier, Jean-Julien; Morillon, Benjamin			Neural entrainment to music is sensitive to melodic spectral complexity	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						arousal; auditory perception; EEG; emotion; neural oscillations; temporal envelope	AUDITORY-CORTEX; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; PREDICTIONS; MODULATION; PATTERNS; TALK	During auditory perception, neural oscillations are known to entrain to acoustic dynamics but their role in the processing of auditory information remains unclear. As a complex temporal structure that can be parameterized acoustically, music is particularly suited to address this issue. In a combined behavioral and EEG experiment in human participants, we investigated the relative contribution of temporal (acoustic dynamics) and nontemporal (melodic spectral complexity) dimensions of stimulation on neural entrainment, a stimulus-brain coupling phenomenon operationally defined here as the temporal coherence between acoustical and neural dynamics. We first highlight that low-frequency neural oscillations robustly entrain to complex acoustic temporal modulations, which underscores the fine-grained nature of this coupling mechanism. We also reveal that enhancing melodic spectral complexity, in terms of pitch, harmony, and pitch variation, increases neural entrainment. Importantly, this manipulation enhances activity in the theta (5 Hz) range, a frequency-selective effect independent of the note rate of the melodies, which may reflect internal temporal constraints of the neural processes involved. Moreover, while both emotional arousal ratings and neural entrainment were positively modulated by spectral complexity, no direct relationship between arousal and neural entrainment was observed. Overall, these results indicate that neural entrainment to music is sensitive to the spectral content of auditory information and indexes an auditory level of processing that should be distinguished from higher-order emotional processing stages. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Low-frequency (<10 Hz) cortical neural oscillations are known to entrain to acoustic dynamics, the so-called neural entrainment phenomenon, but their functional implication in the processing of auditory information remains unclear. In a behavioral and EEG experiment capitalizing on parameterized musical textures, we disentangle the contribution of stimulus dynamics, melodic spectral complexity, and emotional judgments on neural entrainment and highlight their respective spatial and spectral neural signature.

Too Real to Be Virtual: Autonomic and EEG Responses to Extreme Stress Scenarios in Virtual Reality	BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CYBERSICKNESS; OSCILLATIONS; IMMERSION; PREDICT; SENSE	The evolution of virtual reality (VR) technologies requires setting boundaries of its use. In this study, 3 female participants were experiencing VR scenarios with stressful content and their activity of the autonomic nervous system and EEG were recorded. It has been discovered that virtual reality can evoke acute stress reactions accompanied by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and a decrease in the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. The high-stress response is accompanied by a decrease in the power of the EEG, and, on the contrary, the activation of the avoidance reaction is accompanied by an increase in the power of the EEG alpha waves.

Among these are alterations of brain oscillations in the gamma-frequency EEG band in adults and children with ASD, whose origin has been linked to dysfunctions of inhibitory interneuron signaling. While therapeutic interventions aimed to modulate gamma oscillations are being tested for neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia, the prospects for therapeutic gamma modulation in ASD have not been extensively studied. Accordingly, we discuss gamma-related alterations in the setting of ASD pathophysiology, as well as potential interventions that can enhance gamma oscillations in patients with ASD. Ultimately, we argue that transcranial electrical stimulation modalities capable of entraining gamma oscillations, and thereby potentially modulating inhibitory interneuron circuitry, are promising methods to study and mitigate gamma alterations in ASD. Lay Summary Brain functions are mediated by various oscillatory waves of neuronal activity, ranging in amplitude and frequency. In certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, reduced high-frequency oscillations in the "gamma" band have been observed, and therapeutic interventions to enhance such activity are being explored. Here, we review and comment on evidence of reduced gamma activity in ASD, arguing that modalities used in other disorders may benefit individuals with ASD as well.

J	Griffiths, JD; McIntosh, AR; Lefebvre, J				Griffiths, John D.; McIntosh, Anthony Randal; Lefebvre, Jeremie			A Connectome-Based, Corticothalamic Model of State- and Stimulation-Dependent Modulation of Rhythmic Neural Activity and Connectivity	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neural mass and field models; MEG magnetoencephalography; EEG electroencephalography; connectome; alpha rhythm; brain stimulation	FIELD-THEORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; BRAIN-STIMULATION; MASS MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; MECHANISMS; INHIBITION	Rhythmic activity in the brain fluctuates with behaviour and cognitive state, through a combination of coexisting and interacting frequencies. At large spatial scales such as those studied in human M/EEG, measured oscillatory dynamics are believed to arise primarily from a combination of cortical (intracolumnar) and corticothalamic rhythmogenic mechanisms. Whilst considerable progress has been made in characterizing these two types of neural circuit separately, relatively little work has been done that attempts to unify them into a single consistent picture. This is the aim of the present paper. We present and examine a whole-brain, connectome-based neural mass model with detailed long-range cortico-cortical connectivity and strong, recurrent corticothalamic circuitry. This system reproduces a variety of known features of human M/EEG recordings, including spectral peaks at canonical frequencies, and functional connectivity structure that is shaped by the underlying anatomical connectivity. Importantly, our model is able to capture state- (e.g., idling/active) dependent fluctuations in oscillatory activity and the coexistence of multiple oscillatory phenomena, as well as frequency-specific modulation of functional connectivity. We find that increasing the level of sensory drive to the thalamus triggers a suppression of the dominant low frequency rhythms generated by corticothalamic loops, and subsequent disinhibition of higher frequency endogenous rhythmic behaviour of intracolumnar microcircuits. These combine to yield simultaneous decreases in lower frequency and increases in higher frequency components of the M/EEG power spectrum during states of high sensory or cognitive drive. Building on this, we also explored the effect of pulsatile brain stimulation on ongoing oscillatory activity, and evaluated the impact of coexistent frequencies and state-dependent fluctuations on the response of cortical networks. Our results provide new insight into the role played by cortical and corticothalamic circuits in shaping intrinsic brain rhythms, and suggest new directions for brain stimulation therapies aimed at state-and frequency-specific control of oscillatory brain activity.

Hearing Aids Do Not Alter Cortical Entrainment to Speech at Audible Levels in Mild-to-Moderately Hearing-Impaired Subjects	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical entrainment; hearing impairment; hearing aid evaluation; speech detection; electroencephalography	COCKTAIL PARTY; NEURAL ENTRAINMENT; SPOKEN SENTENCES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RESPONSES; COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; EEG; MEG	Background Cortical entrainment to speech correlates with speech intelligibility and attention to a speech stream in noisy environments. However, there is a lack of data on whether cortical entrainment can help in evaluating hearing aid fittings for subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss. One particular problem that may arise is that hearing aids may alter the speech stimulus during (pre-)processing steps, which might alter cortical entrainment to the speech. Here, the effect of hearing aid processing on cortical entrainment to running speech in hearing impaired subjects was investigated. Methodology Seventeen native English-speaking subjects with mild-to-moderate hearing loss participated in the study. Hearing function and hearing aid fitting were evaluated using standard clinical procedures. Participants then listened to a 25-min audiobook under aided and unaided conditions at 70 dBA sound pressure level (SPL) in quiet conditions. EEG data were collected using a 32-channel system. Cortical entrainment to speech was evaluated using decoders reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG data. Null decoders, obtained from EEG and the time-reversed speech envelope, were used to assess the chance level reconstructions. Entrainment in the delta- (1-4 Hz) and theta- (4-8 Hz) band, as well as wideband (1-20 Hz) EEG data was investigated. Results Significant cortical responses could be detected for all but one subject in all three frequency bands under both aided and unaided conditions. However, no significant differences could be found between the two conditions in the number of responses detected, nor in the strength of cortical entrainment. The results show that the relatively small change in speech input provided by the hearing aid was not sufficient to elicit a detectable change in cortical entrainment. Conclusion For subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss, cortical entrainment to speech in quiet at an audible level is not affected by hearing aids. These results clear the pathway for exploring the potential to use cortical entrainment to running speech for evaluating hearing aid fitting at lower speech intensities (which could be inaudible when unaided), or using speech in noise conditions.

Prioritizing relevant information has been linked to theta frequency neural oscillations in lateral prefrontal cortex and suppressing irrelevant information has been linked to alpha oscillations in occipito-parietal cortex [3, 11]. Here, we used a retrospective-cue WM paradigm to manipulate prioritization and suppression task demands designed to drive theta oscillations in prefrontal cortex and alpha oscillations in parietal cortex, respectively. To causally test the role of these neural oscillations, we applied rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in either theta or alpha frequency to prefrontal and parietal regions identified using functional MRI. The effect of rhythmic TMS on WM performance was dependent on whether the TMS frequency matched or mismatched the expected underlying task-driven oscillations of the targeted region. Functional MRI in the targeted regions predicted subsequent TMS effects across subjects supporting a model by which theta oscillations are excitatory to neural activity, and alpha oscillations are inhibitory. Together, these results causally establish dissociable roles for prefrontal theta oscillations and parietal alpha oscillations in the control of internally maintained WM representations.

An open-source toolbox for measuring dynamic video framerates and synchronizing video stimuli with neural and behavioral responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Oscillations; Video presentation; EEG; MATLAB toolbox; Visual stimuli; Steady-state evoked potentials; Entrainment	VISUAL-CORTEX; SPEECH; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; ENTRAINMENT; MACAQUE; PHASE	Background: Researchers rely on the specified capabilities of their hardware and software even though, in reality, these capabilities are often not achieved. Considering that the number of experiments examining neural oscillations has increased steadily, easy-to-implement tools for testing the capabilities of hardware and software are necessary. New method: We present an open-source MATLAB toolbox, the Schultz Cigarette Burn Toolbox (SCiBuT) that allows users to benchmark the capabilities of their visual display devices and align neural and behavioral responses with veridical timing of visual stimuli. Specifically, the toolbox marks the corners of the display with black or white squares to indicate the timing of the onset of static images and the timing of frame changes within videos. Using basic hardware (i.e., a photodiode, an Arduino microcontroller, and an analogue input box), the light changes in the corner of the screen can be captured and synchronized with EEG recordings and/or behavioral responses. Results: We demonstrate that the SCiBuT is sensitive to framerate inconsistencies and provide examples of hardware setups that are suboptimal for measuring fine timing. Finally, we show that inconsistencies in framerate during video presentation can affect EEG oscillations. Conclusions: The SCiBuT provides tools to benchmark framerates and frame changes and to synchronize frame changes with neural and behavioral signals. This is the first open-source toolbox that can perform these functions. The SCiBuT can be freely downloaded (www.band-lab.com/scibut) and be used during experimental trials to improve the accuracy and precision of timestamps to ensure videos are presented at the intended framerate.

J	Shibata, T; Otsubo, H				Shibata, Takashi; Otsubo, Hiroshi			Phase-amplitude coupling of delta brush unveiling neuronal modulation development in the neonatal brain	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Neonate; Modulation index; Direct mean vector length; White matter; Developing modulator	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NMDA RECEPTORS; SEIZURE-ONSET; CORTEX; EEG; RIPPLES; SLEEP	Introduction: Delta brushes are an indicator of brain maturity on a neonatal EEG. We investigated phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between slow delta waves and superimposed alpha-beta activity in delta brushes to elucidate the spatiotemporal developments of the delta brush with post-menstrual weeks (PMW). Methods: The subjects were 18 neurologically intact patients (seven girls). We analyzed EEG within 42 PMW. Patients were divided into four age groups as follows: PMW <= 30w; 31-34 w; 35-38 w; and 39-42 w. We selected up to three epochs of 2-minute EEG segments including delta brushes. We calculated the modulation index (MI), direct mean vector length (dMVL), and mean of phase angle of coupling by PAC between slow waves (0.5-1.5 Hz) and fast activities (8-25 Hz) in four regions (F: Fp1 and Fp2, C: C3 and C4, T: T3 and T4, O: O1 and O2). Results: We collected data from 18 patients and 31 epochs between 29 and 42 PMW, which comprised one, four, five, and eight patients, and two, seven, eight, and 14 epochs in the <= 30w, 31-34 w, 35-38 w, and 39-42 w groups, respectively. There were significant differences in the dMVL between the four regions in age groups <= 30w (P = 0.033) and 31-34w (0.017). Both MI and dMVL showed that delta brushes became higher in the occipital region from 32 to 36 PMW. The mean phase angle of coupling concentrated around either 0 degrees or 180 degrees for all age groups. Conclusions: PAC analysis revealed the spatiotemporal relations of alpha-beta activities that are modulated by slow delta waves in neonatal delta brushes. The delta brushes appeared to be at a maximum around 32-36 PMW with the predominant occipital distribution. The PAC of the delta brush might represent the cortical neuronal fast activity that is modulated by slow delta waves of subcortical regions during a particular neonatal period.

Effects of Neuronic Shutter Observed in the EEG Alpha Rhythm	ENEURO			English	Article						alpha rhythm; EEG; visual-evoked potential; neuronic shutter; visual conduction delay	BRAIN WAVES; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; PHASE; PERCEPTION; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; MODULATION; ATTENTION; TOOLBOX	The posterior alpha (alpha) rhythm, seen in human electroencephalogram (EEG), is posited to originate from cycling inhibitory/excitatory states of visual relay cells in the thalamus. These cycling states are thought to lead to oscillating visual sensitivity levels termed the "neuronic shutter effect." If true, perceptual performance should be predictable by observed alpha phase (of cycling inhibitory/excitatory states) relative to the timeline of afferentiation onto the visual cortex. Here, we tested this hypothesis by presenting contrast changes at near perceptual threshold intensity through closed eyelids to 20 participants (balanced for gender) during times of spontaneous alpha oscillations. To more accurately and rigorously test the shutter hypothesis than ever before, alpha rhythm phase and amplitude were calculated relative to each individual's retina-to-primary visual cortex (V1) conduction delay, estimated from the individual's C1 visual-evoked potential (VEP) latency. Our results show that stimulus observation rates (ORs) are greater at a trough than a peak of the posterior alpha rhythm when phase is measured at the individual's conduction delay relative to stimulus onset. Specifically, the optimal phase for stimulus observation was found to be 272.41 degrees, where ORs are 20.96% greater than the opposing phase of 92.41 degrees. The perception-phase relationship is modulated by alpha rhythm amplitude and is not observed at lower amplitude oscillations. Collectively, these results provide support to the "neuronic shutter" hypothesis and demonstrate a phase and timing relationship consistent with the theory that cycling excitability in the thalamic relay cells underly posterior alpha oscillations.

The present study aims to show the adverse effects of cognitive decline in PD patients via the EEG-Brain Oscillations approach by comparing the electrophysiological responses in two modalities, i.e. auditory, and visual in which PD group show deficit. We conducted a study in which we analyzed event-related theta power and phase-locking during auditory and visual oddball paradigm. Cognitively normal PD (PDCN) patients (N = 15), PD with mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI) patients (N = 22), PD dementia (PDD) patients (N = 11) and healthy controls (HC) (N = 17) were included in the study. Neuropsychological assessments were applied to all participants. There was a gradual decrease in scores of neuropsychological tests (HC, PDCN, PDMCI, PDD, respectively). Most of the neuropsychological test scores of the participants were highly correlated with the theta power and theta phase locking values, especially over frontal-central areas. HC had higher theta phase-locking and power in comparison to PDMCI and PDD. The differentiation between HC and PDCN was specific to frontal-central areas. Theta power and theta phase-locking were decreased overall locations in PDMCI and PDD both during visual and auditory oddball paradigms compared with PDCN. The results indicate that theta responses in PD patients decreased gradually as the cognitive decline increased. We can conclude that complex abnormalities in their neurotransmitter and neuronal signal systems that occur with the progression of the disease could be responsible for these results.

Subjects were epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for the localization of epileptic seizures. Subjects performed a modified Sternberg task in which the encoding of memory items, maintenance, and recall were temporally separated. The dataset includes simultaneously recorded scalp EEG with the 10-20 system, intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded with depth electrodes, waveforms and spike times of neurons recorded in the medial temporal lobe, and localization information on the depth electrodes. Subject characteristics and information on each trial (set size, match/mismatch, correct/incorrect, response, and response time) are given. For technical validation of data, we provide spike sorting quality metrics and the spectra of iEEG and scalp EEG signals. This dataset enables the investigation of working memory by providing simultaneous scalp EEG and iEEG recordings, which can be used for connectivity analysis, along with hard-to-obtain neuronal recordings from humans.

The major objective of the present study was to explore the effects of human aging on the neurodynamics of motor-related EEG theta activity during correct motor response generation. Response-related potentials of young and older adults elicited in auditory and visual four-choice sensorimotor tasks were analyzed in the time-frequency domain. The phase-locking factor and total power were computed at motor cortical regions contra- and ipsilateral to the movement and at the midline to reflect phase synchronization and power of motor theta oscillations. Major results demonstrated that in both young and older adults, a pronounced response-locked theta activity (3.5-7 Hz) was generated at premotor, motor and sensorimotor cortical regions contra-lateral to the responding hand. Aging was associated with a decreased lateral asymmetry in the phase synchronization of only the left-hand responses. Also, there was a strong aging-related suppression of theta power at the medial fronto-central region that was specifically enhanced and correlated with response speed only in young adults. These results confirm the involvement of theta oscillations in movement generation in relation to action coordination in humans. Also, they show that aging is associated with a dysfunction of the oscillatory theta system for motor action regulation due to a strong suppression of a medial frontal integrating mechanism and an impaired balance in the functional control of responses with the right and the left hand.

Epilepsy is a disorder in which a recurrent and sudden malfunction of the brain is characterized. It is proposed to classify, detect and localize Epileptic multi-channel EEG through various power and novel power variance features non-invasively. This work presents power spectral estimation (PSE) using time-frequency analysis of EEG signals in both parametric (FFT) and non-parametric methods (i.e. Welch, Burg, Covariance, MUSIC and Yule-Walker). To examine the robustness of power features for different methods, the analysis ofpvalue is performed. The detection of epileptic seizure is classified using different kernels through SVM. It is observed from the PSE that the power features have higher values in epileptic subjects as compared to non-epileptic subjects. Amongst all the parametric and non-parametric methods, the MUSIC method gives the highest average power. Sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy are 100% for Welch, Burg, Covariance, and Yule-Walker methods while MUSIC and FFT methods deliver 98.73 and 99.52% respectively. The novelty is introduced through the quantification of power and power variance robust feature region/lobe-wise. This quantification is used for the localization of 25 epileptic subjects. Analysis of the parametric and non-parametric PSD methods for extraction of power and power variance features is not used by any study. These are effectively utilized for detection and localization of epilepsy non-invasively.

This retrospective study investigated the differences in the depth of anesthesia through EEG analysis between propofol- and thiopental-induced anesthesia. We reviewed data of 42 patients undergoing cesarean section who received either thiopental (5mg/kg) or propofol (2mg/kg). EEG data were extracted from the bispectral index (BIS) monitor, and 10-second segments were selected from the following sections: 1) Stage I, BIS below 60 after induction; 2) Stage II, after intubation completion; 3) Stage III, end-tidal sevoflurane above 0vol%. The risk of awareness was represented by the BIS and entropy measures. In Stage III, the thiopental group (n=20) showed significantly higher BIS value than the propofol group (n=22) (67.9 [18.66] vs 44.5 [20.63], respectively, p=0.002). The thiopental group had decreased slow-delta oscillations and increased beta-oscillations as compared to the propofol group in Stages II and III (p<0.05). BIS, spectral entropy, and Renyi permutation entropy were also higher in the thiopental group at Stages II and III (p<0.05). In conclusion, frontal spectral EEG analysis demonstrated that propofol induction maintained a deeper anesthesia than thiopental in pregnant women.

Here, 42 white participants underwent electroencephalographic recording while observing social encounters involving dynamic displays of nonverbal behaviors by racial in-group and out-group avatar characters. Dynamic behaviors included approach and avoidance poses and expressions, followed by the participants' ratings of the avatars displaying them. Behaviorally, participants showed longer RTs when evaluating in-group approach behavior compared with other behaviors, possibly suggesting increased interest and attention devoted to processing positive social encounters with their in-group members. Analyses of ERPs revealed differential sensitivity of the N450 and late positivity components to social cues, with the former showing initial sensitivity to the presence of a humanoid avatar character at the beginning of social encounters and the latter showing sensitivity to dynamic nonverbal behaviors displayed by the avatars. Moreover, time-frequency analysis of electroencephalography data also identified suppression of beta-range power linked to the observation of dynamic nonverbal behaviors. Notably, the magnitude of these responses was modulated by the degree of behavioral racial in-group bias. This suggests that differential neural sensitivity to nonverbal cues while observing social encounters is associated with subsequent in-group bias manifested in the evaluation of such encounters. Collectively, these findings shed light on the mechanisms of racial in-group bias in social cognition and have implications for understanding factors related to successful interactions with individuals from diverse racial backgrounds.

Two different patients were worked with to validate the results, and the signals were recorded for 4 seconds at a frequency of 500Hz. The patients were exposed to visual and auditory stimuli in different cases, whose frequency of appearance remained constant. For the recording of the signals, a 4-channel acquisition system was designed, which could be configured to work with unipolar or bipolar derivation, as required by the experiment. The selection of the best base in the multi-resolution wavelet analysis, two important parameters were taken into account, the measurement of entropy and the percentages of classification of these levels, because the evoked potentials are generally constant in their morphology, it was made coherent averaging giving as a result the space-time location where this evoked potential appears, Once the characteristics of the treated signal were obtained, they were classified using two different methods of artificial intelligence, neural networks and vector support machines. At this stage, the measurement of the standard deviation of the data was taken into account to ensure that the learning machine was trained correctly. The results obtained reliably demonstrate the general behaviour of the evoked potentials as a result of the stimuli presented. In addition, it was possible to verify the variation of the patient's alpha waves according to his or her state of relaxation or alert in each case, it is advisable to carry out a much more robust filtering system to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG signal, facilitate its analysis and improve the results.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is commonly used to record the electrical functioning from the brain. These recorded EEG signals have non-stationary and non-linear characteristics. In this chapter, we have introduced a new methodology based on Fourier-Bessel series expansion (FBSE) and empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for the classification of epileptic seizure EEG signals. The scale-space representation based detection of boundaries has been adapted for the segmentation of the FBSE spectrum obtained with EEG signals, and the EWT is utilized to obtain narrow sub-band signals. Then, the Hilbert marginal spectrum (HMS) of these sub-band signals have been obtained with FBSE-EWT. Afterwards, the line length and entropy features have been computed from obtained HMSs corresponding to different oscillatory levels of the EEG signals. To reduce the feature space, the Kruskal-Wallis test based feature ranking is applied. The selected features after feature ranking are used in random forest (RF) classifier for classifying normal from healthy subjects and seizure from epileptic subjects using EEG signals. The classification is also validated with 10-fold cross-validation and 50% training-50% testing data techniques. In addition to these techniques, the 5-fold cross-validation and 40% training-60% testing data techniques have been also applied on the significant features corresponding to maximum classification accuracies obtained with 10-fold cross-validation and 50% training-50% testing data techniques in order to reduce computational complexity. The assessment of classification performance is also evaluated in terms of classification accuracy for different sample lengths of EEG signals. The obtained maximum classification accuracy in this proposed method is 100%, with 50% training-50% testing data technique. The proposed method may help the neurologists for the identification of healthy and epileptic subjects from EEG signals.

Spontaneous Brain Oscillations and Perceptual Decision-Making	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							ALPHA-BAND; PRESTIMULUS OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; DETECTION PERFORMANCE; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; MU RHYTHM; POWER; EEG	Making rapid decisions on the basis of sensory information is essential to everyday behaviors. Why, then, are perceptual decisions so variable despite unchanging inputs? Spontaneous neural oscillations have emerged as a key predictor of trial-to-trial perceptual variability. New work casting these effects in the framework of models of perceptual decision-making has driven novel insight into how the amplitude of spontaneous oscillations impact decision-making. This synthesis reveals that the amplitude of ongoing low-frequency oscillations (<30 Hz), particularly in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz), bias sensory responses and change conscious perception but not, surprisingly, the underly-ing sensitivity of perception. A key model-based insight is that various decision thresholds do not adapt to alpha-related changes in sensory activity, demon-strating a seeming suboptimality of decision mechanisms in tracking endoge-nous changes in sensory responses.

A single psychotomimetic dose of ketamine decreases thalamocortical spindles and delta oscillations in the sedated rat	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Clozapine; Midline thalamic nuclei; NMDA glutamate receptors; Quantitative EEG; Sleep; Thalamic reticular nucleus	NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; IN-VIVO; BASAL FOREBRAIN; SLEEP SPINDLES; SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FEEDBACK CONTROLS; GLYCINE SITE	Background: In patients with psychotic disorders, sleep spindles are reduced, supporting the hypothesis that the thalamus and glutamate receptors play a crucial etio-pathophysiological role, whose underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesized that a reduced function of NMDA receptors is involved in the spindle deficit observed in schizophrenia. Methods: An electrophysiological multisite cell-to-network exploration was used to investigate, in pentobarbital-sedated rats, the effects of a single psychotomimetic dose of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine in the sensorimotor and associative/cognitive thalamocortical (TC) systems. Results: Under the control condition, spontaneously-occurring spindles (intra-frequency: 10-16 waves/s) and delta-frequency (1-4 Hz) oscillations were recorded in the frontoparietal cortical EEG, in thalamic extracellular recordings, in dual juxtacellularly recorded GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and glutamatergic TC neurons, and in intracellularly recorded TC neurons. The TRN cells rhythmically exhibited robust high-frequency bursts of action potentials (7 to 15 APs at 200-700 Hz). A single administration of low-dose ketamine fleetingly reduced TC spindles and delta oscillations, amplified ongoing gamma-(30-80 Hz) and higher-frequency oscillations, and switched the firing pattern of both TC and TRN neurons from a burst mode to a single AP mode. Furthermore, ketamine strengthened the gamma-frequency band TRN-TC connectivity. The antipsychotic clozapine consistently prevented the ketamine effects on spindles, delta- and gamma-/higher-frequency TC oscillations. Conclusion: The present findings support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor hypofunction is involved in the reduction in sleep spindles and delta oscillations. The ketamine-induced swift conversion of ongoing TC-TRN activities may have involved at least both the ascending reticular activating system and the corticothalamic pathway. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Macro and micro sleep architecture and cognitive performance in older adults	NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; SLOW OSCILLATION; INCIDENT DEMENTIA; NEURON NUMBERS; REM-SLEEP; MEMORY; SPINDLES; IMPAIRMENT	In their analysis of two datasets, Djonlagic et al. identify 23 objective sleep metrics that predict cognitive performance and processing speed in older adults. We sought to determine which facets of sleep neurophysiology were most strongly linked to cognitive performance in 3,819 older adults from two independent cohorts, using whole-night electroencephalography. From over 150 objective sleep metrics, we identified 23 that predicted cognitive performance, and processing speed in particular, with effects that were broadly independent of gross changes in sleep quality and quantity. These metrics included rapid eye movement duration, features of the electroencephalography power spectra derived from multivariate analysis, and spindle and slow oscillation morphology and coupling. These metrics were further embedded within broader associative networks linking sleep with aging and cardiometabolic disease: individuals who, compared with similarly aged peers, had better cognitive performance tended to have profiles of sleep metrics more often seen in younger, healthier individuals. Taken together, our results point to multiple facets of sleep neurophysiology that track coherently with underlying, age-dependent determinants of cognitive and physical health trajectories in older adults.

Cortical areas exploit processes of predictive coding that collect sensorial inputs to build and update internal perceptual models. Modifications to the internal representation of the body have been associated with eating disorders. In the light of this, obese subjects were selected as a valid experimental model to explore predictive coding in haptic perception. To this purpose, we performed electroencephalographic (EEG) continuous recordings during a haptic task in normally weighted versus obese subjects. EEG power spectra were analyzed in different time intervals. The quality of haptic performance in the obese group was poorer than in control subjects, though exploration times were similar. Spectral analysis showed a significant decrease in theta, alpha and beta frequencies in the right temporo-parietal areas of obese group, whereas gamma bands significantly increased in the left frontal areas. These results suggest that severe obesity could be characterized by an impairment in haptic performances and an altered activation of multisensory integrative cortical areas. These are involved in functional coding of external stimuli, which could interfere with the ability to process a predicted condition.

Patients with fibromyalgia show increased beta connectivity across distant networks and microstates alterations in resting-state electroencephalogram	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SF-36 HEALTH SURVEY; WORKING-MEMORY; EVOKED POTENTIALS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA RHYTHMS; EEG; PAIN; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION	Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain of unknown etiology associated with alterations in the central nervous system. Although previous studies demonstrated altered patterns of brain activity during pain processing in patients with FM, alterations in spontaneous brain oscillations, in terms of functional connectivity or microstates, have been barely explored so far. Here we recorded the EEG from 43 patients with FM and 51 healthy controls during open-eyes resting-state. We analyzed the functional connectivity between different brain networks computing the phase lag index after group Independent Component Analysis, and also performed an EEG microstates analysis. Patients with FM showed increased beta band connectivity between different brain networks and alterations in some microstates parameters (specifically lower occurrence and coverage of microstate class C). We speculate that the observed alterations in spontaneous EEG may suggest the dominance of endogenous top-down influences; this could be related to limited processing of novel external events and the deterioration of flexible behavior and cognitive control frequently reported for FM. These findings provide the first evidence of alterations in long-distance phase connectivity and microstate indices at rest, and represent progress towards the understanding of the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and the identification of novel biomarkers for its diagnosis.

Specifically, this study sought to explore the differential and combinational effects of commentary sound and on-site spectator sound on the motor resonance and attentional process of viewers. To analyze, this study selected electroencephalogram (EEG) time-frequency analysis using wavelet transforms as a method to observe the viewers' direct brain responses. The overall findings suggest that delivering on-site spectator's sound needs to be regarded as important as it can have a significant effect on viewers' sports-viewing experience.

Here, we investigated if frontal power band activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during aversive mental imagery is modulated by social touch from one's romantic partner and a stranger. We observed the highest theta and beta power when imaging alone, next so when being touched by a stranger, with lowest theta and beta activity during holding hands with the loved one. Delta power was higher when being alone than with a stranger or a partner, with no difference between the two. Gamma power was highest during the stranger condition and lower both when being alone and with the partner, while alpha power did not change as a function of social touch. Theta power displayed a positive correlation with electrodermal activity supporting its relation to emotional arousal. Attachment style modulated the effect of touch on the EEG as only secure but not insecure partner bonding was associated with theta power reductions. Because theta power was sensitive to the experimental perturbations, mapped onto peripheral physiological arousal and reflected partner attachment style we suggest that frontal theta power might serve as an EEG derived bio-marker for social touch in emotionally significant dyads.

Given that about half of the patients diagnosed with MDD do not respond to the various current treatments, new techniques are being sought to predict not only the course of the disease but also the characteristics that differentiate responders from non-responders. Using the electroencephalogram, a noninvasive and inexpensive tool, most studies have proposed that patients with MDD have some lateralization in brain electrical activity, with alterations in alpha and theta rhythms being observed, which would be related to dysfunctions in emotional capacity such as the absence or presence of responses to the different existing treatments. These alterations help in the identification of subjects at high risk of suffering from depression, in the differentiation into responders and nonresponders to various therapies (pharmacological, electroconvulsive therapy, and so on), as well as to establish in which period of the disease the treatment will be more effective. Although the data are still inconclusive and more research is needed, these alpha and theta neurophysiological markers could support future clinical practice when it comes to establishing an early diagnosis and treating state disorders more successfully and accurately of mood disorders.

J	Harquel, S; Guerraz, M; Barraud, PA; Cian, C				Harquel, Sylvain; Guerraz, Michel; Barraud, Pierre-Alain; Cian, Corinne			Modulation of alpha waves in sensorimotor cortical networks during self-motion perception evoked by different visual-vestibular conflicts	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha waves; electroencephalography; self-motion; sensorimotor networks; vection	OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION; OBJECT-MOTION; OPTIC-FLOW; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; VECTION; FMRI; DIRECTION; CORTEX	Visually induced illusion of self-motion (vection) has been used as a tool to address neural correlates of visual-vestibular interaction. The extent to which vestibular cortical areas are deactivated during vection varies from one study to another. The main question in this study is whether such deactivation depends on the visual-vestibular conflict induced by visual motion. A visual motion about the line of sight (roll motion) induces a visual-canal conflict in upright and supine observers. An additional visual-otolith conflict arises in the upright position only, with the graviceptive inputs indicating that the head is stationary. A 96-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 21 participants exposed to roll motion in seated and supine positions. Meanwhile, perceptual state of self-motion was recorded. Results showed a transient decrease in the cortical sensorimotor networks' alpha activity at the onset of vection whatever the participant's position, and therefore the visual-vestibular conflict. During vection, an increase in alpha activity over parieto-occipital areas was observed in the upright condition, that is, in a condition of visual-otolith conflict. The modulation of alpha activity may be predictive of the illusion of self-motion but also may reflect the level of inhibition in the sensorimotor networks needed to reduce potential interference from vestibular conflicting inputs. NEW & NOTEWORTHY For the first time, we explored the neural correlates of different visuo-vestibular conflicts induced by visual motion using EEG. Our study highlighted a neuronal signature for illusory self-motion (vection) in the sensorimotor networks. Strong alpha activity may predict successful vection but also reflects the level of inhibition of sensorimotor networks needed to reduce potential interfering vestibular inputs. These findings would be of prime importance for simulator and virtual reality systems that induce vection.

Psychophysiological methods for diagnostic monitoring of vigilance have focused on power spectral density measures from the electroencephalogram (EEG). This article addresses the diagnosticity of an alternative set of EEG measures, coherence between different electrode sites. Coherence metrics may index the functional connectivity between brain regions that supports sustained attention. Coherence was calculated for seven pre-defined brain networks. Workload and time-on-task factors primarily influenced alpha and theta coherence in anterior, central, and inter-hemispheric networks. Individual differences in coherence in inter-hemispheric, left intro-hemispheric and posterior networks correlated with performance. These findings demonstrate the potential applied utility of coherence metrics, although several methodological limitations and challenges must be overcome.

VR settings are useful in the context of hypothetical situations in which real-world data does not exist or in situations which involve risk and safety issues making real-world data collection infeasible. Nevertheless, VR studies can contribute to transport-related research only if the behavior elicited in a virtual environment closely resembles real-world behavior. Importantly, as VR is a relatively new research tool, the best-practice with regards to the experimental design is still to be established. In this paper, we contribute to a better understanding of the implications of the choice of the experimental setup by comparing cycling behavior in VR between two groups of participants in similar immersive scenarios, the first group controlling the maneuvers using a keyboard and the other group riding an instrumented bicycle. We critically compare the speed, acceleration, braking and head movements of the participants in the two experiments. We also collect electroencephalography (EEG) data to compare the alpha wave amplitudes and assess the engagement levels of participants in the two settings. The results demonstrate the ability of VR to elicit behavioral patterns in line with those observed in the real-world and indicate the importance of the experimental design in a VR environment beyond the choice of audio-visual stimuli. The findings will be useful for researchers in designing the experimental setup of VR for behavioral data collection.

Methods: Twenty-six young (19-33 years, 12 women) and 16 older (52-70 years, 8 women) healthy volunteers underwent a 6-day polysomnographic laboratory study. Participants spent two noise-free nights and four transportation noise exposure nights, two with continuous and two characterized by eventful noise (average sound levels of 45 dB, maximum sound levels between 50 and 62 dB for eventful noise). Generalized mixed models were used to model the time course of EEG arousal rates during NREM sleep and included cycle, age, and noise as independent variables. Results: Arousal rate variation within NREM sleep cycles was best described by a u-shaped course with variations across cycles. Older participants had higher overall arousal rates than the younger individuals with differences for the first and the fourth cycle depending on the age group. During eventful noise nights, overall arousal rates were increased compared to noise-free nights. Additional analyses suggested that the arousal rate time course was partially mediated by slow wave sleep (SWS). Conclusions: The characteristic u-shaped arousal rate time course indicates phases of reduced physiological sleep stability both at the beginning and end of NREM cycles. Small effects on the overall arousal rate by eventful noise exposure suggest a preserved physiological within- and across-cycle arousal evolution with noise exposure, while aging affected the shape depending on the cycle.

Large-Scale Desynchronization During Interictal Epileptic Discharges Recorded With Intracranial EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						intracranial electroencephalography; epileptiform discharges; epileptic focus; epilepsy surgery; surgical outcome; functional connectivity	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURAL NETWORKS; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISM; PATTERNS; SEIZURES; SIGNALS	It is increasingly recognized that deep understanding of epileptic seizures requires both localizing and characterizing the functional network of the region where they are initiated, i. e., the epileptic focus. Previous investigations of the epileptogenic focus' functional connectivity have yielded contrasting results, reporting both pathological increases and decreases during resting periods and seizures. In this study, we shifted paradigm to investigate the time course of connectivity in relation to interictal epileptiform discharges. We recruited 35 epileptic patients undergoing intracranial EEG (iEEG) investigation as part of their presurgical evaluation. For each patient, 50 interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were marked and iEEG signals were epoched around those markers. Signals were narrow-band filtered and time resolved phase-locking values were computed to track the dynamics of functional connectivity during IEDs. Results show that IEDs are associated with a transient decrease in global functional connectivity, time-locked to the peak of the discharge and specific to the high range of the gamma frequency band. Disruption of the long-range connectivity between the epileptic focus and other brain areas might be an important process for the generation of epileptic activity. Transient desynchronization could be a potential biomarker of the epileptogenic focus since 1) the functional connectivity involving the focus decreases significantly more than the connectivity outside the focus and 2) patients with good surgical outcome appear to have a significantly more disconnected focus than patients with bad outcomes.

A Dose Relationship Between Brain Functional Connectivity and Cumulative Head Impact Exposure in Collegiate Water Polo Players	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						head impacts; concussion; sports; inhibitory control; brain connectivity; electroencephalography	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; CONCUSSED INDIVIDUALS; FOOTBALL PLAYERS; INJURY; PHASE; EEG; ORGANIZATION; SEVERITY; NOISE; SPORT	A growing body of evidence suggests that chronic, sport-related head impact exposure can impair brain functional integration and brain structure and function. Evidence of a robust inverse relationship between the frequency and magnitude of repeated head impacts and disturbed brain network function is needed to strengthen an argument for causality. In pursuing such a relationship, we used cap-worn inertial sensors to measure the frequency and magnitude of head impacts sustained by eighteen intercollegiate water polo athletes monitored over a single season of play. Participants were evaluated before and after the season using computerized cognitive tests of inhibitory control and resting electroencephalography. Greater head impact exposure was associated with increased phase synchrony [r((16)) > 0.626, p < 0.03 corrected], global efficiency [r((16)) > 0.601, p < 0.04 corrected], and mean clustering coefficient [r((16)) > 0.625, p < 0.03 corrected] in the functional networks formed by slow-wave (delta, theta) oscillations. Head impact exposure was not associated with changes in performance on the inhibitory control tasks. However, those with the greatest impact exposure showed an association between changes in resting-state connectivity and a dissociation between performance on the tasks after the season [r((16)) = 0.481, p = 0.043] that could also be attributed to increased slow-wave synchrony [F-(4,F- 135) = 113.546, p < 0.001]. Collectively, our results suggest that athletes sustaining the greatest head impact exposure exhibited changes in whole-brain functional connectivity that were associated with altered information processing and inhibitory control.

Twenty-four patients with acute tinnitus, 23 patients with chronic tinnitus, and 32 healthy controls were recruited. High-density electroencephalography (EEG) was used to explore changes in brain areas and functional connectivity in different groups. When compared with healthy subjects, acute tinnitus patients had a significant reduction in superior frontal cortex activity across all frequency bands, whereas chronic tinnitus patients had a significant reduction in the superior frontal cortex at beta 3 and gamma frequency bands as well as a significant increase in the inferior frontal cortex at delta-band and superior temporal cortex at alpha 1 frequency band. When compared to the chronic tinnitus group, the acute tinnitus group activity was significantly increased in the middle frontal and parietal gyrus at the gamma-band. Functional connectivity analysis showed that the chronic tinnitus group had increased connections between the parahippocampus gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus when compared with the healthy group. Alterations of local brain activity and connections between the parahippocampus gyrus and other nonauditory areas appeared in the transition from acute to chronic tinnitus. This indicates that the appearance and development of tinnitus is a dynamic process involving aberrant local neural activity and abnormal connectivity in multifunctional brain networks.

Nevertheless, studies conducted to date have maintained the frequency ranges of the EEG bands commonly used with humans. The aim of the present work was to determine the EEG broad bands that characterize sleep and wakefulness in the spider monkey using principal component analysis (PCA). The EEG activity was recorded from the occipital, central, and frontal EEG derivations of six young-adult male spider monkeys housed in a laboratory setting. To determine which frequencies covaried and which were orthogonally independent during sleep and wakefulness, the power EEG spectra and interhemispheric and intrahemispheric EEG correlations from 1 to 30 Hz were subjected to PCA. Findings show that the EEG bands detection differed from those reported previously in both spider monkeys and humans, and that the 1-3 and 2-13 Hz frequency ranges concur with the oscillatory activity elucidated by cellular recordings of subcortical regions. Results show that applying PCA to the EEG spectrum during sleep and wakefulness in the spider monkey led to the identification of frequencies that covaried with, and were orthogonally independent of, other frequencies in each behavioral vigilance state. The new EEG bands differ from those used previously with both spider monkeys and humans. The 1-3 and 2-13 Hz frequency ranges are in accordance with the oscillatory activity elucidated by cellular recordings of subcortical regions in other mammals.

Existing evidence links these processes with the so-called default mode network (DMN). Here, using EEG data, DMN connectivity in the alpha frequency band was investigated during thinking about own qualities and qualities of other people and during dynamic evaluation of these qualities by means of presented adjectives. In the former case, DMN connectivity between the DMN and the lateral prefrontal cortex was most increased during thinking about own qualities, as compared to qualities of others. In the latter case, on the contrary, self-evaluation was accompanied by the smallest level of DMN connectivity, whereas the highest level was observed during evaluation of a stranger. This results show that connectivity between the DMN and the lateral prefrontal cortex in the alpha frequency band is involved in both cases, but the degree of its involvements depends on the complexity of the task, which is maximal for the dynamic evaluation of a stranger and for the contemplating own qualities.

The current study is an explorative study of the circadian dynamics of sleep spindles in relation to a polygenic score (PGS) for circadian preference towards morningness. The participants represent the 17-year follow-up of a birth cohort having both genome-wide data and an ambulatory sleep electroencephalography measurement available (N = 154, Mean age = 16.9, SD = 0.1 years, 57% girls). Based on a recent genome-wide association study, we calculated a PGS for circadian preference towards morningness across the whole genome, including 354 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Stage 2 slow (9-12.5 Hz, N = 186 739) and fast (12.5-16 Hz, N = 135 504) sleep spindles were detected using an automated algorithm with individual time tags and amplitudes for each spindle. There was a significant interaction of PGS for morningness and timing of sleep spindles across the night. These growth curve models showed a curvilinear trajectory of spindle amplitudes: those with a higher PGS for morningness showed higher slow spindle amplitudes in frontal derivations, and a faster dissipation of spindle amplitude in central derivations. Overall, the findings provide new evidence on how individual sleep spindle trajectories are influenced by genetic factors associated with circadian type. The finding may lead to new hypotheses on the associations previously observed between circadian types, psychiatric problems and spindle activity.

This study presents an experimental design aimed to capture auditory event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related oscillations (ERO) to an oddball task with a fixed stimulus to stimulus interval (SOA = 1000 ms), rare targets (2000 Hz, 10% rate), frequent nontargets (1500 Hz, 80%), and rare stimulus omissions (10%). The data, expectedly, reveal highly robust effects distinguishing target and nontarget conditions. It was also revealed that p50, n100, and p200 ERP components related to sensory gating and observed for nontarget stimuli were strongly facilitated in responses to nontargets following omissions compared to nontargets following nontargets; this facilitation was also prominent for early event-related synchronization observed from delta to upper alpha bands. This experimental paradigm, therefore, enables assessment of a wide range of EEG biomarkers related to selective attention and sensory gating, and is a promising candidate for EEG endophenotype research in neuropsychiatry.

If the normal humans do not sleep properly so its generate many diseases. Bruxism is a neurological or sleep syndrome. Its individuals involuntarily grind the teeth. Bruxism covered in 8-31% of the whole sleep disorders like Insomnia, Narcolepsy etc. The present research focused on three steps such as data selection, filtration, and normalized value of theta activity. Additionally, the three sleep stages of non rapid eye movement such as S0, S1, S2 and rapid eye movement. In addition to parietal occipital (P4-O2) Electroencephalogram (EEG), channels are used in the present work. The total number of eighteen subjects such as bruxism and healthy human studied to this work. The average value of the normal human's theta activity is higher than bruxism in all sleep stages such as S0, S1, S2 and rapid eye movement. Moreover, the proposed research is in accurate than other traditional system.

Children with LDs experience substantial working memory (WM) deficits, even more pronounced if more than one of the academic skills is affected. We compared the task-related electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectral density of children with LDs (n = 23) with a control group of children with good academic achievement (n = 22), during the performance of a WM task. sLoreta was used to estimate the current distribution at the sources, and 18 brain regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen with an extended version of the eigenvector centrality mapping technique. In this way, we lessened some drawbacks of the traditional EEG at the sensor space by an analysis at the brain-sources level over data-driven selected ROIs. Results: The LD group showed fewer correct responses in the WM task, an overall slower EEG with more delta and theta activity, and less high-frequency gamma activity in posterior areas. We explain these EEG patterns in LD children as indices of an inefficient neural resource management related with a delay in neural maturation.

However, the electrophysiological mechanisms of response activation and response inhibition in prolactinomas remain unclear. We recorded participants' scalp electmencephalography (EEG) in a visual Go/Nogo task. Compared to the healthy controls (HCs), the patients demonstrated worse performance and their prolactin (PRL) levels negatively correlated with behavioral results. Meanwhile, patients' P300 amplitudes in the Go and Nogo conditions were smaller than the HCs. The amplitudes of N200nogo in patients were smaller than the HCs as well. Lower frontal theta power was found in the patients than the HCs in both Go and Nogo conditions, which indicated a deficit in response activation and inhibition. Moreover, the PRL levels mediated the relationship between frontal theta power and behavior performance, implying that lower frontal theta power caused the dysfunction of response control by abnormally high PRL levels. Patients also showed lower occipital alpha power than the HCs, which suggested that the impaired response inhibition may arise from deficient attention control. Taken together, the present study revealed the neurocognitive discrepancies between prolactinomas and the HCs. The frontal theta oscillation was highlighted as the electmphysiological markers of the impaired response control in prolactinomas.

By pairing EEG data acquisition with simultaneous measurements of pupil diameter, which is thought to reflect norepinephrinergic arousal, this study tested whether transient changes in EEG oscillations in the alpha frequency range (8-12 Hz) following performance mistakes may reflect error-evoked arousal. In the inter-trial interval following performance mistakes (approximately 8% of trials), pupil diameter increased and EEG alpha power decreased, compared to the inter-trial interval following correct responses. Moreover when trials were binned based on pupil diameter on a within-subjects basis, trials with greater pupil diameter were associated with lower EEG alpha power during the inter-trial interval. This pattern of association suggests that error-related alpha suppression, like pupil dilation, reflects arousal in response to error commission. Errors were also followed by worse next-trial performance, implying that error-evoked arousal may not always be beneficial for adaptive control.

Methods: A total of 97 children aged from 3 to 6 were enrolled in the present study. After resting-state EEG data recording, the children performed eye-tracking tests individually on own-race and other-race stranger faces stimuli. Power spectrum analysis was used for EEG analysis and areas of interest (AOI) were selected for face gaze analysis of eye-tracking data. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) feature selection method combined with SVM classifiers were used for classification of autistic versus typically developing children. Results: Results showed that classification accuracy from combining two types of data reached a maximum of 85.44%, with AUC = 0.93, when 32 features were selected. Limitations: The sample consisted of children aged from 3 to 6, and no younger patients were included. Conclusions: Our machine learning approach, combining EEG and eye-tracking data, may be a useful tool for the identification of children with ASD, and may help for diagnostic processes.

It is one of the most recent marketing research strategies and may become the future of marketing research. Many research works have been carried out in this area to obtain better outcomes. However, literature shows that there is an opportunity for further improvement. Hence, in this study, a model is presented using data mining and machine learning algorithms for consumer behavior analysis from EEG signals. Time-frequency distribution features are extracted from EEG signals on which different classification algorithms are applied. Consumer's responses toward marketing strategies and their behavior towards purchasing or selecting goods can he studied and analyzed to understand the producer-consumer relationship. EEG signals from 25 people are collected where the participants varied in age and gender for a better understanding of consumer behavior towards a marketing policy. By analyzing the data, the reason behind how and why they like certain marketing policies was uncovered. The performance of our proposed model with an existing technique is compared. The accuracy of our model on the dataset is 95%, whereas the accuracy of the existing technique on the same dataset is 70%. We also evaluated whether neuropsychological measures can capture differences in consumer's actions according to different marketing stimuli. The experimental results on our model indicate that studies in this field can bring a change and improve marketing strategies for the betterment of both the producer and the consumer, resulting in an eventual mutual benefit.

The Role of Alpha Power in the Suppression of Anticipated Distractors During Verbal Working Memory	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; Alpha oscillations; Working memory; Distractor suppression	OSCILLATIONS; MAINTENANCE; MODULATION; INCREASE; TASK; LOAD	As working memory (WM) is limited in capacity, it is important to direct neural resources towards processing task-relevant information while ignoring distractors. Neural oscillations in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz) have been suggested to play a role in the inhibition of task-irrelevant information during WM, although results are mixed, possibly due to differences in the type of WM task employed. Here, we examined the role of alpha power in suppression of anticipated distractors of varying strength using a modified Sternberg task where the encoding and retention periods were temporally separated. We recorded EEG while 20 young adults completed the task and found: (1) slower reaction times in strong distractor trials compared to weak distractor trials; (2) increased alpha power in posterior regions from baseline prior to presentation of a distractor regardless of condition; and (3) no differences in alpha power between strong and weak distractor conditions. Our results suggest that parieto-occipital alpha power is increased prior to a distractor. However, we could not find evidence that alpha power is further modulated by distractor strength.

BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Multimodal integration; Simultaneity judgements; EEG alpha oscillations; Phase dependence; Individual alpha frequency	PHASE; INTEGRATION; PREDICTS; BAND; MODULATION; DECISION; RESET	Different inputs from a multisensory object or event are often integrated into a coherent and unitary percept, despite differences in sensory formats, neural pathways, and processing times of the involved modalities. Presumably, multisensory integration occurs if the cross-modal inputs are presented within a certain window of temporal integration where inputs are perceived as being simultaneous. Here, we examine the role of ongoing neuronal alpha (i.e. 10-Hz) oscillations in multimodal synchrony perception. While EEG was measured, participants performed a simultaneity judgement task with visual stimuli preceding auditory ones. At stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA's) of 160-200 ms, simultaneity judgements were around 50%. For trials with these SOA's, occipital alpha power was smaller preceding correct judgements, and the individual alpha frequency was correlated with the size of the temporal window of integration. In addition, simultaneity judgements were modulated as a function of oscillatory phase at 12.5 Hz, but the latter effect was only marginally significant. These results support the notion that oscillatory neuronal activity in the alpha frequency range, which has been taken to shape perceptual cycles, is instrumental in multisensory perception.

Temporal and time-frequency features were explored. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy of linear and nonlinear classification methods was assessed and compared, along with their computational times and complexity, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) yielded the best overall performance (82%).

Many previous studies of insulo-opercular seizures have been unable to separate insular and opercular onset. With adequate sampling of the insula, this study shows this is possible. Methods We analyzed intrainsular dynamics and extrainsular propagation in 12 patients with "pure" insula epilepsy (n = 9) or insular and only deepest opercular involvement (n = 3) at seizure onset. Review of semiology defined clinical groups, agglomerative cluster, and principal component analysis of semiological features were performed. Quantitative epileptogenicity, and intrainsular and extrainsular propagation were computed via time frequency analysis and epileptogenicity mapping. Results Seizure onset patterns were heterogeneous; the seizure onset zone was focal. Seizure onset and first ictal change within insula functional subdivision correlated with aura and reflex component. No paninsular spread occurred; contralateral insular spread was very early. While the discharge was intrainsular, clinical signs related to aura or vegetative signs. Extrainsular propagation was early and related to the emergence of the majority of clinical signs. Cluster analysis found an anterior, intermediate, and posterior insula seizure onset group. The largest principal component separated anterior insula manifestations, including early hypermotor signs, early recovery, and no aura from posterior insula features of early dystonia, early tonic motor features, and sensorimotor aura. Interpretation Aura is vital to identifying seizure onset and relates to insula functional subdivision. Seizures are heterogenous; extrainsular propagation occurs early, accounting for most of the semiology. With adequate sampling, "pure" insula epilepsy can be identified and focal curative resection is possible.

EEG was recorded for stationary sounds and for three patterns of sound motion produced by changes in interaural time differences. In two different task conditions, the participants were either reading books of their choice (passive listening) or indicating the perceived sound trajectories using a graphic tablet (active listening). We explored the effects of listening conditions and motion velocity on the MOR potential, and also on the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) calculated from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. For all the velocities, passive cortical processing of sound motion caused phase resetting of delta-to-alpha oscillations. Besides, the abrupt sound displacement induced non-coherent slow oscillations which could also contribute to the passive MOR. Focusing attention on the moving stimuli affected the MOR only between cN1 and cP2 deflections, without any effect on their peak values. The clearest evidence of top-down influence on motion processing was given by the spectral measures. Active localization of the moving sounds involved phase alignment and amplitude change of the ongoing or evoked delta-alpha activity following the start of sound motion, along with attention-related activity which was not strictly phaselocked to the sound stimuli.

One-hundred and sixty five participants took part in the study. Six minutes of eyes closed EEG resting state was recorded for each participant. Graph theoretical connectivity metrics were calculated separately for two well-established synchronization measures [weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and Imaginary Coherence (iMCOH)] and for sensor- and source EEG space. Non-verbal intelligence was measured with Raven's Progressive Matrices. In line with the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis, path lengths characteristics of the brain networks (Average and Characteristic Path lengths, Diameter and Closeness Centrality) within alpha band range were significantly correlated with non-verbal intelligence for sensor space but no for source space. According to our results, variance in non-verbal intelligence measure can be mainly explained by the graph metrics built from the networks that include both weak and strong connections between the nodes.

We estimate the directed connectivity using relative wavelet transform entropy (RWTE) and partial directed coherence (PDC) and the graphical network measures by graph theory analysis (GTA) at four frequency bands. The RWTE and PDC quantify the strength and directionality of information flow between EEG nodes. On the other hand, the GTA of the complex network measures summarizes the topological structure of the network. We then evaluate the proposed methods using machine learning classifiers. We carried out an experiment on nine subjects performing semantic vigilance task (Stroop color word test (SCWT)) for approximately 45 minutes. Behaviorally, all subjects demonstrated vigilance decrement as reflected by the significant increase in response time and reduced accuracy. The strength and directionality of information flow in the connectivity network by RWTE/PDC and the GTA measures significantly decrease with vigilance decrement, p<0.05. The classification results show that the proposed methods outperform other related and competitive methods available in the literature and achieve 100% accuracy in subject-dependent and above 89% in subject-independent level in each of the four frequency bands. The overall results indicate that the proposed methods of directed connectivity patterns and GTA provide a complementary aspect of functional connectivity. Our study suggests directed functional connectivity with GTA as informative features and highlight Support Vector Machine as the suitable classifier for classifying semantic vigilance levels.

Dose-dependent alcohol effects on electroencephalogram: Sedation/anesthesia is qualitatively distinct from sleep	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Sedation; Mouse; Polysomnography; Sleep states; Power spectra	GABAERGIC SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; EEG POWER SPECTRA; ETHANOL SENSITIVITY; BEHAVIORAL STATES; BODY-TEMPERATURE; HIPPOCAMPAL EEG; UNITED-STATES; REM-SLEEP; RAT; ANESTHESIA	Alcohol is commonly used as a sleep inducer/aid by humans. However, individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorders have sleep problems. Few studies have examined the effect of ethanol on physiological features of sedation and anesthesia, particularly at high doses. This study used polysomnography and a rapid, unbiased scoring of vigilance states with an automated algorithm to provide a thorough characterization of dose-dependent acute ethanol effects on sleep and electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra in C57BL/6J male mice. Ethanol had a narrow dose-response effect on sleep. Only a high dose (4.0 g/kg) produced a unique, transient state that could not be characterized in terms of canonical sleep-wake states, so we dubbed this novel state Drug-Induced State with a Characteristic Oscillation in the Theta Band (DISCO-T). After this anesthetic effect, the high dose of alcohol promoted NREM sleep by increasing the duration of NREM bouts while reducing wake. REM sleep was differentially responsive to the circadian timing of ethanol administration. EEG power spectra proved more sensitive to ethanol than sleep measures as there were clear effects of ethanol at 2.0 and 4.0 g/kg doses. Ethanol promoted delta oscillations and suppressed faster frequencies, but there were clear, differential effects on wake and REM EEG power based on the timing of the ethanol injection. Understanding the neural basis of the extreme soporific effects of high dose ethanol may aid in treating acute toxicity brought about by patterns of excessive binge consumption commonly observed in young people.

Different attempts have been made, mainly by comparing the normal waking state to seemingly unconscious states, such as deep sleep or general anesthesia. A more direct approach would be the neuroscientific investigation of conscious states that are experienced as free of any specific phenomenal content. Here we present serendipitous data on content-free awareness (CFA) during an EEG-fMRI assessment reported by an extraordinarily qualified meditator with over 50,000 h of practice. We focused on two specific cortical networks related to external and internal awareness, i.e., the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN), to explore the neural correlates of this experience. The combination of high-resolution EEG and ultrafast fMRI enabled us to analyze the dynamic aspects of fMRI connectivity informed by EEG power analysis. The neural correlates of CFA were characterized by a sharp decrease in alpha power and an increase in theta power as well as increases in functional connectivity in the DAN and decreases in the posterior DMN. We interpret these findings as correlates of a top-down-initiated attentional state excluding external sensory stimuli and internal mentation from conscious experience. We conclude that the investigation of states of CFA could provide valuable input for new methodological and conceptual approaches in the search for the minimal neural correlate of consciousness.

A prerequisite for further analysis is the identification of the sleep macroarchitecture through manual sleep staging. Several computer-based approaches have been proposed to extract time and/or frequency-domain features with accuracy ranging from 80% to 95% compared with the golden standard of manual staging. However, their acceptability by the medical community is still suboptimal. Recently, utilizing deep learning methodologies increased the research interest in computer-assisted recognition of sleep stages. Aiming to enhance the arsenal of automatic sleep staging, we propose a novel classification framework based on convolutional neural networks. These receive as input synchronizations features derived from cortical interactions within various electroencephalographic rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) for specific cortical regions which are critical for the sleep deepening. These functional connectivity metrics are then processed as multidimensional images. We also propose to augment the small portion of sleep onset (N1 stage) through the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique in order to deal with the great difference in its duration when compared with the remaining sleep stages. Our results (99.85%) indicate the flexibility of deep learning techniques to learn sleep-related neurophysiological patterns.

Yet, an early diagnosis of ASD is challenging as it relies on the consistent presence of behavioral symptomatology, and thus, many children are diagnosed later in development, which prevents early interventions that could benefit cognitive and social outcomes. As a result, there is growing interest in detecting early brain markers of ASD, such as in the electroencephalogram (EEG) to elucidate divergence in early development. Here, we examine the EEG of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in the transition from infancy to toddlerhood, a period of rapid development and pronounced changes in early brain function. NREM features exhibit clear developmental trajectories, are related to social and cognitive development, and may be altered in neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, spectral features of NREM sleep are poorly understood in infants/toddlers with or at high risk for ASD. Methods The present pilot study is the first to examine NREM sleep in 13- to 30-month-olds with ASD in comparison with age-matched healthy controls (TD). EEG was recorded during a daytime nap with high-density array EEG. Results We found topographically distinct decreased fast theta oscillations (5-7.25 Hz), decreased fast sigma (15-16 Hz), and increased beta oscillations (20-25 Hz) in ASD compared to TD. Conclusion These findings suggest a possible functional role of NREM sleep during this important developmental period and provide support for NREM sleep to be a potential early marker for ASD.

Both the primary motor cortex and posterior parietal cortex have successfully been used as a neural source for human motor BCI, leading to interest in exploring other brain areas involved in motor control. The amygdala is one area that has been shown to have functional connectivity to the motor system; however, its role in movement execution is not well studied. Gamma oscillations (30-200 Hz) are known to be prokinetic in the human cortex, but their role is poorly understood in subcortical structures. Here, the authors use direct electrophysiological recordings and the classic "center-out" direct-reach experiment to study amygdaloid gamma-band modulation in 8 patients with medically refractory epilepsy. METHODS The study population consisted of 8 epilepsy patients (2 men; age range 21-62 years) who underwent implantation of micro-macro depth electrodes for seizure localization and EEG monitoring. Data from the macro contacts sampled at 2000 Hz were used for analysis. The classic center-out direct-reach experiment was used, which consists of an intertrial interval phase, a fixation phase, and a response phase. The authors assessed the statistical significance of neural modulation by inspecting for nonoverlapping areas in the 95% confidence intervals of spectral power for the response and fixation phases. RESULTS In 5 of the 8 patients, power spectral analysis showed a statistically significant increase in power within regions of the gamma band during the response phase compared with the fixation phase. In these 5 patients, the 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals of trial-averaged power in contiguous frequencies of the gamma band during the response phase were above, and did not overlap with, the confidence intervals of trial-averaged power during the fixation phase. CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that direct neural recordings have been used to show gamma-band modulation in the human amygdala during the execution of voluntary movement. This work indicates that gamma-band modulation in the amygdala could be a contributing source of neural signals for use in a motor BCI system.

We have demonstrated previously with EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of human motor cortex that the positive vs. negative peak of the sensorimotor tt-oscillation reflect corticospinal low-vs. high-excitability states. In vitro experiments showed that induction of long-term depression (LTD) by low-frequency stimulation depends on the postsynaptic excitability state. Objective/Hypothesis: We tested the hypothesis that induction of LTD-like corticospinal plasticity in humans by 1 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) is enhanced when rTMS is synchronized with the low-excitability state, but decreased or even shifted towards long-term (LTP)-like plasticity when synchronized with the high-excitability state. Methods: We applied real-time EEG-triggered 1-Hz-rTMS (900 pulses) to the hand area of motor cortex in healthy subjects. In a randomized double-blind three-condition crossover design, pulses were synchronized to either the positive or negative peak of the sensorimotor mu-oscillation, or were applied at random phase (control). The amplitude of motor evoked potentials was recorded as an index of corticospinal excitability before and after 1-Hz-rTMS. Results: 1-Hz-rTMS at random phase resulted in a trend towards LTD-like corticospinal plasticity. RTMS in the positive peak condition (i.e., the low-excitability state) induced significant LTD-like plasticity. RTMS in the negative peak condition (i.e., the high-excitability state) showed a trend towards LTP-like plasticity, which was significantly different from the other two conditions. Conclusion: The level of corticospinal depolarization reflected by phase of the mu-oscillation determines the degree of corticospinal plasticity induced by low-frequency rTMS, a finding that may guide future personalized therapeutic stimulation.

EEG Patterns in Early Childhood Differ Between Children Prone To Reward "Bad" or "Good" Actors	PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART			English	Article						children; early age; moral evaluation; alpha asymmetry; EEG	BRAIN; ASYMMETRY; INTENTIONALITY; NEUROSCIENCE; RESONANCE; MORALITY; BEHAVIOR; EMOTION; INFANTS; RHYTHM	Background. Early childhood is a critically important period of development for the formation of personality. Many studies provide convincing proof that elements of moral behavior are observable already in the early stages of ontogenesis. Of particular interest for psychophysiologists is the question of whether the capacity for moral evaluation in younger children can be reflected in specific EEG patterns characteristic of them. Objective. To establish specific patterns of EEG oscillations, including the frontal alpha-rhythm asymmetry, in young children who are prone to evaluate differently the behaviors of "helping" and "hindering" puppets. Design. Fifty-six children aged 16 to 42 months participated in the study. To measure the level of moral evaluation in children, we used the method designed by B. Kenward and M. Dahl, with some modifications. The EEG was recorded when children distributed resources among the puppet-actors. Results. When deciding how to distribute resources among the puppets, the children with a higher moral evaluation index demonstrated an overall higher alpha rhythm amplitude, as well as a specific pattern of theta rhythm amplitude. The moral evaluation indices correlated with alpha asymmetry in the EEC loci F7 and F8. Conclusions. 1. Significant differences in EEG patterns were found between the children who showed different levels of moral evaluation. Children with higher indices of moral evaluation showed a higher alpha rhythm amplitude when deciding how to distribute resources among the puppets, depending on the puppets' "helping" or "hindering" behavior. 2. The theta rhythm oscillation patterns differed significantly between the samples of children with different moral evaluation indices. 3. Alpha asymmetry in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (loci F7, F8) was correlated with the moral evaluation indices, indicating an increased activation in the prefrontal regions of the left hemisphere in children with a more developed understanding of moral behavior.

Temporal Dynamics of the Neural Representation of Social Relationships	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; person perception; representational similarity analysis; social cognition; social relationships	FACE PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; IDENTITY; TRUSTWORTHINESS; CATEGORIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; COMPONENTS; SPACE; FORMS	Humans can rapidly encode information from faces to support social judgments and facilitate interactions with others. We can also recall complex knowledge about those individuals, such as their social relationships with others, but the time course of this process has not been examined in detail. This study addressed the temporal dynamics of emerging visual and social relationship information using EEG and representational similarity analysis. Participants (female = 23, male = 10) became fa-miliar with a 10-person social network, and were then shown faces of that network's members while EEG was recorded. To examine the temporal dynamics of the cognitive processes related to face perception, we compared the similarity structure of neural pattern responses to models of visual processing, face shape similarity, person identity, and social relationships. We found that all types of information are associated with neural patterns after a face is seen. Visual models became significant early after image onset, and identity across a change in facial expression was uniquely associated with neural patterns at several points throughout the time course. Additionally, a model reflecting perceived frequency of social interaction was present beginning at similar to 110 ms, even in the absence of an explicit task to think about the relationships among the network members. This study highlights the speed and salience of social information relating to group dynamics that are present in the brain during person perception.

These improvements are often assumed to arise from selective attention processes, but longer-term plasticity as a result of training may also play a role. Here, listeners were trained to detect either an 861-Hz or 1058-Hz tone (counterbalanced across participants) presented in noise at SNRs varying from -10 to -24 dB. On the following day, they were tasked with detecting 861-Hz and 1058-Hz tones at an SNR of -21 dB. In between blocks of this active task, EEG was recorded during passive presentation of trained and untrained frequency tones in quiet. Detection accuracy and confidence ratings were higher for trials at listeners' trained, than untrained-frequency (i.e., learning occurred). During passive exposure to sounds, the P2 component of the auditory evoked potential (similar to 150 - 200 ms post tone onset) was larger in amplitude for the trained compared to the untrained frequency. An analysis of global field power similarly yielded a stronger response for trained tones in the P2 time window. These effects were obtained during passive exposure, suggesting that training induced improvements in detection are not solely related to changes in selective attention. Rather, there may be an important role for changes in the long-term neural representations of sounds.

Long-range phase synchronization of high-frequency oscillations in human cortex	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							AMPLITUDE CORRELATIONS; RIPPLE OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONY; FIELD POTENTIALS; VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; MEMORY; EEG; HZ; MECHANISMS	Inter-areal synchronization of neuronal oscillations at frequencies below similar to 100Hz is a pervasive feature of neuronal activity and is thought to regulate communication in neuronal circuits. In contrast, faster activities and oscillations have been considered to be largely local-circuit-level phenomena without large-scale synchronization between brain regions. We show, using human intracerebral recordings, that 100-400Hz high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may be synchronized between widely distributed brain regions. HFO synchronization expresses individual frequency peaks and exhibits reliable connectivity patterns that show stable community structuring. HFO synchronization is also characterized by a laminar profile opposite to that of lower frequencies. Importantly, HFO synchronization is both transiently enhanced and suppressed in separate frequency bands during a response-inhibition task. These findings show that HFO synchronization constitutes a functionally significant form of neuronal spike-timing relationships in brain activity and thus a mesoscopic indication of neuronal communication per se.

However, it is increasingly argued that failing to use naturalistic stimuli limits the extent to which findings from lab studies can be extrapolated to rich and varied real-world experiences. Here, we recorded brain activity from 8 epileptic patients, implanted with stereo-encephalography (SEEG) electrodes, while they listened to pieces from the western tonal music repertoire. We estimated the sound intensity and key and pulse clarity of the stimuli using a toolbox for automatic extraction of musico-acoustic features. We then used partial-correlation analyses to examine the patterns of neuro-oscillatory activity associated with the processing of these features. Our results showed clear tracking of sound intensity in high-gamma and alpha frequency bands in the posterior superior temporal gyms, reflecting neural firing and the transfer of auditory information from the thalamus to auditory cortices, respectively. Patterns of partial correlations, in line with our hypotheses, also suggested limbic and inferior frontal cortical tracking of tonal and rhythmic uncertainty, albeit without the robustness shown for sound intensity tracking in auditory areas. The study provides an important contribution to the existing literature in its adherence to the call for a greater use of ecologically valid stimuli in neuroscientific investigations of music listening. Our results, specifically, have implications for research on the neural processing of musical uncertainty and for future studies seeking to use intracranial electroencephalography to examine naturalistic music processing.

But accurate delineation of EZ based on HFOs is still challenging. Our study compared HFOs from EZ and non-EZ on the basis of their associations with interictal slow waves, aiming at exploring a new way to localize EZ. Nineteen medically intractable epilepsy patients with good surgical outcome were included. Five minute interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) epochs of slow-wave sleep were randomly selected; then ripples (80-200 Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 200-500 Hz), and slow waves (0.1-4 Hz) were automatically analyzed. The EZ and non-EZ were identified by resection range during the surgeries. We found that both ripples and FRs superimposed more frequently on slow waves in EZ than in non-EZ (P< 0.01). Although ripples preferred to occur on the down state of slow waves in both two groups, ripples in EZ tended to be closer to the down-state peak of slow wave than in non-EZ (-174 vs. -231 ms,P= 0.008). As for FR, no statistical difference was found between the two groups (P= 0.430). Additionally, slow wave-containing ripples in EZ had a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.5 mu V/ms,P< 0.001) and wider distribution ratio (32.3 vs. 30.1%,P< 0.001) than those in the non-EZ. But for slow wave-containing FR, only a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.4 mu V/ms,P< 0.001) was observed. Our study innovatively compared the different features of association between HFOs and slow wave in EZ and non-EZ from refractory focal epilepsy with good surgical outcome, proposing a new method to localize EZ and facilitating the surgical plan.

However, planning multiple-task sequences also requires VWM to store representations for future goals. These future goals need to be prevented from interfering with the current perceptual task. Recent findings have implicated neural oscillations as a control mechanism serving the implementation and switching of different states of prioritization of VWM representations. We review recent evidence that posterior alpha-band oscillations underlie the flexible activation and deactivation of VWM representations and that frontal delta-to-theta-band oscillations play a role in the executive control of this process. That is, frontal delta-to-theta appears to orchestrate posterior alpha through long-range oscillatory networks to flexibly set up and change VWM states during multitask sequences.

However, their functional role is not yet fully understood and their interpretation is debatable. Amplitude modulations (AMs) in alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and high gamma (70-150 Hz) band in invasive electrocorticogram (ECoG) and non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) signals change with behavior. Alpha and beta band AMs are typically suppressed (desynchronized) during motor behavior, while high gamma AMs highly correlate with the behavior. These two phenomena are successfully used for functional brain mapping and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Recent research found movement-phase related AMs (MPA) also in high beta/low gamma (24-40 Hz) EEG rhythms. These MPAs were found by separating the suppressed AMs into sustained and dynamic components. Sustained AM components are those with frequencies that are lower than the motor behavior. Dynamic components those with frequencies higher than the behavior. In this paper, we study ECoG beta/low gamma band (12-30 Hz/30-42 Hz) AM during repetitive finger movements addressing the question whether or not MPAs can be found in ECoG beta band. Indeed, MPA in the 12-18 Hz and 18-24 Hz band were found. This additional information may lead to further improvements in ECoG-based prediction and reconstruction of motor behavior by combining high gamma AM and beta band MPA.

In the conventional diagnosis method, the neurologist has to visually examine the long hour electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which consumes time and is prone to error. Hence, in this present work, automated diagnosis of FC EEG signals from NFC EEG signals is developed using the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) method, entropies, and artificial neural network (ANN). The FWHT analyzes the EEG signals in the frequency domain and decomposes it into the Hadamard coefficients. Five different nonlinear features, namely approximate entropy (ApEn), log-energy entropy (LogEn), fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and permutation entropy (PermEn) are extracted from the decomposed Hadamard coefficients. The extracted features detail the nonlinearity in the NFC and the FC EEG signals. The judicious entropy features are supplied to the ANN classifier, with a 10-fold cross-validation method to classify the NFC and FC classes. Two publicly available datasets such as the University of Bonn and Bern-Barcelona dataset are used to evaluate the proposed approach. A maximum sensitivity of 99.70%, the accuracy of 99.50%, and specificity of 99.30% with the 3750 pairs of NFC and FC signal are achieved using the Bern-Barcelona dataset, while the accuracy of 92.80%, the sensitivity of 91%, and specificity of 94.60% is achieved using University of Bonn dataset. Compared to the existing technique, the proposed approach attained a maximum classification performance in both the dataset.	[Prasanna, J.; Sairamya, N.

It is unknown what underlies sleep misperception, as standard polysomnographic (PSG) parameters are often normal in these cases. Here we asked whether regional changes in brain activity could account for the mismatch between objective and subjective total sleep times (TST). To set cutoffs and define the norm, we first evaluated sleep perception in a population-based sample, consisting of 2,092 individuals who underwent a full PSG at home and estimated TST the next day. We then compared participants with a low mismatch (normoestimators, n = 1,147, +/- 0.5 SD of mean) with those who severely underestimated (n = 52, <2.5th percentile) or overestimated TST (n = 53, >97.5th percentile). Compared with normoestimators, underestimators displayed higher electroencephalographic (EEG) activation (beta/delta power ratio) in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while overestimators showed lower EEG activation (significant in REM sleep). To spatially map these changes, we performed a second experiment, in which 24 healthy subjects and 10 insomnia patients underwent high-density sleep EEG recordings. Similarly to underestimators, patients displayed increased EEG activation during NREM sleep, which we localized to central-posterior brain areas. Our results indicate that a relative shift from low- to high-frequency spectral power in central-posterior brain regions, not readily apparent in conventional PSG parameters, is associated with underestimation of sleep duration. This challenges the concept of sleep misperception, and suggests that instead of misperceiving sleep, insomnia patients may correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity.

Our aim was to investigate differences in brain activity in children with a history of complex FS, through a study paradigm notably associated with the development of learning capacities and using electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. To further increase our understanding of these differences, complex FS were studied separately depending on their type. Method: EEG was recorded in 43 children with past FS. Brain activity associated with auditory learning was investigated using a habituation paradigm, in which repetition suppression (RS) is typically found following stimulus repetition. Auditory stimuli were repeated three times, and each presentation were analysed separately in the time-frequency (TF) domain. A mixed-analysis of variance was used to assess differences in spectral power between stimulus repetition and FS type (simple vs complex prolonged; CP vs complex unprolonged; CUP). Results: Repetition effects were found in the 3-6 Hz during 150-600 ms time window after stimulus onset at frontal sites (F(2, 40) = 5.645, p = 0.007, eta(2)(P), = 0.220). Moreover, an interaction effect between stimulus repetition and FS type (F(4, 80) = 2.607, p = 0.042, eta(2)(P), = 0.115) was found. Children with CP FS showed greater increase in spectral power in response to the first stimulus presentation, while children with CUP FS failed to show a RS pattern. Significance: Our results show distinct abnormalities in brain activity to a habituation paradigm. We argue that these changes suggest children with CP FS may be hyperexcitable, while children with CUP FS show impaired habituation processes. Still, these differences may be associated with other clinical features linked to complex FS as well. Hence, the role of these differences in complex FS incidence and prognosis should be the subject of future studies.

The Importance of Cursive Handwriting Over Typewriting for Learning in the Classroom: A High-Density EEG Study of 12-Year-Old Children and Young Adults	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						high-density electroencephalography; cursive handwriting; typewriting; temporal spectral evolution; digital era; learning in the brain; educational psychology	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; ARTIFACT CORRECTION; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; LAPTOP USE; MEMORY; ALPHA; POWER	To write by hand, to type, or to draw - which of these strategies is the most efficient for optimal learning in the classroom? As digital devices are increasingly replacing traditional writing by hand, it is crucial to examine the long-term implications of this practice. High-density electroencephalogram (HD EEG) was used in 12 young adults and 12, 12-year-old children to study brain electrical activity as they were writing in cursive by hand, typewriting, or drawing visually presented words that were varying in difficulty. Analyses of temporal spectral evolution (TSE, i.e., time-dependent amplitude changes) were performed on EEG data recorded with a 256-channel sensor array. For young adults, we found that when writing by hand using a digital pen on a touchscreen, brain areas in the parietal and central regions showed event-related synchronized activity in the theta range. Existing literature suggests that such oscillatory neuronal activity in these particular brain areas is important for memory and for the encoding of new information and, therefore, provides the brain with optimal conditions for learning. When drawing, we found similar activation patterns in the parietal areas, in addition to event-related desynchronization in the alpha/beta range, suggesting both similarities but also slight differences in activation patterns when drawing and writing by hand. When typewriting on a keyboard, we found event-related desynchronized activity in the theta range and, to a lesser extent, in the alpha range in parietal and central brain regions. However, as this activity was desynchronized and differed from when writing by hand and drawing, its relation to learning remains unclear. For 12-year-old children, the same activation patterns were found, but to a lesser extent. We suggest that children, from an early age, must be exposed to handwriting and drawing activities in school to establish the neuronal oscillation patterns that are beneficial for learning. We conclude that because of the benefits of sensory-motor integration due to the larger involvement of the senses as well as fine and precisely controlled hand movements when writing by hand and when drawing, it is vital to maintain both activities in a learning environment to facilitate and optimize learning.

Standard multiscale entropy reflects neural dynamics at mismatched temporal scales: What's signal irregularity got to do with it?	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; EEG COMPLEXITY; POWER SPECTRUM; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA-POWER; VARIABILITY; STATE; HEALTHY; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS	Multiscale Entropy (MSE) is used to characterize the temporal irregularity of neural time series patterns. Due to its' presumed sensitivity to non-linear signal characteristics, MSE is typically considered a complementary measure of brain dynamics to signal variance and spectral power. However, the divergence between these measures is often unclear in application. Furthermore, it is commonly assumed (yet sparingly verified) that entropy estimated at specific time scales reflects signal irregularity at those precise time scales of brain function. We argue that such assumptions are not tenable. Using simulated and empirical electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 47 younger and 52 older adults, we indicate strong and previously underappreciated associations between MSE and spectral power, and highlight how these links preclude traditional interpretations of MSE time scales. Specifically, we show that the typical definition of temporal patterns via "similarity bounds" biases coarse MSE scales-that are thought to reflect slow dynamics-by high-frequency dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that entropy at fine time scales-presumed to indicate fast dynamics-is highly sensitive to broadband spectral power, a measure dominated by low-frequency contributions. Jointly, these issues produce counterintuitive reflections of frequency-specific content on MSE time scales. We emphasize the resulting inferential problems in a conceptual replication of cross-sectional age differences at rest, in which scale-specific entropy age effects could be explained by spectral power differences at mismatched temporal scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such problems may be alleviated, resulting in the indication of scale-specific age differences in rhythmic irregularity. By controlling for narrowband contributions, we indicate that spontaneous alpha rhythms during eyes open rest transiently reduce broadband signal irregularity. Finally, we recommend best practices that may better permit a valid estimation and interpretation of neural signal irregularity at time scales of interest. Author summary Brain signals exhibit a wealth of dynamic patterns that are thought to reflect ongoing neural computations. Multiscale sample entropy (MSE) intends to describe the temporal irregularity of such patterns at multiple time scales of brain function. However, the notion of time scales may often be unintuitive. In particular, traditional implementations of MSE are sensitive to slow fluctuations at fine time scales, and fast dynamics at coarse time scales. This conceptual divergence is often overlooked and may lead to difficulties in establishing the unique contribution of MSE to effects of interest over more established spectral power. Using simulations and empirical data, we highlight these issues and provide evidence for their relevance for valid practical inferences. We further highlight that standard MSE and traditional spectral power are highly collinear in our example. Finally, our analyses indicate that spectral filtering can be used to estimate temporal signal irregularity at matching and intuitive time scales. To guide future studies, we make multiple recommendations based on our observations. We believe that following these suggestions may advance our understanding of the unique contributions of neural signal irregularity to neural and cognitive function across the lifespan.

With age, probability of cognitive and behavioral deficits increase and the prognosis deteriorates. Although a few in vitro studies have reported that flavonoid fisetin is beneficial for healthy aging, its effect on deteriorating mental health with aging in vivo is very limited and poorly understood. The brain aging is physiologically characterized by electroencephalograph (EEG) wave frequency, power, and distribution. Brain oscillatory waves from neural tissue get altered by various sensory-cognitive inputs. Besides, the fast-wave alpha(8-12 Hz)- and beta(12-28 Hz)-oscillations are associated with coordination and indeed deal with complex behavioral performances. Therefore, the effect of fisetin supplementation on age-associated EEG mean cortical spectral power in alpha- and beta-oscillations, multi-unit activity (MUA) count were studied in vivo which was not addressed so far. Besides, age-associated cognitive and behavioral alterations were also studied. The relative spectral power of alpha and beta declined along with the MUA count in aged rats compared to young. However, supplementing fisetin for four weeks has improved relative alpha-power, beta-power, and MUA count in aged rats. Also, fisetin supplemented aged rats showed significantly improved cognitive and behavioral performances than aged controls. These findings demonstrated the relative cortical spectral power in alpha-, beta-oscillations, and MUA count change in aged rats and that some of these changes and behavioral alterations may be partly as a result of oxidative stress, which was prevented significantly in fisetin supplemented aged rats. Thus, fisetin boosted mental health in the aged animals.

Recent methodological advances have revealed functional magnetic resonance imaging-like connectivity networks using electroencephalography (EEG), a tool more easily implemented in clinical practice. Objective To determine whether EEG connectivity could reveal neural moderators of antidepressant treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants In this nonprespecified secondary analysis, data were analyzed from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinic Care study, a placebo-controlled, double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Recruitment began July 29, 2011, and was completed December 15, 2015. A random sample of 221 outpatients with depression aged 18 to 65 years who were not taking medication for depression was recruited and assessed at 4 clinical sites. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Statistical analysis was performed from November 16, 2018, to May 23, 2019. Interventions Patients received either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline hydrochloride or placebo for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures Electroencephalographic orthogonalized power envelope connectivity analyses were applied to resting-state EEG data. Intent-to-treat prediction linear mixed models were used to determine which pretreatment connectivity patterns were associated with response to sertraline vs placebo. The primary clinical outcome was the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, administered at each study visit. Results Of the participants recruited, 9 withdrew after first dose owing to reported adverse effects, and 221 participants (150 women; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [12.7] years) underwent EEG recordings and had high-quality pretreatment EEG data. After correction for multiple comparisons, connectome-wide analyses revealed moderation by connections within and between widespread cortical regions-most prominently parietal-for both the antidepressant and placebo groups. Greater alpha-band and lower gamma-band connectivity predicted better placebo outcomes and worse antidepressant outcomes. Lower connectivity levels in these moderating connections were associated with higher levels of anhedonia. Connectivity features that moderate treatment response differentially by treatment group were distinct from connectivity features that change from baseline to 1 week into treatment. The group mean (SD) score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was 18.35 (4.58) at baseline and 26.14 (30.37) across all time points. Conclusions and Relevance These findings establish the utility of EEG-based network functional connectivity analyses for differentiating between responses to an antidepressant vs placebo. A role emerged for parietal cortical regions in predicting placebo outcome. From a treatment perspective, capitalizing on the therapeutic components leading to placebo response differentially from antidepressant response should provide an alternative direction toward establishing a placebo signature in clinical trials, thereby enhancing the signal detection in randomized clinical trials.

In children, activation is characterized by a global reduction in alpha, frontally present reductions for delta and theta, and a frontal increase for beta. The present study aimed to replicate frontal EEG activation effects using single-channel, dry-sensor EEG, and to extend current understanding by examining developmental change in children. Frontal EEG was recorded using a single-channel, dry-sensor EEG device while 182 children aged 7 to 12 years completed eyes-closed resting (EC), eyes-open resting (EO), and focus (FO) tasks. Results indicated that frontal delta, theta, and alpha power were reduced, and frontal beta power was increased, in the EO compared with the EC condition. Exploratory analysis of a form of top-down activation showed that frontal beta power was increased in the FO compared with to the EO condition, with no differences for other bands. The activation effects were robust at the individual level. The bottom-up activation effects reduced with age for frontal delta and theta, increased for frontal alpha, with no developmental change for top-down or bottom-up frontal beta activation. These findings contribute further to validation of the single-channel, dry-sensor, frontal EEG and provide support for use in a range of medical, therapeutic, and clinical domains.

Although high-frequency neural oscillations (> 1 Hz) have been extensively studied in cognition, the neural mechanisms underlying low-frequency hemodynamic oscillations (LFHO) < 1 Hz have not yet been fully explored. One way to examine oscillatory neural dynamics is to use a facial expression (FE) paradigm to induce steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), which has been used in electroencephalography studies of high-frequency brain oscillation activity. In this study, LFHO during SSVEP-inducing periodic flickering stimuli presentation were inspected using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), in which hemodynamic responses in the prefrontal cortex were recorded while participants were passively viewing dynamic FEs flickering at 0.2 Hz. The fast Fourier analysis results demonstrated that the power exhibited monochronic peaks at 0.2 Hz across all channels, indicating that the periodic events successfully elicited LFHO in the prefrontal cortex. More importantly, measurement of LFHO can effectively distinguish the brain activation difference between different cognitive conditions, with happy FE presentation showing greater LFHO power than neutral FE presentation. These results demonstrate that stimuli flashing at a given frequency can induce LFHO in the prefrontal cortex, which provides new insights into the cognitive mechanisms involved in slow oscillation.

In search for direct evidence concerning the involvement of beta oscillations in reversal learning, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) was applied in a double-blind, sham-controlled and between-subjects design. Exogenous oscillatory currents were administered bilaterally to the frontal cortex at 20 Hz with an intensity of 1 mA peak-to-peak and the effects on reward-punishment based reversal learning were evaluated in hundred-and-eight healthy volunteers. Pre- and post-tACS resting state EEG recordings were analyzed. Results showed that beta-tACS improved rule implementation during reversal learning and decreases left and right resting-state frontal theta/beta EEG ratios following tACS. Our findings provide the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence for exogenous 20 Hz oscillatory electric field potentials administered over to the frontal cortex to improve reversal learning.

An electrophysiological marker of arousal level in humans	ELIFE			English	Article							RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE; NREM SLOW WAVES; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; DEPENDENT MEMORY; POWER SPECTRUM; SLEEP; BRAIN; EEG; DYNAMICS	Deep non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and general anesthesia with propofol are prominent states of reduced arousal linked to the occurrence of synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is also associated with diminished arousal levels, it is characterized by a desynchronized, 'wake-like' EEG. This observation implies that reduced arousal states are not necessarily only defined by synchronous oscillatory activity. Using intracranial and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets, we demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, delineates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM and REM sleep. Critically, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state. Taken together, our findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.

Seventy-eight participants were subjected to an immersive virtual reality (VR) application, where they received identical instructional information, rendered in three different formats: as text in an overlay interface, as text embedded semantically in a virtual book, or as audio. Learning outcome measures, self-reports, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) were used to compare conditions. Results show that reading was superior to listening for the learning outcomes of retention, self-efficacy, and extraneous attention. Reading text from a virtual book was reported to be less cognitively demanding, compared to reading from an overlay interface. EEG analyses show significantly lower theta and higher alpha activation in the audio condition. The findings provide important considerations for the design of educational VR environments.

Since a low number of electrodes would make the method clinically more practical, we now investigated whether our results received with a full EEG cap could be reproduced using only forehead electrodes. Experimental data from comatose post-CA patients (N = 10) were used. EEG was recorded approximately 48 h after CA using 19-channel EEG cap during a controlled propofol exposure. The slow wave activity was calculated separately for all electrodes and four forehead electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8) by determining the low-frequency (< 1 Hz) power of the EEG. HIE was defined by following the patients' recovery for six months. In patients without HIE (N = 6), propofol substantially increased (244 +/- 91%, mean +/- SD) the slow wave activity in forehead electrodes, whereas the patients with HIE (N = 4) were unable to produce such activity. The results received with forehead electrodes were similar to those of the full EEG cap. With the experimental pilot study data, the forehead electrodes were as capable as the full EEG cap in capturing the effect of HIE on propofol-induced slow wave activity. The finding offers potential in developing a clinically practical method for the early detection of HIE.

Owing to the high sample rate, EEG signals usually come with a large number of sample points, making it difficult to predict the working memory ability in cognitive research with EEG. New Method: Following well-designed experiments, the functional linear model provides a simple framework for regressions involving EEG signal predictors. The use of a data-driven basis in a linear structure naturally extends the standard linear regression model. The proposed approach utilizes B-spline approximation of functional principal components that greatly facilitates implementation. Results: Using LASSO feature selection, critical features have been extracted from eight frontal electrodes, and the R-square of 0.72 indicates rather strong linear association of actual observations and out-of-sample predictions. Comparison with Existing Methods: There does not seem to be any existing methods of predicting working memory ability from N-back task tests via EEG signals; the data-driven functional linear regression method proposed in this work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind. Conclusions: The data analytics suggest that a multiple functional linear regression model for the predictive relationship between working memory ability and frontal activity of the brain is both feasible and accurate via EEG signal processing.

The efficacy of such fiscal policies is currently being debated. Here we address this issue by investigating how behavioral and brain-based responses in parents with low socioeconomic status change when rebates and lower taxes are offered on healthy food items. We performed behavioral and brain-based experiments, with the latter employing electroencephalography (EEG) acquired from parents while they shop in a simulated shopping market as well as follow up functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the more restricted scanner environment. Behavioral data show that lower tax and rebate on healthy foods increase their purchase significantly compared to baseline. Rebate has a higher effect than lower tax treatment. From the EEG and fMRI experiments, we first show that healthy/unhealthy foods elicit least/maximal reward response in the brain, respectively. Further, by offering lower tax or rebate on healthy food items, the reward signal for such items in the brain is significantly enhanced. Second, we demonstrate that rebate is more effective than lower tax in encouraging consumers to purchase healthy food items, driven in part, by higher reward-related response in the brain for rebate. Third, fiscal interventions decreased the amount of frontal cognitive control required to buy healthy foods despite their lower calorific value as compared to unhealthy foods. Finally, we propose that it is possible to titrate the amount of tax reductions and rebates on healthy food items so that they consistently become more preferable than unhealthy foods.

Discrete sampling in perception via neuronal oscillations-Evidence from rhythmic, non-invasive brain stimulation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain oscillations; entrainment; perception; rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS); transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; PHENOMENAL SIMULTANEITY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; RESONANCE PHENOMENA; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG OSCILLATIONS	A variety of perceptual phenomena suggest that, in contrast to our everyday experience, our perception may be discrete rather than continuous. The possibility of such discrete sampling processes inevitably prompts the question of how such discretization is implemented in the brain. Evidence from neurophysiological measurements suggest that neural oscillations, particularly in the lower frequencies, may provide a mechanism by which such discretization can be implemented. It is hypothesized that cortical excitability is rhythmically enhanced or reduced along the positive and negative half-cycle of such oscillations. In recent years, rhythmic non-invasive brain stimulation approaches such as rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) are increasingly used to test this hypothesis. Both methods are thought to entrain endogenous brain oscillations, allowing them to alter their power, frequency, and phase in order to study their roles in perception. After a brief introduction to the core mechanisms of both methods, we will provide an overview of rTMS and tACS studies probing the role of brain oscillations for discretized perception in different domains and will contrast these results with unsuccessful attempts. Further, we will discuss methodological pitfalls and challenges associated with the methods.

The long adaptation process that consolidates a novel gait pattern seems to depend on cerebellar function for reinforcement of specific gait modifications, but the precise, step-by-step gait modifications (e.g., foot placement) most likely rely on top-down commands from the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The aim of this study was to identify, in able-bodied individuals, the specific modulations of cortical rhythms that accompany short-term gait modifications during first-time use of a dummy prosthesis. Methods Fourteen naive participants walked on a treadmill without (one block, 4 min) and with a dummy prosthesis (three blocks, 3 x 4 min), while ground reaction forces and 32-channel EEG were recorded. Gait cycle duration, stance phase duration, step width, maximal ground reaction force and, ground reaction force trace over time were measured to identify gait modifications. Independent component analysis of EEG data isolated brain-related activity from distinct anatomical sources. The source-level data were segmented into gait cycles and analyzed in the time-frequency domain to reveal relative enhancement or suppression of intrinsic cortical oscillations. Differences between walking conditions were evaluated with one-way ANOVA and post-hoc testing (alpha = 0.05). Results Immediate modifications occurred in the gait parameters when participants were introduced to the dummy prosthesis. Except for gait cycle duration, these modifications remained throughout the duration of the experimental session. Power modulations of the theta, mu, beta, and gamma rhythms, of sources presumably from the fronto-central and the parietal cortices, were found across the experimental session. Significant power modulations of the theta, beta, and gamma rhythms within the gait cycle were predominately found around the heel strike of both feet and the swing phase of the right (prosthetic) leg. Conclusions The modulations of cortical activity could be related to whole-body coordination, including the swing phase and placing of the prosthesis, and the bodyweight transfer between legs and arms. Reduced power modulation of the gamma rhythm within the experimental session may indicate initial motor memories being formed. Better understanding of the sensorimotor processes behind gait modifications may inform the development of neurofeedback strategies to assist gait rehabilitation.	[Kooiman, Vera G.

However, the extent these brain signals reflect a generic process and are independent of the type of information recognized remains an open question. To address this issue, twenty-seven healthy volunteers performed an episodic memory task while their electro-encephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Participants encoded a set of abstract pictures, and subsequently rated their confidence on recognition decisions. Similar to results reported in previous studies using concrete words, we found retrieval-related theta power, FN400 and late positive component (LPC) effects. In contrast to previous studies using verbal material, a subsequent memory effect for encoding-related evoked theta power, sensitive to subjectively perceived memory confidence, was observed. Our findings suggest that brain signals that are associated with subjectively perceived confidence reflect specific encoding, but generic retrieval processes.	[Wynn, Syanah C.; Kessels, Roy P.

Nonetheless, their ecological validity is still to be established hence their use in mathematical modelling in a transport setting has been scarce. We aim to fill this gap by conducting a study of cycling behaviour where non-immersive and immersive presentation methods are used in a virtual reality setting. The results confirm our hypothesis that participants behave differently when shown a choice scenario in non-immersive and immersive settings. In particular, cycling in an immersive setting is characterised by a higher degree of engagement. We also captured neural activity during task performance. We focussed on oscillations in the alpha (alpha) band where we found increased suppression in this signal in response to the immersive condition relative to the non-immersive. These results complement the behavioural findings and indicate that immersive environments may increase levels of task-engagement.

EEG techniques have shown to be advantageous for studying and predicting epileptic seizures, thanks to their cost-effectiveness, non-invasiveness, portability and the capability for long-term monitoring. Linear and non-linear EEG analysis methods have been developed for the effective prediction of seizure onset, however both methods remain blind to underlying alterations of the structural and functional brain networks associated with epileptic seizures. Such information is employed in this study to develop novel method for epileptic seizure prediction. New Methods: In this study, nonlinear partial directed coherence (NPDC) was employed as measure of functional brain networks (FBNs) and analyzed to reveal the directional flow of epilepsy-linked brain activity. A novel prediction strategy was then developed for the prediction of epileptic seizures by introducing extracted network features to an extreme learning machine (ELM). Results: Results show that the proposed method achieved favorable performance across all subjects and in all EEG frequency bands, with best accuracy of 89.2% in beta band and an optimal prediction time of 1356.4 s in delta bands, which outperforms currently available approaches. Comparison with Existing Methods: Our NPDC based on FBNs methods approach surpasses the accuracy of pure graph theory and pure non-linear methods with a significantly increased prediction time. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that the proposed prediction strategy is suitable for the prediction of seizure onset.

Associations among the home language environment and neural activity during infancy	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Socioeconomic status; Language; Chaos; Infancy	CHILD-DIRECTED SPEECH; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; BRAIN RESPONSES; HOUSEHOLD CHAOS; FOLLOW-UP; EEG POWER; ORDER; DISADVANTAGES; OSCILLATIONS; SPECIFICITY	Characteristics of the home language environment, independent of socioeconomic background, may account for disparities in early language abilities. Past studies have reported links between the quantity of language input within the home and differences in brain function during early childhood. The current study examined associations between home language input and EEG brain activity in a socioeconomically diverse sample of 6- to 12-month-old infants (N = 94). Replicating past studies, a positive correlation was found between measures of socioeconomic status and language input. Examining links between language input and brain activity, analyses yielded a negative association, with children who heard more adult words in the home demonstrating reduced EEG beta power (13-19 Hz) in the parietal region. Exploratory analyses revealed a significant interaction between language input and the amount of chaos and disorganization in the home. Specifically, among children living in high-chaos households, children who heard more adult words tended to have reduced EEG activity. Among children living in low-chaos homes, there was no link between adult word count and children's EEG activity. These findings demonstrate the importance of the early home environment context in shaping neurocognitive trajectories.

Investigating EEG theta and alpha oscillations as measures of value-directed strategic processing in cognitively normal younger and older adults	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategic processing; Aging; EEG; Theta; Alpha; selectivity/inhibition	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AGE-DIFFERENCES; MEMORY EFFICIENCY; FRONTAL THETA; LIFE-SPAN; BRAIN; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; PERSPECTIVE	Value-directed strategic processing is an ability that appears to be relatively preserved with aging, but the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying strategic processing in older adults are not well understood. The current study examined age-related spectral power differences in EEG oscillations linked to processing of high-value versus low-value information in a value-directed strategic processing task in 24 younger adults (mean age: 22.4 +/- 1.2 years) and 24 older adults (mean age: 63.2 +/- 6.4 years). Both groups exhibited comparable strategic processing ability behaviorally with preferential recall of high- compared to low-value words. Both groups exhibited comparable theta band power with greater synchronization for low- compared to high-value words, but age-related differences in processing were noted in alpha band power. Older adults showed more prolonged alpha desynchronization for high- compared to low-value words relative to younger adults. This neurophysiological modulation in the alpha band in older adults might reflect a compensatory neural mechanism or increased effort linked to selective engagement of neural resources, allowing them to perform similarly to younger adults behaviorally on a value-directed strategic processing task.

We tested the hypothesis that distinct neural oscillatory networks are engaged in tinnitus with and without hearing loss. In both tinnitus groups, with and without hearing loss, we identified multiple frequency band-dependent regions of increased and decreased global functional connectivity. We also found that the auditory domain of tinnitus severity, assayed by the Tinnitus Functional Index, was associated with global functional connectivity in both auditory and nonauditory regions. These findings provide candidate biomarkers to target and monitor treatments for tinnitus with and without hearing loss.

Although some previous studies indicated that beta oscillation (13-30 Hz) may directly originate in the network composed of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and external globus pallidus (GPe) neurons, specific onset mechanisms of which are unclear, especially theoretical evidences in numerical simulation are still little. In this paper, we employ a STN-GPe mean-field model to explore the onset mechanism of Parkinson's oscillation. In addition to beta oscillation, we find that some other common oscillation frequency bands can appear in this network, such as the alpha oscillation band (8-12 Hz), the theta oscillation band (4-7 Hz) and delta oscillation band (1-3 Hz). In addition to the coupling weight between the STN and GPe, the delay is also a critical factor to affect oscillatory activities, which can not be neglected compared to other parameters. Through simulation and analysis, we propose two possible theories may induce the system to transfer from the stable state to the oscillatory state in this model: (1). The oscillation activity can be induced when the firing activation level of the population increases to large enough; (2). In some special cases, the population may stay in the high firing rate stable state and the mean discharge rate of which is too large to induce oscillations, then oscillation activities may be induced as the MD decreases to moderate value. In most situations, the change trends of the MD and oscillation dominant frequency are contrary, which may be an important physiological phenomenon shown in this model. The delays and firing rates were obtained by simulating, which may be verified in the experiment in the future.

These diseases usually cause cognitive impairments of neuropsychiatric patients and threat to their health and life. However, we still lack of objective standard for clinically diagnosis so far, and cannot fully rely on traditional treatments of medicine because of their side effects. Thus, it becomes essential to develop effective and objective methods for diagnosis and treatment. EEG can reflect our brain's real-time state, that could be used as an indicator of brain impairment by detecting the characteristic rhythms. Gamma rhythms (similar to 25-100 Hz) play an important role in the higher-level functions of brain, especially associated with cognition and memory. Importantly, disrupted gamma rhythms have been found in neuropsychiatric diseases of both clinical patients and animal models, which suggests novel diagnostics based on gamma rhythms measurements in core brain regions of cognition. In this paper, we reviewed the recent studies on impaired gamma rhythms in neuropsychiatric diseases, including some major neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. We focused on the characteristics of gamma rhythms in regulating cognition, learning and memory in human and rodents, and analyzed the underlying neural mechanisms in cellular and molecular levels. Therefore, these findings may shed light to highly effective diagnosis of neuropsychiatric diseases in future by targeting gamma rhythms detection in EEG signals.

Among others, the pre-stimulus microstates' topography, representing the whole brain activity, has been proposed as a promising index of the anticipatory period in several cognitive tasks. However, to date, a clear relationship between the metrics of the pre-stimulus microstates [i.e., the global explained variance (GEV) and the frequency of occurrence (FOO)] and well-known electroencephalography marker of the anticipation (i.e., the alpha power reduction) has not been investigated. Here, after extracting the microstates during the expectancy of the semantic memory task, we investigate the correlations between the microstate features and the anticipatory alpha (8-12 Hz) power reduction (i.e., the event-related de-synchronization of the alpha rhythms; ERD) that is widely interpreted as a functional correlate of brain activation. We report a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate and both the mean amplitude of high-alpha ERD and the magnitude of the alpha ERD peak so that the stronger the decrease (percentage) in the alpha power, the higher the FOO of the dominant microstate. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant microstate and the latency of the alpha ERD peak, suggesting that subjects with higher FOO present the stronger alpha ERD closely to the target. These correlations are not significant between the GEV and all anticipatory alpha ERD indices. Our results suggest that only the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate should be considered as a useful electrophysiological correlate of the cortical activation.

EOG signal analysis is a noninvasive method for evaluating the movement of eyeball in the horizontal and vertical direction. It is a feasible technique in comparison to the other physiological signal based process to determine and quantify the fatigue and drowsiness of the drivers/operators. For this study data from fourteen participants in three different cue frequency and different time phases of a day has been acquired and three parameters like cornea pace, peak to blink ratio and blink count are evaluated on the basis of the real time signal. Based upon the experimental results, it is concluded that the fatigue and drowsiness increase with muscle stress, sleep deprivation, and the gap between the two sleep cycles. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Minocycline Treatment Reverses Sound Evoked EEG Abnormalities in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fragile X syndrome; autism; forebrain; sensory hypersensitivity; EEG; minocycline; MMP-9	RANDOMIZED DOUBLE-BLIND; RESTING-STATE EEG; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; PERINEURONAL NETS; VISUAL RESPONSES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; CHILDREN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; POTENTIALS	Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability. Many symptoms of FXS overlap with those in autism including repetitive behaviors, language delays, anxiety, social impairments and sensory processing deficits. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from humans with FXS and an animal model, theFmr1knockout (KO) mouse, show remarkably similar phenotypes suggesting that EEG phenotypes can serve as biomarkers for developing treatments. This includes enhanced resting gamma band power and sound evoked total power, and reduced fidelity of temporal processing and habituation of responses to repeated sounds. Given the therapeutic potential of the antibiotic minocycline in humans with FXS and animal models, it is important to determine sensitivity and selectivity of EEG responses to minocycline. Therefore, in this study, we examined if a 10-day treatment of adultFmr1KO mice with minocycline (oral gavage, 30 mg/kg per day) would reduce EEG abnormalities. We tested if minocycline treatment has specific effects based on the EEG measurement type (e.g., resting versus sound-evoked) from the frontal and auditory cortex of theFmr1KO mice. We show increased resting EEG gamma power and reduced phase locking to time varying stimuli as well as the 40 Hz auditory steady state response in theFmr1KO mice in the pre-drug condition. Minocycline treatment increased gamma band phase locking in response to auditory stimuli, and reduced sound-evoked power of auditory event related potentials (ERP) inFmr1KO mice compared to vehicle treatment. Minocycline reduced resting EEG gamma power inFmr1KO mice, but this effect was similar to vehicle treatment. We also report frequency band-specific effects on EEG responses. Taken together, these data indicate that sound-evoked EEG responses may serve as more sensitive measures, compared to resting EEG measures, to isolate minocycline effects from placebo in humans with FXS. Given the use of minocycline and EEG recordings in a number of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions, these findings may be more broadly applicable in translational neuroscience.

Tendency to ruminate and anxiety are associated with altered alpha and beta oscillatory power dynamics during memory for contextual details	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Episodic memory; Cognitive flexibility; Rumination; Anxiety; Brain oscillations	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; EPISODIC MEMORY; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; DEPRESSIVE RUMINATION; THETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; TOP-DOWN; ATTENTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; DISSOCIATE	Rumination occurs when an individual becomes mentally stuck and cannot redirect attention away from an unwanted thought demonstrating cognitive inflexibility. Cognitive flexibility is important for various cognitive functions, including episodic memory. Trait rumination is a partial mediator in the relationship between depression and overgeneral episodic memory, suggesting that rumination may negatively influence memory for contextual details. Oscillations in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands are crucial for various cognitive functions (e.g., attention control and episodic memory) and may help to explain the relationship between trait rumination and memory for contextual details. Our study uses EEG recorded during a source memory task to assess how alpha and beta oscillations during memory for contextual details may change as a function of trait rumination, anxiety, and depression level (n = 43). The source memory task instructs participants to remember objects and their associated contextual details. Memory for contextual details is lessened for participants higher in trait rumination paired with higher trait anxiety. Oscillations were analyzed in posterior parietal/occipital regions. During encoding, an interaction of nonclinical depression level and rumination predicts higher alpha power for items that were later not successfully remembered. During test, depression and rumination interact and predict higher alpha power for both successful and unsuccessful memory. These results suggest that trait anxiety, depression, and rumination impact accuracy and alpha oscillatory dynamics during contextual memory via changes in attention control.

For example, auditory temporal resolution seems to be linked to individual gamma frequency of auditory cortex. Individual gamma frequency not only correlates with performance in between-channel gap detection tasks but can be modulated via auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation. Modulation of individual gamma frequency is accompanied by an improvement in gap detection performance. Aging changes electrophysiological frequency components and sensory processing mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the link between individual gamma frequency and gap detection performance in elderly people using auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation. In a within-subject design, twelve participants were electrically stimulated with two individualized transcranial alternating current stimulation frequencies: 3 Hz above their individual gamma frequency (experimental condition) and 4 Hz below their individual gamma frequency (control condition), while they were performing a between-channel gap detection task. As expected, individual gamma frequencies correlated significantly with gap detection performance at baseline and in the experimental condition, transcranial alternating current stimulation modulated gap detection performance. In the control condition, stimulation did not modulate gap detection performance. In addition, in elderly, the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation on auditory temporal resolution seems to be dependent on endogenous frequencies in auditory cortex: Elderlies with slower individual gamma frequencies and lower auditory temporal resolution profit from auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation and show increased gap detection performance during stimulation. Our results strongly suggest individualized transcranial alternating current stimulation protocols for successful modulation of performance.

EEG microstate analysis of resting-state neuronal activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) could provide insight into altered brain dynamics of patients exhibiting dementia. Resting-state EEG microstate maps were derived from 128 channel EEG data in 20 PD without dementia (PDND), 18 PD with dementia (PDD) and 20 Healthy controls (CON) using Cartool and sLORETA softwares. Microstate map parameters including global explained variance, mean duration, frequency of occurrence (TF) and time coverage were compared statistically among the groups. Eight maps that explained 72% of the topographic variance were identified and only three maps differed significantly across the groups. TF of Map1 was lower in both PDND and PDD (p < 0.001) and that of Map3 (p = 0.02) in PDND compared to control. Cortical sources showed higher activation in precuneus, cuneus and superior parietal lobe (Threshold: Log-F = 1.74,p < 0.05) with maximum activity in the precuneus region (MNI co-ordinates: - 25, - 75, - 40; Log-F = 1.9) in PDND compared to control only for Map1. Lower TF of Map1 (prototypical microstate D) may potentially serve as a biomarker for PD with or without dementia whereas higher activation of precuneus, cuneus and superior parietal lobe at resting-state could favour signal processing, lack of which could be associated with dementia in Parkinson's disorder.

Connectivity dynamics from wakefulness to sleep	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; NETWORKS; FLUCTUATIONS; FREQUENCY; PATTERNS	Interest in time-resolved connectivity in fMRI has grown rapidly in recent years. The most widely used technique for studying connectivity changes over time utilizes a sliding windows approach. There has been some debate about the utility of shorter versus longer windows, the use of fixed versus adaptive windows, as well as whether observed resting state dynamics during wakefulness may be predominantly due to changes in sleep state and subject head motion. In this work we use an independent component analysis (ICA)-based pipeline applied to concurrent EEG/fMRI data collected during wakefulness and various sleep stages and show: 1) connectivity states obtained from clustering sliding windowed correlations of resting state functional network time courses well classify the sleep states obtained from EEG data, 2) using shorter sliding windows instead of longer non-overlapping windows improves the ability to capture transition dynamics even at windows as short as 30 s, 3) motion appears to be mostly associated with one of the states rather than spread across all of them 4) a fixed tapered sliding window approach outperforms an adaptive dynamic conditional correlation approach, and 5) consistent with prior EEG/fMRI work, we identify evidence of multiple states within the wakeful condition which are able to be classified with high accuracy. Classification of wakeful only states suggest the presence of time-varying changes in connectivity in fMRI data beyond sleep state or motion. Results also inform about advantageous technical choices, and the identification of different clusters within wakefulness that are separable suggest further studies in this direction.

The present study used continuous behavioral rating and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the dynamic process of tension generation and its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms; specifically, tension induced by structural violations at different music hierarchical levels. In the experiment, twenty-four musicians were required to rate felt tension continuously in real-time, while listening to music sequences with either well-formed structure, phrase violations, or period violations. The behavioral data showed that structural violations gave rise to increasing and accumulating tension experience as the music unfolded; tension was increased dramatically by structural violations. Correspondingly, structural violations elicited N5 at GFP peaks, and induced decreasing neural oscillations power in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz). Furthermore, compared to phrase violations, period violations elicited larger N5 and induced a longer-lasting decrease of power in the alpha band, suggesting a hierarchical manner of musical processing. These results demonstrate the important role of musical structure in the generation of the experience of tension, providing support to the dynamic view of musical emotion and the hierarchical manner of tension processing.

Three conditions of throwing games were compared looking for significant differences (simple throwing, throwing to a goal, and simultaneous throwing with another player). After signal processing, power spectral densities were compared through variance analysis (p <= 0.001). Significant differences were found especially in high-beta oscillations (22-30 Hz). "Goal" and "Simultaneous" throwing conditions show significantly higher values than those shown for throws without opponent. This can be explained by the higher demand for motor control and the higher arousal in competition situations. On the other hand, the high-beta records of the "Goal" condition are significantly higher than those of the "Simultaneous" throwing, which could be understood from the association of the beta waves with decision-making processes. These results support the difference in brain activity during similar games. This has several implications: opening up a path to study the effects of each specific game on brain activity and calling into question the transfer of research findings on animal play to all types of human play.

J	Cardena, E; Pick, S; Litwin, R				Cardena, Etzel; Pick, Susannah; Litwin, Richard			Differentiating psychogenic nonepileptic from epileptic seizures: A mixed -methods, content analysis study	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epileptic seizures; Nonepileptic seizures; Functional neurological disorder; Mixed-methods; Content analysis	DISSOCIATIVE SEIZURES; SYMPTOMS; EMOTION; TRAUMA	Background Identification of clinical features that might distinguish psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) from epileptic seizures (ES) is of value for diagnosis, management, and understanding of both conditions. Previous studies have shown that patients' descriptions of their seizures reflect differences in content and delivery. We aimed to compare verbal descriptions of PNES and ES using a mixed-methods approach. Methods We analyzed data from semi-structured interviews in which patients with video-electroencephalography (EEG)-confirmed ES (n=30) or PNES (n=10) described their seizures. Two masked raters independently coded the transcripts for relevant psychological categories and discrepancies that were noted and resolved. Additional analyses were conducted using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count system. The identified phenomena were descriptively compared, and inferential analyses assessed group differences in frequencies. A logistic regression analysis examined the predictive power of the most distinctive phenomena for diagnosis. Results As compared with ES, PNES reported longer seizures, more preseizure negative emotions (e.g., fear), anxiety symptoms (e.g., arousal, hyperventilation), altered vision/olfaction, and automatic behaviors. During seizures, PNES reported more fear, altered breathing, and dissociative phenomena (depersonalization, impaired time perception). Epileptic seizures reported more self-injurious behavior. Postseizure, PNES reported more fear and weeping and ES more amnesia and aches. The predictive power when including these variables was 97.5%. None of the single predictor variables was significant. The few but consistent linguistic differences related to the use of some pronouns and references to family. Conclusions Although no single clinical feature definitively distinguishes PNES from ES, several features may be suggestive of a PNES diagnosis, including longer duration, negative emotion (i.e., fear) throughout the events, preseizure anxiety, ictal dissociation, and postseizure weeping. Fewer reports of ictal self-injury and postseizure amnesia and aches may also indicate the possibility of PNES.

Classifying creativity: Applying machine learning techniques to divergent thinking EEG data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha; Classification; EEG; Creativity; AUT	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; EMOTION RECOGNITION; OSCILLATIONS; CONVERGENT; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS; MUSIC; STAGE	Prior research has shown that greater EEG alpha power (8-13 Hz) is characteristic of more creative individuals, and more creative task conditions. The present study investigated the potential for machine learning to classify more and less creative brain states. Participants completed an Alternate Uses Task, in which they thought of Normal or Uncommon (more creative) uses for everyday objects (e.g., brick). We hypothesized that alpha power would be greater for Uncommon (vs. Common) uses, and that a machine learning (ML) approach would enable the reliable classification data from the two conditions. Further, we expected that ML would be successful at classifying more (vs. less) creative individuals. As expected, alpha power was significantly greater for the Uncommon than for the Normal condition. Using spectrally weighted common spatial patterns to extract EEG features, and quadratic discriminant analysis, we found that classification accuracy for the two conditions varied widely among individuals, with a mean of 63.9%. For more vs. less creative individuals, 82.3% classification accuracy was attained. These findings indicate the potential for broader adoption of machine learning in creativity research.

Advances in predicting epileptic seizures can promise a robust model in which seizures and irreparable injuries at the time of occurrence can be possible. Most of the previous automated solutions are associated with challenges such as the lack of a proper signal descriptor, the existence of a large number of features and, consequently, the time-consuming analysis, which are not considering the uncertainty issue. In this paper, efficient and fastidious classification is performed by analysing the frequency bands of the input EEG signal via discrete wavelet transform, which is relying on the deep convolutional neural network based classification. Using the EEG signals obtained from the CHEG-MIT Scalp EEG database, the implementation in the desired model is performed and the results show that the proposed model has the best response in detecting the disease from the sample signal and with the highest level of certainty to follow. To solve the uncertainty problem, the repeatability algorithm test is arranged and after K-fold cross-validation, the experimental precision of all the three evaluation factors were equal to 99.34%, 99.53%, and 99.76%, respectively.

The relationship of skin diseases observed in panic disorder with quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) findings has not been investigated yet. The aim of this study is to compare the absolute alpha and delta power of panic disorder patients with and without skin disease. Methods: 246 panic disorder patients, 19 of whom had skin disease and 227 of whom did not have skin disease, were included in the study. Panic disorder severity scale (PDSS) scores of patients were recorded, and QEEG recording was performed. Absolute alpha and delta power and PDSS scores were compared between the two groups. Results: It was found that the absolute delta power in the left hemisphere was lower and PDSS scores were higher in the patients with skin diseases compared to the control group. In the patients with skin disease, decreased delta power in the left hemisphere may cause impairment in the processing of positive emotions and may cause trait anxiety. Conclusion: Trait anxiety may increase susceptibility to skin diseases by disrupting cutaneous homeostasis resulting from the prolonged sympathetic nervous system activation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Consciousness is closely related to memory consolidation in that memory is a critical component of conscious experience. So far, many studies have been reported on memory consolidation during consciousness, but there is little research on memory consolidation during unconsciousness. Therefore, we aim to assess the unconsciousness in terms of memory consolidation using electroencephalogram signals. In particular, we used unconscious state during the nap; because sleep is the only state in which consciousness disappears under normal physiological conditions. Seven participants performed two memory tasks (word-pairs and visuo-spatial) before and after the nap to assess the memory consolidation during unconsciousness. As a result, spindle power in central, parietal, occipital regions during unconsciousness was positively correlated with the difference in location memory performance. With the difference in memory performance, there was also a negative correlation between delta connectivity and word-pairs memory, alpha connectivity and location memory, and spindle connectivity and word-pairs memory. Additionally, brain activity and connectivity for differences according to nap and unconsciousness during memory recall were explored. These findings could help present new insights into the assessment of unconsciousness by exploring the relationship with memory consolidation.

There are few data about ictal ANS activity alterations induced by PNES in patients with pure PNES (pPNES) compared to PNES with comorbid epilepsy (PNES/ES). We aimed to compare heart rate variability (HRV) parameters and hence autonomic regulation in PNES in epileptic and non-epileptic patients. Methods: We obtained HRV data from video-electroencephalography recordings in 22 patients presenting PNES (11 pPNES and 11 PNES/ES) in awake, and supine states. We calculated HRV parameters in both time and frequency domains including low frequency (LF) power, high frequency power (HF), LF/HF ratio, square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent R wave intervals (RMSSD) and the standard deviation of all consecutive R wave intervals (SDNN). We also evaluated approximate entropy (ApEn), cardiosympathetic index (CSI), and cardiovagal index (CVI). Four conditions were considered: basal condition (BAS), before PNES (PRE), during PNES (ICT) and after PNES (POST). Results:HRV analysis showed significantly higher ICT LF and LF/HF ratio vs. each condition. We also found higher POST HF vs. PRE and BAS, lower RRI in ICT vs. each condition and PRE vs. BAS. POST RMSSD was significantly higher compared to all other states. ICT CSI was significantly higher compared to all other states, whereas CSI was significantly lower in POST vs. PRE and PRE CVI lower than ICT and higher in POST vs. BAS and PRE. Also, ICT ApEn was lower than in all other states. Higher LF in pPNES vs. PNES/ES was also evident when compared across groups. Significance:A few studies examined HRV alterations in PNES, reporting high sympathetic tone (although less evident than in epileptic seizures). Our data suggest a sympathetic overdrive before and during PNES followed by a post-PNES increase in vagal tone. A sympathovagal imbalance was more evident in pPNES as compared to PNES/ES.

Trends in the use of automated algorithms for the detection of high-frequency oscillations associated with human epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Review						biomarker; epileptogenic zone; fast ripple; ripple; seizure localization; seizure-onset zone	SEIZURE-ONSET ZONE; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FAST RIPPLES; 80-500 HZ; SURGERY; RESECTION; HFOS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; MACROELECTRODES	High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) are a promising biomarker of the epileptogenic zone and tool for surgical planning. Many studies have shown that a high rate of HFOs (number per minute) is correlated with the seizure-onset zone, and complete removal of HFO-generating brain regions has been associated with seizure-free outcome after surgery. In order to use HFOs as a biomarker, these transient events must first be detected in electrophysiological data. Because visual detection of HFOs is time-consuming and subject to low interrater reliability, many automated algorithms have been developed, and they are being used increasingly for such studies. However, there is little guidance on how to select an algorithm, implement it in a clinical setting, and validate the performance. Therefore, we aim to review automated HFO detection algorithms, focusing on conceptual similarities and differences between them. We summarize the standard steps for data pre-processing, as well as post-processing strategies for rejection of false-positive detections. We also detail four methods for algorithm testing and validation, and we describe the specific goal achieved by each one. We briefly review direct comparisons of automated algorithms applied to the same data set, emphasizing the importance of optimizing detection parameters. Then, to assess trends in the use of automated algorithms and their potential for use in clinical studies, we review evidence for the relationship between automatically detected HFOs and surgical outcome. We conclude with practical recommendations and propose standards for the selection, implementation, and validation of automated HFO-detection algorithms.

In previous studies, we demonstrated that movement-related beta modulation depth (peak ERS-ERD) during reaching increases within 1-h practice. This increase may represent plasticity processes within the sensorimotor network. If so, beta modulation during a reaching test should be affected by previous learning activity that engages the sensorimotor system but not by learning involving other systems. We thus recorded high-density EEG activity in a group of healthy subjects performing three 45-min blocks of motor adaptation task to a visually rotated display (ROT) and in another performing three blocks of visual sequence-learning (VSEQ). Each block of either ROT or VSEQ was followed by a simple reaching test (mov) without rotation. We found that beta modulation depth increased with practice across mov tests. However, such an increase was greater in the group performing ROT over both the left and frontal areas previously involved in ROT. Importantly, beta modulation values returned to baseline values after a 90-min of either nap or quiet wake. These results show that previous practice leaves a trace in movement-related beta modulation and therefore such increases are cumulative. Furthermore, as sleep is not necessary to bring beta modulation values to baseline, they could reflect local increases of neuronal activity and decrease of energy and supplies.

Overexcitation of neurons can facilitate disease progression whereas the induction of cortical gamma oscillations can reduce amyloid load and improve cognitive functions in mouse models. Although previous studies have induced cortical gamma oscillations by either optogenetic activation of cortical parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons or sensory stimuli, it is still unclear whether other approaches to induce gamma oscillations can also be beneficial. Here we show that optogenetic activation of PV+neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) increases amyloid burden, rather than reducing it. We applied 40 Hz optical stimulation in the BF by expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in PV+neurons of 5xFAD mice. After 1-h induction of cortical gamma oscillations over three days, we observed the increase in the concentration of amyloid-beta 42 in the frontal cortical region, but not amyloid-beta 40. Amyloid plaques were accumulated more in the medial prefrontal cortex and the septal nuclei, both of which are targets of BF PV+neurons. These results suggest that beneficial effects of cortical gamma oscillations on Alzheimer's disease pathology can depend on the induction mechanisms of cortical gamma oscillations.

These cortical gamma oscillations can be indexed by the gamma-band auditory steady-state response (ASSR), a robust electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarker that is increasingly used to advance the development of novel therapeutics for schizophrenia, and other related brain disorders. Despite promise of ASSR, the neural substrates of ASSR have not yet been characterized. This study investigated the sources underlying ASSR in healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients. In this study, a novel method for noninvasively characterizing source locations was developed and applied to EEG recordings obtained from 293 healthy subjects and 427 schizophrenia patients who underwent ASSR testing. Results revealed a distributed network of temporal and frontal sources in both healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients. In both groups, primary contributing ASSR sources were identified in the right superior temporal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. In conjunction with normal activity in these areas, schizophrenia patients showed significantly reduced source dipole density of gamma-band ASSR (ITC > 0.25) in the left superior temporal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and left superior frontal cortex. In conclusion, a distributed network of temporal and frontal brain regions supports gamma phase synchronization. We demonstrated that failure to mount a coherent physiologic response to simple 40-Hz stimulation reflects disorganized network function in schizophrenia patients. Future translational studies are needed to more fully understand the neural mechanisms underlying gamma-band ASSR network abnormalities in schizophrenia.

Here we tested whether implicit sensorimotor adaptation and strategic re-aiming used to reduce movement error are reflected by spatially distinct EEG oscillatory components. We analyzed beta-band oscillations (similar to 13-30 Hz), which have long been linked to sensorimotor functions, at the time when these adaptive processes intervene for movement planning. We hypothesized that beta-band activity within sensorimotor regions relates to implicit adaptive processes, whereas beta-band activity within medial motor areas reflects deliberate re-aiming. In female and male human volunteers, we recorded EEG in a motor adaptation task in which a visual rotation was introduced in short series of trials separated by unperturbed trials. Participants were instructed in advance about the nature of the visual perturbation and trained to counter it by strategically re-aiming at a neighboring target. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that preparatory beta-band activities within the two regions exhibited different patterns of modulation. Beta power in lateral central regions was attenuated when a change in the visual condition rendered internal-model predictions uncertain. In contrast, beta power in medial frontal regions was selectively decreased when participants strategically re-aimed their reaches. We propose that the reduction in lateral central beta power reflects an increased weighting of peripheral sensory information implicitly triggered when an adaptive change in the sensorimotor mapping is required, whereas the reduction in medial frontal beta-band activity relates to the inhibition of automatic motor responses in favor of cognitively controlled movements.

Material and methods: Twenty-two patients with ADHD participated in a crossover experiment with a visual time-estimation task under control conditions (without exposure to time estimation tasks) and experimental (thirty days exposure to time-estimation tasks) in association with electroencephalographic analysis of theta band. Results: ADHD patients with thirty days of time-estimation task exposure presented a worse performance of the time-estimation task, as revealed by the measurements of the absolute error and relative error (p <= 0.05). However, our findings show the improvement of self-reported symptoms of attention, impulsivity, and emotional control in patients after the time-estimation task exposure (p = 0.0001). Moreover, the theta band oscillations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in the ventrolateral prefrontal increased with thirty days of time-estimation task exposure (p <= 0.05). Conclusion: We propose that the decrease in EEG theta power may indicate an efficient accumulation of temporal pulses, which could be responsible for the improvement in the patient cognitive aspects as demonstrated by the current study. Time-estimation task improves ADHD cognitive symptoms, with a substantial increase in cortical areas activity related to attention and memory, suggesting its use as a tool for cognitive timing function management and non-invasive therapeutic aid in ADHD.

Weighted visibility graph (WVG) algorithm is first applied to transform each channel EEG into network and its topological parameters were further extracted. Statistical analysis indicates that AD and normal subjects show significant difference in the structure of WVG network and thus can be used to identify Alzheimer's disease. Taking network parameters as input features, a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model is established to identify AD's EEG signal. Three feature sets-single parameter from multi-networks, multi-parameters from single network, and multi-parameters from multi-networks-are considered as input vectors. The number and order of input features in each set is optimized with various feature selection methods. Classification results demonstrate the ability of network-based TSK fuzzy classifiers and the feasibility of three input feature sets. The highest accuracy that can be achieved is 95.28% for single parameter from four networks, 93.41% for three parameters from single network. In particular, multi-parameters from the multi-networks set obtained the best result. The highest accuracy, 97.12%, is achieved with five features selected from four networks. The combination of network and fuzzy learning can highly improve the efficiency of AD's EEG identification.

Scalp EEG interictal high frequency oscillations as an objective biomarker of infantile spasms	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						HFO; FR; Ripple; Physiological HFO; Modulation index	FAST RIPPLES; SEIZURE-ONSET; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; WEST-SYNDROME; 100-500 HZ; PHASE; EPILEPSY; MARKER; HYPSARRHYTHMIA; HIPPOCAMPAL	Objective: To investigate the diagnostic utility of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) via scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in infantile spasms. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed interictal slow-wave sleep EEGs sampled at 2,000 Hz recorded from 30 consecutive patients who were suspected of having infantile spasms. We measured the rate of HFOs (80-500 Hz) and the strength of the cross-frequency coupling between HFOs and slow-wave activity (SWA) at 3-4 Hz and 0.5-1 Hz as quantified with modulation indices (MIs). Results: Twenty-three patients (77%) exhibited active spasms during the overnight EEG recording. Although the HFOs were detected in all children, increased HFO rate and MIs correlated with the presence of active spasms (p < 0.001 by HFO rate; p < 0.01 by MIs at 3-4 Hz; p = 0.02 by MIs at 0.5-1 Hz). The presence of active spasms was predicted by the logistic regression models incorporating HFO-related metrics (AUC: 0.80-0.98) better than that incorporating hypsarrhythmia (AUC: 0.61). The predictive performance of the best model remained favorable (87.5% accuracy) after a cross-validation procedure. Conclusions: Increased rate of HFOs and coupling between HFOs and SWA are associated with active epileptic spasms. Significance: Scalp-recorded HFOs may serve as an objective EEG biomarker for active epileptic spasms. (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this laboratory study was the search for associations between spectral electroencephalogram (EEG) variability and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters during cognitive workload. This was carried out to search for so-called strain correlates in order to make a comparable statement on the mental strain, that occurs based on the HRV parameters. In addition, measuring methods such as the EEG burden employees, which should be avoided in future studies in the real working environment Methods A total of 22 healthy volunteers took part in the study. The trial included three standardized psychometric tests of the Vienna test system, rest breaks, and continuous EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. Results Adaptation reactions to the psychometric tests occurred within the deflections of the HRV parameters and with the changes in the EEG parameters of different frequency bands. Regarding the strain correlates between HRV and EEG, the HRV parameters low-frequency normalized unit (LF nu), high-frequency normalized unit (HF nu) and the percentage of successive RR intervals, that differ by more than 50ms (pNN50) attracted attention, which allowed conclusions about the EEG-mediated mental strain under certain criteria. Conclusion No explicit HRV parameters were found, that continuously correlated with the EEG in all tests and frequency bands. A reason for this could be the different cognitive loads in the three psychometric tests.

Electroencephalography has shown that recall signals unfold a few hundred milliseconds after simple recognition, but has only provided limited insights into the underlying brain networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed a "core recollection network" (CRN) centered on posterior parietal and medial temporal lobe regions, but the temporal dynamics of these regions during retrieval remain largely unknown. Here we used Magnetoencephalography in a memory paradigm assessing correct rejection (CR) of lures, item recognition (IR) and associative recall (AR) in human participants of both sexes. We found that power decreases in the alpha frequency band (10 -12 Hz) systematically track different mnemonic outcomes in both time and space: Over left posterior sensors, alpha power decreased in a stepwise fashion from 500 ms onward, first from CR to IR and then from IR to AR. When projecting alpha power into source space, the CRN known from fMRI studies emerged, including posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and hippocampus. While PPC showed a monotonic change across conditions, hippocampal effects were specific to recall. These region-specific effects were corroborated by a separate fMRI dataset. Importantly, alpha power time courses revealed a temporal dissociation between item and associative memory in hippocampus and PPC, with earlier AR effects in hippocampus. Our data thus link engagement of the CRN to the temporal dynamics of episodic memory and highlight the role of alpha rhythms in revealing when and where different types of memories are retrieved.

Existing methods cannot simultaneously consider common and individual characteristics among/within subjects when extracting stimuluselicited brain activities from ongoing EEG elicited by 512-s long modern tango music. New method: Aiming to discover the commonly music-elicited brain activities among subjects, we provide a comprehensive framework based on fast double-coupled nonnegative tensor decomposition (FDC-NTD) algorithm. The proposed algorithm with a generalized model is capable of simultaneously decomposing EEG tensors into common and individual components. Results: With the proposed framework, the brain activities can be effectively extracted and sorted into the clusters of interest. The proposed algorithm based on the generalized model achieved higher fittings and stronger robustness. In addition to the distribution of centro-parietal and occipito-parietal regions with theta and alpha oscillations, the music-elicited brain activities were also located in the frontal region and distributed in the 4 similar to 11 Hz band. Comparison with existing method(s): The present study, by providing a solution of how to separate common stimulus-elicited brain activities using coupled tensor decomposition, has shed new light on the processing and analysis of ongoing EEG data in multi-subject level. It can also reveal more links between brain responses and the continuous musical stimulus. Conclusions: The proposed framework based on coupled tensor decomposition can be successfully applied to group analysis of ongoing EEG data, as it can be reliably inferred that those brain activities we obtained are associated with musical stimulus.

In epilepsy, modulation is a key concept since seizures essentially result from neural hypersynchronization and hyperexcitability. In this study, we have introduced a time-dependent index based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the effects of phase and frequency modulations of neural oscillations in neonatal mice exhibiting epileptiform activity induced by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Through this index, we demonstrate that fast oscillations (gamma and beta 2) are the more susceptible modulated rhythms in terms of phase, during seizures, whereas slow waves (delta and theta) mainly undergo changes in frequency. The index also allowed detection of specific patterns associated with the interdependent modulation of phase and frequency in neural activity. Furthermore, by comparing ZIKV modulations with the general computational model Epileptors, we verify different signatures related to the brain rhythms modulation in phase and frequency. These findings instigate new studies on the effects of ZIKV infection on neuronal networks from electrophysiological activities, and how different mechanisms can trigger epilepsy.

It is also significant for brain disorder diagnosis and psychological health monitoring. Mental workload induced by various factors needs to be critically examined for better decisions. This paper presents an automated model for cognitive workload assessment to provide accurate categorization on intensity of workload induced by multitasking situations. Statistical wavelets corresponding to brain frequencies act as features for categorization task. The brain analysis needs technical expertise to identify the relevant information but, due to lack of sufficient number of experts, feature selection model helps to identify the relevant features responsible to categorize cognitive workload. Teaching Learning based Optimization (TLBO) method has been modified using 'Logical Operators' for binary feature selection problem in the current study and evaluated based on different parameters. Results on Logical TLBO reached upto 100% for binary and multiclass classification of cognitive workload. The results also show the proposed method is converging in minimum iteration for multiclass cognitive workload. PROMETHEE based multi-criteria decision-making approach has adopted for ranking of algorithm to select the best algorithm when multiple alternatives are available. Based on study of current literature, this approach appears to be first time implemented to provide ranking of optimization algorithms. The PROMETHEE method also suggests that the Logical TLBO is best among all the other compared approaches.

Given that FM theta oscillations are assumed to provide top-down control for episodic memory retrieval, especially for source retrieval, that is, accurate recollection of contextual details of prior episodes, the present study investigated whether FM theta NFT transfers to memory control processes. It was assessed (1) whether FM theta NFT improves source retrieval and modulates its underlying EEG characteristics and (2) whether this transfer extends over two posttests. Over seven NFT sessions, the training group who trained individual FM theta activity showed greater FM theta increase than an active control group who trained randomly chosen frequency bands. The training group showed better source retrieval in a posttraining session performed 13 days after NFT and their performance increases from pre- to both posttraining sessions were predicted by NFT theta increases. Thus, training-induced enhancement of memory control processes seems to protect newly formed memories from proactive interference of previously learned information. EEG analyses revealed that during pretest both groups showed source memory specific theta activity at frontal and parietal sites. Surprisingly, training-induced improvements in source retrieval tended to be accompanied by less prestimulus FM theta activity, which was predicted by NFT theta change for the training but not the control group, suggesting a more efficient use of memory control processes after training. The present findings provide unique evidence for the enhancement of memory control processes by FM theta NFT.	[Eschmann, Kathrin C.

Schizotypy dimensions are associated with altered resting state alpha connectivity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales; Alpha oscillations; Functional connectivity; Social anhedonia; Perceptual aberration; Magical ideation	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SHORT FORMS; HIGH-RISK; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EEG; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; PSYCHOSIS; COGNITION	The disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia says that symptoms are explained by dysfunctional connections across a wide range of brain networks. Despite some support for this hypothesis, there have been mixed findings. One reason for these may be the multidimensional nature of schizophrenia symptoms. In order to clarify the relationship between symptoms and brain networks, the current study included individuals at risk for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who either report extreme levels of positive schizotypy traits (perceptual aberrations and magical ideation, or "PerMag"; n = 23), or an extreme negative schizotypy trait (social anhedonia, or "SocAnh"; n = 19), as well as a control group (n = 18). Resting-state alpha electroencephalography was collected, and functional networks for each subject were measured using the phase-lag index to calculate the connectivity between channel pairs based on the symmetry of instantaneous phase differences over time. Furthermore, graph theory measures were introduced to identify network features exclusive to schizotypy groups. We found that the PerMag group exhibited a smaller difference in node strength and clustering coefficient in frontal/occipital and central/occipital regional comparisons compared to controls, suggesting a more widespread network. The SocAnh group exhibited a larger difference in degree in the central/occipital regional comparison relative to controls, suggesting a localized occipital focus in the connectivity network. Regional differences in functional connectivity suggest that different schizotypy dimensions are manifested at the network level by different forms of disconnections. Taken together, these findings lend further support to the disconnection hypothesis and suggest that altered connectivity networks may serve as a potential biomarker for schizophrenia risk.

Cervical dystonia (CD) is a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary contractions of the cervical musculature and is known to be associated with proprioceptive dysfunction in dystonic/nondystonic limbs. Objectives. We examined how neck botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injection affects wrist proprioception and the corresponding sensorimotor cortical activity in CD. Method. Wrist position sense acuity of the dominant (right) hand was evaluated in 15 CD and 15 control participants. Acuity measures were a psychophysical position sense discrimination threshold (DT; based on passive joint displacement) and joint position matching error (based on active movement). Cortical activity during the motor preparation period of the active joint position matching was examined using electroencephalography. Results. In their symptomatic state, patients demonstrated a significantly higher wrist proprioceptive DT, indicating an abnormal passive wrist position sense. Yet BoNT injections had no significant effect on this threshold. During active joint position matching, errors were significantly larger in patients, but this difference vanished after the administration of BoNT. Motor preparation of active wrist position matching was associated with a significantly higher rise of beta-band (13-30 Hz) power over contralateral somatosensory-motor cortical areas in patients. This excessive cortical activity significantly declined post-BoNT. Conclusion. Wrist proprioceptive perception during passive/active movements is abnormal in CD. An excessive rise of premotor/motor cortical beta-oscillations during motor planning is associated with this proprioceptive dysfunction. Neck BoNT injections normalized the cortical processing of proprioceptive information from nonsymptomatic limbs, indicating that local injections may affect the central mechanisms of proprioceptive function in CD.

Preventing relapse or minimizing its extent is hence a challenging goal for long-term successful management of AUD. New perspectives that rely on diverse neuromodulation tools have been developed in this regard as care supports. This paper focuses on electroencephalogram-neurofeedback (EEG-NF), which is a tool that has experienced renewed interest in both clinical and research areas. We review the literature on EEG-based neurofeedback studies investigating the efficacy in AUD and including at least 10 neurofeedback training sessions. As neurofeedback is a form of biofeedback in which a measure of brain activity is provided as feedback in real-time to a subject, the high degree of temporal resolution of the EEG interface supports optimal learning. By offering a wide range of brain oscillation targets (alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma, and SMR) the EEG-NF procedure increases the scope of possible investigations through a multitude of experimental protocols that can be considered to reinforce or inhibit specific forms of EEG activity associated with AUD-related cognitive impairments. The present review provides an overview of the EEG-NF protocols that have been used in AUD and it highlights the current paucity of robust evidence. Within this framework, this review presents the arguments in favor of the application of EEG-NF as an add-on tool in the management of alcohol disorders to enhance the cognitive abilities required to maintain abstinence more specifically, with a focus on inhibition and attentional skills.

Gamma Entrainment in a Large Retrospective Cohort: Implications for Photic Stimulation Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						40 Hz; aging; Alzheimer's disease; electroencephalography; frequency analysis; gamma rhythm; photic stimulation	WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN; RESPONSES; FLICKER	Background: Studies on mice models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have suggested potential therapeutic benefits of intermittent photic stimulation at 40 Hz. Objective: We examined the physiological response of 40 Hz intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) on routine EEG in a large retrospective cohort to investigate the effects of age on induced gamma oscillations by intermittent photic stimulation. Since most AD patients are elderly, it is important for future research to know if age affects photic stimulation. Methods: Retrospective data from 1,464 subjects aged 0-91. We performed frequency analysis and automatic peak detection and used regression analysis to investigate the effects of age and sex on peak frequencies and amplitude changes. To investigate the spread of the induced gamma oscillations, we assessed averaged topographies of 40 Hz band power. Results: There was a statistically significant but very minor effect of age on amplitude change (-0.002 normalized power per year, p <0.0001) but not for sex ( p = 0.728). Detection probability of induced peaks was significantly predicted by both age (OR = 0.988, CI 95 % [0.984, 0.993], p <0.00001) and sex (OR = 0.625, CI 95 % [0.496, 0.787], p < 0.0001). The induced 40 Hz gamma entrainment is spatially confined to the occipital area. Conclusion: There is a significant effect of age on induced gamma activity, but advanced age does not fundamentally change the behavior of the response in either magnitude or spatial distribution. This fact is important regarding future research into the possible therapeutic effects of photic stimulation in patients with AD.

Alpha's basic psychometric properties in pain populations requires further study. The present study reports on the test-retest reliability and internal consistency of EEG alpha power in older adults with chronic knee pain. Methods: Repeated EEG alpha power measurements were taken of older adults (N = 31) with chronic knee pain across two sessions separated by a ten-day period associated with a pilot clinical trial study. Recordings included resting periods (eyes open and eyes closed) as well as periods involving a pain management activity. Results: Most single alpha-power measures and all within-participant averages of alpha obtained within a session showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's a > 0.7) and satisfactory-to-excellent re-test reliability (Pearson's rs > 0.6) of both alpha power and alpha blocking (eyes closed minus eyes open) across repeated conditions. Conclusions: EEG alpha power seems mostly reliable and consistent, particularly when participants' eyes are closed, after a period of habituation, and when alpha measures are averaged as within-participant estimates. Significance: This analysis suggests that within-subject averages of EEG alpha are the most reliable for developing indices of chronic knee pain.

Modulation of auditory gamma-band responses using transcranial electrical stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						biomarker; connectome; cross-frequency coupling; gamma; tACS; tDCS	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; STEADY-STATE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN; TDCS; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; STROKE	Auditory gamma-band (>30 Hz) activity is a biomarker of cortical excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in autism, schizophrenia. and bipolar disorder. We provide a comprehensive account of the effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on gamma responses. Forty-five healthy young adults listened to 40-Hz auditory click trains while electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected to measure stimulus-related gamma activity immediately before and after 10 min of 1 mA tACS (40 Hz), tDCS, or sham stimulation to left auditory cortex. tACS, but not tDCS, increased gamma power and phase locking to the auditory stimulus. However, both tACS and tDCS strengthened the gamma phase connectome, and effects persisted beyond the stimulus. Finally, tDCS strengthened the coupling of gamma activity to alpha oscillations after termination of the stimulus. No effects were observed in prestimulus gamma power, the gamma amplitude connectome, or any band-limited alpha measure. Whereas both stimulation techniques synchronize gamma responses between regions. tACS also tunes the magnitude and timing of gamma responses to the stimulus. Results reveal dissociable neurophysiological changes following tACS and tDCS and demonstrate that clinical biomarkers can be altered with noninvasive neurostimulation, especially frequency-tuned tACS. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Gamma frequency-tuned transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) adjusts the magnitude and timing of auditory gamma responses, as compared with both sham stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). However, both tACS and tDCS strengthen the gamma phase connectome, which is disrupted in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. These findings reveal dissociable neurophysiological changes following two noninvasive neurostimulation techniques commonly applied in clinical and research settings.

It is not clear whether these effects are distinct or related phenomena, or whether they are early sensory effects or late decisional processes. Combining electroencephalography and electrocardiography, along with signal detection theory analyses, we identify two distinct heartbeat-related influences on conscious perception differentially related to early vs. late somatosensory processing. First, an effect on early sensory processing was found for the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a marker of cardiac interoception. The amplitude of the prestimulus HEP negatively correlated with localization and detection of somatosensory stimuli, reflecting a more conservative detection bias (criterion). Importantly, higher HEP amplitudes were followed by decreases in early (P50) as well as late (N140, P300) somatosensoryevoked potential (SEP) amplitudes. Second, stimulus timing along the cardiac cycle also affected perception. During systole, stimuli were detected and correctly localized less frequently, relating to a shift in perceptual sensitivity. This perceptual attenuationwas accompanied by the suppression of only late SEP components (P300) and was stronger for individuals with a more stable heart rate. Both heart-related effects were independent of alpha oscillations' influence on somatosensory processing. We explain cardiac cycle timing effects in a predictive coding account and suggest that HEP-related effects might reflect spontaneous shifts between interoception and exteroception or modulations of general attentional resources. Thus, our results provide a general conceptual framework to explain how internal signals can be integrated into our conscious perception of the world.

Seizure Onset Zone Lateralization Using a Non-linear Analysis of Micro vs. Macro Electroencephalographic Recordings During Seizure-Free Stages of the Sleep-Wake Cycle From Epilepsy Patients	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; quantitative EEG analysis; seizure onset zone lateralization; EEG; hybrid electrodes	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; NEURONAL COMPLEXITY LOSS; PRIMARY EPILEPTOGENIC AREA; INTRACRANIAL EEG; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; DETERMINISTIC DYNAMICS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; QUANTITATIVE EEG	The application of non-linear signal analysis techniques to biomedical data is key to improve our knowledge about complex physiological and pathological processes. In particular, the use of non-linear techniques to study electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings can provide an advanced characterization of brain dynamics. In epilepsy these dynamics are altered at different spatial scales of neuronal organization. We therefore apply non-linear signal analysis to EEG recordings from epilepsy patients derived with intracranial hybrid electrodes, which are composed of classical macro contacts and micro wires. Thereby, these electrodes record EEG at two different spatial scales. Our aim is to test the degree to which the analysis of the EEG recorded at these different scales allows us to characterize the neuronal dynamics affected by epilepsy. For this purpose, we retrospectively analyzed long-term recordings performed during five nights in three patients during which no seizures took place. As a benchmark we used the accuracy with which this analysis allows determining the hemisphere that contains the seizure onset zone, which is the brain area where clinical seizures originate. We applied the surrogate-corrected non-linear predictability score (psi), a non-linear signal analysis technique which was shown previously to be useful for the lateralization of the seizure onset zone from classical intracranial EEG macro contact recordings. Higher values of psi were found predominantly for signals recorded from the hemisphere containing the seizure onset zone as compared to signals recorded from the opposite hemisphere. These differences were found not only for the EEG signals recorded with macro contacts, but also for those recorded with micro wires. In conclusion, the information obtained from the analysis of classical macro EEG contacts can be complemented by the one of micro wire EEG recordings. This combined approach may therefore help to further improve the degree to which quantitative EEG analysis can contribute to the diagnostics in epilepsy patients.	[Martinez, Cristina G.

In the mismatch condition, the textual and pictorial information being dissimilar, TPI was not possible, whereas in the match and the partial-match condition, the textual and pictorial information being identical respective complementary, TPI was possible. We expected mental processing demands to be higher in the mismatch condition, when pictorial and textual information had to be processed and memorized as separate representations, compared to the match and partial-match conditions when TPI was possible. As expected, on virtually all process measures we observed increased mental processing demands when two mental representations had to be processed and memorized compared to the two conditions where TPI was possible. The EEG alpha and theta frequency band power data corroborated and extended the eye tracking measures of mental processing demands. In addition, we performed a fixation-related EEG frequency band power analysis that also corroborated the results of the classic stimulus-locked EEG frequency band power analysis, exemplifying the use of this former methodology in the context of complex multimedia task materials.

Neonatal Ketamine Alters High-Frequency Oscillations and Synaptic Plasticity in the Subiculum But Does not Affect Sleep Macrostructure in Adolescent Rats	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ketamine; sedation; brain development; EEG; long-term potentiation	GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SLOW; ANESTHESIA; EEG; RHYTHMS; MICE; INFANT; CORTEX; MEMORY	Exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs, such as ketamine, during the critical period of synaptogenesis, causes profound neurotoxicity in the developing rodent and primate brains and is associated with poor cognitive outcomes later in life. The subiculum is especially vulnerable to acute neurotoxicity after neonatal exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs. The subiculum acts as a relay center between the hippocampal complex and various cortical and subcortical brain regions and is also an independent generator of gamma oscillations. Gamma oscillations are vital in neuronal synchronization and play a role in learning and memory during wake and sleep. However, there has been little research examining long-term changes in subicular neurophysiology after neonatal exposure to ketamine. Here we explore the lasting effects of neonatal ketamine exposure on sleep macrostructure as well as subicular neuronal oscillations and synaptic plasticity in rats. During the peak of rodent synaptogenesis at postnatal day 7, rat pups were exposed to either 40 mg/kg of ketamine over 12 h or to volume matched saline vehicle. At weaning age, a subset of rats were implanted with a cortical and subicular electroencephalogram electrode, and at postnatal day 31, we performed in vivo experiments that included sleep macrostructure (divided into the wake, non-rapid eye movement, and rapid eye movement sleep) and electroencephalogram power spectra in cortex and subiculum. In a second subset of ketamine exposed animals, we conducted ex vivo studies of long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments in adolescent rats. Overall, we found that neonatal exposure to ketamine increased subicular gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep but it did not alter sleep macrostructure. Also, we observed a significant decrease in subicular LTP. Gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep are implicated in memory formation and consolidation, while LTP serves as a surrogate for learning and memory. Together these results suggest that lasting functional changes in subiculum circuitry may underlie neurocognitive impairments associated with neonatal exposure to anesthetic agents.

J	Young, J; Dragoi, V; Aazhang, B				Young, Joseph; Dragoi, Valentin; Aazhang, Behnaam			Precise measurement of correlations between frequency coupling and visual task performance	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT; MUTUAL INFORMATION; EEG COHERENCE; CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; BOOTSTRAP	Functional connectivity analyses focused on frequency-domain relationships, i.e. frequency coupling, powerfully reveal neurophysiology. Coherence is commonly used but neural activity does not follow its Gaussian assumption. The recently introduced mutual information in frequency (MIF) technique makes no model assumptions and measures non-Gaussian and nonlinear relationships. We develop a powerful MIF estimator optimized for correlating frequency coupling with task performance and other relevant task phenomena. In light of variance reduction afforded by multitaper spectral estimation, which is critical to precisely measuring such correlations, we propose a multitaper approach for MIF and compare its performance with coherence in simulations. Additionally, multitaper MIF and coherence are computed between macaque visual cortical recordings and their correlation with task performance is analyzed. Our multitaper MIF estimator produces low variance and performs better than all other estimators in simulated correlation analyses. Simulations further suggest that multitaper MIF captures more information than coherence. For the macaque data set, coherence and our new MIF estimator largely agree. Overall, we provide a new way to precisely estimate frequency coupling that sheds light on task performance and helps neuroscientists accurately capture correlations between coupling and task phenomena in general. Additionally, we make an MIF toolbox available for the first time.

However, the resulting PSD plot lacks temporal information, making interpretation sometimes equivocal. For example, consider two different PSDs: a central parietal EEG PSD with twin peaks at 10 Hz and 20 Hz and a central parietal PSD with twin peaks at 10 Hz and 50 Hz. We can assume the first PSD shows a mu rhythm and the second harmonic; however, the latter PSD likely shows an alpha peak and an independent line noise. Without prior knowledge, however, the PSD alone cannot distinguish between the two cases. To address this limitation of PSD, we propose using cross-frequency power-power coupling (PPC) as a post-processing of independent component (IC) analysis (ICA) to distinguish brain components from muscle and environmental artifact sources. We conclude that post-ICA PPC analysis could serve as a new data-driven EEG classifier in M/EEG studies. For the reader's convenience, we offer a brief literature overview on the disparate use of PPC. The proposed cross-frequency power-power coupling analysis toolbox (PowPowCAT) is a free, open-source toolbox, which works as an EEGLAB extension.

SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS); Sleep spindle; Amplitude; Frequency; Density	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; SPINDLE FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; SLEEP SPINDLES; WAVE DISCHARGES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; GENERATION; THALAMUS	Introduction: Benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is one of the most frequently seen epileptic syndromes in childhood. It is characterized by centrotemporal spikes (CTS) on electroencephalography (EEG) that are typically activated by drowsiness and stage N2 sleep. The location, frequency, and amplitude of the spikes may vary in different EEG records of the same patient, supporting the presence of a global pathology rather than a focal one. Despite the well-known relation between BECTS and stage N2 sleep, the results of sleep studies have been diverse and have mainly focused on sleep cycles. The characteristics of sleep spindles in the interictal periods have not been studied well. Methods: A retrospective study involving patients with BECTS who were admitted to the Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Neurology from January 2017 to October 2018 was conducted herein. Patients with BECTS and age-matched controls who had stage N2 sleep records of 10 min were enrolled for spindle amplitude (peak-to-peak difference in spindle voltage), frequency (number of waveforms per second), and duration and density (number of spindle bursts/minute of stage N2 sleep). Results: A total of 30 children with BECTS and 20 age-matched healthy peers were enrolled in the study. There were no significant differences between the age and sex of the patients. Statistically significant lower mean values of the amplitude, and duration and density of the spindle activity were observed in patients with BECTS when compared to the controls (P: 0.034, P: 0.016, and 0.020, respectively). Additionally, the risk of epilepsy was found to increase by 1.9 %, by the decrease of the mean amplitude of the spindles by 1 mV when compared to control group. Conclusion: The interictal records of stage N2 sleep differed in the patients with BECTS when compared to the controls. Findings related to the stage N2 sleep of the present study may suggest a network problem involving the thalamus and thalamocortical pathways in patients with BECTS.

Cognitive functions of shift workers: paramedics and firefighters - an electroencephalography study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND ERGONOMICS			English	Article						shift work; paramedics; firefighters; cognitive functions; attention; working memory	WORKING-MEMORY MAINTENANCE; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; NIGHT-SHIFT; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; CRITICAL-CARE; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; CONSEQUENCES; INHIBITION	Introduction. Working shifts has a negative impact on employee health and cognitive efficiency. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of shift work on cognitive functions - attention and working memory - using both behavioural and electrophysiological measures.Methods. The study was carried out on a group of 34 shift employees (18 paramedics, 16 firefighters) and on 17 day workers. Participants performed the attention network test and theN-back task with two conditions (1-back, 2-back) while the electroencephalography signal was recorded.Results.Observations included a higher amplitude of the P200 potential in paramedics (compared to the control group), a higher amplitude of the P300 potential after work than on a day off and the lowest increase in power in the theta band after the night shift. In firefighters, lower alpha desynchronization and lower synchronization in the alpha/beta band were observed after a 24-h shift. Paramedics and firefighters had longer reaction times (N-back task).Conclusions. The results suggest that paramedics experience problems with sustained attention. Paramedics process visual stimuli in a different way; after a night shift, performing the tasks required more engagement of cognitive resources. For firefighters, a decrease in visual attention functions and cognitive inhibition was observed.

Conventional filters are used for removing the line noise artifact, but these filters, also remove physiological activity and could induce spurious oscillations. We tested two alternative methods for removing line noise artifact without removing a physiological activity, specifically Adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) method with Linear regression and modified Independent Component Analysis (ICA). We proposed a new protocol for statistical evaluation of line noise removal effectiveness. The line noise artifact was physically simulated and the protocol for statistical evaluation was verified. The ANC method shows good results according to statistical evaluation. The lowest residuum of simulated line noise artifact corresponds to 0.0005 mu V2/Hz. Nevertheless, the ANC is very sensitive to the quality of the reference signal, which heavily depends on the reference electrode selection.

This study aims to develop a robot assistant that facilitates mindfulness training by means of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. To achieve this goal, we collected EEG signals from two groups of subjects engaging in a meditative vs. non-meditative human-robot interaction (HRI) and evaluated cerebral hemispheric asymmetry, which is recognized as a well-defined indicator of emotional states. Moreover, using self-reported affective states, we strived to explain asymmetry changes based on pre- and post-experiment mood alterations. We found that unlike earlier meditation studies, the fronto-central activations in alpha and theta frequency bands were not influenced by robot-guided mindfulness practice, however there was a significantly greater right-sided activity in the occipital gamma band of Meditation group, which is attributed to increased sensory awareness and open monitoring. In addition, there was a significant main effect of Time on participant's self-reported affect, indicating an improved mood after interaction with the robot regardless of the interaction type. Our results suggest that EEG responses during robot-guided meditation hold promise in real-time detection and neurofeedback of mindful state to the user, however the experienced neurophysiological changes may differ based on the meditation practice and recruited tools. This study is the first to report EEG changes during mindfulness practice with a robot. We believe that our findings driven from an ecologically valid setting, can be used in development of future BCI systems that are integrated with social robots for health applications.

Combining Behavior and EEG to Study the Effects of Mindfulness Meditation on Episodic Memory	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 159; Behavior; mindfulness meditation; episodic memory; memory retrieval; EEG; theta oscillations	BRAIN STRUCTURE; HIPPOCAMPAL; ATTENTION; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; METAANALYSIS; INCREASES; STRESS; SYSTEM; ERP	Although there has been recent interest in how mindfulness meditation can affect episodic memory as well as brain structure and function, no study has examined the behavioral and neural effects of mindfulness meditation on episodic memory. Here we present a protocol that combines mindfulness meditation training, an episodic memory task, and EEG to examine how mindfulness meditation changes behavioral performance and the neural correlates of episodic memory. Subjects in a mindfulness meditation experimental group were compared to a waitlist control group. Subjects in the mindfulness meditation experimental group spent four weeks training and practicing mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness was measured before and after training using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Episodic memory was measured before and after training using a source recognition task. During the retrieval phase of the source recognition task, EEG was recorded. The results showed that mindfulness, source recognition behavioral performance, and EEG theta power in right frontal and left parietal channels increased following mindfulness meditation training. In addition, increases in mindfulness correlated with increases in theta power in right frontal channels. Therefore, results obtained from combining mindfulness meditation training, an episodic memory task, and EEG reveal the behavioral and neural effects of mindfulness meditation on episodic memory.

The present study addressed this issue by investigating functional patterns of EEG alpha activity while 93 participants viewed nonverbal humorous cartoons until they indicated having recognized the punch line, and subsequently vocalized their idea as to what constituted it. In a similar fashion, EEG was also assessed during performance of the Alternate Uses Task (AUT), in order to identify similarities and differences in EEG alpha activity implicated in conventional creative cognition vs. humor comprehension. Analyses revealed a pattern of robust task-related alpha power increases in both tasks, which were markedly more right-lateralized at ventral fronto-temporal sites in the humor task as compared to the AUT. Findings are interpreted in line with recent literature on the functional role of alpha activity in the creativity domain. Altogether, this study adds further evidence to the particular role of EEG alpha oscillations in creative cognition and supports the idea that conventional creative ideation and the comprehension of humor share neural mechanisms affiliated to creative cognition.

While conventional methods like Artificial neural network (ANN), Linear discernment analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), etc. have made significant progress in terms of classification accuracy, deep transfer learning-based systems have shown the potential to outperform them. BCI can play a vital role in enabling communication with the external world for persons with motor disabilities. New Methods: Deep learning has been a success in many fields. However, for Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, relatively minimal work has been carried out using deep learning. This paper proposes a combination of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) along with deep learning-based transfer learning to solve the problem. CWT transforms one dimensional EEG signals into two-dimensional time-frequency-amplitude representation enabling us to exploit available deep networks through transfer learning. Results: The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in this study using an openly available BCI competition data-set. The results of the approach have been compared to earlier works on the same dataset, and a promising validation accuracy of 95.71% is achieved in our investigation. Comparison with existing methods and Conclusion: Our approach has shown significant improvement over other studies, which is 5.71% improvement over earlier reported algorithm (Tabar and Halici, 2017) using the same dataset. Results show the validity of the proposed Deep Transfer-Learning based technique as a state of the art technique for MI classification in BCI.

We used EEG to investigate cortical oscillatory activities during the tactile discrimination task and characterize the correlation between the EEG features and subjects' discrimination performance. Approach. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was applied on two finger areas (thumb and index for healthy hands, thumb and index-projected areas for disabled hands) to evoke two kinds of tactile sensations (vibration and pressure) with three levels of intensities (low, medium and high). Four forearm amputees and thirteen able-bodied subjects were recruited to discriminate the specific intensity and area of the applied stimulation. We assessed the discrimination performance [discrimination accuracy rate (AR) and response time (RT)] to quantify the tactile acuity. During the stimulation, EEG signals were recorded and the evoked cortical oscillatory activities were analyzed. Linear regression analyses were performed between EEG features and tactile discrimination performance. Main results. Spectral analysis revealed that alpha ERD over somatosensory regions persisted the whole task period and was related to the sensory information processing. Alpha ERD over prefrontal regions was only found during the stimulation judgement period and might reflect advanced cognitive process. There was no linear correlation between prefrontal alpha ERD and tactile discrimination performance. While contralateral somatosensory alpha ERDs exhibited significantly negative correlations with ARs (r < -0.7, p < 0.05) and positive correlations with RTs (r > 0.65, p < 0.05). Specifically, the fitting results of higher alpha band (10-13 Hz) were superior to lower alpha band (8-10 Hz). Significance. Alpha ERD over contralateral somatosensory cortex could be used as an objective index for the evaluation of tactile acuity and might have the potential to be applied in sensory rehabilitation for amputees.

The disease begins with a febrile stage, characterized by febrile seizures with otherwise normal development. Progression to the worsening stage features recurrent intractable seizures and the presentation of additional nonepileptic comorbidities, including global developmental delay, hyperactivity, and motor deficits. Later in life, at the stabilization stage, seizure burden decreases, whereas Dravet-associated comorbidities persist. To date, it remains debated whether the nonepileptic comorbidities result from severe epilepsy or represent an independent phenotypic feature. Methods Dravet mice (DS) faithfully recapitulate many clinical aspects of Dravet. Using wild-type (WT) and DS at different ages, we monitored multiple behavioral features as well as background electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during the different stages of Dravet epilepsy. Results Behavioral tests of WT and DS demonstrated that some deficits manifest already at the pre-epileptic stage, prior to the onset of convulsive seizures. These include motor impairment and hyperactivity in the open field. Deficits in cognitive functions were detected at the onset of severe spontaneous seizures. Power spectral analysis of background EEG activity, measured through development, showed that DS exhibit normal background oscillations at the pre-epileptic stage, a marked reduction in total power during the onset of severe epilepsy, and a subsequent smaller reduction later in life. Importantly, low EEG power at the stage of severe frequent convulsive seizures correlated with increased risk for premature death. Significance Our data provide a comprehensive developmental trajectory of Dravet epilepsy and Dravet-associated comorbidities in mice, under controlled settings, demonstrating that the convulsive seizures and some nonepileptic comorbidities may be uncoupled. Moreover, we report the existence of an inverse correlation, on average, between the power of background EEG and the severity of epileptic phenotypes, suggesting that such measurements may potentially serve as a biomarker for Dravet severity.

Consistent with this notion, excitation-inhibition imbalances are considered a pathophysiological mechanism in many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, methods to measure E/I ratios in human brain networks are lacking. Here, we present a method to quantify a functional E/I ratio (fE/I) from neuronal oscillations, and validate it in healthy subjects and children with ASD. We define structural E/I ratio in an in silico neuronal network, investigate how it relates to power and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of the network's activity, and use these relationships to design the fE/I algorithm. Application of this algorithm to the EEGs of healthy adults showed that fE/I is balanced at the population level and is decreased through GABAergic enforcement. In children with ASD, we observed larger fE/I variability and stronger LRTC compared to typically developing children (TDC). Interestingly, visual grading for EEG abnormalities that are thought to reflect E/I imbalances revealed elevated fE/I and LRTC in ASD children with normal EEG compared to TDC or ASD with abnormal EEG. We speculate that our approach will help understand physiological heterogeneity also in other brain disorders.

The dataset of ASSRs without BF-PV stimulation (dataset 1) contains raw 36-channel EEG epochs of ASSRs elicited by 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50Hz click trains and time stamps of stimulations. The dataset of ASSRs with BF-PV stimulation (dataset 2) contains raw 36-channel EEG epochs of 40-Hz ASSRs during BF-PV stimulation with latencies of 0, 6.25, 12.5, and 18.75ms and time stamps of stimulations. We provide the datasets and step-by-step tutorial analysis scripts written in Python, allowing for descriptions of the event-related potentials, spectrograms, and the topography of power.

Identifying early neural indicators of later cognitive ability may enable us to better elucidate the mechanisms that shape individual differences, eventually aiding identification of infants with an elevated likelihood of less optimal outcomes. A previous study associated a measure of neural activity (theta EEG) recorded at 12-months with nonverbal cognitive ability at ages two, three and seven in individuals with older siblings with autism (Jones et al., 2020). In a pre-registered study (https://osf.io/v5xrw/), we replicate and extend this finding in a younger, low-risk infant sample. EEG was recorded during presentation of a non-social video to a cohort of 6-month-old infants and behavioural data was collected at 6- and 9-months-old. Initial analyses replicated the finding that frontal theta power increases over the course of video viewing, extending this to 6-month-olds. Further, individual differences in the magnitude of this change significantly predicted non-verbal cognitive ability measured at 9-months, but not early executive function. Theta change at 6-months-old may therefore be an early indicator of later cognitive ability. This could have important implications for identification of, and interventions for, children at risk of poor cognitive outcomes.	[Braithwaite, Eleanor K.; Jones, Emily J.

Specifically, the between-subject delta-beta amplitude-amplitude correlation is found to increase in some hypothetically anxiogenic conditions. We tested whether cortical-subcortical coupling would increase as a function of decreased delta (theta) or higher beta (gamma) activity. EEG recording was obtained from a group of 59 students during a resting anxiogenic situation (Anxiety) and from another group of 66 during a relaxation situation (Relaxation). Participants filled out the State Anxiety and the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory Personality Questionnaire. Between-subjects cross-frequency correlations were calculated between power values in the delta (theta) and beta (gamma) frequency bands and compared between Anxiety and Relaxation groups. A significant positive between-subject delta-beta correlation was observed in the resting Anxiety, and this association was significantly higher than that observed in the Relaxation group. In the Anxiety, but not Relaxation group, we observed a delta-beta coupling for the low delta activity. In the Anxiety group, BIS trait was significantly associated with higher strength of within-subject delta-beta coupling, while in the Relaxation group BIS was positively associated with delta-theta coupling. Interesting, in both resting Anxiety and Relaxation groups, BAS-GDP was positively associated with higher delta-gamma coupling.

What is less clear is how hippocampal theta interacts with higher frequency oscillations to support long-term memory. Here we asked 10 presurgical epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recording to perform a long-term spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality and found that increased theta power in two discrete bands ("low" 2-5 Hz and "high" 6-11 Hz) during cued retrieval was associated with improved task performance. Similarly, increased coupling between "low" theta phase and gamma amplitude during the same period was associated with improved task performance. Finally, low and high gamma amplitude appeared to peak at different phases of the theta cycle; providing a novel connection between human hippocampal function and rodent data. These results help to elucidate the role of theta oscillations and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in human long-term memory.

Using a motor sequence learning paradigm with separate phases for initial exploration and reward-based learning, we show that anxiety states in humans impair learning by attenuating the update of reward estimates. Further, when such estimates are perceived as unstable over time (volatility), anxiety constrains adaptive behavioral changes. Neurally, anxiety during initial exploration increased the amplitude and the rate of long bursts of sensorimotor and prefrontal beta oscillations (13-30 Hz). These changes extended to the subsequent learning phase, where phasic increases in beta power and burst rate following reward feedback were linked to smaller updates in reward estimates, with a higher anxiety-related increase explaining the attenuated belief updating. These data suggest that state anxiety alters the dynamics of beta oscillations during reward processing, thereby impairing proper updating of motor predictions when learning in unstable environments.

Sentences were presented in 7 Hz sinusoidally modulated noise while the neural response to that modulation frequency was monitored by electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in 21 participants. We implemented a selective attention paradigm including three different attention conditions while keeping physical stimulus parameters constant. The participants' task was either to repeat the sentence as accurately as possible (speech recognition task), to count the number of decrements implemented in modulated noise (decrement detection task), or to do both (dual task), while the EEG was recorded. Behavioural analysis revealed reduced performance in the dual task condition for decrement detection, possibly reflecting limited cognitive resources. EEG analysis revealed no significant differences in power for the 7 Hz modulation frequency, but an attention-dependent phase difference between tasks. Further phase analysis revealed a significant difference 500 ms after sentence onset between trials with correct and incorrect responses for speech recognition, indicating that speech recognition performance and the neural phase are linked via selective attention mechanisms, at least shortly after sentence onset. However, the neural phase effects identified were small and await further investigation.

However, recent studies have reported that DLPFC-mediated top-down control interferes with implicit forms of learning. Here we used continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) combined with electroencephalography to investigate the causal role of DLPFC in implicit contextual memory-guided attention. We aimed to test whether transient disruption of the DLPFC would interfere with implicit learning performance and related electrical brain activity. We applied neuronavigation-guided cTBS to the DLPFC or to the vertex as a control region prior to the performance of an implicit contextual learning task. We found that cTBS applied over the DLPFC significantly improved performance during implicit contextual learning. We also noted that beta-band (13-19 Hz) oscillatory power was reduced at fronto-central channels about 140 to 370 ms after visual stimulus onset in cTBS DLPFC compared with cTBS vertex. Taken together, our results provide evidence that DLPFC-mediated top-down control interferes with contextual memory-guided attention and beta-band oscillatory activity.

All measures were repeated two months later to determine stability of the results. Correlation analyses revealed that within the range of 2-45 Hz, at rest, beta-2 band power correlated with the strength of frontoparietal connectivity and behavioral performance in both sessions. Participants with lower global beta-2 resting-state power (gB2rest) showed weaker frontoparietal connectivity and greater capacity for its modifications, as indicated by changes in phase correlations of the EEG signals. At the same time shorter reaction times and improved shooting accuracy were found, in both test and retest, in participants with low gB2rest compared to higher gB2rest values. We posit that weak frontoparietal connectivity permits flexible network reconfigurations required for improved performance in everyday tasks.

Recording local field potential and neuronal activity with tetrodes in epileptic patients	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Hybrid electrode; Depth electrode; Tetrode; Intracranial EEG; Single unit; Epilepsy	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SINGLE-UNIT ACTIVITIES; DEPTH ELECTRODES; FIRING PATTERNS; SEIZURES; REPRESENTATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; DISCHARGES; DYNAMICS	Background: Recordings with tetrodes have proven to be more effective in isolating single neuron spiking activity than with single microwires. However, tetrodes have never been used in humans. We report on the characteristics, safety, compatibility with clinical intracranial recordings in epileptic patients, and performance, of a new type of hybrid electrode equipped with tetrodes. New method: 240 standard clinical macroelectrodes and 102 hybrid electrodes were implanted in 28 patients. Hybrids (diameter 800 mu m) are made of 6 or 9 macro-contacts and 2 or 3 tetrodes (diameter 70-80 mu m). Results: No clinical complication or adverse event was associated with the hybrids. Impedance and noise of recordings were stable over time. The design enabled multiscale spatial analyses that revealed physiopathological events which were sometimes specific to one tetrode, but could not be recorded on the macro-contacts. After spike sorting, the single-unit yield was similar to other hybrid electrodes and was sometimes as high as > 10 neurons per tetrode. Comparison with existing method(s): This new hybrid electrode has a smaller diameter than other available hybrid electrodes. It provides novel spatial information due to the configuration of the tetrodes. The single-unit yield appears promising. Conclusions: This new hybrid electrode is safe, easy to use, and works satisfactorily for conducting multi-scale seizure and physiological analyses.

Separately, personal importance of religion and spirituality (R/S) has been shown to provide protective benefits for individuals at high familial risk for MDD. This study directly explored the joint value of posterior alpha and R/S on predicting clinical health outcomes of depression. Methods: Using a mixed-effects model approach, we obtained virtual estimates of R/S at age 21 using longitudinal data collected at 5 timepoints spanning 25 years. Current source density and frequency principal component analysis was used to quantify posterior alpha in 72-channel resting EEG (eyes open/closed). Depression severity was measured between 5 and 10 years after EEG collection using PHQ-9 and IDAS-GD scales. Results: Greater R/S (p = .008, eta(2)(p) = 0.076) and higher alpha (p = .02, eta(2)(p) = 0.056) were separately associated with fewer symptoms across scales. However, an interaction between alpha and R/S (p = .02, eta(2)(p) = 0.062) was observed, where greater R/S predicted fewer symptoms with low alpha but high alpha predicted fewer symptoms with lower R/S. Limitations: Small-to-medium effect sizes and homogeneity of sample demographics caution overall interpretation and generalizability. Conclusions: Findings revealed a complementary role of R/S and alpha in that either variable exerted protective effects only if the other was present at low levels. These findings confirm the relevance of R/S importance and alpha oscillations as predictors of depression symptom severity. More research is needed on the neurobiological mechanism underlying the protective effects of R/S importance for MDD.	[Panier, Lidia Y.

Quantitative characteristics of spike-wave paroxysms in genetic generalized epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Absence; Time-frequency analys; Connectivity; Epilepsy; Entropy; Spike-wave-complexes	ABSENCE SEIZURES; IMPAIRED CONSCIOUSNESS; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; EEG; CHILDHOOD; CONNECTIVITY; VARIABILITY; MORPHOLOGY; AMPLITUDE	Objective: To characterize generalized spike-wave paroxysms (GSW) in children with generalized genetic epilepsy (GGE). Methods: We annotated 15-19 channel scalp EEGs from a retrospective cohort from patients with a variety of GGE syndromes. Connectivity, entropy, frequency, power, spike-amplitudes were compared with a normal baseline activity and analyzed for the effect of age and sex. Cluster analysis was used to group spike-topographies between patients. Results: In total, 864 GSWs from 100 patients aged 2-18 were analyzed. Age had a significant effect on peak frequency, entropy and connectivity. Female sex was associated with significantly higher probability of positive responsiveness to photic stimulation (OR 4.28, CI [1.65, 11.73], p = 0.0036). Entropy decreases significantly during GSW (D = -0.29, CI [ -0.31, -0.27], p << 0.0001) and connectivity significantly increases (D = 0.39, CI [0.36, 0.40], p << 0.0001). Within patient spike-voltage maps exhibit remarkable consistency between spikes. Spike-topographies cluster together to predict age, connectivity and entropy. Conclusions: A quantitative characterization is possible and reveals significant relationships between age, sex and spike characteristics and multidimensional EEG features. Significance: Quantitative GSW characterization can capture aspects from traditional qualitative GSW analysis while being unaffected by intra- and interrater variation and this may be useful for multidimensional predictors of patient outcomes in GGE in the future.

The influence of induction speed on the frontal (processed) EEG	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; PROPOFOL INFUSION; BISPECTRAL INDEX; SPECTRAL EDGE; EFFECT SITE; COMA SCALE; CONSCIOUSNESS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; SEVOFLURANE	The intravenous injection of the anaesthetic propofol is clinical routine to induce loss of responsiveness (LOR). However, there are only a few studies investigating the influence of the injection rate on the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) during LOR. Therefore, we focused on changes of the frontal EEG especially during this period. We included 18 patients which were randomly assigned to a slow or fast induction group and recorded the frontal EEG. Based on this data, we calculated the power spectral density, the band powers and band ratios. To analyse the behaviour of processed EEG parameters we calculated the beta ratio, the spectral entropy, and the spectral edge frequency. Due to the prolonged induction period in the slow injection group we were able to distinguish loss of responsiveness to verbal command (LOvR) from loss of responsiveness to painful stimulus (LOpR) whereas in the fast induction group we could not. At LOpR, we observed a higher relative alpha and beta power in the slow induction group while the relative power in the delta range was lower than in the fast induction group. When concentrating on the slow induction group the increase in relative alpha power pre-LOpR and even before LOvR indicated that frontal EEG patterns, which have been suggested as an indicator of unconsciousness, can develop before LOR. Further, LOvR was best reflected by an increase of the alpha to delta ratio, and LOpR was indicated by a decrease of the beta to alpha ratio. These findings highlight the different spectral properties of the EEG at various levels of responsiveness and underline the influence of the propofol injection rate on the frontal EEG during induction of general anesthesia.

Using neuroscience to understand consumers' intentions towards sustainable eco-luxury items	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TRENDS			English	Article						sustainability; fashion industry; EEG; eco-luxury; consumer behaviour	EEG	The main aim of the present study was to analyze implicit consumers' responses to sustainability issues in a luxury fashion context, during the customer exploration of the store (in-store condition) of a well-known British fashion brand. Cortical EEG activity was assessed in 16 fashion-luxury consumers with a different sustainability orientation, in order to obtain insight on implicit dynamic towards eco-luxury products. Functional meaning of difference frequency EEG bands was analyzed to gain an insight on cognitive and emotional neurophysiological responses. Results highlighted an increase of theta band in right temporo-parietal brain regions suggesting an emotional negative impact elicited by sustainability pictures. Specifically, this effect was higher in the group of non-sustainability-oriented people, perhaps depending on the novelty of the stimuli either a lower sensitivity to social and environmental impact of fashion luxury industry. This study provides initial evidence about cortical oscillations and implicit emotional responses in luxury consumers during stimulation with sustainable images.

Circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters in canine epilepsy	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; animal models; intracranial EEG; ambulatory EEG; seizure prediction	STATUS EPILEPTICUS; IMPLANTED DEVICE; LONG-TERM; PHARMACOKINETICS; STIMULATION; CIRCASEPTAN; PREDICTION; FREQUENCY; NUCLEUS; PLACEBO	Advances in ambulatory intracranial EEG devices have enabled objective analyses of circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters in humans. This study characterizes circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters in dogs with naturally occurring focal epilepsy, and considers the implications of an animal model for the study of seizure risk patterns, seizure forecasting and personalized treatment protocols. In this retrospective cohort study, 16 dogs were continuously monitored with ambulatory intracranial EEG devices designed for humans. Detailed medication records were kept for all dogs. Seizure periodicity was evaluated with circular statistics methods. Circular non-uniformity was assessed for circadian, 7-day and approximately monthly periods. The Rayleigh test was used to assess statistical significance, with correction for multiple comparisons. Seizure clusters were evaluated with Fano factor (index of dispersion) measurements, and compared to a Poisson distribution. Relationships between interseizure interval (ISI) and seizure duration were evaluated. Six dogs met the inclusion criteria of having at least 30 seizures and were monitored for an average of 65 weeks. Three dogs had seizures with circadian seizure periodicity, one dog had a 7-day periodicity, and two dogs had approximately monthly periodicity. Four dogs had seizure clusters and significantly elevated Fano factor values. There were subject-specific differences in the dynamics of ISI and seizure durations, both within and between lead and clustered seizure categories. Our findings show that seizure timing in dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy is not random, and that circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters are common. Circadian, 7-day, and monthly seizure periodicities occur independent of antiseizure medication dosing, and these patterns likely reflect endogenous rhythms of seizure risk.

J	Lee, JW				Lee, Jong Woo			Mechanistic Wager on Outcome in Coma After Cardiac Arrest: The EEG Signature in Burst Suppression Provides Some Clues	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							MODEL	Objective: Survivors of prolonged (>2 weeks) post-cardiac arrest (CA) coma are expected to remain permanently disabled. We aimed to investigate 3 outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post-CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post-CA patients. Methods: We identified 3 patients with late recovery from coma (17-37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all 3 patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intraburst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post-CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, and EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients. Results: All 3 patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (similar to 4-7 Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intraburst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features, or decreasing intraburst frequencies with time. Interpretation: Burst suppression patterns with theta (similar to 4-7 Hz) peak intraburst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the corticothalamic system during recovery from prolonged post-CA coma.

Previous studies show that individuals with ADHD and neurotypical individuals with increased MW-S display similar cognitive-performance and electrophysiological (EEG) impairments in attentional processes. However, the cognitive-EEG markers associated with increased MW-S in ADHD remain poorly understood. We therefore investigated such markers in a sample of 69 sex- and age-matched adults with ADHD and 29 controls during the Sustained Attention to Response Task. We compared task performance and EEG measures (P3, time-frequency brain-oscillations) of attentional processes between groups, and examined their association with a validated self-report questionnaire of MW-S. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that MW-S and ADHD diagnosis relate to the same cognitive-EEG impairments using a hierarchical regression model. Compared to controls, adults with ADHD showed attenuations in P3, event-related alpha and beta suppression during response inhibition (No-Go trials), and theta power activations during response execution (Go trials), as well as increased reaction time variability and more commission/omission errors. MW-S was also continuously associated with most cognitive-EEG measures related to ADHD. The hierarchical regressions on measures associated with both ADHD diagnosis and MW-S showed that MW-S did not explain additional variance in the cognitive-EEG markers (except for beta suppression) beyond ADHD diagnosis, and vice versa. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that ADHD diagnosis and MW-S share common neural deficits, and that MW-S may reflect a core symptom of the disorder.

Autonomic/central coupling benefits working memory in healthy young adults	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Nap; Working memory; Parasympathetic; NREM; Autonomic; Sleep; Heart rate	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; IMPROVING FLUID INTELLIGENCE; NEUROCOGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES; EXECUTIVE-CONTROL; EEG; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT; CONSOLIDATION	Working memory (WM) is an executive function that can improve with training. However, the precise mechanism for this improvement is not known. Studies have shown greater WM gains after a period of sleep than a similar period of wake, and correlations between WM improvement and slow wave activity (SWA; 0.5-1 Hz) during slow wave sleep (SWS). A different body of literature has suggested an important role for autonomic activity during wake for WM. A recent study from our group reported that the temporal coupling of Autonomic/Central Events (ACEs) during sleep was associated with memory consolidation. We found that heart rate bursts (HR bursts) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are accompanied by increases in SWA and sigma (12-15 Hz) power, as well as increases in the high-frequency (HF) component of the RR interval, reflecting vagal rebound. In addition, ACEs predict long-term, episodic memory improvement. Building on these previous results, we examined whether ACEs also contribute to gains in WM. We tested 104 young adults in an operation span task (OSPAN) in the morning and evening, with either a nap (n = 53; with electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG)) or wake (n = 51) between testing sessions. We identified HR bursts in the ECG and replicated the increases in SWA and sigma prior to peak of the HR burst, as well as vagal rebound after the peak. Furthermore, we showed sleep-dependent WM improvement, which was predicted by ACE activity. Using regression analyses, we discovered that significantly more variance in WM improvement could be explained with ACE variables than with overall sleep activity not time-locked with ECG. These results provide the first evidence that coordinated autonomic and central events play a significant role in sleep-related WM improvement and implicate the potential of autonomic interventions during sleep for cognitive enhancement.

We aimed at characterizing, in non-invasive human brain recordings, the large-scale, coordinated activation of distant brain regions thought to occur during conscious perception. This process is termed ignition in the Global Workspace Theory, and integration in Integrated Information Theory, which are two of the major theories of consciousness. Approach. Here, we provide evidence for this process in humans by combining a magnetically-induced phosphene perception task with electroencephalography. Functional cortical networks were identified and characterized using graph theory to quantify the impact of conscious perception on local (segregation) and distant (integration) processing. Main results. Conscious phosphene perception activated frequency-specific networks, each associated with a specific spatial scale of information processing. Integration increased within an alpha-band functional network, while changes in segregation occurred in the beta band. Significance. These results bring novel evidence for the functional role of distinct brain oscillations and confirm the key role of integration processes for conscious perception in humans.

Resting-state posterior alpha power changes with prolonged exposure in a natural environment	COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS			English	Article						Attention restoration theory; Cognitive neuroscience; Electrophysiology; Electroencephalography; Environmental effects; Cognitive processes	ATTENTION RESTORATION THEORY; BENEFITS; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; NETWORKS; THALAMUS; VIEWS	Exposure to environments that contain natural features can benefit mood, cognition, and physiological responses. Previous research proposed exposure to nature restores voluntary attention - attention that is directed towards a task through top down control. Voluntary attention is limited in capacity and depletes with use. Nature provides unique stimuli that do not require voluntary attention; therefore, the neural resources needed for attention to operate efficiently are theorized to restore when spending time in nature. Electroencephalography reflects changes in attention through fluctuations in power within specific frequencies. The current study (N = 29) measured changes in averaged resting state posterior alpha power before, during, and after a multiday nature exposure. Linear mixed-effects models revealed posterior alpha power was significantly lower during the nature exposure compared to pre-trip and post-trip testing, suggesting posterior alpha power may be a potential biomarker for differences related to exposure to natural and urban environments.

We contribute neural evidence to this debate with electroencephalogram data collected from high school students during their regular morning, mid-morning and afternoon classes. Overall, student alpha power was lower when class content was taught via videos than through lectures. Students' resting state alpha brain activity decreased as the day progressed, consistent with adolescents being least attentive early in the morning. During the lessons, students showed consistently worse performance and higher alpha power for early morning classes than for mid-morning classes, while afternoon quiz scores and alpha levels varied. Together, our findings demonstrate that both class activity and class time are reflected in adolescents' brain states in a real-world setting, and corroborate educational research suggesting that mid-morning may be the best time to learn.

However, recent evidence in human and rodent chronic sleep restriction (CSR) studies suggests that NREM delta power is not progressively increased despite of accumulated sleep loss over days. In addition, there has been little progress in understanding how sleep EEG in different brain regions responds to CSR. Using novel high-density EEG electrode arrays in the mouse model of CSR where mice underwent 18-h sleep deprivation per day for 5 consecutive days, we performed an extensive analysis of topographical NREM sleep EEG responses to the CSR condition, including period-amplitude analysis of individual slow waves. As previously reported in our analysis of REM sleep responses, we found different patterns of changes: (i) progressive decrease in NREM sleep duration and consolidation, (ii) persistent enhancement in NREM delta power especially in the frontal and parietal regions, and (iii) progressive increases in individual slow wave slope and frontal fast oscillation power. These results suggest that multiple sleep-wake regulatory systems exist in a brain region-specific manner, which can be modulated independently, especially in the CSR condition.

Several neuropsychiatric disorders were shown to be associated with altered DFC, with schizophrenia (SZ) being one of the most intensely studied among such conditions. Here we analyzed resting-state electroencephalography recordings of 14 SZ patients and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). We reconstructed dynamic functional networks from delta band (0.5-4 Hz) neural activity and captured their spatiotemporal dynamics in various global network topological measures. The acquired network measure time series were made subject to dynamic analyses including multifractal analysis and entropy estimation. Besides group-level comparisons, we built a classifier to explore the potential of DFC features in classifying individual cases. We found stronger delta-band connectivity, as well as increased variance of DFC in SZ patients. Surrogate data testing verified the true multifractal nature of DFC in SZ, with patients expressing stronger long-range autocorrelation and degree of multifractality when compared to controls. Entropy analysis indicated reduced temporal complexity of DFC in SZ. When using these indices as features, an overall cross-validation accuracy surpassing 89% could be achieved in classifying individual cases. Our results imply that dynamic features of DFC such as its multifractal properties and entropy are potent markers of altered neural dynamics in SZ and carry significant potential not only in better understanding its pathophysiology but also in improving its diagnosis. The proposed framework is readily applicable for neuropsychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia.

Continuing professional development module An updated introduction to electroencephalogram-based brain monitoring during intended general anesthesia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							NITROUS-OXIDE ANESTHESIA; POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM; NEURAL INERTIA; EEG CHANGES; CONSCIOUSNESS; PROPOFOL; OSCILLATIONS; UNCONSCIOUSNESS; SUPPRESSION; SLEEP	The electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a reliable reflection of the brain's electrical state, so it can reassure us that the anesthetic agents are actually reaching the patient's brain, and are having the desired effect. In most patients, the EEG changes somewhat predictably in response to propofol and volatile agents, so a frontal EEG channel can guide avoidance of insufficient and excessive administration of general anesthesia. Persistent alpha-spindles (around 10 Hz) phase-amplitude coupled with slow delta waves (around 1 Hz) are commonly seen during an "appropriate hypnotic state of general anesthesia". Such patterns can be appreciated from the EEG waveform or from the spectrogram (a colour-coded display of how the power in the various EEG frequencies changes with time). Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this. For example, administration of ketamine and nitrous oxide is generally not associated with the aforementioned alpha-spindle coupled with delta wave pattern. Also, some patients, including older adults and those with neurodegenerative disorders, are less predisposed to generate a strong electroencephalographic "alpha-spindle" pattern during general anesthesia. There might also be some rare instances when the frontal EEG shows a pattern suggestive of general anesthesia, while the patient has some awareness and is able to follow simple commands, albeit this is typically without obvious distress or memory formation. Thus, the frontal EEG alone, as currently analyzed, is an imperfect but clinically useful mirror, and more scientific insights will be needed before we can claim to have a reliable readout of brain "function" during general anesthesia.

The renin secretion profile under the influence of sleep deprivation and the neuropeptides CRH and GHRH	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Renin; Sleep; Sleep deprivation; CRH; GHRH	EEG POWER SPECTRA; GROWTH-HORMONE; DEPRESSION; OSCILLATIONS; CYCLE	It is already known that during normal sleep plasma renin activity (PRA) shows oscillations with decreases during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and increases during non-REM (NREM) sleep. We also know that renin correlates positively with slow-wave sleep (SWS). Sleep deprivation is known to enhance significantly SWS and slow wave activity (SWA, known as d power). Based on these findings we addressed the question whether and to which extent sleep deprivation may affect the synchronization found between PRA and REM sleep during normal sleep and whether this synchronization is affected by other sleep regulating factors. To investigate these questions we compared sleep EEG and sleeprelated free renin levels in 48 normal women and men 19-69 years old between nights before and after 40 h of sleep deprivation. During the recovery night, four bolus injections of either GHRH, CRH or placebo were injected via long catheter around sleep onset. When compared to baseline after each of the treatments SWS, SWA and renin levels increased. The characteristical oscillation profiles of renin during normal sleep were also preserved after sleep deprivation. Similar to normal sleep our data support also a distinct link between nocturnal renin secretion and SWS after sleep deprivation and that independent of the applied treatments.

However, the relationship between musical emotional types and therapeutic effects remains unclear. To investigate this issue, this study tested three typical emotional types of music and discussed their neural mechanisms in relation to pain modulation. Subjects and Methods: In this experiment, 40 participants were exposed to cold pain under four conditions: listening to happy music, listening to neutral music, listening to sad music and no sound. EEG and pain thresholds were recorded. The participants were divided into the remission group and the nonremission group for analysis. Differences among conditions were quantified by the duration of exposure to the pain-inducing stimulus in the remission group. EEG data were obtained using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and then correlated with the behavioral data. Results: We found that sad music had a significantly better effect on alleviating pain, as a result of brain oscillations in a higher beta band and the gamma band at the O2 and P4 electrodes. The comparison between the remission group and the nonremission group suggested that personality may affect music-induced analgesia, and dominance, liveliness and introvert and extrovert personality traits were associated with pain modulation by sad music. Additionally, in the network analysis, we compared brain networks under the three conditions and discussed the possible mechanisms underlying the better analgesic effect of sad music. Conclusion: Sad music may have a better effect on alleviating pain, and its neural mechanisms are also discussed. This work may help understand the effects of music on pain modulation, which also has potential value for clinical use.

Though, it has been well established that the brain activities are significantly modulated by the behavioural state (such as locomotion), how the ASSR is affected remains unclear. Methods We investigated the effect of locomotion by recording local field potential (LFP) evoked by 40-Hz click-train from multiple brain areas: auditory cortex (AC), medial geniculate body (MGB), hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), in head-fixed mice free to run on a treadmill. Comparisons were conducted on the LFPs during spontaneous movement and stationary conditions. Results We found that in both the auditory (AC and MGB) and non-auditory areas (HP and PFC), locomotion reduced the initial negative deflection of LFP (early response during 0-100 ms from stimulus onset), and had no significant effect on the ASSR phase-locking to the late stimulus (100-500 ms). Conclusions Our results suggest that different neural mechanisms contribute to the early response and ASSR, and the ASSR is a more robust biomarker to investigate the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.

A great deal of work has examined the behavioral consequences and human electrophysiological substrates of anticipation following probabilistic memory cues that carry spatial or temporal information to guide perception. However, less is understood about the electrophysiological substrates linked to anticipating the sensory content of events based on recurring associations between successive events. Here, we demonstrate behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of using associative-memory templates to guide perception, while equating spatial and temporal anticipation (experiments 1 and 2), as well as target probability and response demands (experiment 2). By recording the electroencephalogram in the two experiments (N = 55; 24 females), we show that two markers in human electrophysiology implicated in spatial and temporal anticipation also contribute to the anticipation of perceptual identity, as follows: attenuation of alpha-band oscillations and the contingent negative variation (CNV). Together, our results show that memory-guided identity templates proactively impact perception and are associated with anticipatory states of attenuated alpha oscillations and the CNV. Furthermore, by isolating object-identity anticipation from spatial and temporal anticipation, our results suggest a role for alpha attenuation and the CNV in specific visual content anticipation beyond general changes in neural excitability or readiness.

EEGs recorded from non-human primates (monkeys) is useful for understanding of human pathologies of psychiatric disorders and development of new therapeutic agents. New methods: In this study, we expand a previous non-invasive head holding system with face masks for awake monkeys to be applied to scalp EEG recording. The new design of a head holding system allows to attach scalp EEG electrodes on the positions comparable to human electrode placement and to present auditory stimuli. Results: With this system, we could record auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in auditory sensory gating and oddball paradigms, which are often used as biomarkers of psychiatric disorders in animal models and human patients. The recorded AEPs were comparable to previous human clinical data. Comparison with existing methods: Compared with previous non-invasive head holding systems, top, side (cheek and ears), and rear of the head can be open for attachment of EEG electrodes and auditory stimulation in the present system. Conclusions: The results suggest that the present system is useful in EEG recording from awake monkeys. Furthermore, this system can be applied to eye-tracking and chronic intra-cerebral recording experiments.

Natural alpha frequency components in resting EEG and their relation to arousal	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Resting EEG; Arousal; EEG alpha amplitude; Skin conductance level (SCL); Frequency PCA	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; STATE AROUSAL; ANALYSIS PCA; HYPERACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; CHILDREN; BANDS; TOOL	Objective: Global EEG alpha activity is negatively correlated with skin conductance level (SCL), supporting alpha as an inverse marker of arousal. Frequency Principal Components Analysis (f-PCA) of resting EEG amplitude spectra has demonstrated natural components in the alpha band of healthy persons. This is a preliminary exploration of whether such components differ with arousal, possibly underpinning the anomalous ADHD hypoarousal link to reduced alpha. Method: Twenty-seven right-handed undergraduate students participated in three 2 minute blocks of resting eyes-open/closed EEG and SCL: EO1, EC, EO2. For each condition, mean EEG spectra were submitted to separate f-PCAs. Results: The inverse alpha/SCL relationship was confirmed for band amplitudes. EO had two alpha components; both correlated negatively with SCL. EC alpha contained four components, but only one had a substantial negative correlation with SCL; two had no relationship, suggesting natural alpha components with different non-arousal functionality in EC. Conclusion: Some alpha components in both EC and EO reflect arousal, with other non-arousal components in EC. Our f-PCA approach offers insight into previously-noted alpha anomalies in disorders such as ADHD. Significance: This proof of concept demonstration in typical participants may provide the basis for a new research effort in clinical disorders involving atypical arousal patterns.

The automatic detection method of high frequency oscillation can avoid the disadvantages of time consuming and easily influenced by the subjectivity of the analyst. At present. There are many reports on the optimization of high frequency oscillation automatic detection methods, mainly focusing on how to calculate the dynamic baseline. Because most of the detection algorithms based on flleted signal, the Gibbs phenomenon in the filtering process will lead to abnormal oscillation of the signal, bring false positive judgnent, and reduce the detection accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimization method for Gibbs phenomenon based on the maximum distributed peak points detection algorithm. From the published iEEG data of intracranial epilepsy from the Mayo Clinic, 300 iEEG samples were intercepted, including 193 samples containing high frequency oscillations and 107 samples without high frequency oscillations, each of which was 10 s. First, the algorithm uses the detection algorithm based on the maximum distributed peak points to determine the dynamic baseline identifying the HFOs, To detect the false positive time period, use oscillation matching, differential the signal before and after filtering, to judge the consistency of the amplitude variation trends of them by a parameter, and the consistency of the filtering artifacts caused by Gibbs phenomenon is low, and to discard it. The results show that the new algorithm improves accuracy from 87% to 91.3%. Specificity is Improved reduced from 75.7% to 88.8 %. The study reduces the probability of false positive.

Crossmodal Phase Reset and Evoked Responses Provide Complementary Mechanisms for the Influence of Visual Speech in Auditory Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						audiovisual speech; broadband high-frequency activity; crossmodal stimuli; intracranial electroencephalography; neuronal oscillations; phase-amplitude coupling	MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ATTENDED SPEECH; MATLAB TOOLBOX; ENTRAINMENT; ACTIVATION; RECORDINGS; REVEALS; SYNCHRONIZATION; ORGANIZATION	Natural conversation is multisensory: when we can see the speaker's face, visual speech cues improve our comprehension. The neuronal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. The two main alternatives are visually mediated phase modulation of neuronal oscillations (excitability fluctuations) in auditory neurons and visual input-evoked responses in auditory neurons. Investigating this question using naturalistic audiovisual speech with intracranial recordings in humans of both sexes, we find evidence for both mechanisms. Remarkably, auditory cortical neurons track the temporal dynamics of purely visual speech using the phase of their slow oscillations and phase-related modulations in broadband high-frequency activity. Consistent with known perceptual enhancement effects, the visual phase reset amplifies the cortical representation of concomitant auditory speech. In contrast to this, and in line with earlier reports, visual input reduces the amplitude of evoked responses to concomitant auditory input. We interpret the combination of improved phase tracking and reduced response amplitude as evidence for more efficient and reliable stimulus processing in the presence of congruent auditory and visual speech inputs.

Here, the relationship of fluid intelligence (gf) with the resting-state EEG (rsEEG) complexity over different timescales and different electrodes was investigated. A 6-min rsEEG blocks of eyes open were analyzed. The results of 119 subjects (57 men, mean age = 22.85 +/- 2.84 years) were examined using multivariate multiscale sample entropy (mMSE) that quantifies changes in information richness of rsEEG in multiple data channels at fine and coarse timescales.gffactor was extracted from six intelligence tests. Partial least square regression analysis revealed that mainly predictors of the rsEEG complexity at coarse timescales in the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the temporo-parietal complexities at fine timescales were relevant to highergf.Sex differently affected the relationship between fluid intelligence and EEG complexity at rest. In men,gfwas mainly positively related to the complexity at coarse timescales in the FPN. Furthermore, at fine and coarse timescales positive relations in the parietal region were revealed. In women, positive relations withgfwere mostly observed for the overall and the coarse complexity in the FPN, whereas negative associations withgfwere found for the complexity at fine timescales in the parietal and centro-temporal region. These outcomes indicate that two separate time pathways (corresponding to fine and coarse timescales) used to characterize rsEEG complexity (expressed by mMSE features) are beneficial for effective information processing.

Enhancing Slow Oscillations and Increasing N3 Sleep Proportion with Supervised, Non-Phase-Locked Pink Noise and Other Non-Standard Auditory Stimulation During NREM Sleep	NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP			English	Article						electroencephalographic spectral analysis; neurobehavioral performance; slowwave sleep; sleep fragmentation; delta power; slow oscillation	CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; ACOUSTIC STIMULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; K-COMPLEX; FRAGMENTATION; EEG; BRAIN; SENSITIVITY; VERSION; PVT	Purpose: In non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 3 sleep (N3), phase-locked pink noise auditory stimulation can amplify slow oscillatory activity (0.5-1 Hz). Open-loop pink noise auditory stimulation can amplify slow oscillatory and delta frequency activity (0.5-4 Hz). We assessed the ability of pink noise and other sounds to elicit delta power, slow oscillatory power, and N3 sleep. Participants and Methods: Participants (n = 8) underwent four consecutive inpatient nights in a within-participants design, starting with a habituation night. A registered polysomnographic technologist live-scored sleep stage and administered stimuli on randomized counterbalanced Enhancing and Disruptive nights, with a preceding Habituation night (night 1) and an intervening Sham night (night 3). A variety of non-phase-locked pink noise stimuli were used on Enhancing night during NREM; on Disruptive night, environmental sounds were used throughout sleep to induce frequent auditory-evoked arousals. Results: Total sleep time did not differ between conditions. Percentage of N3 was higher in the Enhancing condition, and lower in the Disruptive condition, versus Sham. Standard 0.8 Hz pink noise elicited low-frequency power more effectively than other pink noise, but was not the most effective stimulus. Both pink noise on the "Enhancing" night and sounds intended to Disrupt sleep administered on the "Disruptive" night increased momentary delta and slow-wave activity (ie, during stimulation versus the immediate pre-stimulation period). Disruptive auditory stimulation degraded sleep with frequent arousals and increased next-day vigilance lapses versus Sham despite preserved sleep duration and momentary increases in delta and slow-wave activity. Conclusion: These findings emphasize sound features of interest in ecologically valid, translational auditory intervention to increase restorative sleep. Preserving sleep continuity should be a primary consideration if auditory stimulation is used to enhance slow-wave activity.

Moreover, diagnosing idiopathic hypersomnia is challenging as patients can report significant symptoms but may not meet diagnostic criteria on standard objective tests. Advanced analyses of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity could provide objective markers of idiopathic hypersomnia and explain part of its pathophysiology and heterogeneity. In fact, the EEG signal recorded during wakefulness and sleep not only captures sleep macroarchitecture but also homeostatic sleep process efficiency, strength of neural synchrony during sleep, sleep consolidation, and changes in cognitive processes. In this review, we will present current and potential markers of idiopathic hypersomnia, with a focus on sleep propensity. We will also discuss EEG changes occurring in sleep deprivation conditions and recovery nights, as well as those observed in other central hypersomnolence conditions, namely narcolepsy type-1 and type-2.Recent FindingsAmong EEG markers studied in sleep deprivation and narcolepsy are those derived from sleep macroarchitecture (sleep consolidation, sleep stage proportion, sleep-stage transitions, sleep onset in rapid-eye movement sleep) and microarchitecture (slow-wave activity, spindles), spectral analysis of the waking electroencephalographic signal, and cognitive event-related potentials. To date, no clear objective EEG markers of idiopathic hypersomnia exist, as studies were generally performed on small samples, used heterogeneous protocols (including changes of diagnostic criteria that occurred over time), and most of them focused on more traditional macroarchitecture sleep analyses.SummaryBased on studies of sleep deprivation and narcolepsy, further studies are needed to understand the EEG signal in idiopathic hypersomnia. Future studies should take advantage of the richness and the complexity of the EEG signal and verify whether subgroups of hypersomniac patients exist.

However, such an approach of feature extraction requires rigorous analysis and validation to develop an efficient machine-learning algorithm. The aim of this study is to classify rest and hand movements using the raw EEG signals and deep learning (DL) network. Healthy adult subjects age ranging 18-25 years performed hand movement four times each. The DL network was trained using subject-specifically with window sizes varying between 300ms and 1500ms. In the post-processing step, the majority voting scheme was employed. The results showed that the DL algorithm can predict the hand movement with more than 80% accuracy using 600ms or greater window size. The prediction accuracy is improved to more than 90% using the majority voting scheme. However, the window size of greater than 600ms did not significantly improve the accuracy values. When comparing between 300ms and 600ms window sizes, the accuracy increases from 77.5% to 82.7% (p<0.05). Such improvement was also reflected in both ROC curves and ranking analysis, where 600ms window size yielded higher AUC values and scores compared to the 300ms window size. The results of this study is valuable in human-computer interaction as well as in controlling devices including prosthesis, exoskeleton, virtual objects, computer typing, and wheelchair.

This study was designed to explore the neural mechanism of environmental restorative experiences. We conducted an experiment by randomly exposing thirty-two participants to either 20 min of a restorative (wooded garden) or a nonrestorative (traffic island) environment. Participants' real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were monitored via a 14-channel mobile device during the exposure. They also completed a series of psychological assessments of affective and cognitive functioning, as well as the perceived restorativeness of the environment, before and after the exposure. The results revealed stronger and more efficient alpha-theta synchronization (functional connectivity) during the restorative experience, as well as stronger alpha-theta oscillations in the occipital lobes. Regression analysis revealed that perceived coherence was associated with the efficiency of the alpha-theta synchronization network (alpha: coef. = 2.02, 95% CI [0.68, 3.36], p = 0.020, R-2 = 23.97%; theta: coef. = 2.41, 95% CI [1.30, 3.52], p < 0.001, R-2 = 39.54%); fatigue recovery was associated with alpha-theta oscillations in the occipital lobes (alpha: coef. = -0.58, 95% CI [-0.88, -0.28], p = 0.001, R-2 = 33.62%; theta: coef. = -0.50, 95% CI [-0.73, -0.26], p < 0.001, R-2 = 37.74%); and the degree of fatigue recovery further improved attention-related cognitive performance (coef. = 0.22, 95% CI [0.03, 0.41], p = 0.027; R-2 = 15.28%). Based on the above-mentioned evidence, we proposed that the perceived coherence of the restorative environment may induce fatigue recovery and, hence, attention restoration via alpha-theta oscillations and synchronization. The increased alpha-theta oscillations in the occipital lobes suppress visual processing, allowing the human brain to reorganize itself via alpha-theta synchronization.

Recovery of Theta Frequency Oscillations in Rats Following Lateral Fluid Percussion Corresponds With a Mild Cognitive Phenotype	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						spatial learning; traumatic brain injury; theta oscillations; biomarker; in vivo electrophysiology; phase coherence	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; HEAD-INJURY; EXTRACELLULAR POTASSIUM; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL; UNITED-STATES; IMPACT MODEL; CONCUSSION; RHYTHM	Whether from a fall, sports concussion, or even combat injury, there is a critical need to identify when an individual is able to return to play or work following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) represent potential tools to monitor circuit-level abnormalities related to learning and memory: specifically, theta oscillations can be readily observed and play a critical role in cognition. Following moderate traumatic brain injury in the rat, lasting changes in theta oscillations coincide with deficits in spatial learning. We hypothesized, therefore, that theta oscillations can be used as an objective biomarker of recovery, with a return of oscillatory activity corresponding with improved spatial learning. In the current study, LFP were recorded from dorsal hippocampus and anterior cingulate in awake, behaving adult Sprague Dawley rats in both a novel environment on post-injury days 3 and 7, and Barnes maze spatial navigation on post-injury days 8-11. Theta oscillations, as measured by power, theta-delta ratio, peak theta frequency, and phase coherence, were significantly altered on day 3, but had largely recovered by day 7 post-injury. Injured rats had a mild behavioral phenotype and were not different from shams on the Barnes maze, as measured by escape latency. Injured rats did use suboptimal search strategies. Combined with our previous findings that demonstrated a correlation between persistent alterations in theta oscillations and spatial learning deficits, these new data suggest that neural oscillations, and particularly theta oscillations, have potential as a biomarker to monitor recovery of brain function following TBI. Specifically, we now demonstrate that oscillations are depressed following injury, but as oscillations recover, so does behavior.

Listening to speech in real-life situations is often cognitively demanding but it is unknown whether WM load influences how auditory cortical activity synchronizes to speech features. Here, we developed an auditory n-back paradigm to investigate cortical entrainment to speech envelope fluctuations under different degrees of WM load. We measured the electroencephalogram, pupil dilations and behavioural performance from 22 subjects listening to continuous speech with an embedded n-back task. The speech stimuli consisted of long spoken number sequences created to match natural speech in terms of sentence intonation, syllabic rate and phonetic content. To burden different WM functions during speech processing, listeners performed an n-back task on the speech sequences in different levels of background noise. Increasing WM load at higher n-back levels was associated with a decrease in posterior alpha power as well as increased pupil dilations. Frontal theta power increased at the start of the trial and increased additionally with higher n-back level. The observed alpha-theta power changes are consistent with visual n-back paradigms suggesting general oscillatory correlates of WM processing load. Speech entrainment was measured as a linear mapping between the envelope of the speech signal and low-frequency cortical activity (< 13 Hz). We found that increases in both types of WM load (background noise and n-back level) decreased cortical speech envelope entrainment. Although entrainment persisted under high load, our results suggest a top-down influence of WM processing on cortical speech entrainment.

However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of such modulation remain insufficiently explored. The present study combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the modulation of activity across the language network following continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) of the left pars opercularis. In 10 healthy subjects (21 +/- 2 years old, four females), neuronavigated cTBS was delivered over the left pars opercularis of the frontal operculum (part of the traditional Broca's area) at 80% of active motor threshold (AMT) stimulation intensity. Real cTBS and sham cTBS were performed in two different visits separated by at least 48 h. Before, immediately, and 10 min after cTBS, 30 single pulses of TMS were delivered to the left pars opercularis at 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT), whereas EEG was simultaneously recorded. We examined the cTBS-induced modulation of phase locking values (PLVs) between the TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded over the pars opercularis and those recorded over its right-hemispheric homolog area, the left supramarginal area, and the left superior temporal area in different EEG frequency bands and different time windows following cTBS. cTBS to the left pars opercularis induced within the gamma band: (1) a significant increase in TEP phase synchronization between the left and right pars opercularis at an early time window (250-350 ms) following cTBS; and (2) significantly increased PLV with the left supramarginal area and the left superior temporal area at a later time window (600-700 ms). In the theta and delta band, cTBS to the left pars opercularis induced significantly increased phase synchronization of TEPs between the left pars opercularis and the posterior left hemispheric language areas at a late time window. In sham condition, there was a significant decrease in TEP phase synchronization of the high beta band between left pars opercularis and left superior temporal area at 200-300 ms. These results contribute to characterize the dynamics of the language network and may have implications in the development of noninvasive stimulation protocols to promote the language rehabilitation in aphasia patients.

Cortical Beta Oscillatory Activity Evoked during Reactive Balance Recovery Scales with Perturbation Difficulty and Individual Balance Ability	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						EEG; walking; skill	HUMAN POSTURAL RESPONSES; MOTOR CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; BEAM WALKING; STABILITY; DEMANDS; STROKE; MODEL; YOUNG	Cortical beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) reflect sensorimotor processing, but are not well understood in balance recovery. We hypothesized that sensorimotor cortical activity would increase under challenging balance conditions. We predicted greater beta power when balance was challenged, either by more difficult perturbations or by lower balance ability. In 19 young adults, we measured beta power over motor cortical areas (electroencephalography, Cz electrode) during three magnitudes of backward support -surface translations. Peak beta power was measured during early (50-150 ms), late (150-250 ms), and overall (0-400 ms) time bins, and wavelet-based analyses quantified the time course of evoked beta power. An ANOVA was used to compare peak beta power across perturbation magnitudes in each time bin. We further tested the association between perturbation-evoked beta power and individual balance ability measured in a challenging beam walking task. Beta power increased similar to 50 ms after perturbation, and to a greater extent in larger perturbations. Lower individual balance ability was associated with greater beta power in only the late (150-250 ms) time bin. These findings demonstrate greater sensorimotor cortical engagement under more challenging balance conditions, which may provide a biomarker for reduced automaticity in balance control that could be used in populations with neurological impairments.

Alterations in sleep, sleep spindle, and EEG power in mGluR5 knockout mice	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						metabotropic glutamate receptor 5; N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors; polysomnography; sigma; visual evoked potentials	GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR 5; GAMMA ACTIVITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ABNORMALITIES; INSOMNIA; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; DISRUPTION; MODULATION; MECHANISMS	The type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) represents a novel therapeutic target for schizophrenia and other disorders. Schizophrenia is associated with progressive abnormalities in cortical oscillatory processes including reduced spindles (8-15 Hz) during sleep and increased delta (0.5-4 Hz)- and gamma-band activity (30-80 Hz) during wakefulness. mGluR5 knockout (KO) mice demonstrate many schizophrenia-like behaviors, including abnormal sleep. To examine the effects of mGluR5 on the maintenance of the neocortical circuitry responsible for such neural oscillations, we analyzed sleep/wake electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of mGluR5 KO mice at baseline, after 6 h of sleep deprivation, and during a visual method of cortical entrainment (visual steady state response). We hypothesized mGluR5-KO mice would exhibit translationally relevant abnormalities in sleep and neural oscillations that mimic schizophrenia. Power spectral and spindle density analyses were performed across 24-h EEG recordings in mGluR5-KO mice and wild-type (WT) controls. Novel findings in mGluR5 KO mice include deficits in sleep spindle density, wake alpha power, and 40-Hz visual task-evoked gamma power and phase locking. Sigma power (10-15 Hz), an approximation of spindle activity, was also reduced during non-rapid eye movement sleep transitions. Our observations on abnormal sleep/wake are generally in agreement with previous reports, although we did not replicate changes in rapid eye movement sleep. The timing of these phenotypes may suggest an impaired circadian process in mGluR5 KO mice. In conclusion, EEG phenotypes in mGluR5 KO mice resemble deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia. These findings implicate mGluR5-mediated pathways in several translationally relevant phenotypes associated with schizophrenia, and suggest that agents targeting this receptor may have harmful consequences on sleep health and daily patterns of EEG power. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) knockout (KO) mice show several translationally relevant abnormalities in neural oscillatory activity associated with schizophrenia. These include deficits in sleep spindle density, sigma and alpha power, and 40-Hz task-evoked gamma power. The timing of these phenotypes suggests an impaired circadian process in these mice. Previously reported rapid eye movement sleep deficits in this model were not observed. These findings suggest mGluR5-enhancing drugs may improve sleep stability and sleep spindle density, which could impact memory and cognition.

Level of Consciousness Is Dissociable from Electroencephalographic Measures of Cortical Connectivity, Slow Oscillations, and Complexity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anesthesia; cholinergic; consciousness; EEG; functional connectivity; noradrenergic	AREA INDUCES REANIMATION; LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; PROPOFOL-INDUCED LOSS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SLEEP; EEG; COHERENCE; KETAMINE; RECOVERY	Leading neuroscientific theories posit a central role for the functional integration of cortical areas in conscious states. Considerable evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on network changes during anesthesia, but it is unclear whether these changes represent state-related (conscious vs unconscious) or drug-related (anesthetic vs no anesthetic) effects. We recently demonstrated that carbachol delivery to prefrontal cortex (PFC) restored wakefulness despite continuous administration of the general anesthetic sevoflurane. By contrast, carbachol delivery to parietal cortex, or noradrenaline delivery to either prefrontal or parietal cortices, failed to restore wakefulness. Thus, carbachol-induced reversal of sevoflurane anesthesia represents a unique state that combines wakefulness with clinically relevant anesthetic concentrations in the brain. To differentiate the state-related and drug-related associations of cortical connectivity and dynamics, we analyzed the electroencephalographic data gathered from adult male Sprague Dawley rats during the aforementioned experiments for changes in functional cortical gamma connectivity (25-155 Hz), slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz), and complexity (<175 Hz). We show that higher gamma (85-155 Hz) connectivity is decreased (p <= 0.02) during sevoflurane anesthesia, an expected finding, but was not restored during wakefulness induced by carbachol delivery to PFC. Conversely, for rats in which wakefulness was not restored, the functional gamma connectivity remained reduced, but there was a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the power of slow oscillations and increase (p < 0.001) in cortical complexity, which was similar to that observed during wakefulness induced after carbachol delivery to PFC. We conclude that the level of consciousness can be dissociated from cortical connectivity, oscillations, and dynamics.

J	Kostoglou, K; Lunglmayr, M				Kostoglou, Kyriaki; Lunglmayr, Michael			Root tracking using time-varying autoregressive moving average models and sigma-point Kalman filters	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						ARMA models; Time-varying; Cascade structure; Sigma-point Kalman filter; Root tracking; Genetic algorithm; Ultrasound imaging	FREQUENCY; SIGNALS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; EXTRACTION; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS	Root tracking is a powerful technique that provides insight into the mechanisms of various time-varying processes. The poles and the zeros of a signal-generating system determine the spectral characteristics of the signal under consideration. In this work, time-frequency analysis is achieved by tracking the roots of time-varying processes using autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models in cascade form. A cascade ARMA model is essentially a high-order infinite impulse response (IIR) filter decomposed into a series of first- and second-order sections. Each section is characterized by real or conjugate pole/zero pairs. This filter topology allows individual root tracking as well as immediate stability monitoring and correction. Also, it does not suffer from high round-off error sensitivity, as is the case with the filter coefficients of the direct-form ARMA structure. Instead of using conventional gradient-based recursive methods, we investigate the performance of derivative-free sigma-point Kalman filters for root trajectory tracking over time. Based on simulations, the sigma-point estimators provide more accurate estimates, especially in the case of tightly clustered poles and zeros. The proposed framework is applied to real data, and more specifically, it is used to examine the time-frequency characteristics of raw ultrasonic signals from medical ultrasound images.

A Novel Technique to Trigger High Beta and Low Gamma Activity in Patients with Schizophrenia	XV MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING - MEDICON 2019	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDICON)	SEP 26-28, 2019	UNESCO World Heritage Univ, Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Univ Coimbra	UNESCO World Heritage Univ	Schizophrenia; Beta activity; Gamma activity; Auditory-motor task	OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONY	The main purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between resting state and auditory-motor task electroencephalogram beta and gamma distribution in healthy subjects and subjects with schizophrenia. First, we looked to changes in the resting state EEG distribution in three healthy subjects and in three patients with schizophrenia. We also analyzed high-beta and gamma cortical activity from high-density EEG during a cognitively-driven auditorymotor task in two participants, one normal subject and one diagnosed with schizophrenia. For the auditory-motor task, we asked the participants to press a button using the thumb of both hands independently, during two three-minute sessions. Resting state EEG showed more fragmentation in schizophrenia patients when compared with the healthy participants. During the auditory-motor task, we observed increased cortical fragmentation and clustering during the hand response in the patient and healthy control compared with a resting state EEG. The fragmentation remains stable during both hand response time and reference period located between the command "press" and "do not press" suggesting that this task activates a network which remains similar during the entire task.

Dissociating activation and integration of discourse referents: Evidence from ERPs and oscillations	CORTEX			English	Article						Reference resolution; Anaphora; Proper names; Theta; Gamma	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; WORD REPETITION; SENTENCE-LEVEL; PROPER-NAMES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE	A key challenge in understanding stories and conversations is the comprehension of 'anaphora', words that refer back to previously mentioned words or concepts ('antecedents'). In psycholinguistic theories, anaphor comprehension involves the initial activation of the antecedent and its subsequent integration into the unfolding representation of the narrated event. A recent proposal suggests that these processes draw upon the brain's recognition memory and language networks, respectively, and may be dissociable in patterns of neural oscillatory synchronization (Nieuwland & Martin, 2017). We addressed this proposal in an electroencephalogram (EEG) study with pre-registered data acquisition and analyses, using event-related potentials and neural oscillations. Dutch participants read two-sentence mini stories containing proper names, which were repeated or new (ease of activation) and semantically coherent or incoherent with the preceding discourse (ease of integration). Repeated names elicited smaller N400 and Late Positive Component amplitude than new names, and also an increase in theta-band (4-7 Hz) synchronization, which was largest around 240-450 ms after name onset. Discourse-coherent names elicited an increase in gamma-band (60-80 Hz) synchronization compared to discourse-incoherent names. This effect was largest around 690-1000 ms after name onset and exploratory beamformer analysis suggested a left frontal source. We argue that the initial activation and subsequent discourse-level integration of referents can be dissociated with event-related EEG activity, and are associated with respectively theta- and gamma-band activity. These findings further establish the link between memory and language through neural oscillations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For example, during actions, a copy of motor signals-termed "corollary discharge" (CD) or "efference copy" (EC)-can be transmitted to sensory regions and modulate perception. However, the sole inhibitory function of the motor copies is challenged by mixed empirical observations as well as multifaceted computational demands for behaviors. We hypothesized that the content in the motor signals available at distinct stages of actions determined the nature of signals (CD vs. EC) and constrained their modulatory functions on perceptual processing. We tested this hypothesis using speech in which we could precisely control and quantify the course of action. In three electroencephalography (EEG) experiments using a novel delayed articulation paradigm, we found that preparation without linguistic contents suppressed auditory responses to all speech sounds, whereas preparing to speak a syllable selectively enhanced the auditory responses to the prepared syllable. A computational model demonstrated that a bifurcation of motor signals could be a potential algorithm and neural implementation to achieve the distinct functions in the motor-to-sensory transformation. These results suggest that distinct motor signals are generated in the motor-to-sensory transformation and integrated with sensory input to modulate perception.

The basis for these improvements may be attentional control in conjunction with reward-related learning to amplify the execution of goal-relevant actions while suppressing goal-irrelevant actions. Given that EEG alpha power reflects inhibitory processing, a core component of attentional control, it might represent the electrophysiological substrate of cognitive improvement in video gaming. The aim of this study was to test whether non-video gamers (NVGs), non-action video gamers (NAVGs) and action video gamers (AVGs) exhibit differences in EEG alpha power, and whether this might account for differences in visual information processing as operationalized by the theory of visual attention (TVA). Forty male volunteers performed a visual short-term memory paradigm where they memorized shape stimuli depicted on circular stimulus displays at six different exposure durations while their EEGs were recorded. Accuracy data was analyzed using TVA-algorithms. There was a positive correlation between the extent of post-stimulus EEG alpha power attenuation (10-12 Hz) and speed of information processing across all participants. Moreover, both EEG alpha power attenuation and speed of information processing were modulated by an interaction between group affiliation and time on task, indicating that video gamers showed larger EEG alpha power attenuations and faster information processing over time than NVGs - with AVGs displaying the largest increase. An additional regression analysis affirmed this observation. From this we concluded that EEG alpha power might be a promising neural substrate for explaining cognitive improvement in video gaming.

There are few reports on its use. Its diagnostic yield is variable (7-57%) and can be related to the differences in recording time. The present study analyzes possible predictive factors to support the indication of a short-term VEEG. We analyzed short-term VEEG studies (<24 h) throughout a period of 5 years (2013-2017). The patients were clustered according to the date of last epileptic seizure and the frequency of epileptic events per month and subcategorized depending on the frequency found. Chi square univariate analysis was performed looking for predictive variables to obtain an epileptic short-term EEG. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with statistically significant variables. A total of 1092 VEEG were analyzed from 832 patients. 34.5% were reported as epileptic VEEG. In the multivariate analysis, 3 predictors of epileptic short-term VEEG were identified: The use of 2 or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (OR 1.67, CI 1.23-2.25, p = 0.001), the presence of an epileptic event in the last month (OR 1.53, CI 1.07-2.17, p = 0.018) and daily seizures (OR 1.84, CI 1.21-2.78, p = 0.004). Six-month seizure free subjects predict a non-epileptic VEEG (OR 0.58, CI 0.30-0.89, p = 0.013). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In clinical practice, the main method used for assessing pain is self-report; however, it is not possibly adopted in a huge number of vulnerable populations or by non-communicative patients such as those with disorders of speech and consciousness. Thus, the availability of an objective measure of the subjective pain's perception that complements the self-report pain assessments is a great significant demand in several clinical applications. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel approach to objectively quantify the subjective perception of pain. We integrated signal processing techniques and machine learning principles to learn brain signals associated with pain and classify them into one of four pain intensities (no pain, low, moderate, and high). We found that the signal processing revealed a direct correlation between Alpha frequency band power and the pain intensity, and the classifier could achieve an accuracy of 94.83%. This study provides a clue for the betterment of the collective scientific understanding of the brain's activities inflicted by the physical pain and helps in building a reliable automated prediction of pain.

Commercially available anesthetic state monitors perform poorly when ketamine is administered as an anesthetic-analgesic adjunct. Poor performance is likely because the models underlying these monitors are not optimized for the electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations that are unique to the co-administration of ketamine.Approach.In this work, we designed twok-nearest neighbors algorithms for anesthetic state prediction.Main results.The first algorithm was trained only on sevoflurane EEG data, making it sevoflurane-specific. This algorithm enabled discrimination of the sevoflurane general anesthesia (GA) state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.87, [95% CI, 0.76, 0.97]). However, it did not enable discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.43, [0.19, 0.67]). In our second algorithm, we implemented a cross drug training paradigm by including both sevoflurane and sevoflurane-plus-ketamine EEG data in our training set. This algorithm enabled discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.91, [0.84, 0.98]).Significance.Instead of a one-algorithm-fits-all-drugs approach to anesthetic state monitoring, our results suggest that drug-specific models are necessary to improve the performance of automated anesthetic state monitors.

Several studies have reported that time estimation involves the communication and synchronization of neural assemblies that decode the duration of time. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the interaction between different brain areas during time estimation. Brain electrical activity was recorded during a time perception task and correlation matrices were calculated using different frequency bands. Graph networks show an important contribution of fronto-central regions and left hemisphere. The estimation of time could involve the recruitment of attentional resources and the inhibition of motor responses to make a temporal prediction, by this way possibly monitoring the "flow of time".

Long-term seizure reduction and freedom following intracranial monitoring without additional surgical interventions	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Intracranial monitoring; Implantation effect; Microlesion effect; Seizure freedom; Thalamic electrodes	STIMULATION; REMISSION	The term 'implantation effect' is used to describe an immediate and transient improvement in seizure frequency following an intracranial study for seizure onset localization. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 190 consecutive patients undergoing intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, of whom 41 had no subsequent resection/ablation/stimulation; 33 had adequate data and follow-up time available for analysis. Analysis of seizure frequency following an intracranial study showed 36% (12/33) responder rate (>50% seizure reduction) at one year, decreasing and stabilizing at 20% from year 4 onwards. In addition, we describe three patients (9%) who had long term seizure freedom of more than five years following electrode implantation alone, two of whom had thalamic depth electrodes. Electrode implantation perhaps leads to a neuromodulatory effect sufficient enough to disrupt epileptogenic networks. Rarely, this may be significant enough to even result in long term seizure freedom, as seen in our three patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Development of novel measures of attentional behaviors may lead to earlier identification of children at risk for ASD. In this work, we first introduce a behavioral measure, Relative Average Look Duration (RALD), indicating attentional preference to different stimuli, such as social versus nonsocial stimuli; and then study its association with neurophysiological activity. We show that (1) ASD and typically developing (TD) children differ in both (absolute) Average Look Duration (ALD) and RALD to stimuli during an EEG experiment, with the most pronounced differences in looking at social stimuli; and (2) associations between looking behaviors and neurophysiological activity, as measured by EEG, are different for children with ASD versus TD. Even when ASD children show attentional engagement to social content, our results suggest that their underlying brain activity is different than TD children. This study therefore introduces a new measure of social/nonsocial attentional preference in ASD and demonstrates the value of incorporating attentional variables measured simultaneously with EEG into the analysis pipeline.

The present research aimed to investigate the electrophysiological (EEG) correlates during the observation of affective, social and informative gestures in non-verbal communication between encoder and decoder. Moreover, the hyperscanning paradigm allows investigating the individuals' inter-brain connectivity. Regarding gestures' type, the study's results showed a decrease of alpha (increased brain activity), and an increase of delta and theta brain responsiveness and inter-brain connectivity for affective and social gestures in frontal and posterior areas for informative ones. Concerning gestures' valence, an increase of left frontal theta activity and inter-brain connectivity was observed. Finally, about the inter-agents' role, the same brain responses and inter-brain connectivity patterns emerged both in encoder and decoder. This study allows discovering neural responses underlying gestures' type and valence during action observation, highlighting the validity of hyperscanning to investigate inter-brain connectivity mechanisms.

Global sleep homeostasis reflects temporally and spatially integrated local cortical neuronal activity	ELIFE			English	Article							SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; FIRING RATE HOMEOSTASIS; EEG; OSCILLATION; DYNAMICS; STATES; BRAIN; DEPRIVATION; TOPOGRAPHY; RECOVERY	Sleep homeostasis manifests as a relative constancy of its daily amount and intensity. Theoretical descriptions define 'Process S', a variable with dynamics dependent on global sleep-wake history, and reflected in electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4 Hz) during sleep. The notion of sleep as a local, activity-dependent process suggests that activity history must be integrated to determine the dynamics of global Process S. Here, we developed novel mathematical models of Process S based on cortical activity recorded in freely behaving mice, describing local Process S as a function of the deviation of neuronal firing rates from a locally defined set-point, independent of global sleep-wake state. Averaging locally derived Processes S and their rate parameters yielded values resembling those obtained from EEG SWA and global vigilance states. We conclude that local Process S dynamics reflects neuronal activity integrated over time, and global Process S reflects local processes integrated over space.

Especially in PD, maintaining cyclic movement can be significantly disturbed due to pathological changes in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Providing external cues improves timing of these movements in PD and also affects ET. The aim of this study is to determine differences in cortical activation patterns in PD and ET patients during externally and internally cued movements. Methods Eleven PD patients, twelve ET patients, OFF tremor suppressing medication, and nineteen age-matched healthy controls (HC) were included and asked to perform a bimanual tapping task at two predefined cue frequencies. The auditory cue, a metronome sound presented at 2 or 4 Hz, was alternately switched on and off every 30 s. Tapping at two different frequencies were used since it is expected that different brain networks are involved at different frequencies as has been shown in previous studies. Cortical activity was recorded using a 64-channel EEG cap. To establish the cortical activation pattern in each group, the task related power (TRP) was calculated for each subject. For inter-groups analysis, EEG electrodes for divided into 5 different areas. Results Inter-group analysis revealed significant differences in areas responsible for motor planning, organization and regulation and involved in initiation, maintenance, coordination and planning of complex sequences of movements. Within the area of the primary motor cortex the ET group showed a significantly lower TRP than the HC group. In the area responsible for combining somatosensory, auditory and visual information both patient groups had a higher TRP than the HC group. Conclusions Different neurological networks are involved during cued and non-cued movements in ET, PD and HC. Distinct cortical activation patterns were revealed using task related power calculations. Different activation patterns were revealed during the 2 and 4 Hz tapping task indicating different strategies to execute movements at these rates. The results suggest that a including a cued/non-cued tapping task during clinical decision making could be a valuable tool in an objective diagnostic protocol.

Thus, data fusion should employ all dimensions of data to both extract the shared information, and distinguish the dissimilarities of modalities. Method: In this paper, we present a new method based on Advanced Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (ACMTF) method to decompose the EEG tensor and fMRI matrix. We remove the confining assumption of identical shared components in ACMTF and propose an approach to maximize the correlation between the shared components of EEG and fMRI in the common mode, while removing the smearing effect of hemodynamic response function on fMRI data. This method is called Correlated Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (CCMTF). Results: Two simulation scenarios with different noise levels are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed CCMTF method. The simulation results show 30.1% and 23.38% average improvement of Match Scores over ACMTF and N-way Partial Least Square (N-PLS) methods, respectively. The proposed method is also applied to a real dataset of an auditory oddball paradigm. The results of real data analysis show that the proposed CCMTF method estimates the unknown number of shared components between EEG and fMRI data, with p-value less than 0.007. Conclusion and Significance: In addition to the improvement of match score, the simulation results demonstrate that CCMTF has higher performance than ACMTF for fusion of EEG and fMRI datasets in case of extracting the dissimilarities in modalities, and it provides more convenient interpretation of the results, in comparison to N-PLS method.

The compensation theory is analyzed in detail to reveal the characteristics of the impedance boosting method. The proposed chopper IA achieves very high input impedance of 18.9 G Omega and 18.5 G Omega at DC and 100 Hz respectively. It can reach 5.8 G Omega even at 1 kHz. With the common-mode feedback loop, up to 600 mVpp common-mode interference tolerance and 97 dB CMRR are achieved. The amplifier is implemented in a 0.18 mu m standard CMOS process and takes a power consumption of 1.34 mu W with a 1.2 V supply.

Research has shown greater levels of EEG gamma-band activity are experienced during threat perception and attentional bias. This has been identified in high math anxious individuals when confronted with math-based tasks, but has not yet been explored for number anxiety specifically. Single-digit numbers and letters were presented to 15 high and 15 low math anxious participants, who were required to observe the stimuli. High math anxious participants displayed significantly greater levels of gamma activity during number observation compared to letter observation. Findings suggest high math anxious individuals may have a threat-related response to observation of simple numerical stimuli. Further behavioural investigations are needed, but high math anxious individuals may display avoidance towards number and math due to a threat response associated with increased gamma activity.

J	Paul, K; Vassena, E; Severo, MC; Pourtois, G				Paul, Katharina; Vassena, Eliana; Severo, Mario Carlo; Pourtois, Gilles			Dissociable effects of reward magnitude on fronto-medial theta and FRN during performance monitoring	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						motivation; reward; RewP; theta	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; PREDICTION ERRORS; MIDLINE THETA; MONETARY LOSS; VALENCE; DYNAMICS; SENSITIVITY	Reward processing is influenced by reward magnitude, as previous EEG studies showed changes in amplitude of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and reward positivity (RewP), or power of fronto-medial theta (FM theta). However, it remains unclear whether these changes are driven by increased reward sensitivity, altered reward predictions, enhanced cognitive control, or a combination of these effects. To address this question, we asked 36 participants to perform a simple gambling task where feedback valence (reward vs. no-reward), its magnitude (small vs. large reward), and expectancy (expected vs. unexpected) were manipulated in a factorial design, while 64-channel EEG was recorded concurrently. We performed standard ERP analyses (FRN and RewP) as well as time-frequency decompositions (FM theta) of feedback-locked EEG data. Subjective reports showed that large rewards were more liked and expected than small ones. At the EEG level, increasing magnitude led to a larger RewP irrespective of expectancy, whereas the FRN was not influenced by this manipulation. In comparison, FM theta power was overall increased when reward magnitude was large, except if it was unexpected. These results show dissociable effects of reward magnitude on the RewP and FM theta power. Further, they suggest, that although large reward magnitude boosts reward processing (RewP), it can nonetheless undermine the need for enhanced cognitive control (FM theta) in case reward is unexpected. We discuss these new results in terms of optimistic bias or positive mood resulting from an increased reward magnitude.

It is based on experimental findings in two genetic models of childhood absence epilepsy-rats of WAG/Rij and GAERS strains. The model is organized hierarchically into two levels (brain structures and individual neurons) and composed of compartments for representation of somatosensory cortex, reticular and ventroposteriomedial thalamic nuclei. The cortex and the two thalamic compartments contain excitatory and inhibitory connections between four populations of neurons. Two connected subnetworks both including relevant parts of a C-T-C network responsible for SWD generation are modelled: a smaller subnetwork for the focal area in which the SWD generation can take place, and a larger subnetwork for surrounding areas which can be only passively involved into SWDs, but which is mostly responsible for normal brain activity. This assumption allows modeling of both normal and SWD activity as a dynamical system (no noise is necessary), providing reproducibility of results and allowing future analysis by means of theory of dynamical system theories. The model is able to reproduce most time-frequency changes in EEG activity accompanying the transition from normal to epileptiform activity and back. Three different mechanisms of SWD initiation reported previously in experimental studies were successfully reproduced in the model. The model incorporates also a separate mechanism for the maintenance of SWDs based on coupling analysis from experimental data. Finally, the model reproduces the possibility to stop ongoing SWDs with high frequency electrical stimulation, as described in the literature.	[Medvedeva, T.

The coherence method is a linear analysis method, which has certain limitations in further revealing the nonlinear coupling between neural signals. Although mutual information (MI) and transfer entropy (TE) based on information theory can capture both linear and nonlinear correlations, the equitability of these algorithms is ignored and the nonlinear components of the correlation cannot be separated. The maximal information coefficient (MIC) is a suitable method to measure the coupling between neurophysiological signals. This study extends the MIC to the time-frequency domain, named time-frequency maximal information coefficient (TFMIC), to explore the FCMC in a specific frequency band. The effectiveness, equitability, and robustness of the algorithm on the simulation data was verified and compared with coherence, TE- and MI- based methods. Simulation results showed that the TFMIC could accurately detect the coupling for different functional relationships at low noise levels. The dorsiflexion experimental results revealed that the beta-band (14-30 Hz) significant coupling was observed at channels Cz, C4, FC4, and FCz. Additionally, the results showed that the coupling was higher in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz) and beta-band (14-30 Hz) than in the gamma-band (31-45 Hz). This might be related to a transition between sensorimotor states. Specifically, the nonlinear component of FCMC was also observed at channels Cz, C4, FC4, and FCz. This study expanded the research on nonlinear coupling components in FCMC.

It is most commonly used in the identification of epileptogenic zones in cases of refractory epilepsy. The implanted electrodes generally provide a sparse sampling of a unique set of brain regions including deeper brain structures such as hippocampus, amygdala and insula that cannot be captured by superficial measurement modalities such as electrocorticography (ECoG). Despite the overlapping clinical application and recent progress in decoding of ECoG for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), sEEG has thus far received comparatively little attention for BCI decoding. Additionally, the success of the related deep-brain stimulation (DBS) implants bodes well for the potential for chronic sEEG applications. This article provides an overview of sEEG technology, BCI-related research, and prospective future directions of sEEG for long-term BCI applications.

In recent years, characteristics (power/frequency/phase) of occipital alpha os-cillations have been correlated with various perceptual phenomena. However, the relationship between inter -individual differences in alpha oscillatory characteristics and the properties of the underlying brain structures, such as white matter pathways, is unclear. A possibility is that intrinsic occipital alpha oscillations are medi-ated by thalamocortical interaction; we hypothesized that the most promising candidate for characterizing the intrinsic alpha oscillation is optic radiation (OR), which is the geniculo-cortical pathway carrying signals be-tween the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). We used resting-state magnetoence-phalography (MEG) and diffusion-weighted/quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (dMRI/qMRI) to correlate the frequency and power of occipital alpha oscillations with the tissue properties of the OR by focusing on the different characteristics across individuals. We found that the peak alpha frequency (PAF) negatively cor-related with intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), reflecting diffusion properties in intracellular (axonal) space, whereas the peak alpha power was not correlated with any tissue properties measurements. No significant cor-relation was found between OR and beta frequency/amplitude or between other white matter tract connecting parietal and inferotemporal cortex and alpha frequency/amplitude. These results support the hypothesis that an interaction between thalamic nuclei and early visual areas is essential for the occipital alpha oscillatory rhythm.

Speech segmentation based on the relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity can be used to estimate segmental contributions to perception in noisy conditions. High-RMS-level segments contain crucial information for speech perception. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of high-RMS-level speech segments on auditory attention decoding performance under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Scalp EEG signals were recorded when subjects listened to the attended speech stream in the mixed speech narrated concurrently by two Mandarin speakers. The temporal response function was used to identify the attended speech from EEG responses of tracking to the temporal envelopes of intact speech and high-RMS-level speech segments alone, respectively. Auditory decoding performance was then analyzed under various SNR conditions by comparing EEG correlations to the attended and ignored speech streams. The accuracy of auditory attention decoding based on the temporal envelope with high-RMS-level speech segments was not inferior to that based on the temporal envelope of intact speech. Cortical activity correlated more strongly with attended than with ignored speech under different SNR conditions. These results suggest that EEG recordings corresponding to high-RMS-level speech segments carry crucial information for the identification and tracking of attended speech in the presence of background noise. This study also showed that with the modulation of auditory attention, attended speech can be decoded more robustly from neural activity than from behavioral measures under a wide range of SNR.

Detection of anomalous high-frequency events in human intracranial EEG	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						automated detection algorithm; epilepsy surgery; High-frequency oscillations; machine learning; seizure onset zone	OSCILLATIONS 80-500 HZ; SEIZURE-ONSET ZONE; AUTOMATIC DETECTION; EPILEPSY; ALGORITHM; TIME; MACROELECTRODES; CLASSIFICATION; RESECTION; RIPPLES	ObjectiveHigh-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. However, no physiological definition of an HFO has been established, so detection relies on the empirical definition of an HFO derived from visual observation. This can bias estimates of HFO features such as amplitude and duration, thereby hindering their utility as biomarkers. Therefore, we set out to develop an algorithm that detects high-frequency events in the intracranial EEG that are morphologically distinct from background without requiring assumptions about event amplitude or shape. MethodWe propose the anomaly detection algorithm (ADA), which uses unsupervised machine learning to identify segments of data that are distinct from the background. We apply ADA and a standard HFO detector using a root mean square amplitude threshold to intracranial EEG from 11 patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery. The rate, amplitude, and duration of the detected events and the percent overlap between the two detectors are compared. ResultIn the seizure onset zone (SOZ), ADA detected a subset of conventional HFOs. In non-SOZ channels, ADA detected at least twice as many events as the standard approach, including some conventional HFOs; however, ADA also identified many low and intermediate amplitude events missed by the standard amplitude-based method. The rate of ADA events was similar across all channels; however, the amplitude of ADA events was significantly higher in SOZ channels (P < .0045), and the amplitude measurement was more stable over time than the HFO rate, as indicated by a lower coefficient of variation (P < .0125). SignificanceADA does not require human supervision, parameter optimization, or prior assumptions about event shape, amplitude, or duration. Our results suggest that the algorithm's estimate of event amplitude may differentiate SOZ and non-SOZ channels. Further studies will examine the utility of HFO amplitude as a biomarker for epilepsy surgical outcome.

Music training is increasingly associated with improvement in working memory, which is strongly related to both localized and distributed patterns of neural oscillations. Importantly, there is a small but growing number of reports of relationships between music training, working memory, and neural oscillations in adults. Taken together, these studies make important contributions to our understanding of the neural mechanisms that support effects of music training on behavioral measures of executive functions. In addition, they reveal gaps in our knowledge that hold promise for further investigation. The current review is divided into the main sections that follow: (1) discussion of behavioral measures of working memory, and effects of music training on working memory in adults; (2) relationships between music training and neural oscillations during temporal stages of working memory; (3) relationships between music training and working memory in children; (4) relationships between music training and working memory in older adults; and (5) effects of entrainment of neural oscillations on cognitive processing. We conclude that the study of neural oscillations is proving useful in elucidating the neural mechanisms of relationships between music training and the temporal stages of working memory. Moreover, a lifespan approach to these studies will likely reveal strategies to improve and maintain executive function during development and aging.

For pharmacoresistant patients, the surgical resection of the critical area is considered a valid clinical solution, therefore, an accurate localization is crucial to minimize neurological damage. In current clinical routine the characterization of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) is performed using invasive methods, such as Stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (SEEG). Medical experts perform the tag of neural electrophysiological recordings by visually inspecting the acquired data, a highly time consuming and subjective procedure. Here we show the results of an automatic multi-modal classification method for the evaluation of critical areas in focal epileptic patients. The proposed method represents an attempt in the characterization of brain areas which integrates the anatomical information on neural tissue, inferred using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in combination with spectral features extracted from SEEG recordings.

Modulation of gamma oscillations as a possible therapeutic tool for neuropsychiatric diseases: A review and perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Alzheimer; EEG; Gamma; Neuropsychiatric disorders; Rhythmic stimulation; tACS	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; WORKING-MEMORY PERFORMANCE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BAND ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; RESONANCE PHENOMENA; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	Gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz) are well-known for their role in cortical signal transmission and cognitive brain functions. Aberrant gamma activity has been observed in various neuropsychiatric disorders, but the clinical potential of restoring gamma oscillations via noninvasive brain stimulation has been widely neglected. Only recently, therapeutic effects of gamma entrainment were documented in mouse models of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) using rhythmic sensory stimulation. In the present review, we first summarize the current status of the research on gamma entrainment in mouse models of AD and human AD patients. Then, we suggest transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) as an alternative brain stimulation technique and review the recent literature on the effects of gamma tACS in healthy volunteers and neuropsychiatric diseases to document the efficacy of gamma tACS in improving cognitive functions. We discuss several advantages of tACS compared to rhythmic sensory stimulation for the entrainment of gamma oscillations in the human brain and emphasize the need for more clinical studies applying tACS to drive gamma oscillations and, in turn, to improve cognitive functioning not only in AD but also in patients suffering from other neuropsychiatric disorders.

J	Tanaka, H				Tanaka, Hirokazu			Group task-related component analysis (gTRCA): a multivariate method for inter-trial reproducibility and inter-subject similarity maximization for EEG data analysis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN; ROTATION; PCA; PROMAX; OSCILLATIONS; CRITERION; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; CRITIQUE; INFOMAX	EEG is known to contain considerable inter-trial and inter-subject variability, which poses a challenge in any group-level EEG analyses. A true experimental effect must be reproducible even with variabilities in trials, sessions, and subjects. Extracting components that are reproducible across trials and subjects benefits both understanding common mechanisms in neural processing of cognitive functions and building robust brain-computer interfaces. This study extends our previous method (task-related component analysis, TRCA) by maximizing not only trial-by-trial reproducibility within single subjects but also similarity across a group of subjects, hence referred to as group TRCA (gTRCA). The problem of maximizing reproducibility of time series across trials and subjects is formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem. We applied gTRCA to EEG data recorded from 35 subjects during a steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP) experiment. The results revealed: (1) The group-representative data computed by gTRCA showed higher and consistent spectral peaks than other conventional methods; (2) Scalp maps obtained by gTRCA showed estimated source locations consistently within the occipital lobe; And (3) the high-dimensional features extracted by gTRCA are consistently mapped to a low-dimensional space. We conclude that gTRCA offers a framework for group-level EEG data analysis and brain-computer interfaces alternative in complement to grand averaging.

However, measurement of feelings through explicit self-report is not without its limitations. The current study adds to previous work by showing a sophisticated way of first estimating how arousal is represented in the brain via an independent task (using EEG), and thereafter using this representation to measure arousal in response to advertisements. We then estimate the relationship between the identified process (arousal) and external measures of ad effectiveness (as measured by notability and attitude toward the ad). The results show that the neural measure of arousal is positively associated with notability of ads in the population at large, but may be negatively associated with attitude toward these ads. The implications for the application of EEG in ad testing and for understanding the relationship between arousal and effective advertising are discussed.	[Eijlers, Esther; Boksem, Maarten A.

Accurate detection of MDD via physiological signals represents an urgent research topic. Here, a frequency-dependent multilayer brain network, combined with deep convolutional neural network (CNN), is developed to detect the MDD. Multivariate pseudo Wigner distribution is firstly introduced to extract the time-frequency characteristics from the multi-channel EEG signals. Then multilayer brain network is constructed, with each layer corresponding to a specific frequency band. Such multilayer framework is in line with the nature of the workings of the brain, and can effectively characterize the brain state. Further, a multilayer deep CNN architecture is designed to study the brain network topology features, which is finally used to accurately detect MDD. The experimental results on a publicly available MDD dataset show that the proposed approach is able to detect MDD with state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.27%. Our approach, combining multilayer brain network and deep CNN, enriches the multivariate time series analysis theory and helps to better characterize and recognize the complex brain states.

Case report: A 33-year old man with three generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in history admitted for overnight video-EEG. At the age of 28, he had his first seizure soon after being diagnosed with Graves' disease. For four years, he received thiamazole and then underwent total thyroidectomy. EEG showed a high number of generalized 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges (GSWD) but also revealed numerous runs of bitemporal independent lateralized 3-Hz spike-and-wave activity (LSWA). GSWD and LSWA were mostly independent and had slightly different morphology. A diagnosis of IGE with GTCS upon awakening was made. On levetiracetam therapy, the patient demonstrated no seizure recurrence during 2-year follow-up. Repeated overnight EEG showed significant GSWD reduction and complete LSWA suppression. Discussion: To our knowledge, in patients with IGE, strictly lateralized spike-and-wave activity was never reported. In this case, thyroid dysfunction seemed to increase propensity to generate spontaneous seizures. We speculate that thyroid dysfunction superimposed on IGE thalamocortical network oscillations resulted in uncommon bitemporal independent LSWA.

GBOs were related to subjective pain intensity, years of migraine history and migraine attack frequency and the sources of GBOs were investigated. Methods: Twenty-three migraine patients without aura and 23 controls received a series of laser stimulations on their right forehead and right hand while recording electroencephalographic data (61 electrodes). After each series they indicated the perceived pain. A multitaper time-frequency method was used on artifact-cleaned scalp data and frequency domain beamforming was used to localize the GBOs. Results: In both groups we observed increases in GBOs around central electrodes, which were not significantly different between groups. The central GBOs were positively associated with the subjective pain ratings in the control group, in accordance with previous studies, but not in the migraine group. Increases in gamma power were observed in the midcingulate cortex. Conclusions: No evidence was found that GBOs differ between interictal migraine and controls nor that central GBOs represent a neurophysiological correlate of subjective pain in migraine. Significance: We shed light on observations of GBOs during pain processing in interictal migraine. (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Eighteen right-handed subjects (19.3 +/- 1.1 years old) created stories. The subjects reported the formation of story plot stereotypes (as we call them: self-induced) during self-regulated creative production, which had to be overcome with the instruction to continue the story. Creative task fulfillment (without formed stereotypes-first stage of creation) was characterized by a decrease in the wave percentages of 9-10 Hz, 10-11 Hz and 11-12 Hz frequencies and EEG desynchronization (decreases in EEG spectral power) in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10 Hz) and alpha2 (10-13 Hz) frequency bands in comparison with the REST (random episodic silent thought) state. The effortful creation task (with overcoming of self-induced stereotypes-second stage of creation) was characterized by increases in waves with frequencies of 9-10 Hz, 10-11 Hz, 11-12 Hz in temporal, occipital areas and pronounced EEG synchronization in alpha1,2 frequency bands in comparison with the free creation condition. It was also found, that the participants with the higher originality scores in psychological tests demonstrated increased percentage of high frequencies (11-12 Hz in comparison with those who had lower originality scores. Obtained results support the role of alpha and theta frequency bands dynamics in creative cognition.

Effects of priming intermittent theta burst stimulation on upper limb motor recovery after stroke: study protocol for a proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; BETA OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; REHABILITATION; PLASTICITY; METAPLASTICITY; VARIABILITY; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY	Introduction Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), delivered to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1), appears to enhance the brain's response to rehabilitative training in patients with stroke. However, its clinical utility is highly subject to variability in different protocols. New evidence has reported that preceding iTBS, with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) may stabilise and even boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS on the stimulated M1, via metaplasticity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of iTBS primed with cTBS (ie, priming iTBS), in addition to robot-assisted training (RAT), on the improvement of the hemiparetic upper limb functions of stroke patients and to explore potential sensorimotor neuroplasticity using electroencephalography (EEG). Methods and analysis A three-arm, subjects and assessors-blinded, randomised controlled trial will be performed with patients with chronic stroke. An estimated sample of 36 patients will be needed based on the prior sample size calculation. All participants will be randomly allocated to receive 10 sessions of rTMS with different TBS protocols (cTBS+iTBS, sham cTBS+iTBS and sham cTBS+sham iTBS), three to five sessions per week, for 2-3 weeks. All participants will receive 60 min of RAT after each stimulation session. Primary outcomes will be assessed using Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores and Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using kinematic outcomes generated during RAT and EEG. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from The Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee, University Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (reference number: HSEARS20190718003).

J	Ouyang, G				Ouyang, Guang			ReSync: Correcting the trial-to-trial asynchrony of event-related brain potentials to improve neural response representation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Event-related potential; Brain response variability; ERP latency jitter correction; Single trial ERPs; ERP decomposition	VARIABLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS; REGRESSION-BASED ESTIMATION; WAVE-FORMS; ADAPTIVE-FILTER; LATENCY; P300; VARIABILITY; STIMULUS; DECOMPOSITION; ERPS	Background: For various reasons, the brain response activities in electroencephalography (EEG) signals are not perfectly synchronized between trials with respect to event markers-a problem commonly referred to as latency jitter. Experimental technologies have been greatly advanced to reduce technical timing errors and thereby reduce jitter. However, there remain intrinsic sources of jitter that are difficult to remove. The problem becomes more complicated when multiple sub-components possess different degrees and features of jitter. The jitter issue renders trial-averaged ERP inaccurate and even misleading. Effective methods for correcting ERP distortion due to latency jitter are needed. New Method: This study developed a simple and easy-to-use method and toolbox for correcting ERP jitter based on simple signal processing theories, named ReSync. ReSync can be used to correct multiple overlapping ERP sub-components with different degrees of jitter (including static sub-components) without their affecting each other. Results: The theories, principles, technical details, and limitations of ReSync are presented in this paper, along with a series of simulation and real data examples used to evaluate and validate the method. Comparison with Existing Methods: ReSync was conceptually compared with previous methods in the literature that are related to tackling of the jitter issue from theoretical, methodological, and technical perspectives. Conclusions: Providing a novel approach to latency jitter estimation with automatic dominant frequency identification and integrated decomposition and reconstruction, the ReSync method was validated using both simulation and empirical data, and demonstrated to be an effective jitter-correction approach with implementational simplicity.

Overground Walking Decreases Alpha Activity and Entrains Eye Movements in Humans	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mobile EEG; alpha oscillations; blinks; saccades; locomotion; pupil size; walking phase; motor entrainment	VISUAL-MOTION; EEG ALPHA; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; LOCOMOTION; BRAIN; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; ATTENTION; CORTEX	Experiments in animal models have shown that running increases neuronal activity in early visual areas in light as well as in darkness. This suggests that visual processing is influenced by locomotion independent of visual input. Combining mobile electroencephalography, motion- and eye-tracking, we investigated the influence of overground free walking on cortical alpha activity (similar to 10 Hz) and eye movements in healthy humans. Alpha activity has been considered a valuable marker of inhibition of sensory processing and shown to negatively correlate with neuronal firing rates. We found that walking led to a decrease in alpha activity over occipital cortex compared to standing. This decrease was present during walking in darkness as well as during light. Importantly, eye movements could not explain the change in alpha activity. Nevertheless, we found that walking and eye related movements were linked. While the blink rate increased with increasing walking speed independent of light or darkness, saccade rate was only significantly linked to walking speed in the light. Pupil size, on the other hand, was larger during darkness than during light, but only showed a modulation by walking in darkness. Analyzing the effect of walking with respect to the stride cycle, we further found that blinks and saccades preferentially occurred during the double support phase of walking. Alpha power, as shown previously, was lower during the swing phase than during the double support phase. We however could exclude the possibility that the alpha modulation was introduced by a walking movement induced change in electrode impedance. Overall, our work indicates that the human visual system is influenced by the current locomotion state of the body. This influence affects eye movement pattern as well as neuronal activity in sensory areas and might form part of an implicit strategy to optimally extract sensory information during locomotion.

We examine a hierarchical, linear graph spectral model of brain activity at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales. The model formulation yields an elegant closed-form solution for the structure-function problem, specified by the graph spectrum of the structural connectome's Laplacian, with simple, universal rules of dynamics specified by a minimal set of global parameters. The resulting parsimonious and analytical solution stands in contrast to complex numerical simulations of high dimensional coupled nonlinear neural field models. This spectral graph model accurately predicts spatial and spectral features of neural oscillatory activity across the brain and was successful in simultaneously reproducing empirically observed spatial and spectral patterns of alpha-band (8-12 Hz) and beta-band (15-30 Hz) activity estimated from source localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). This spectral graph model demonstrates that certain brain oscillations are emergent properties of the graph structure of the structural connectome and provides important insights towards understanding the fundamental relationship between network topology and macroscopic whole-brain dynamics. .

J	Hindriks, R				Hindriks, Rikkert			A methodological framework for inverse-modeling of propagating cortical activity using MEG/EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TRAVELING-WAVES; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SLOW WAVES; SLEEP; EEG; MEG; FIELD; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; ANESTHESIA	The prevailing view on the dynamics of large-scale electrical activity in the human cortex is that it constitutes a functional network of discrete and localized circuits. Within this view, a natural way to analyse magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data is by adopting methods from network theory. Invasive recordings, however, demonstrate that cortical activity is spatially continuous, rather than discrete, and exhibits propagation behavior. Furthermore, human cortical activity is known to propagate under a variety of conditions such as non-REM sleep, general anesthesia, and coma. Although several MEG/EEG studies have investigated propagating cortical activity, not much is known about the conditions under which such activity can be successfully reconstructed from MEG/EEG sensor-data. This study provides a methodological framework for inverse-modeling of propagating cortical activity. Within this framework, cortical activity is represented in the spatial frequency domain, which is more natural than the dipole domain when dealing with spatially continuous activity. We define angular power spectra, which show how the power of cortical activity is distributed across spatial frequencies, angular gain/phase spectra, which characterize the spatial filtering properties of linear inverse operators, and angular resolution matrices, which summarize how linear inverse operators leak signal within and across spatial frequencies. We adopt the framework to provide insight into the performance of several linear inverse operators in reconstructing propagating cortical activity from MEG/EEG sensor-data. We also describe how prior spatial frequency information can be incorporated into the inverse-modeling to obtain better reconstructions.

Two types, iso-frequency coupling (IFC) and cross-frequency coupling (CFC), are existed in sensory-motor system for healthy people. However, in stroke, only a few studies focused on IFC between electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals, and no CFC studies have been found. Considering the intrinsic complexity and rhythmicity of the biological system, we first used the wavelet package transformation (WPT) to decompose the EEG and EMG signals into several subsignals with different frequency bands, and then applied transfer entropy (TE) to analyze the IFC and CFC relationship between each pair-wise subsignal. In this study, eight stroke patients and eight healthy people were enrolled. Results showed that both IFC and CFC still existed in stroke patients (EEG -> EMG: 1:1, 3:2, 2:1; EMG -> EEG: 1:1, 2:1, 2:3, 3:1). Compared with the stroke-unaffected side and healthy controls, the stroke-affected side yielded lower alpha, beta and gamma synchronization (IFC: beta; CFC: alpha, beta and gamma). Further analysis indicated that stroke patients yielded no significant difference of the FCMC between EEG -> EMG and EMG -> EEG directions. Our study indicated that alpha and beta bands were essential to concentrating and maintaining the motor capacities, and provided a new insight in understanding the propagation and function in the sensory-motor system.

J	Haar, S; Faisal, AA				Haar, Shlomi; Faisal, A. Aldo			Brain Activity Reveals Multiple Motor-Learning Mechanisms in a Real-World Task	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor learning; skill; real-world; EEG; post-movement beta rebound; motor neuroscience	SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; VARIABILITY; ADAPTATION; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; NOISE	Many recent studies found signatures of motor learning in neural beta oscillations (13-30 Hz), and specifically in the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). All these studies were in controlled laboratory-tasks in which the task designed to induce the studied learning mechanism. Interestingly, these studies reported opposing dynamics of the PMBR magnitude over learning for the error-based and reward-based tasks (increase vs. decrease, respectively). Here, we explored the PMBR dynamics during real-world motor-skill-learning in a billiards task using mobile-brain-imaging. Our EEG recordings highlight the opposing dynamics of PMBR magnitudes (increase vs. decrease) between different subjects performing the same task. The groups of subjects, defined by their neural dynamics, also showed behavioral differences expected for different learning mechanisms. Our results suggest that when faced with the complexity of the real-world different subjects might use different learning mechanisms for the same complex task. We speculate that all subjects combine multi-modal mechanisms of learning, but different subjects have different predominant learning mechanisms.	[Haar, Shlomi; Faisal, A.

Detecting stimulation-induced alterations of pathological brain networks may help to unravel the underlying physiological mechanisms related to effective stimulation delivery and optimize target engagement. Methods: We acquired 64-channel electroencephalography during ten ANT-DBS cycles (145 Hz, 90 mu s, 3-5 V) of 1-min ON followed by 5-min OFF stimulation to detect changes in cortical activity related to seizure reduction. The study included 14 subjects (three responders, four non-responders, and seven healthy controls). Mixed-model ANOVA tests were used to compare differences in cortical activity between subgroups both ON and OFF stimulation, while investigating frequency-specific effects for the seizure onset zones. Results: ANT-DBS had a widespread desynchronization effect on cortical theta and alpha band activity in responders, but not in non-responders. Time domain analysis showed that the stimulation induced reduction in theta-band activity was temporally linked to the stimulation period. Moreover, stimulation induced theta-band desynchronization in the temporal lobe channels correlated significantly with the therapeutic response. Responders to ANT-DBS and healthy-controls had an overall lower level of theta-band activity compared to non-responders. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that temporal lobe channel theta-band desynchronization may be a predictive physiological hallmark of therapeutic response to ANT-DBS and may be used to improve the functional precision of this intervention by verifying implantation sites, calibrating stimulation contacts, and possibly identifying treatment responders prior to implantation.

Impairments in cognition occur early in the course of illness and are associated with poor functional outcome, but have been difficult to treat with conventional treatments. Recent studies have implicated abnormal neural network dynamics and impaired connectivity in frontal brain regions as possible causes of cognitive deficits. For example, high-frequency, dorsal-lateral prefrontal oscillatory activity in the gamma range (30-50 Hz) is associated with impaired working memory in individuals with schizophrenia. In light of these findings, it may be possible to use EEG neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) to train individuals with schizophrenia to enhance frontal gamma activity to improve working memory and cognition. In a single-group, proof-of-concept study, 31 individuals with schizophrenia received 12 weeks of twice weekly EEG-NFB to enhance frontal gamma band response. EEG-NFB was well-tolerated, associated with increased gamma training threshold, and significant increases in frontal gamma power during an n-back working memory task. Additionally, EEG-NFB was associated with significant improvements in n-back performance and working memory, speed of processing, and reasoning and problem solving on neuropsychological tests. Change in gamma power was associated with change in cognition. Significant improvements in psychiatric symptoms were also found. These encouraging findings suggest EEGNFB targeting frontal gamma activity may provide a novel effective approach to cognitive remediation in schizophrenia, although placebo-controlled trials are needed to assess the effects of non-treatment related factors.

J	Begus, K; Bonawitz, E				Begus, Katarina; Bonawitz, Elizabeth			The rhythm of learning: Theta oscillations as an index of active learning in infancy	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Theta oscillations; Active learning; Infancy	PHASE-LOCKING; FRONTAL THETA; MEMORY; CURIOSITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXPLORATION; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; ATTENTION; CHILDREN	Active learning is a critical component of human development, however, the mechanisms supporting it are not fully understood. Given that early learning experiences may affect both infants' immediate learning success, as well as their motivation to learn, it is particularly important to investigate the mechanisms of active learning in this period, when the foundations of learning habits and curiosity are built. Traditional behavioural approaches of studying infant learning face challenges that emerging tools from neuroscience may help relieve. We introduce one such tool, EEG theta oscillations, and propose this neural marker has great potential for offering novel insights into active learning. Theta activity, recorded prior to or during learning, has been shown to be predictive of learning success. We argue that this involvement in memory formation, combined with theta activity's tight association with reward processing, makes theta oscillations a uniquely suited tool for the investigation of motivational mechanisms underlying active learning. We outline research questions as well as methodological approaches pertinent to infant learning and suggest how and why theta oscillations may offer complementary insights. As such, we aim to bridge the gap between cognitive and neural approaches, and advance our knowledge of active learning in development more broadly.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether amount of visual feedback during an isometric pinch grip contraction would influence these coherences in young and elderly adults. Thirty-three healthy young and elderly subjects performed pinch grip force-matching task with right thumb and index finger, while scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles were recorded. The amount of visual feedback was altered by manipulation of visual gain (low and high). Beta-band corticomuscular coherence was computed between EEG over the sensorimotor cortex and EMG from the FDI muscle and between EEG and EMG from the APB muscle (EEG-FDI and EEG-APB coherences). Also, beta-band intermuscular coherence was computed between EMG signals from the FDI and APB muscles (EMG-EMG coherence). Task performance was quantified as standard deviation (SD) of force and mean force error (MFE). EEG-FDI coherence was larger at high than low visual gain in the elderly but not in the young subjects, whereas there was no effect of age or visual gain on EEG-APB coherence. EMG-EMG coherence was smaller at high than low visual gain in the young and elderly subjects. The MFE was smaller at high than low visual gain in the young and elderly subjects, but the SD of force was smaller at high than low visual gain only in the young subjects. These results suggest that the effect of aging on beta-band coherence depends on the amount of visual feedback and further that visual feedback modulates beta-band corticomuscular and intermuscular coherences differently.

This makes it difficult to visualize the cortical lateralization of event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) during left and right foot motor imageries. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of using ERD/ERS in the mu, low beta, and high beta bandwidth, during left and right foot dorsiflexion kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI), as unilateral control commands for a brain-computer interface (BCI). EEG was recorded from nine healthy participants during cue-based left-right foot dorsiflexion KMI tasks. The features were analysed for common average and bipolar references. With each reference, mu and beta band-power features were analysed using time-frequency (TF) maps, scalp topographies, and average time course for ERD/ERS. The cortical lateralization of ERD/ERS, during left and right foot KMI, was confirmed. Statistically significant features were classified using LDA, SVM, and KNN model, and evaluated using the area under ROC curves. An increase in high beta power following the end of KMI for both tasks was recorded, from right and left hemispheres, respectively, at the vertex. The single trial analysis and classification models resulted in high discrimination accuracies, i.e. maximum 83.4% for beta ERS, 79.1% for beta ERD, and 74.0% for mu ERD. With each model the features performed above the statistical chance level of 2-class discrimination for a BCI. Our findings indicate these features can evoke left-right differences in single EEG trials. This suggests that any BCI employing unilateral foot KMI can attain classification accuracy suitable for practical implementation. Given results stipulate the novel utilization of mu and beta as independent control features for discrimination of bilateral foot KMI in a BCI.

To examine their temporal characteristics, we recorded electroencephalography during a visual backward-masking task, which required participants to localize the missing part of a target stimulus. A subsequent confidence rating was used as a proxy for the target's access to consciousness. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of all correct trials were determined relative to a brief period immediately before the target and then compared among consciousness levels. In an interval ranging from 2 s prior to target presentation up to this period, a negative relationship between slowly fluctuating ERP values and the level of consciousness became evident. After target presentation, high conscious awareness was characterized by an enhanced visual awareness negativity, an increased P3 component, and associated positive SCPs. Together, these findings add new evidence to the proposed role of SCPs in the emergence of visual consciousness.

Motor Imagery Hand Movement Direction Decoding Using Brain Computer Interface to Aid Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; motor imagery; phase locking value; event-related desynchronization; synchronization; brain-computer interface; neurorehabilitation	EEG	Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is a potential technology for active neurorehabilitation of stroke patients by complementing the conventional passive rehabilitation methods. Research to date mainly focused on classifying left vs. right hand/foot MI of stroke patients. Though a very few studies have reported decoding imagined hand movement directions using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI, the experiments were conducted on healthy subjects. Our work analyzes MI-based brain cortical activity from EEG signals and decodes the imagined hand movement directions in stroke patients. The decoded direction (left vs. right) of hand movement imagination is used to provide control commands to a motorized arm support on which patient's affected (paralyzed) arm is placed. This enables the patient to move his/her stroke-affected hand towards the intended (imagined) direction that aids neuroplasticity in the brain. The synchronization measure called Phase Locking Value (PLV), extracted from EEG, is the neuronal signature used to decode the directional movement of the MI task. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis on Mu and Beta frequency bands of EEG is done to select the time bin corresponding to the MI task. The dissimilarities between the two directions of MI tasks are identified by selecting the most significant channel pairs that provided maximum difference in PLV features. The training protocol has an initial calibration session followed by a feedback session with 50 trials of MI task in each session. The feedback session extracts PLV features corresponding to most significant channel pairs which are identified in the calibration session and is used to predict the direction of MI task in left/right direction. An average MI direction classification accuracy of 74.44% is obtained in performing the training protocol and 68.63% from the prediction protocol during feedback session on 16 stroke patients.

Pioneering animal work has already established a crucial role of memory reactivation to prepare and guide behaviour. Research in humans is now delineating the neural processes involved in memory reactivation during both wakefulness and sleep as well as their functional significance. Focusing on the electrophysiological signatures of memory reactivation in humans during both memory retrieval and sleep-related consolidation, this review provides an overview of the state of the art in the field. We outline recent advances, methodological developments and open questions and specifically highlight commonalities and differences in the neuronal signatures of memory reactivation during the states of wakefulness and sleep.

To classify the sleep stage from half-minute EEG, called an epoch, sleep experts investigate sleep-related events and consider the transition rules between the found events. Similarly, IITNet extracts representative features at a sub-epoch level by a residual neural network and captures intra- and inter-epoch temporal contexts from the sequence of the features via bidirectional LSTM. The performance was investigated for three datasets as the sequence length (L) increased from one to ten. IITNet achieved the comparable performance with other state-of-the-art results. The best accuracy, MF1, and Cohen's kappa (kappa) were 83.9%, 77.6%, 0.78 for SleepEDF (L = 10), 86.5%, 80.7%, 0.80 for MASS (L = 9), and 86.7%, 79.8%, 0.81 for SHHS (L = 10), respectively. Even though using four epochs, the performance was still comparable. Compared to using a single epoch, on average, accuracy and MF1 increased by 2.48%p and 4.90%p and F1 of N1, N2, and REM increased by 16.1%p, 1.50%p, and 6.42%p, respectively. Above four epochs, the performance improvement was not significant. The results support that considering the latest two-minute raw single-channel EEG can be a reasonable choice for sleep scoring via deep neural networks with efficiency and reliability. Furthermore, the experiments with the baselines showed that introducing intra-epoch temporal context learning with a deep residual network contributes to the improvement in the overall performance and has the positive synergy effect with the inter-epoch temporal context learning.

The objective of this study is to propose an objective index to evaluate the difference of tactile acuity between the left and right hand based on steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP). Approach. Two kinds of tactile sensations (vibration and pressure) with three levels of intensities (low/medium/high) were evoked on two finger areas of the left or right hand (thumb and index for healthy hands, thumb and index-projected areas for disabled hands) via transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Three forearm amputees and 13 able-bodied subjects were recruited to discriminate the specific level and area of the applied stimulation. Electroencephalography was adopted to simultaneously record the somatosensory cortex response to TENS. We assessed the discrimination performance (discrimination accuracy rate (AR) and response time (RT)) to quantify the tactile acuity, while the evoked SSSEP was synchronously analyzed. Linear regression analyses were performed between the difference of SSSEP amplitudes and the difference of discrimination performance for the left and right hand stimulation. Main results. Frequency domain analysis revealed that SSSEP amplitude increased with the increase of the stimulation intensity. There were positive correlations between the difference of SSSEP amplitudes and the difference of ARs for the left and right hand stimulation in the sensations of vibration (R-2 = 0.6389 for able-bodied subjects, R-2 = 0.5328 for amputees) and pressure (R-2 = 0.6102 for able-bodied subjects, R-2 = 0.5452 for amputees), respectively. Significance The SSSEP amplitude could be used as an objective index to evaluate the difference of the tactile acuity between the left and right hand and has the potential to be applied in sensory rehabilitation for amputees or stroke patients.

Methodology: We enrolled 31 children with ADHD (mean age 11.1 years; 23 boys) and 17 sex-, age-, and intelligence-matched TDC to undergo 19-channel EEGs during light sleep. We estimated functional connectivity using the phase lag index (PLI) and coherence measurements that capture the synchronization of EEG signals and graphed metrics with GRETNA. We also performed continuous performance tests (CPTs) on the children and obtained answered questionnaires on ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. Results: The central-to-posterior gamma PLI was lower in children with ADHD than that in TDC. The other PLI frequency bands and all coherence frequency bands were not statistically different between both groups. Individuals with high hyperactivity scores on questionnaires and low reaction times (SDs) on CPT had low motor and occipital pairs of gamma PLIs. Graph metrics showed no differences between the groups. Conclusions: The difference in averaged gamma PLI (especially with motor and occipital pairs) between groups was more suitable for diagnosis than the averaged coherence. Lower averaged gamma PLIs reflected more severe ADHD symptoms. A prospective study with more controlled conditions is warranted to determine if gamma-band PLI can be used as an auxiliary tool for ADHD diagnosis. (C) 2019 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

One possible strategy is to allocate attention to task-relevant time intervals. Prior work has linked auditory selective attention to alignment of neural modulations with stimulus temporal structure. However, since this prior research used relatively easy tasks and focused on analysis of main effects of attention across participants, relatively little is known about the neural foundations of individual differences in auditory selective attention. Here we investigated individual differences in auditory selective attention by asking participants to perform a 1-back task on a target auditory stream while ignoring a distractor auditory stream presented 180 degrees out of phase. Neural entrainment to the attended auditory stream was strongly linked to individual differences in task performance. Some variability in performance was accounted for by degree of musical training, suggesting a link between long-term auditory experience and auditory selective attention. To investigate whether short-term improvements in auditory selective attention are possible, we gave participants 2 h of auditory selective attention training and found improvements in both task performance and enhancements of the effects of attention on neural phase angle. Our results suggest that although there exist large individual differences in auditory selective attention and attentional modulation of neural phase angle, this skill improves after a small amount of targeted training.

Participants first performed a perceptual judgment task, then saw the majority opinion prior to submitting their final decision, and subsequently learned whether their final decision was correct. With incongruent initial self and others' opinions, the incorrect feedback to a non-conform (no-change) final decision elicited larger FRN while the incorrect feedback to a conform (change) decision elicited larger theta power, compared to their respective correct decisions. In addition, beta power was larger in the correct than incorrect conform decision. FRN and theta power, but not beta power, were associated with subsequent conformity behavior. The FRN and theta signals therefore demonstrated differential sensitivity to the source of information that drove a conformity decision.

This method involves having participants walk on a treadmill under two experimental conditions: a control condition (i.e., simply walking) and a multitasking condition (i.e., texting while walking). During these conditions, the participants must switch between the tasks related to the experimental condition and a direction determining task. This direction task is done with a point-light walker figure, seemingly walking towards the left or the right of the participant. Performance on the direction task represents the participant's task-switching costs. There were two performance measures: 1) correct identification of the direction and 2) response time. EEG data are recorded in order to measure the alpha oscillations and cognitive engagement occurring during the task switch. This method is limited in its ecological validity: pedestrian environments have many stimuli occurring simultaneously and competing for attention. Nonetheless, this method is appropriate for pinpointing task-switching costs. The EEG data allow the study of the underlying mechanisms in the brain that are related to differing task-switching costs. This design allows the comparison between task switching when doing one task at a time, as compared to task switching when multitasking, prior to the stimulus presentation. This allows understanding and pinpointing both the behavioral and neurophysiological impact of these two different task-switching conditions. Furthermore, by correlating the task-switching costs with the brain activity, we can learn more about what causes these behavioral effects. This protocol is an appropriate base for studying the switching cost of different smartphone uses. Different tasks, questionnaires, and other measures can be added to it in order to understand the different factors involved in the task-switching cost of smartphone use while walking.

Doctors often make diagnosis by observing the lung CT images. In order to further study the brain response structure and construct a brain-computer interface, we propose an isolated pulmonary nodule detection model based on a brain-computer interface. First, a single channel time-frequency feature extraction model is constructed based on the analysis of EEG data. Second, a multilayer fusion model is proposed to establish the brain-computer interface by connecting the brain electrical signal with a computer. Finally, according to image presentation, a three-frame image presentation method with different window widths and window positions is proposed to effectively detect the solitary pulmonary nodules.

Slow oscillation-spindle coupling predicts enhanced memory formation from childhood to adolescence	ELIFE			English	Article							SLEEP SPINDLES; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG; FREQUENCY; STIMULATION; CHILDREN; POWER; AGE; TRAJECTORIES	Precise temporal coordination of slow oscillations (SO) and sleep spindles is a fundamental mechanism of sleep-dependent memory consolidation. SO and spindle morphology changes considerably throughout development. Critically, it remains unknown how the precise temporal coordination of these two sleep oscillations develops during brain maturation and whether their synchronization indexes the development of memory networks. Here, we use a longitudinal study design spanning from childhood to adolescence, where participants underwent polysomnography and performed a declarative word-pair learning task. Performance on the memory task was better during adolescence. After disentangling oscillatory components from 1/f activity, we found frequency shifts within SO and spindle frequency bands. Consequently, we devised an individualized cross-frequency coupling approach, which demonstrates that SO-spindle coupling strength increases during maturation. Critically, this increase indicated enhanced memory formation from childhood to adolescence. Our results provide evidence that improved coordination between SOs and spindles indexes the development of sleep-dependent memory networks.

Intraindividual Characterization of the Sleep Spindle Variability in Healthy Subjects	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; RIPPLES; EEG	Spatial and frequency characterization of sleep spindles have been extensively addressed using M/EEG or fMRI recordings. However, its intraindividual variability across time has not been addressed. Here we propose to assess the intraindividual variability of sleep spindles in a time-resolved way by means of a trial-to-trial-variability (TTV) measure. For that purpose, the EEG of 26 healthy subjects were recorded overnight. After an exhaustive preprocessing pipeline to remove artifacts, spindles were automatically detected using a complex demodulation-based method. Then, the Wavelet Scalogram was estimated to validate it. Spindle TTV of each participant was also computed for all the conventional EEG frequency bands. Root mean square (RMS) of each TTV signal was calculated as a measure of the total variability of each spindle. Results showed significant differences in the variability between frequencies. Specifically, RMS in the beta-1 frequency band showed higher values as compared to all the other frequency bands (p<0.001). TTV curves showed a dichotomic trend, with lower frequencies showing an increase in the variability before the spindle onset, and higher frequencies showing such increase after the onset. The dependence of the spindle variability with the frequency could be explained by the influence of the multiple cortical generators involved.

This suggests that alpha-band activity may play a key role in the phenomenon of inattentional blindness, however this has not yet been empirically examined. The current study employed transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over occipital cortex at alpha, theta, and sham frequencies within an inattentional blindness task to delineate whether an exogenous manipulation of alpha oscillations has a modulatory effect on visual awareness of the unexpected stimulus. Results revealed that compared to theta and sham, those exposed to alpha tACS were more likely to be inattentionally blind to the unexpected stimulus. Findings extend current theoretical views of alpha by suggesting inattentional blindness may be explained as a suppression of irrelevant information via alpha-band.

Neural tracking and integration of 'self' and 'other' in improvised interpersonal coordination	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dual-EEG; Frequency-tagging; Joint action; Sensorimotor synchronization; Self and other	JOINT ACTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SIGNATURES; SYNCHRONY; RESPONSES; PERFORMANCE; FOLLOWERS; MOVEMENTS; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	Humans coordinate their movements with one another in a range of everyday activities and skill domains. Optimal joint performance requires the continuous anticipation of and adaptation to each other's movements, especially when actions are spontaneous rather than pre-planned. Here we employ dual-EEG and frequency-tagging techniques to investigate how the neural tracking of self- and other-generated movements supports interpersonal coordination during improvised motion. LEDs flickering at 5.7 and 7.7 Hz were attached to participants' index fingers in 28 dyads as they produced novel patterns of synchronous horizontal forearm movements. EEG responses at these frequencies revealed enhanced neural tracking of self-generated movement when leading and of other-generated movements when following. A marker of self-other integration at 13.4 Hz (inter-modulation frequency of 5.7 and 7.7 Hz) peaked when no leader was designated, and mutual adaptation and movement synchrony were maximal. Furthermore, the amplitude of EEG responses reflected differences in the capacity of dyads to synchronize their movements, offering a neurophysiologically grounded perspective for understanding perceptual-motor mechanisms underlying joint action.

However, the relation between them remains unclear. In this study, we investigated phase-amplitude coupling between infraslow phase (0.016-1 Hz) and HFOs' amplitude of focal impaired awareness seizures followed by focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, in a 28-year-old right-handed man with a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor. We recorded five habitual seizures. After the time of seizure onset, a significant increase in the power of HFOs was observed, and the power was significantly coupled with theta (4-8 Hz) phase. In contrast, coupling of infraslow activities and HFOs surged a few minutes before the seizure-onset time, and ictal HFOs discharged after that. Collectively, our results show that coupling of infraslow activities and HFOs precedes the seizure-onset time. We infer that such coupling may be a potential biomarker for seizure prediction.

J	Zumalacarregui, M				Zumalacarregui, Miguel			Gravity in the era of equality: Towards solutions to the Hubble problem without fine-tuned initial conditions	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; CONSTRAINTS; TENSION; LIGHT; H-0	Discrepant measurements of the Universe's expansion rate (Ho) may signal physics beyond the standard cosmological model. Here I describe two early modified gravity mechanisms that reconcile H-0 value by increasing the expansion rate in the era of matter-radiation equality. These mechanisms, based on viable Homdeski theories, require significantly less fine-tuned initial conditions than early dark energy with oscillating scalar fields. In imperfect dark energy at equality (IDEE), the initial energy density dilutes slower than radiation but faster than matter, naturally peaking around the era of equality. The minimal IDEE model, a cubic Galileon, is too constrained by the cosmic microwave background (Planck) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) to relieve the H-0 tension. In enhanced early gravity (EEG), the scalar field value modulates the cosmological strength of gravity. The minimal EEG model, an exponentially coupled cubic Galileon, gives a Planck + BAO value H-0 = 68.7 +/- 1.5 (68% CL), reducing the tension with SHOES from 4.4 sigma to 2.6 sigma. Additionally, Galileon contributions to cosmic acceleration may reconcile H-0 via lateuniverse phantom expansion (LUPE). Combining LUPE, EEG and A reduces the tension between Planck, BAO, and SHOES to 2.5 sigma. I will also describe additional tests of coupled Galileons based on local gravity tests, primordial element abundances and gravitational waves. While further model building is required to fully resolve the H-0 problem and satisfy all available observations, these examples show the wealth of possibilities to solve cosmological tensions beyond Einstein's general relativity.

Methods: Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were simultaneously recorded from 27 young and 19 elderly adults at resting state with their eyes closed. Alpha rhythm power fluctuation was extracted from EEG signal of parietal-occipital region and was fused with fMRI data by correlating alpha rhythm with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal using general linear models. Results: For both young adults and the elderly, the regions correlated with alpha rhythm power were widely distributed in cortical and subcortical regions. However, compared to young adults, correlations between alpha rhythm and the activity of thalamus and frontal regions were significantly reduced in the elderly. In addition, an increased correlation with alpha rhythm was found in frontal, insula and cingulate gyrus regions in the elderly. Conclusions: Changes in the roles of the above brain regions may be present in the generation or modulation of alpha rhythm due to age advancing. Significance: This study provides novel insight into the alteration of the spatial correlates of alpha rhythm in the elderly by using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data fusion analysis.

Concurrent human TMS-EEG-fMRI enables monitoring of oscillatory brain state-dependent gating of cortico-subcortical network activity	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; ALPHA-BAND; INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CAUSAL EVIDENCE; BETA-FREQUENCY; THETA BURST; CONNECTIVITY	Peters and Reithler et al. use TMS, EEG, and fMRI concurrently to study how oscillatory fluctuations in network excitability influence brain-wide propagation of TMS-induced activation. Exemplifying this approach in the human motor system, they show how these techniques can be combined to gain insights into gating of functional networks by oscillatory states. Despite growing interest, the causal mechanisms underlying human neural network dynamics remain elusive. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows to noninvasively probe neural excitability, while concurrent fMRI can log the induced activity propagation through connected network nodes. However, this approach ignores ongoing oscillatory fluctuations which strongly affect network excitability and concomitant behavior. Here, we show that concurrent TMS-EEG-fMRI enables precise and direct monitoring of causal dependencies between oscillatory states and signal propagation throughout cortico-subcortical networks. To demonstrate the utility of this multimodal triad, we assessed how pre-TMS EEG power fluctuations influenced motor network activations induced by subthreshold TMS to right dorsal premotor cortex. In participants with adequate motor network reactivity, strong pre-TMS alpha power reduced TMS-evoked hemodynamic activations throughout the bilateral cortico-subcortical motor system (including striatum and thalamus), suggesting shunted network connectivity. Concurrent TMS-EEG-fMRI opens an exciting noninvasive avenue of subject-tailored network research into dynamic cognitive circuits and their dysfunction.

Here, we aimed at examining frequency band related interactions between brain and muscles during different movement periods of a bipedal squat (BpS) task utilizing regression corticomuscular coherence (rCMC), as well as partial directed coherence (PDC) analyses. Participants performed 40 squats, divided into three successive movement periods (Eccentric (ECC), Isometric (ISO) and Concentric (CON)) in a standardized manner. EEG was recorded from 32 channels specifically-tailored to cover bilateral sensorimotor areas while bilateral EMG was recorded from four main muscles of BpS. We found both significant CMC and PDC (in beta and gamma bands) during BpS execution, where CMC was significantly elevated during ECC and CON when compared to ISO. Further, the dominant direction of information flow (DIF) was most prominent in EEG-EMG direction for CON and EMG-EEG direction for ECC. Collectively, we provide novel evidence that motor control during BpS is potentially achieved through central motor commands driven by a combination of directed inputs spanning across multiple frequency bands. These results serve as an important step toward a better understanding of brain-muscle relationships during multi joint compound movements.

Previous research in adult patients has shown reduced sleep spindle activity, transient oscillations in the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) generated through thalamocortical loops. The current study examines sleep spindle activity in patients with COS. Seventeen children and adolescents with COS (16 years 6.6) underwent overnight sleep EEG recordings. Sleep spindle activity was compared between patients with COS and age and gender matched controls and correlated with clinical symptom severity. We found pronounced deficits in sleep spindle amplitude, duration, density and frequency in patients with COS (effect size = 0.61 to 1.96; dependent on metric and EEG derivation). Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep EEG power and coherence in the sigma band (11-16 Hz) corresponding to spindle activity were also markedly diminished in patients with COS as compared to controls. Furthermore, the degree of deficit in power and coherence of spindles was strongly associated with clinician rated hallucinations and positive symptoms over widespread cortical regions. Our finding of diminished spindle activity and its association with hallucinations likely reflect dysfunction of the thalamocortical circuits in children and adolescents with COS. Given the relative ease of sleep EEG recordings in vulnerable populations, this study highlights the potential of such recordings to characterize brain function in schizophrenia.

A more detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and timing of the synchronization of frequency bands would contribute substantially to the clarification of neural mechanisms that underlie performance of the Go/NoGo task. Methods The present study used a machine learning approach to learn the features that distinguish between ERSPs involved in selection and inhibition in a Go/NoGo task. A single-layer neural network classifier was used to predict task conditions for each subject to characterize ERSPs associated with Go versus NoGo trials. Results The final classifier accurately identified individual task conditions at an overall rate of 92%, estimated by fivefold cross-validation. The detailed accounting of EEG time-frequency patterns localized to brain regions (i.e., thalamus, pre-SMA, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex) corroborates and also elaborates upon previous findings from fMRI and EEG studies, and expands the information about EEG power changes in multiple frequency bands (i.e., primarily theta power increase, alpha decreases, and beta increases and decreases) within these regions underlying the selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials. Conclusion This time-frequency-based classifier extends previous spatiotemporal findings and provides information about neural mechanisms underlying selection and inhibition processes engaged in Go and NoGo trials, respectively. This neural network classifier can be used to assess time-frequency patterns from an individual subject and thus may offer insight into therapeutic uses of neuromodulation in neural dysfunction.

Invasive electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements are commonly used to evaluate functions of the human amygdala, but a comprehensive understanding of their relation is still lacking. Here, we aimed at investigating the link between fast and slow frequency amygdalar oscillations, neuronal firing and hemodynamic responses. To this aim, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), hemodynamic responses and single neuron activity from the amygdala of patients with epilepsy. Patients were presented with dynamic visual sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition), interleaved with sequences of neutral landscapes (neutral condition). Comparing responses to aversive versus neutral stimuli across participants, we observed enhanced high gamma power (HGP, >60 Hz) during the first 2 s of aversive sequence viewing, and reduced delta power (1-4 Hz) lasting up to 18 s. In 5 participants with implanted microwires, neuronal firing rates were enhanced following aversive stimuli, and exhibited positive correlation with HGP and hemodynamic responses. Our results show that high gamma power, neuronal firing and BOLD responses from the human amygdala are co-modulated. Our findings provide, for the first time, a comprehensive investigation of amygdalar responses to aversive stimuli, ranging from single-neuron spikes to local field potentials and hemodynamic responses.

Distinguishing cognitive effort and working memory load using scale-invariance and alpha suppression in EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Working memory; Cognitive effort; Scale-invariance; EEG	BRAIN DYNAMICS; CAPACITY; PSYCHOPHYSICS; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; LIMITS	Despite being intuitive, cognitive effort has proven difficult to define quantitatively. Here, we proposed to study cognitive effort by investigating the degree to which the brain deviates from its default state, where brain activity is scale-invariant. Specifically, we measured such deviations by examining changes in scale-invariance of brain activity as a function of task difficulty and posited suppression of scale-invariance as a proxy for exertion of cognitive effort. While there is some fMRI evidence supporting this proposition, EEG investigations on the matter are scant, despite the EEG signal being more suitable for analysis of scale invariance (i.e., having a much broader frequency range). In the current study we validated the correspondence between scale-invariance (H) of cortical activity recorded by EEG and task load during two working memory (WM) experiments with varying set sizes. Then, we used this neural signature to disentangle cognitive effort from the number of items stored in WM within participants. Our results showed monotonic decreases in H with increased set size, even after set size exceeded WM capacity. This behavior of H contrasted with behavioral performance and an oscillatory indicator of WM load (i.e., alpha-band desynchronization), both of which showed a plateau a difficulty levels surpassing WM capacity. This is the first reported evidence for the suppression of scale-invariance in EEG due to task difficulty, and our work suggests that H suppression may be used to quantify changes in cognitive effort even when working memory load is a maximum capacity.

Large effects of brief meditation intervention on EEG spectra in meditation novices	IBRO REPORTS			English	Article						Stress; Brain waves; Meditation; States of consciousness; Electroencephalogram (EEG)	COGNITIVE THERAPY; STRESS REDUCTION; MINDFULNESS; BRAIN; NEUROSCIENCE; STIMULATION; INTEGRATION; DISORDERS; STATES; ERP	This study investigated the impact of a brief meditation workshop on a sample of 223 novice meditators. Participants attended a three-day workshop comprising daily guided seated meditation sessions using music without vocals that focused on various emotional states and intentions (open focus). Based on the theory of integrative consciousness, it was hypothesized that altered states of consciousness would be experienced by participants during the meditation intervention as assessed using electroencephalogram (EEG). Brainwave power bands patterns were measured throughout the meditation training workshop, producing a total of 5616 EEG scans. Changes in conscious states were analysed using pre-meditation and post-meditation session measures of delta through to gamma oscillations. Results suggested the meditation intervention had large varying effects on EEG spectra (up to 50 % increase and 24 % decrease), and the speed of change from pre-meditation to post-meditation state of the EEG co-spectra was significant (with 0.76 probability of entering end-meditation state within the first minute). There was a main 5 % decrease in delta power (95 % HDI = [-0.07, -0.03]); a global increase in theta power of 29 % (95 % HDI = [0.27, 0.33]); a global increase of 16 % (95 % HDI = [0.13, 0.19]) in alpha power; a main effect of condition, with global beta power increasing by 17 % (95 % HDI = [0.15, 0.19]); and an 11 % increase (95 % HDI = [0.08, 0.14]) in gamma power from pre-meditation to end-meditation. Findings provided preliminary support for brief meditation in altering states of consciousness in novice meditators. Future clinical examination of meditation was recommended as an intervention for mental health conditions particularly associated with hippocampal impairments.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in the magnitude of electroencephalogram-electromyography (EEG-EMG) coherence and phase synchronization index (PSI) induced by antagonistic muscle prefatigue. Methods Twelve young male volunteers conducted a 30-s long, nonfatiguing isometric elbow extension with a target force level of 20% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) before and after a fatiguing sustained elbow flexion contraction at 20% MVC until task failure. Coherence and PSI between the EEG recorded over the sensorimotor cortex and the surface EMG of the triceps brachii (TB) muscle were quantified for the pre- and post-fatigue elbow extension contractions. Results Coherence and PSI in the gamma frequency band (35-60 Hz) were found significantly decreased in the postfatigue elbow extension contraction than the prefatigue contraction. The power of the EEG in the beta and gamma band were significantly increased, while the EMG power showed no significant changes when the antagonistic muscle was prefatigued. PSI in the gamma frequency band between the EMG of the TB muscle and the EEG were found significantly decreased during postfatigue elbow extension contraction compared with prefatigue contraction. Conclusion Antagonistic muscle prefatigue led to significantly lower gamma band corticomuscular coherence and phase coupling during an isometric elbow extension position task. The lower corticomuscular coupling may indicate a central modulation mechanism of antagonist muscle prefatigue that related to decreased descending common drive or joint instability compensation modulation mechanism.

This work aims at designing novel microelectrodes in order to optimize the recording and further detection of HFOs in brain (intracerebral electroencephalography, iEEG). The quality of the recorded iEEG signals is highly dependent on the electrode contact impedance, which is determined by the characteristics of the recording electrode (geometry, position, material). These properties are essential for the observability of HFOs. In this study, a previously published hippocampal neural network model is used for the simulation of interictal HFOs. An additional microelectrode model layer is implemented in order to simulate the impact of using different types and characteristics of microelectrodes on the recorded HFOs. Results indicate that a small layer PEDOT/PSS and PEDOT/CNT on microelectrodes can effectively decrease their impedance resulting in the increase of HFOs observability. This model- based study can lead to the actual design of new electrodes that will ultimately contribute to improved diagnosis prior to invasive therapies.

Mindfulness meditation alters neural activity underpinning working memory during tactile distraction	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; Working memory; Cognitive control; Mindfulness; Electroencephalography	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN; EEG; ALPHA; PAIN; MODULATION; CAPACITY; P300; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS	Evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation (MM) improves selective attention and reduces distractibility by enhancing top-down neural modulation. Altered P300 and alpha neural activity from MM have been identified and may reflect the neural changes that underpin these improvements. Given the proposed role of alpha activity in supressing processing of task-irrelevant information, it is theorised that altered alpha activity may underlie increased availability of neural resources in meditators. The present study investigated attentional function in meditators using a cross-modal study design, examining the P300 during working memory (WM) and alpha activity during concurrent distracting tactile stimuli. Thirty-three meditators and 27 healthy controls participated in the study. Meditators showed a more frontal distribution of P300 neural activity following WM stimuli (p= 0.005, eta(2)= 0.060) and more modulation of alpha activity at parietal-occipital regions between single (tactile stimulation only) and dual task demands (tactile stimulation plus WM task) (p< 0.001, eta(2)= 0.065). Additionally, meditators performed more accurately than controls (p= 0.038, eta(2)= 0.067). The altered distribution of neural activity concurrent with improved WM performance suggests greater attentional resources dedicated to task related functions, such as WM in meditators. Thus, meditation-related neural changes are likely multifaceted, involving both altered distribution and also amplitudes of brain activity, thereby enhancing attentional processes depending on task requirements.

We aim to analyze the impact of a transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol, the continuous theta burst (cTBS), on human neurophysiology, particularly on contralateral motor rhythms. cTBS was applied in 20 subjects over the primary motor cortex. We recorded brain electrical activity pre- and post-cTBS with electroencephalography both at rest and while performing motor tasks, to evaluate changes in brain oscillatory patterns such as mu and beta rhythms. Moreover, we measured motor-evoked potentials before and after cTBS to assess its impact on brain's excitability. On the hemisphere contralateral to the protocol, we did observe a significant increase in mu (p = 0.027) and beta (p = 0.006) rhythms from pre- to post-cTBS, at the beginning of arm elevation. The topology of action planning and motor execution suggests that cTBS produced an inhibitory effect that propagated to the contralateral hemisphere, thereby precluding the expected/desired excitation for therapy purposes. This novel approach provides support for the notion that this protocol induces inhibitory changes in contralateral motor rhythms, by decreasing desynchronization, contradicting the ipsilateral inhibition vs. contralateral disinhibition hypothesis. Our results have implications for personalized cTBS usage as a rehabilitation intervention, suggesting that an unexpected propagation of inhibition can occur.

Two competing models have been suggested for the cancellation of such specific actions: (1) the abrupt engagement of a unitary global inhibitory mechanism followed by reinitiation of the continuing actions; or (2) a balance between distinct global and selective inhibitory mecha-nisms. To evaluate these models, we examined behavioral and physiological markers of proactive control, motor preparation, and response inhibition using a combination of behavioral task performance measures, electromyography, electroencephalography, and motor evoked potentials elicited with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Healthy human participants of either sex performed two versions of a stop signal task with cues incorporating proactive control: a unimanual task involving the initiation and inhibition of a single response, and a bimanual task involving the selective stopping of one of two prepared responses. Stopping latencies, motor evoked potentials, and frontal # power (13-20 Hz) did not differ between the unimanual and bimanual tasks. However, evidence for selective proactive control before stopping was manifest in the bimanual condition as changes in corticomotor excitability, l (9-14 Hz), and # (15-25 Hz) oscillations over sensorimotor cortex. Together, our results favor the recruitment of a single inhibitory stopping mechanism with the net behavioral output depending on the levels of action-specific motor preparation.

Preferred EEG brain states at stimulus onset in normal ageing: Explorations in a fixed interstimulus interval Go/NoGo task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Ageing; Preferred phase states; Event-related potentials; Brain dynamics; Phase synchronisation; Orthogonal phase effects; Principal Components Analysis; Auditory Go/NoGo task	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; DYNAMICS; PHASE; ATTENTION; CHILDREN; TOOLBOX	Some 40 years ago, Erol Basar began an interesting line of brain dynamics research on the phase of oscillatory EEG activity. Stimuli presented at a fixed interstimulus interval (ISI) were reported to produce a "preferred phase angle" at stimulus onset in the ongoing EEG oscillations, so that cortical negativity occurred more often than expected. Our previous work has confirmed this phenomenon in young adults, and linked it to enhancements in stimulus-elicited ERP components and behaviour. The present study sought evidence for this phenomenon in older adults. Twenty healthy independent-living participants (5 males) aged 59.8 to 74.8 years (M = 68.2) completed a fixed ISI equiprobable auditory oddball task. EEG phases in four traditional bands were computed separately for each artefact-free Go and NoGo trial. These were used to group accepted trials according to the phase quartile at stimulus onset in each band, forming 16 mean ERPs for each participant at each phase quartile/band combination, separately for Go and NoGo. The 32 mean ERPs were decomposed by separate Principal Component Analyses, and the N1 and P3 components were examined as a function of EEG phase at stimulus onset in each band. Differential preferential occurrence of phase states was found in all bands, generally confirming prior results in young adults despite important age differences in both EEG spectra and ERP morphology. Substantial effects on N1 and P3 components, as well as prestimulus CNVs, are discussed. The stability of this phenomenon across age indicates its important role in perception and cognition.

Invasive EEG study is usually necessary to delineate the epileptogenic zone, but constructing an accurate hypothesis to define an appropriate electrode implantation scheme and the treatment is challenging. This article reviews recent studies that help understanding the epileptogenicity and potential therapeutic options in PNH. Recent Findings New noninvasive diagnostic and intracerebral EEG analytic tools demonstrated that cortical hyperexcitability and aberrant connectivity (between nodules and cortices and among nodules) are likely mechanisms causing epilepsy in most patients. The deeply seated PNH, if epileptogenic, are ideal target for stereotactic ablative techniques, which offer concomitant ablation of multiple regions with relatively satisfactory seizure outcome. Advance in diagnostic and analytic tools have enhanced our understanding of the complex epileptogenicity in PNH. Development in stereotactic ablative techniques now offers promising therapeutic options for these patients.

However, melatonin's effects on cortical activity during NREMS in AD have not been studied. The objective of this research was to analyze the effects of melatonin on cortical activity during the stages of NREMS in 8 mild-to-moderate AD patients that received 5-mg of fast-release melatonin. Methods: During a single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, polysomnographic recordings were obtained from C3-A1, C4-A2, F7-T3, F8-T4, F3-F4 and O1-O2. Also, the relative power (RP) and EEG coherences of the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2 and gamma bands were calculated during NREMS-1, NREMS-2 and NREMS-3. These sleep latencies and all EEG data were then compared between the placebo and melatonin conditions. Results: During NREMS-2, a significant RP increase was observed in the theta band of the left-central hemisphere. During NREMS-3, significant RP decreases in the beta bands were recorded in the right-central hemisphere, compared to the placebo group. After melatonin administration, significant decreases of EEG coherences in the beta2, beta1 and gamma bands were observed in the right hemisphere during NREMS-3. Discussion: We conclude that short NREMS onset related to melatonin intake in AD patients is associated with a significant RP increase in the theta band and a decrease in RP and EEG coherences in the beta and gamma bands during NREMS-3. These results suggest that the GABAergic pathways are preserved in mild-to-moderate AD.

J	Borawska, A; Oleksy, T; Maison, D				Borawska, Anna; Oleksy, Tomasz; Maison, Dominika			Do negative emotions in social advertising really work? Confrontation of classic vs. EEG reaction toward advertising that promotes safe driving	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FEAR APPEALS; THREAT APPEALS; NEUROSCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE; SELF-REPORT; MESSAGES; ASYMMETRY; ATTITUDES; IMPACT; ADVERTISEMENTS; OSCILLATIONS	Social campaigns are persuasive messages that attempt to communicate positive ideas and practices. One of the main challenges in designing effective social campaigns is the need to compete with other advertisements for viewers' attention. One of the most widely used methods of drawing attention to social advertising is the use of negative emotions. However, the effectiveness of negative emotional appeals in social campaigns is still a topic of debates. The aim of the study was to use both declarative and neural (EEG) measures to examine whether increasing the intensity of negative emotions in a social campaign enhances its effectiveness linearly or only to a certain level (curvilinear relation). The experimental study was conducted (N = 62) with road safety campaign, using three different levels of negative emotional intensity. The results showed that even though advertising with the strongest negative stimuli evoked the strongest negative emotions, it had no significantly stronger influence on behavioral intention (driving less risky) than moderately negative stimuli. Moreover, neural reaction to the negative stimuli in advertising depended on driving style-people with risky driving style payed less attention to more threatening message (higher beta oscillations).

In a parallel literature, hippocampal theta activity (4-10 Hz) has been shown to modulate the appearance of neocortical fast gamma oscillations (100-150 Hz), a phenomenon known as cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Even though CFC has also been previously associated with information routing, it remains to be determined whether it directly relates to CTC. In particular, for the theta-fast gamma example at hand, a critical question is to know if the phase of the theta cycle influences gamma synchronization across the neocortex. To answer this question, we combined CFC (modulation index) and CTC (phase-locking value) metrics in order to detect the modulation of the cross-regional high-frequency synchronization by the phase of slower oscillations. Upon applying this method, we found that the inter-hemispheric synchronization of neocortical fast gamma during REM sleep depends on the instantaneous phase of the theta rhythm. These results show that CFC is likely to aid long-range information transfer by facilitating the synchronization of faster rhythms, thus consistent with classical CTC views. (C) 2020 IBRO.

Prefrontal Multielectrode Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Modulates Performance and Neural Activity Serving Visuospatial Processing	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						laterality effects; magnetoencephalography; neural oscillations; spontaneous activity	VISUAL GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-STIMULATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN; ATTENTION; CORTEX; EEG	The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is known to play a critical role in visuospatial attention and processing, but the relative contribution of the left versus right DLPFC remains poorly understood. We applied multielectrode transcranial direct-current stimulation (ME-tDCS) to the left and right DLPFC to investigate its net impact on behavioral performance and population-level neural activity. The primary hypothesis was that significant laterality effects would be observed in regard to behavior and neural oscillations. Twenty-five healthy adults underwent three visits (left, right, and sham ME-tDCS). Following stimulation, participants completed a visuospatial processing task during magnetoencephalography (MEG). Statistically significant oscillatory events were imaged, and time series were then extracted from the peak voxels of each response. Behavioral findings indicated differences in reaction time and accuracy, with left DLPFC stimulation being associated with slower responses and decreased accuracy compared to right stimulation. Left DLPFC stimulation was also associated with increases in spontaneous theta and decreases in gamma within occipital cortices relative to both right and sham stimulation, while connectivity among DLPFC and visual cortices was generally increased contralateral to stimulation. These data suggest spectrally specific modulation of spontaneous cortical activity at the network-level by ME-tDCS, with distinct outcomes based on the laterality of stimulation.

Whether TMR acts locally or globally on cortical sleep oscillations remains unknown. Here, we exploit the unique functional neuroanatomy of olfaction with its ipsilateral stimulus processing to perform local TMR in one brain hemisphere. Participants learned associations between words and locations in left or right visual fields with contextual odor throughout. We found lateralized event-related potentials during task training that indicate unihemispheric memory processes. During post-learning naps, odors were presented to one nostril in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Memory for specific words processed in the cued hemisphere (ipsilateral to stimulated nostril) was improved after local TMR during sleep. Unilateral odor cues locally modulated slow-wave (SW) power such that regional SW power increase was lower in the cued hemisphere relative to the uncued hemisphere and negatively correlated with select memories for cued words. Moreover, local TMR improved phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between slow oscillations and sleep spindles specifically in the cued hemisphere. The effects on memory performance and cortical sleep oscillations were not observed when unilateral olfactory stimulation during sleep followed learning without contextual odor. Thus, TMR in human sleep transcends global action by selectively promoting specific memories associated with local sleep oscillations.

Methods The pain state was established by spraying capsaicin on subjects' left inner forearm. A total of 20 experimental pain subjects and 20 matched nonpain controls underwent cognitive tasks with electroencephalogram recording. We collected and analyzed behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data. Results High cognitive tasks exhibited significantly longer response times and lower accuracies than low-load tasks. The experimental pain group displayed a significantly lower accuracy than the control group. In addition, the experimental pain group showed no significance between high and low cognitive tasks in early ERP components (amplitude of N1, P2, N2, and early part of late positive potential), whereas the control group exhibited significance between different load tasks. Furthermore, we observed a delay peak energy for delta and theta oscillation in Fz 500-800 ms after the onset for pain persons and high cognitive load tasks. Conclusions Inadequate early attention modulation, along with delayed peak energy for brain oscillation (delta and theta), could be accountable for a worse performance in cognitive tasks in the experimental pain group. Thus, cognitive load is a highly considerable factor. Overall, this study offers more insights into how healthy population works with cognitive tasks under pain neurologically.

First, we introduce a new bispectral CFC measure which is selective to couplings between three or more brain sources. This measure can be derived from ordinary cross-bispectra by performing a total-antisymmetrization operation on them. Significant coupling values can then be attributed to at least three interacting signals. This selectivity to the number of sources can be helpful to test hypotheses on the number of brain sources involved in the generation of commonly observed brain oscillations, such as the alpha rhythm. In a second step we present the correct empirical distribution for the coupling measure, which is necessary to properly assess the significance of coupling results. More importantly however, this corrected statistic is not limited to our particular measure, but holds for all complex-valued coupling estimators. We illustrate how the very common misassumption of empirical normality of such estimators can lead to a systematic underestimation of p-values, the breakdown of multiple comparison control procedures and in consequence a drastic inflation of the number of false positives.

Early polysomnography studies have focused on characterizing differences in sleep architecture between patients with SCZ and healthy controls. More recently, research has focused on sleep-specific EEG oscillations, such as sleep spindles and slow waves, which reflect the integrity of underlying thalamo-cortical networks. Furthermore, high-density (hd)-EEG (>= 64 channels), which affords enhanced spatial resolution, has been employed to better localize abnormalities in sleep characteristics and related thalamocortical circuits in patients with SCZ and related disorders. In this article, we will review the most relevant sleep abnormalities reported in SCZ, with an emphasis on recent findings, and propose directions for future research.

Previous studies investigating either prediction or production highlighted M/EEG desynchronization (power decrease) in the alpha (8-10 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands preceding the target. However, it is unclear whether this electrophysiological modulation underlies common mechanisms. We recorded EEG from participants performing both a comprehension and a production task in two separate blocks. Participants listened to high and low constraint incomplete sentences and were asked either to name a picture to complete them (production) or to simply listen to the final word (comprehension). We found that in a silent gap before the final stimulus, predictable stimuli elicited alpha and beta desynchronization in both tasks, signaling the pre-activation of linguistic information. Source estimation highlighted the involvement of left-lateralized language areas and temporo-parietal areas in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, correlations between the desynchronizations in comprehension and production showed spatiotemporal commonalities in language-relevant areas of the left hemisphere. As proposed by prediction-by-production models, our results suggest that comprehenders engage the production system while predicting upcoming words. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The success of targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during sleep presumably depends on the presence of slow oscillations (i.e., EEG activity at a frequency of about 0.75Hz). As slow oscillating activity is at its maximum during adolescence, we hypothesized that TMR is even more beneficial at this developmental stage. In the present study, adolescents aged 11 to 13 learnt Dutch vocabulary in the evening and were tested on recall performance the next morning. Half of the words were presented via loudspeakers during post-learning periods of NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement) sleep in order to stimulate memory reactivation. Unexpectedly, TMR during sleep did not improve memory on the behavioral level in adolescents. On the oscillatory level, successful reactivation during sleep resulted in the characteristic increase in theta power over frontal brain regions, as reported in adults. However, we observed no increase in spindle power during successful reactivation. Possible factors that may explain the lacking effect of TMR in adolescents in this study such as differences in learning abilities and pre-sleep performance levels are discussed.

We evaluated alterations in PPG signals in relationship to the occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) in patients with epilepsy to evaluate the feasibility of seizure detection. Methods During electroencephalographic (EEG) long-term monitoring, patients wore portable wristband sensor(s) on their wrists or ankles recording PPG signals. We analyzed PPG signals during three time periods, which were defined with respect to seizures detected on EEG: (1) baseline (>30 minutes prior to seizure), (2) preseizure period, and (3) postseizure period. Furthermore, we selected five random control segments during seizure-free periods. PPG features, including frequency, amplitude, duration, slope, smoothness, and area under the curve, were automatically calculated. We used a linear mixed-effect model to evaluate changes in PPG features between different time periods in an attempt to identify signal changes that detect seizures. Results We prospectively enrolled 174 patients from the epilepsy monitoring unit at Boston Children's Hospital. Twenty-five GTCSs were recorded from 13 patients. Data from the first recorded GTCS of each patient were included in the analysis. We observed an increase in PPG frequency during pre- and postseizure periods that was higher than the changes during seizure-free periods (frequency increase: preseizure = 0.22 Hz, postseizure = 0.58 Hz vs changes during seizure-free period = 0.05 Hz). The PPG slope decreased significantly by 56.71 nW/s during preseizure periods compared to seizure-free periods. Additionally, the smoothness increased significantly by 0.22 nW/s during the postseizure period compared to seizure-free periods. Significance Monitoring of PPG signals may assist in the detection of GTCSs in patients with epilepsy. PPG may serve as a promising biomarker for future seizure detection systems and may contribute to future seizure prediction systems.

Flickering Red-Light Stimulus for Promoting Coherent 40 Hz Neural Oscillation: A Feasibility Study	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						40 Hz neural oscillation; Alzheimer's disease; electroencephalography; flickering red light; subjective sleepiness; working memory performance testing	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ENTRAINMENT; WAVELENGTH; SLEEPINESS; DISORDERS; DEMENTIA; MEMORY; MILD	Background: Coherent 40 Hz (gamma) neural oscillation indicates healthy brain activity and is known to be disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. 40 Hz entrainment by flickering light is known to significantly attenuate AD pathology in mice. Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of using a lighting intervention to promote coherent 40 Hz neural oscillation, improved working memory performance, and reduced subjective sleepiness among a population of healthy young adults. If successful, the intervention could be extended to address cognitive impairment associated with mild cognitive impairment and AD. Methods: Nine healthy participants (median age 22 years, five females) were exposed to one of two lighting conditions per session in a within-subjects counterbalanced manner. The study's two sessions were separated by 1 week. Custom-built light masks provided either a 40Hz flickering red light (FRL) intervention or a dark control condition (i.e., total darkness, light mask not energized) at participants' eyes. Data were collected four times per session: pre-exposure, after 25-min exposure, after 50-min exposure, and post-exposure. Each data collection period included a Karolinska Sleepiness Scale report, an electroencephalogram, and working memory (n-back) auditory performance testing. Results: The FRL intervention induced a significant increase in 40 Hz power and a modest increase in low gamma power. The intervention had no significant impact on working memory performance and subjective sleepiness compared to the control. However, increases in 40 Hz power were significantly correlated with reduced subjective sleepiness. Conclusion: The results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using a flickering light to increase 40 Hz power.

We examined the clinical outcome of RAGT and analyzed the correlations between gait analysis data and event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) in patients with chronic stroke. We applied the Berg balance scale (BBS) and analyzed gait parameters and the ERD and ERS of self-paced voluntary leg movements performed by patients with chronic stroke before and after undergoing RAGT. A significant change was observed in BBS (p = 0.011). We also showed preliminary outcomes of changes in gait cycle duration (p = 0.015) and in ipsilesional ERS in the low-beta (p = 0.033) and high-beta (p = 0.034) frequency bands before and after RAGT. In addition, correlations were observed between BBS and ipsilesional ERS in the alpha and low-beta bands (r = -0.52, p = 0.039; r = -0.52, p = 0.040). The study demonstrated that RAGT can improve balance and provided an idea of the possible role of brain oscillation and clinical outcomes in affecting stroke rehabilitation.

J	Tian, Y; Ma, L				Tian, Yin; Ma, Liang			Auditory attention tracking states in a cocktail party environment can be decoded by deep convolutional neural networks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						auditory attention tracking; electroencephalogram (EEG); convolutional neural network (CNN); brain-computer interface (BCI); deep learning (DL)	ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG; SPEECH; BETA; FEEDFORWARD; FEEDBACK; CORTEX; TIME	Objective.A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is a method for deep learning (DL). It has a powerful ability to automatically extract features and is widely used in classification tasks with scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the small number of samples and low signal-to-noise ratio involved in scalp EEG with low spatial resolution constitute a limitation that might restrict potential brain-computer interface (BCI) applications that are based on the CNN model. In the present study, a novel CNN model with source-spatial feature images (SSFIs) as the input is proposed to decode auditory attention tracking states in a cocktail party environment.Approach.We first extract SSFIs using rhythm entropy and weighted minimum norm estimation. Next, we develop a CNN model with three convolutional layers. Furthermore, we estimate the performance of the proposed model via generalized performance, alternative models that deleted or replaced a model's component, and loss curves. Finally, we use a deep transfer model with fine-tuning for a low (poor) behavioral performance group (L-group).Main results.Based on cortical activity reconstructions from the scalp EEGs, the classification accuracy (CA) of the proposed model is 80.4% (chance level: 52.5%), which is superior to that achieved by scalp EEG. Additionally, the performance of the proposed model is more stable when compared to alternative models that delete or replace specific model components. The proposed model identifies the difference between two auditory attention tracking states (successful versus unsuccessful) at an early stage with a short time window (250 ms after target offset). Furthermore, we propose a deep transfer learning model to improve the classification for the L-group. With this model, the CA of the L-group significantly increase by 5.3%.Significance.Our proposed model improves the performance of a decoder for auditory attention tracking, which could be suitable for relieving the difficulty with the attentional modulation of individual's neural responses. It provides a novel communication channel with auditory cognitive BCI for patients with attention and hearing impairment.

Layer 4 pyramidal neuron dendritic bursting underlies a post-stimulus visual cortical alpha rhythm	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; CORTEX; INHIBITION; FREQUENCY; NETWORKS; HZ; PERFORMANCE	Alpha rhythms (9-11Hz) are a dominant feature of EEG recordings, particularly over occipital cortex on cessation of a visual stimulation. Little is known about underlying neocortical mechanisms so here we constructed alpha rhythm models that follow cessation of cortical stimulation. The rhythm manifests following a period of gamma frequency activity in local V1 networks in layer 4. It associates with network level bias of excitatory synaptic activity in favour of NMDA- rather than AMPA-mediated signalling and reorganisation of synaptic inhibition in favour of fast GABA(A) receptor-mediated events. At the cellular level the alpha rhythm depended upon the generation of layer 4 pyramidal neuron dendritic bursting mediated primarily by PPDA-sensitive NR2C/D-containing NMDA receptors, which lack the magnesium-dependent open channel block. Subthreshold potassium conductances are also critical. The rhythm dynamically filters outputs from sensory relay neurons (stellate neurons in layer 4) such that they become temporally uncoupled from downstream population activity. The authors combine computational and electrophysiological approaches to study the neocortical mechanisms underlying alpha rhythms generated after visual stimuli cessation. They show that layer 4 pyramidal neuron bursting, as well as a shift towards NMDA- and GABA(A)- receptor transmission is critical for the generation of these alpha oscillations.

Deletion of Fmr1 from Forebrain Excitatory Neurons Triggers Abnormal Cellular, EEG, and Behavioral Phenotypes in the Auditory Cortex of a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						autism; cortical deficits; fragile X syndrome; perineuronal nets; sensory processing disorders	MENTAL-RETARDATION PROTEIN; MESSENGER-RNA TRANSLATION; FAST-SPIKING INTERNEURONS; MINOCYCLINE TREATMENT; MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SIGNALING PATHWAY; VISUAL RESPONSES; PERINEURONAL NET; MICE LACKING	Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism with symptoms that include sensory processing deficits. In both humans with FXS and a mouse model [Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse], electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings show enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced sound-evoked gamma synchrony. We previously showed that elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) may contribute to these phenotypes by affecting perineuronal nets (PNNs) around parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. However, how different cell types within local cortical circuits contribute to these deficits is not known. Here, we examined whether Fmr1 deletion in forebrain excitatory neurons affects neural oscillations, MMP-9 activity, and PV/PNN expression in the auditory cortex. We found that cortical MMP-9 gelatinase activity, mTOR/Akt phosphorylation, and resting EEG gamma power were enhanced in CreNex1/Fmr1Flox/y conditional KO (cKO) mice, whereas the density of PV/PNN cells was reduced. The CreNex1/Fmr1Flox/y cKO mice also show increased locomotor activity, but not the anxiety-like behaviors. These results indicate that fragile X mental retardation protein changes in excitatory neurons in the cortex are sufficient to elicit cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. More broadly, these results indicate that local cortical circuit abnormalities contribute to sensory processing deficits in autism spectrum disorders.

We aimed to investigate 3 outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post-CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post-CA patients. Methods We identified 3 patients with late recovery from coma (17-37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all 3 patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intraburst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post-CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, and EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients. Results All 3 patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (similar to 4-7Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intraburst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features, or decreasing intraburst frequencies with time. Interpretation BSP with theta (similar to 4-7Hz) peak intraburst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the corticothalamic system during recovery from prolonged post-CA coma.

J	Stock, AK; Pertermann, M; Muckschel, M; Beste, C				Stock, Ann-Kathrin; Pertermann, Maik; Mueckschel, Moritz; Beste, Christian			High-dose ethanol intoxication decreases 1/f neural noise or scale-free neural activity in the resting state	ADDICTION BIOLOGY			English	Article						alcohol; 1; f neural noise; resting state EEG	BINGE DRINKING; EEG DIFFERENCES; POWER SPECTRA; FIELD; ALCOHOL; OSCILLATIONS; GABA	Binge drinking is a frequent phenomenon in many western societies and has been associated with an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorder later in life. Yet, the effects of high-dose alcohol intoxication on neurophysiological processes are still quite poorly understood. This is particularly the case given that neurophysiological brain activity not only contains recurring (oscillatory) patterns of activity, but also a significant fraction of "scale-free" or arrhythmic dynamics referred to as 1/f type activity, pink noise, or 1/f neural noise. Neurobiological considerations suggest that it should be modulated by alcohol intoxication. To investigate this assumption, we collected resting state EEG data from n = 23 healthy young male subjects in a crossover design, where each subject was once tested sober and once tested while intoxicated (mean breath alcohol concentration of 1.1 permille +/- 0.2). Analyses of the 1/f neural dynamics showed that ethanol intoxication decreased resting state 1/f neural noise, as compared with a sober state. The effects were strongest when the eyes were closed and particularly reliable in the beta frequency band. Given that the dynamics of the beta band have been shown to strongly depend on GABA(A) receptor neural transmission, this finding nicely aligns with the fact that ethanol increases GABAergic signaling. The study reveals a currently unreported effect of binge drinking on neurophysiological dynamics, which likely revealed a higher sensitivity for ethanol effects than most commonly considered measures of power in neural oscillations. Implications and applicability of these findings are discussed.

Constitutive and Stress-Induced Psychomotor Cortical Responses to Compound K Supplementation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ginsenoside; cortical activity; EEG; event-related potentials; source localization; exercise; psychomotor performance; stress	BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; SAPONIN METABOLITES; PHYSICAL-EXERCISE; GINSENG; GINSENOSIDES; OSCILLATIONS; 20(S)-PROTOPANAXADIOL; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION	Isolated ginsenoside metabolites such as Compound K (CK) are of increasing interest to consumer and clinical populations as safe and non-pharmacological means to enhance psychomotor performance constitutively and in response to physical or cognitive stress. Nevertheless, the influence of CK on behavioral performance and EEG measures of cortical activity in humans is undetermined. In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced within-group study, dose-dependent responses to CK (placebo, 160 and 960 mg) were assessed after 2 weeks of supplementation in nineteen healthy men and women (age: 39.9 +/- 7.9 year, height 170.2 +/- 8.6 cm, weight 79.7 +/- 11.9 kg). Performance on upper- and lower-body choice reaction tests (CRTs) was tested before and after intense lower-body anaerobic exercise. Treatment- and stress-related changes in brain activity were measured with high-density EEG based on event-related potentials, oscillations, and source activity. Upper- (-12.3 +/- 3.5 ms, p = 0.002) and lower-body (-12.3 +/- 4.9 ms, p = 0.021) response times improved after exercise, with no difference between treatments (upper: p = 0.354; lower: p = 0.926). Analysis of cortical activity in sensor and source space revealed global increases in cortical arousal after exercise. CK increased activity in cortical regions responsible for sustained attention and mitigated exercise-induced increases in arousal. Responses to exercise varied depending on task, but CK appeared to reduce sensory interference from lower-body exercise during an upper-body CRT and improve the general maintenance of task-relevant sensory processes.

However, visual marking of HFOs is very tedious, extremely time consuming and remains a subjective process. In addition, some factors like low signal-to-noise ratio and presence of artifacts in electroencephalographic signals make scoring of HFOs a difficult task. Therefore, automatic HFOs detectors have been developed by different research groups with the goal of providing reliable detection results. However, no common dataset was used to evaluate the performance of these detectors. The aim of the present study is thus to provide a fair comparative study of three existing HFOs detectors. These detectors are respectively based on the root mean square, the short time line length and the Hilbert transform techniques. This fair comparative study is performed using a common dataset with the same expert visual marking. The behavior of the considered HFOs detectors is evaluated in terms of the sensitivity, the precision, the false discovery rate and the area under the ROC curve. Our results show that the Hilbert transform based method is the most efficient and reliable method for detecting HFOs compared to the other ones.

By evaluating heart rate variability (HRV) during sleep, we will better understand their influence on cardiac activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate HRV in the dark phase of the circadian rhythm during sleep in healthy children and adolescents. Methods: One 3 min segment of pre-sleep electrocardiography (EEG) and 3, 6 min segments of electrocardiography recorded during polysomnography from 75 healthy children and adolescents were sampled during progressive cycles of slow wave sleep (SWS1, SWS2, SWS3). Three, 3 min segments of rapid eye movement sleep (REM) were also assessed, with REM1 marked at the last REM period before awakening. Studies that recorded REM3 prior to SWS3 were used for assessment. HRV variables include the following time domain values: mean NN (average RR intervals over given time), SDNN (Standard Deviation of RR intervals), and RMSSD (root Mean Square of beat-to-beat Differences). Frequency domain values include: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and LF:HF. Results: Mixed linear effects model analysis revealed a significant difference in time and frequency domain values between sleep cycles and stages. Mean NN was lowest (highest heart rate) during pre-sleep then significantly increased across SWS1-3. Mean NN in SWS1 was similar to all REM periods which was significantly lower than both SWS2 and SWS3. SDNN remained at pre-sleep levels until SWS3, and then significantly increased in REM1&2. There was a large drop in LF from pre-sleep to SWS1. As cycles progressed through the night, LF remains lower than awake but increases to awake like levels by REM2. RMSSD and HF were lowest in pre-sleep and increased significantly by SWS1 and remain high and stable across stages and cycles except during the REM3 period where RMSSD decreased. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that there are considerable changes in the spectral analysis of cardiac function occurring during different sleep stages and between sleep cycles across the night. Hence, time of night and sleep stage need to be considered when reporting any HRV differences.

In this MEG study with 34 participants (17 women), we used a bimodal (visual/auditory) attention task to determine the neuronal dynamics associated with suppression of the activity of the VAN during top-down attention and its recruitment when information from the unattended sensory modality is involuntarily integrated. We observed an anticipatory power increase of alpha/beta oscillations (12-20 Hz, previously associated with functional inhibition) in the VAN following a cue indicating the modality to attend. Stronger VAN power increases were associated with better task performance, suggesting that the VAN suppression prevents shifting attention to distractors. Moreover, the TPJ was synchronized with the frontal eye field in that frequency band, indicating that the dorsal attention network (DAN) might participate in such suppression. Furthermore, we found a 12-20 Hz power decrease and enhanced synchronization, in both the VAN and DAN, when information between sensory modalities was congruent, suggesting an involvement of these networks when attention is involuntarily enhanced due to multisensory integration. Our results show that effective multimodal attentional allocation includes the modulation of the VAN and DAN through upper-alpha/beta oscillations. Altogether these results indicate that the suppressing role of alpha/beta oscillations might operate beyond sensory regions.

Several studies in both human and animal models have focused their attention on the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) spindles and slow waves during NREM, using the power in the sigma and delta bands as a surrogate for the production of spindles and slow waves. A typical report is an overall inverse relationship between the time course of sigma and delta power as measured by a single correlation coefficient both within and across NREM episodes. Here we analysed stereotactically implanted intracerebral electrode (Stereo-EEG [SEEG]) recordings during NREM simultaneously acquired from thalamic and from several neocortical sites in six neurosurgical patients. We investigated the relationship between the time course of delta and sigma power and found that, although at the cortical level it shows the expected inverse relationship, these two frequency bands follow a parallel time course at the thalamic level. Both these observations were consistent across patients and across different cortical as well as thalamic regions. These different temporal dynamics at the neocortical and thalamic level are discussed, considering classical as well as more recent interpretations of the neurophysiological determinants of sleep spindles and slow waves. These findings may also help understanding the regulatory mechanisms of these fundamental sleep EEG graphoelements across different brain compartments.

Here, we examined the occurrence rates of and the temporal relationships between these oscillatory events in rats, to identify the possible direction of interaction between these events under natural conditions. To facilitate comparisons with findings in humans, we combined frontal and parietal surface EEG with local field potential (LFP) recordings in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus (dHC). Consistent with a top-down driving influence, EEG SO upstates were associated with an increase in spindles and hippocampal ripples. This increase was missing in SO upstates identified in mPFC recordings. Ripples in dHC recordings always followed the onset of spindles consistent with spindles timing ripple occurrence. Comparing ripple activity during co-occurring SO-spindle events with that during isolated SOs or spindles, suggested that ripple dynamics during SO-spindle events are mainly determined by the spindle, with only the SO downstate providing a global inhibitory signal to both thalamus and hippocampus. As to bottom-up influences, we found an increase in hippocampal ripples similar to 200 ms before the SO downstate, but no similar increase of spindles preceding SO downstates. Overall, the temporal pattern is consistent with a loop-like scenario where, top-down, SOs can trigger thalamic spindles which, in turn, regulate the occurrence of hippocampal ripples. Ripples, bottom-up, and independent from thalamic spindles, can contribute to the emergence of neocortical SOs.

Assessing the impact of vibrotactile kinaesthetic feedback on electroencephalographic signals in a center-out task	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						vibrotactile feedback; kinaesthetic feedback; motor task; EEG; MRCP	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOVEMENT; NEUROPROSTHESES; SYSTEM; SKIN	Objective.An important part of restoring motor control via a brain-computer interface is to close the sensorimotor feedback loop. As part of our investigations into vibrotactile kinaesthetic feedback of arm movements, we studied electroencephalographic signals in the delta,mu and beta bands obtained during a center-out movement task with four conditions: movement with real-time kinaesthetic feedback, movement with static vibrations, movement without vibrotactile input, and no movement with sham feedback.Approach.Participants performed center-out movements with their palm on a flat table surface. One of three movement directions was cued visually before the movement. The palm position was tracked in order to provide real-time vibrotactile feedback. All analyses were performed offline.Main results.Movement-related cortical potentials exhibit minor discrepancies between movement conditions as well as between movement directions, in peak amplitude and shape. Classification of each movement condition and each direction against rest yields peak accuracies of 60%-65% using low-frequency amplitude features, and 90% using mu and beta power features. Within-class accuracies of four-way classification between conditions based on low-frequency amplitude features are around chance level for the movement conditions with vibrotactile stimulation, slightly above chance level for the movement condition without stimulation, and considerably higher for the non-movement condition. Four-way classification between conditions based on mu and beta power features yields within-class accuracies slightly above chance level for all movement conditions, and considerably higher for the non-movement condition. Within-class accuracies of three-way classification between directions are slightly above chance level for low-frequency amplitude features, and at chance level for power features.Significance.We found that the vibrotactile stimulation does not interfere with movement-related features in the delta,mu and beta frequency ranges. Our feedback system may therefore feasibly be deployed in conjunction with a BCI based on movement-related cortical potentials or sensorimotor rhythms, without adversely affecting control.

A myriad collection of software and hardware frameworks has been developed to alleviate some of the technical barriers involved in EEG-driven research. Methods: we propose an integrated development environment which encompasses the entire technical "data-collection pipeline" of cognitive-neuropsychological research, including experiment design, data acquisition, data exploration and analysis in a state-of-the-art user interface. Our framework is based on a unique integration between a python-based web framework, time-oriented databases and object-based data schemes. Results: we demonstrated our framework with the recording and analysis of an n-Back task completed by 15 elderly (ages 50 to 80) participants. This case study demonstrates the highly utilized nature of our integrated framework with a challenging target population. Furthermore, our results may provide new insights into the correlation between brain activity and working memory performance in elderly people, who are prone to experience accelerated decline in executive prefrontal cortex functioning. Conclusion: our framework extends the range of EEG-driven experimental methods for assessing cognition available for cognitive-neuroscientists, allowing them to concentrate on the creative part of their work instead of technical aspects.

Prestimulus alpha and beta contributions to equiprobable Go/NoGo processing in healthy ageing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP dynamics; Alpha; Beta; Healthy ageing; Principal Components Analysis (PCA); Auditory Go/NoGo	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG-DYNAMICS; ERP; TASK; NEUROSCIENCE; INHIBITION; COMPONENTS; COGNITION; MIND	The immediately-prestimulus electroencephalographic (EEG) brain state influences subsequent event-related processing, dynamically impacting event-related potential (ERP) and behavioural outcomes. Both EEG and ERPs are known to undergo age-related change, yet few have investigated the consistency in their dynamic interrelations in the context of ageing. The present investigation assessed the impact of prestimulus alpha and beta brain states in 20 young (18-26 years) and 20 gender-matched healthy older (59-75 years) adults who completed an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo paradigm. Prestimulus alpha and beta band amplitudes in their prominent band topographies were separately used to derive Go and NoGo ERPs at 10 ascending levels of prestimulus activity, and ERP components were derived for these levels using Principal Components Analysis. Prestimulus alpha directly modulated Go/NoGo P3a amplitudes across the groups, while beta inversely modulated the young (cf. older) adult NoGo N1-1, each supporting and extending limited prior research. Several novel effects were also uncovered, most notably an inverse relationship between prestimulus alpha and reaction time. Prestimulus alpha and beta were confirmed as significant determinants of the processing outcomes in this task, and the complex pattern of results provides a normative map in healthy ageing.

Atypical Electrophysiological Indices of Eyes-Open and Eyes-Closed Resting-State in Children and Adolescents with ADHD and Autism	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						ADHD; autism; resting-state; EEG; alpha; alpha reactivity	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EEG; HYPERACTIVITY; ALPHA; ASD; OSCILLATIONS; AROUSAL; SCIENCE; MODEL	Investigating electrophysiological measures during resting-state might be useful to investigate brain functioning and responsivity in individuals under diagnostic assessment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. EEG was recorded in 43 children with or without ADHD and autism, during a 4-min-long resting-state session which included an eyes-closed and an eyes-open condition. We calculated and analyzed occipital absolute and relative spectral power in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz), and alpha reactivity, conceptualized as the difference in alpha power between eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. Alpha power was increased during eyes-closed compared to eyes-open resting-state. While absolute alpha power was reduced in children with autism, relative alpha power was reduced in children with ADHD, especially during the eyes-closed condition. Reduced relative alpha reactivity was mainly associated with lower IQ and not with ADHD or autism. Atypical brain functioning during resting-state seems differently associated with ADHD and autism, however further studies replicating these results are needed; we therefore suggest involving research groups worldwide by creating a shared and publicly available repository of resting-state EEG data collected in people with different psychological, psychiatric, or neurodevelopmental conditions, including ADHD and autism.

Such behavioral low-frequency variations are connected with dynamics of attention-related cortical neuronal networks. At the same time neurophysiological reason of a such behavior remains unclear. In this talk we analyze the neuronal interactions in alpha and beta bands by means of 31-channels EEG processing. As a visual attention task we use a binary classification of a large number of presented images - ambiguous Necker cubes. Analyzing of response time of subjects indicates that processing of similar tasks takes both long and short reaction time. Provided analysis based on complex network theory reveals strong correlation between response time and duration of formation of a functional frontoparietal functional network associated with perceptual decision-making process. Having considered a functional topology during a prestimulus period, we find that lower reaction times are subserved by a strong prestimulus functional connectivity over a somatosensory and sensorimotor areas of cortex. Finally, we show that high reaction times are dominant during the beginning of experiment and suppose that this time is required for a prestimulus template formation. Since similar visual tasks are presented several times during the experiment, brain uses their templates to perform them faster and effectively.
